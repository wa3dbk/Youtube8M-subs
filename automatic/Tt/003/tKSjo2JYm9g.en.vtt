 hello guys welcome to this new 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.629
 video and today I bring you a tutorial very 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.639
 interesting for all those who have 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.129
 an iphone an ipod touch or any 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.980
 ios device and want to play with 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.270
 emuladores de jávea from nintendo ds la 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.750
 truth is that there are several then what 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.630
 we will see but the grace is that you can 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.660
 play with all these emulators without 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.150
 jailbreak is to say gba games 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.970
 of nintendo ds etcetera without gear break 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.399
 it's worth it so nothing guys made this 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.489
 small introduction let's go for it 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:41.050
 the first thing is to go to adjustments then we are going to 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.420
 general we go down and we go to date and time and 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 we deactivate the automatic adjustment 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.940
 you will ask for what then the truth 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.090
 is that it is to let us install 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.850
 these emulators are worth we should go to 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.649
 set date and time and change the year 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.449
 ok we give up to the part of 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.070
 up where he puts the day of all that at 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.409
 month and we put 2011 vale 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.330
 it does not matter the day does not matter this only 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.330
 we change the year and we put 2011 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.610
 so once this is done we go out and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.800
 we must go to the safari once in safari 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.940
 we should go to the next website 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.550
 it's cool rom dotcom once it loads 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 we will see that we get three sections 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.710
 emulators tutorials and rooms is worth 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.130
 the roms are the games for those who do not 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.130
 know it and then we should go to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.960
 emulators and I'm going to search android for 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.600
 it is with jailbreak and for it wells 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.210
 no jailbreak and last windows phones 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.539
 ok so we'll give it to halloween 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.250
 singer big valley never the edge and like 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.050
 you see guys we get a broad 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.899
 repertoire of emulators for our 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.600
 iphone or device ios sinter break 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.720

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.320

 and finally super nintendo worth we can 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.370

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.930
 any of these games voucher 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.020

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.810
 all all and they work very well and 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.480
 on without being break 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.970
 I repeat so nothing guys I will do the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.730
 try the emulator for here in boy 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.800
 advance I hope you can install 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.660
 the one you like the most, you can install the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.460
 of nintendo ds that good of a console 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.800
 newer than that of the game boy 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.800
 advance or your game the super nes 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.110
 nintendo which you want is worth me in this 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.200
 case I will select as I said 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.180
 before gba is worth cambodia so much 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.700
 process is the same voucher install the 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.470
 emulator that you install so if instead 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.230
 to install the one of jávea installs from 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.810
 the one of nintendo ds you will see what process is 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.130
 same and let's see that this tutorial serves you 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.560
 equally because the process is 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.240
 exactly the same so once you 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.360
 let's give the emulator that we want 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.950
 We give you to install voucher and it will start 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.540
 to install as if it were an application 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.210
 downloaded from the normal app store and 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.060
 current 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.130
 Once downloaded, this will appear 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.160
 icon is valid and we will have our 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.320
 emulator is worth gba for the west so 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.550
 we give him and you will see that we do not have any 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.470
 game is still worth so to download 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.240
 our roms our games 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.820
 we will have to give the magnifying glass from above to the 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.920
 right is worth in some emulators for 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.750
 example from nintendo ds instead of a 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.840
 magnifying glass there is a better one but it is exactly 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.510
 the same once we give it we give to 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.110
 open safari ok depends on the emulator is 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.590
 the same and we'll give the first one 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.990
 first result that goes out is worth in google 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.690
 and good here we have our our web 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.210
 to download the roms the games and 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.830
 We can download the or search the most 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.990
 well by letter also by category and 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.560
 well here are the 25 most downloaded and 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.690
 the top 25 is worth it so I 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.570
 I'm going to download the first one more 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.420
 downloaded that is pokemon emerald like this 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.500
 that I simply give I go to the file 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.620
 of the game 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.570
 and if we go down we will see the download link 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.120
 so we just give ground 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.120
 out and it will start to download the game 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.270
 once downloaded the game your rom 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.580
 whatever it is you will leave this 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.370
 maybe up on the right we get to 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.630
 Open in GM Out West or Nintendo DS 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.700
 out of weiss is worth depends on your 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.370
 emulator you should leave one thing or another 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.460
 ok but if up on the right does not come out 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.190
 open in your emulator of you should 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.230
 give up to the left to open in and 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.180
 open in your emulator is worth in my 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.610
 case from the one of jávea therefore from 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.390
 the one from gm to fort lewis is worth so 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.540
 I just give it to him and he goes to the 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.670
 application of gba, and as you can see 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.500
 come out the game is that easy you do not have 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.780
 to do anything simply copy is sewn 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.090
 the game only and simply with that 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.340
 let's give it a point that we would start 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.370
 play this game that I downloaded the 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.130
 Emerald pokemon is worth so guys 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.310
 this is exactly the same for all 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.169
 emulators be the gba in this case be 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.210
 of nintendo ds be the one of snes 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.520
 the emulator that is the process is the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.800
 same is true so now only 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.659
 I would be playing and it would be 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.289
 all done there is no complication 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:32.199
 As you can see, it's very easy and without 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.639
 be break ballet before this only what 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.469
 could people enjoy with jailbreak 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.870
 and now we have it all so 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.879
 take advantage of the ballet in the boy that is 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.009

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.110
