from the beginning all right this piece
I<00:00:33.930> already<00:00:34.260> built<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:36.059> goes<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.329> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I already built this is what goes on to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.860 
I already built this is what goes on to
the<00:00:37.230> water<00:00:37.829> returned<00:00:38.520> from<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.300> pump<00:00:39.570> to

the water returned from your pump to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200 
the water returned from your pump to
your<00:00:40.050> pool<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:41.100> should<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.700> screw<00:00:42.030> in

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
your pool that should just screw in

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
your pool that should just screw in
there<00:00:42.450> that's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.350> half<00:00:43.379> inch

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
there that's a one and a half inch

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.360 
there that's a one and a half inch
threaded<00:00:44.309> piece<00:00:44.780> which<00:00:45.780> looks<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.379> this

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
threaded piece which looks like this

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.660 
threaded piece which looks like this
it's<00:00:48.360> smooth<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.829> side<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.520> it's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
it's smooth on one side and it's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.209 
it's smooth on one side and it's
threaded<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> other<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.739> one<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.190> a

half<00:00:53.399> inches<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.390> diameter<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.980> that's<00:00:56.190> what

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
half inches in diameter so that's what

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.319 
half inches in diameter so that's what
this<00:00:57.420> piece<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.850> it's<00:00:59.850> going

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
this piece is right here and it's going

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.359 
this piece is right here and it's going
into<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:01.489> splitter<00:01:02.960> which<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.339> half

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
into a splitter which is one and a half

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.800 
into a splitter which is one and a half
inches<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.360> every<00:01:06.990> opening<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.450> take<00:01:09.780> your

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
inches at every opening so you take your

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
inches at every opening so you take your
smooth<00:01:10.470> edge<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.810> fits<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.340> like<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
smooth edge and that fits in like that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.950 
smooth edge and that fits in like that
but<00:01:15.020> before<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.200> put<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.530> smooth<00:01:16.860> edge<00:01:17.250> in

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
but before you put your smooth edge in

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.530 
but before you put your smooth edge in
this<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> another<00:01:19.439> piece<00:01:20.030> take<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> piece<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
this is another piece take a piece of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.820 
this is another piece take a piece of
sandpaper<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.350> clean<00:01:23.540> all<00:01:24.540> around<00:01:24.830> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
sandpaper and clean all around the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.569 
sandpaper and clean all around the
smooth<00:01:26.220> edge<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.720> that'll<00:01:28.049> give<00:01:28.280> some<00:01:29.280> place

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
smooth edge so that'll give some place

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:38.890 
smooth edge so that'll give some place
for<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.689> glue<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:34.100> go<00:01:35.100> into<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:36.110> use<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.470> BS

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
for the glue to go into I use a BS

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
for the glue to go into I use a BS
yellow<00:01:39.900> premium<00:01:40.439> grade<00:01:40.770> glue<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.759> makes<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
yellow premium grade glue just makes it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.280 
yellow premium grade glue just makes it
nice<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.360> watertight<00:01:44.450> okay<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.509> still<00:01:46.110> we're

these<00:02:28.349> two<00:02:29.000> are<00:02:30.000> open<00:02:30.359> all<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.049> way<00:02:31.139> through

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
these two are open all the way through

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.339 
these two are open all the way through
because<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.859> have<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> third<00:02:32.459> piece<00:02:33.319> which<00:02:34.319> is

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
because you have a third piece which is

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.909 
because you have a third piece which is
once<00:02:35.010> again<00:02:35.189> inch<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:35.909> half<00:02:36.139> smooth<00:02:37.139> one

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:37.919 
once again inch and a half smooth one

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.959 
once again inch and a half smooth one
side<00:02:38.219> but<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.629> have<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:40.109> half<00:02:40.379> inch<00:02:40.969> threaded

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
side but you have a half inch threaded

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.039 
side but you have a half inch threaded
hole<00:02:42.329> in<00:02:42.689> the<00:02:42.989> middle<00:02:43.139> that<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:44.810> what<00:02:45.810> goes

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
hole in the middle that is what goes

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.270 
hole in the middle that is what goes
here<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:48.299> off<00:02:48.540> split<00:02:49.139> piece<00:02:49.409> and<00:02:50.159> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
here on the off split piece and the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.559 
here on the off split piece and the
reason<00:02:50.699> you<00:02:50.790> want<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.000> make<00:02:51.090> sure<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.359> have

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
reason you want to make sure you have

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.179 
reason you want to make sure you have
the<00:02:51.750> direction<00:02:52.079> aiming<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.769> right<00:02:52.949> way

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
the direction aiming the right way

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.819 
the direction aiming the right way
because<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.959> coming<00:02:55.260> from<00:02:55.290> your<00:02:55.560> pump

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
because this is coming from your pump

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.890 
because this is coming from your pump
this<00:02:56.010> direction<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.540> return

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
this direction and this is the return

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.709 
this direction and this is the return
from<00:02:58.560> your<00:02:58.799> pool<00:02:59.340> heater<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.090> want<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.510> going

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
from your pool heater you want it going

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.080 
from your pool heater you want it going
this<00:03:01.019> way<00:03:01.199> because<00:03:01.409> of<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:02.430> little<00:03:02.609> opening

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
this way because of the little opening

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.000 
this way because of the little opening
here<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:04.109> get<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> little<00:03:04.590> bit<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.769> suction

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
here you get a little bit of suction

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.709 
here you get a little bit of suction
happening<00:03:05.760> right<00:03:05.969> in<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.419> that's<00:03:06.599> going

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
happening right in here and that's going

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.229 
happening right in here and that's going
to<00:03:06.780> help<00:03:06.959> draw<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.379> heated<00:03:07.859> water<00:03:08.069> back<00:03:08.879> into

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
to help draw the heated water back into

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.229 
to help draw the heated water back into
the<00:03:09.599> pool<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:11.010> very<00:03:11.280> important<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.849> have<00:03:12.030> your

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
the pool so very important you have your

the pool so very important you have your
direction<00:03:12.599> going<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.139> right<00:03:13.290> way

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
direction going the right way

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.610 
direction going the right way

and in the threads here and then you'll

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.550 
and in the threads here and then you'll
just<00:03:44.879> screw<00:03:45.329> it<00:03:45.449> together<00:03:45.720> until<00:03:46.139> it<00:03:46.409> goes

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
just screw it together until it goes

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.159 
just screw it together until it goes

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
anything like that because odds are

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.819 
anything like that because odds are
you'll<00:03:50.609> end<00:03:50.790> up<00:03:50.879> breaking<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.419> because<00:03:52.199> I<00:03:52.590> did

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
you'll end up breaking it because I did

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.610 
you'll end up breaking it because I did
on<00:03:53.009> the<00:03:53.129> first<00:03:53.280> one<00:03:53.750> so<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:55.019> is<00:03:55.199> how<00:03:55.319> you<00:03:55.349> make

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
on the first one so that is how you make

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.360 
on the first one so that is how you make
your<00:03:56.189> return<00:03:56.810> going<00:03:57.810> back<00:03:58.109> from<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:59.129> heater

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
edges do not glue these two edges here

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.689 
edges do not glue these two edges here
and<00:04:11.489> here<00:04:11.789> use<00:04:12.000> teflon<00:04:12.479> tape<00:04:12.659> and<00:04:13.340> that's<00:04:14.340> your

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
and here use teflon tape and that's your

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.090 
and here use teflon tape and that's your
return<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.329> pool

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
return to the pool

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.800 
return to the pool
so<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:17.690> make<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.200> part<00:04:18.590> that<00:04:18.770> comes<00:04:19.720> pumps<00:04:20.720> the

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
so to make the part that comes pumps the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.940 
so to make the part that comes pumps the
water<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:22.150> your<00:04:23.150> solar<00:04:23.450> heater<00:04:23.810> pretty<00:04:24.740> much

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
water to your solar heater pretty much

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.000 
water to your solar heater pretty much
the<00:04:25.640> exact<00:04:26.180> same<00:04:26.420> thing<00:04:26.720> is<00:04:26.870> this<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.740> only

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
the exact same thing is this the only

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.430 
the exact same thing is this the only
difference<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:29.030> have<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.330> half<00:04:29.750> inch<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.260> half

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
difference you have a half inch the half

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.480 
difference you have a half inch the half
inch<00:04:30.770> threaded<00:04:31.670> coupler<00:04:32.150> that<00:04:32.890> you<00:04:33.890> screw

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
inch threaded coupler that you screw

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
inch threaded coupler that you screw
into<00:04:34.700> here<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:36.070> use<00:04:37.070> once<00:04:37.430> again<00:04:37.700> use<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.300> glue

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
into here I use once again use the glue

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.100 
into here I use once again use the glue
and<00:04:39.520> then<00:04:40.520> you<00:04:40.640> have<00:04:40.850> this<00:04:41.090> it's<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.810> mini

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
and then you have this it's a mini

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.490 
and then you have this it's a mini
version<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:43.040> big<00:04:43.280> blue<00:04:43.550> here<00:04:44.000> so<00:04:44.900> again<00:04:45.110> it's<00:04:45.320> a

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
version of big blue here so again it's a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.640 
version of big blue here so again it's a
valve<00:04:46.280> that<00:04:46.640> opens<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.720> closes<00:04:48.020> your<00:04:48.410> water

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
valve that opens and closes your water

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.530 
valve that opens and closes your water
supply<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:49.460> this<00:04:49.640> is<00:04:49.820> for<00:04:50.060> those<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.270> you<00:04:50.480> if

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
supply so this is for those of you if

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.330 
supply so this is for those of you if
you<00:04:50.630> want<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:50.840> run<00:04:50.990> your<00:04:51.200> filter<00:04:51.620> at<00:04:51.830> night<00:04:52.130> to

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
you want to run your filter at night to

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.730 
you want to run your filter at night to
clean<00:04:52.580> your<00:04:52.730> pool<00:04:52.940> you<00:04:53.750> can<00:04:53.960> shut<00:04:54.290> off<00:04:54.320> your

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
clean your pool you can shut off your

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.190 
clean your pool you can shut off your
solar<00:04:55.100> heater<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.750> way<00:04:56.960> you're<00:04:57.140> not

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
solar heater so that way you're not

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.330 
solar heater so that way you're not
going<00:04:57.380> to<00:04:57.440> end<00:04:57.560> up<00:04:57.590> running<00:04:57.950> cold<00:04:58.220> water

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
going to end up running cold water

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.940 
going to end up running cold water
through<00:04:58.850> your<00:04:59.000> system<00:04:59.390> and<00:04:59.600> that<00:05:00.350> once<00:05:00.830> again

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
through your system and that once again

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.220 
through your system and that once again
a<00:05:01.130> little<00:05:01.340> bit<00:05:01.460> of<00:05:01.640> glue<00:05:01.880> no<00:05:02.600> need<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.960> sand

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
a little bit of glue no need to sand

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.160 
a little bit of glue no need to sand
threaded<00:05:03.800> parts<00:05:04.100> obviously<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.930> you'll<00:05:05.930> have

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
threaded parts obviously and you'll have

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.420 
threaded parts obviously and you'll have
that<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:08.180> then<00:05:08.420> these<00:05:08.840> two<00:05:09.140> pieces<00:05:09.380> will<00:05:10.220> end

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
that so then these two pieces will end

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.290 
that so then these two pieces will end
up<00:05:11.200> coming<00:05:12.200> together<00:05:12.590> this<00:05:13.400> is<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.790> other<00:05:13.970> end

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
up coming together this is the other end

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.510 
up coming together this is the other end
of<00:05:14.540> big<00:05:14.750> blue<00:05:14.990> that's<00:05:15.350> going<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.680> come<00:05:16.010> as<00:05:16.250> one

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
of big blue that's going to come as one

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.340 
of big blue that's going to come as one
piece<00:05:16.850> and<00:05:17.890> then<00:05:18.890> that<00:05:19.240> teflon<00:05:20.240> tape<00:05:20.480> you'll

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
piece and then that teflon tape you'll

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.100 
piece and then that teflon tape you'll
screw<00:05:21.740> these<00:05:22.010> pieces<00:05:22.370> together<00:05:22.760> and<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:24.080> end

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
screw these pieces together and you end

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.000 
screw these pieces together and you end
up<00:05:24.470> with<00:05:24.710> this<00:05:25.300> giant<00:05:26.380> looking<00:05:27.380> crazy<00:05:28.280> thing

you want it going like this there we go

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.740 
you want it going like this there we go
this<00:05:44.650> is<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:45.160> ideal<00:05:45.520> setup<00:05:46.090> that<00:05:46.360> you<00:05:46.480> wanted

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
this is the ideal setup that you wanted

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.450 
this is the ideal setup that you wanted
looking<00:05:47.140> at<00:05:47.290> because<00:05:47.530> your<00:05:47.800> water<00:05:48.040> is<00:05:48.190> coming

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
looking at because your water is coming

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.350 
looking at because your water is coming
from<00:05:48.640> your<00:05:48.850> pool<00:05:49.120> pump<00:05:49.530> into<00:05:50.530> here<00:05:51.150> comes<00:05:52.150> out

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
from your pool pump into here comes out

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.810 
from your pool pump into here comes out
here<00:05:52.950> there's<00:05:53.950> your<00:05:55.080> threaded<00:05:56.080> to<00:05:56.560> your<00:05:57.100> half

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
here there's your threaded to your half

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.280 
here there's your threaded to your half
inch<00:05:58.200> hose<00:05:59.200> that<00:05:59.500> goes<00:05:59.560> up<00:05:59.860> onto<00:06:00.160> your<00:06:00.340> roof<00:06:01.290> so

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
inch hose that goes up onto your roof so

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.540 
inch hose that goes up onto your roof so
you<00:06:02.350> have<00:06:02.500> your<00:06:02.620> water<00:06:02.860> coming<00:06:03.250> from<00:06:03.280> your

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
you have your water coming from your

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.720 
you have your water coming from your
pool<00:06:03.760> pump<00:06:04.110> into<00:06:05.110> your<00:06:05.140> one<00:06:06.040> and<00:06:06.070> a<00:06:06.220> half<00:06:06.430> inch

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
pool pump into your one and a half inch

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.980 
pool pump into your one and a half inch
and<00:06:07.060> it<00:06:08.020> splits<00:06:08.470> and<00:06:08.740> goes<00:06:08.860> to<00:06:09.100> the<00:06:09.130> pool<00:06:09.430> and

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
and it splits and goes to the pool and

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.450 
and it splits and goes to the pool and
this<00:06:10.990> is<00:06:11.170> concentrate<00:06:11.770> here<00:06:11.920> so<00:06:12.100> the<00:06:12.190> pressure

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
this is concentrate here so the pressure

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.100 
this is concentrate here so the pressure
is<00:06:12.820> really<00:06:13.330> forcing<00:06:13.630> it<00:06:13.870> through<00:06:13.900> the

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
is really forcing it through the

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.630 
is really forcing it through the
half-inch<00:06:14.500> pipe<00:06:14.710> all<00:06:14.950> the<00:06:15.100> way<00:06:15.190> up<00:06:15.370> to<00:06:15.520> your

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
half-inch pipe all the way up to your

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.690 
half-inch pipe all the way up to your
coil<00:06:15.970> comes<00:06:16.840> back<00:06:17.080> down<00:06:17.410> we<00:06:17.860> will<00:06:18.310> go<00:06:18.490> into

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
coil comes back down we will go into

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.090 
coil comes back down we will go into
this<00:06:19.000> one<00:06:19.330> suction<00:06:20.230> goes<00:06:20.620> to<00:06:20.770> the<00:06:20.860> pool<00:06:21.070> now

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
this one suction goes to the pool now

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.450 
this one suction goes to the pool now
you<00:06:21.340> can<00:06:21.700> adjust<00:06:22.080> this<00:06:23.080> pool<00:06:23.440> valve<00:06:23.800> here<00:06:24.220> and

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
you can adjust this pool valve here and

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.670 
you can adjust this pool valve here and
it<00:06:24.760> will<00:06:24.850> increase<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.600> pressure<00:06:25.900> going

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
it will increase the pressure going

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.430 
it will increase the pressure going
through<00:06:26.830> your<00:06:27.370> solar<00:06:27.760> pool<00:06:28.120> heater<00:06:28.450> if<00:06:28.750> you

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
through your solar pool heater if you

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.990 
through your solar pool heater if you
turn<00:06:29.620> it<00:06:29.740> all<00:06:29.950> the<00:06:29.980> way<00:06:30.100> off<00:06:30.310> well<00:06:30.640> then<00:06:30.850> you're

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
turn it all the way off well then you're

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.610 
turn it all the way off well then you're
going<00:06:31.090> to<00:06:31.180> get<00:06:31.360> a<00:06:31.390> hundred<00:06:31.810> percent<00:06:32.080> of<00:06:32.440> the

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
going to get a hundred percent of the

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.950 
going to get a hundred percent of the
force<00:06:32.920> of<00:06:33.100> the<00:06:33.220> pump<00:06:33.610> pushing<00:06:34.540> it<00:06:34.630> out<00:06:34.720> that's

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
force of the pump pushing it out that's

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.080 
force of the pump pushing it out that's
good<00:06:35.140> to<00:06:35.350> prime<00:06:35.650> it<00:06:35.680> if<00:06:36.070> you're<00:06:36.370> just<00:06:36.850> starting

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
good to prime it if you're just starting

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.380 
good to prime it if you're just starting
for<00:06:37.390> the<00:06:37.450> first<00:06:37.540> time<00:06:38.020> I<00:06:39.000> usually<00:06:40.000> leave<00:06:40.180> it

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
for the first time I usually leave it

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.170 
for the first time I usually leave it
about<00:06:40.600> halfway<00:06:41.340> during<00:06:42.340> the<00:06:42.490> day<00:06:42.670> so<00:06:42.730> that<00:06:43.060> way

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
about halfway during the day so that way

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.910
