00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
refitted this dumpy Ernie obviously

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.919 
refitted this dumpy Ernie obviously
without<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.170> spring<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.659> was<00:01:58.840> able

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
without the spring and what I was able

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.410 
without the spring and what I was able
to<00:01:59.109> do<00:01:59.350> then<00:01:59.560> is<00:02:00.100> rise<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.729> rear<00:02:00.939> of<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.179> body

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
to do then is rise the rear of the body

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.510 
to do then is rise the rear of the body
cook<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.409> gets<00:02:02.590> about<00:02:02.829> a<00:02:02.890> quarter<00:02:03.399> of<00:02:03.429> an

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
cook so it gets about a quarter of an

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.719 
cook so it gets about a quarter of an
inch<00:02:03.640> from<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.969> back<00:02:04.179> of<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.479> seat<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.399> then

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
inch from the back of the seat and then

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.570 
inch from the back of the seat and then
knows<00:02:06.999> how<00:02:07.179> to<00:02:07.240> mark<00:02:07.689> this<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.740> a<00:02:08.860> damper<00:02:09.550> on

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
knows how to mark this is a damper on

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.220 
knows how to mark this is a damper on
Dahlia<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:11.490> then<00:02:12.490> I<00:02:12.730> could<00:02:13.000> work<00:02:13.180> out<00:02:13.570> what

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
Dahlia and then I could work out what

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.220 
Dahlia and then I could work out what
size<00:02:14.500> travel<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:15.130> each<00:02:15.250> eye<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:15.610> 82<00:02:15.910> v<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:17.200> I

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
size travel on each eye on 82 v so I

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.170 
size travel on each eye on 82 v so I
mean<00:02:17.530> I've<00:02:17.620> done<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:18.040> now<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.730> that's<00:02:18.940> all

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.920 
and then fitted the original stole tank
cap<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.830> suit<00:02:35.690> now<00:02:37.190> looking<00:02:38.190> at<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> bars

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
cap to suit now looking at the bars

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.080 
cap to suit now looking at the bars
they're<00:02:39.930> much<00:02:40.170> wider<00:02:40.530> than<00:02:40.770> standard<00:02:41.520> now

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
they're much wider than standard now

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.270 
they're much wider than standard now
these<00:02:42.540> bars<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:43.140> from<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.380> jar<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.650> five<00:02:43.950> nine

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
these bars are from a jar of five nine

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.150 
these bars are from a jar of five nine
sir<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:45.750> I've<00:02:45.840> actually<00:02:45.959> widened<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.890> bowed

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
sir but I've actually widened and bowed

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.680 
sir but I've actually widened and bowed
to<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.120> think<00:02:48.450> she's<00:02:48.690> either<00:02:48.840> solid<00:02:50.690> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
to it I think she's either solid and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.580 
to it I think she's either solid and
because<00:02:52.110> I've<00:02:52.260> done<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:53.959> better<00:02:54.959> move<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
because I've done that I better move the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.940 
because I've done that I better move the
lever<00:02:56.580> brackets<00:02:57.209> because<00:02:57.450> they<00:02:58.319> are<00:02:58.530> actually

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
lever brackets because they are actually

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.280 
lever brackets because they are actually
welded<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.550> as<00:02:59.730> standard<00:03:00.300> it's<00:03:00.840> all<00:03:00.959> about<00:03:01.110> to

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
welded on as standard it's all about to

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.620 
welded on as standard it's all about to
move<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.709> back<00:03:01.950> reposition<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:02.970> weld<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
move and back reposition and weld and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.800 
move and back reposition and weld and
back<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:04.080> both<00:03:04.319> sides<00:03:05.269> not<00:03:06.269> doing<00:03:06.600> that

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
back on both sides not doing that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.190 
back on both sides not doing that
they're<00:03:07.080> not<00:03:07.110> quite<00:03:08.069> like<00:03:08.310> them<00:03:09.140> now<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
they're not quite like them now the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.199 
they're not quite like them now the
original<00:03:10.470> bars<00:03:11.069> they<00:03:11.640> used<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:11.970> have<00:03:12.090> an

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
original bars they used to have an

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.430 
original bars they used to have an
internal<00:03:12.630> throttle<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:14.670> offer<00:03:15.290> changed<00:03:16.290> it

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
internal throttle but offer changed it

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.729 
internal throttle but offer changed it
to<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> standard<00:03:17.310> type<00:03:17.549> to<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.819> strip<00:03:18.739> so

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
to the standard type to a strip so

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.720 
to the standard type to a strip so
obviously<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.450> bars<00:03:21.660> there<00:03:22.049> was<00:03:22.170> a

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
obviously in the bars there was a

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.259 
obviously in the bars there was a
cutaway<00:03:23.730> there<00:03:24.590> where<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.739> internal<00:03:26.269> twist

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
cutaway there where the internal twist

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.300 
cutaway there where the internal twist
script<00:03:27.540> used<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.810> run<00:03:28.080> up<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.319> down<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:29.099> that's

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
script used to run up and down so that's

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.970 
script used to run up and down so that's
a<00:03:29.430> whale<00:03:29.580> batting<00:03:30.000> as<00:03:30.120> well<00:03:30.500> now<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.560> reason

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
a whale batting as well now the reason

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.339 
a whale batting as well now the reason
I'm<00:03:32.069> using<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.640> type<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:32.940> twist<00:03:33.360> grip<00:03:33.540> is

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
I'm using this type of twist grip is

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.199 
I'm using this type of twist grip is
pure<00:03:34.769> because<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.370> much<00:03:35.579> easier<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:36.180> change

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
pure because it's much easier to change

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.539 
pure because it's much easier to change
the<00:03:36.690> cable<00:03:37.170> if<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.620> was<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.890> have<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> break<00:03:38.280> on

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
the cable if it was to have a break on

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.849 
the cable if it was to have a break on
the<00:03:38.670> road<00:03:38.880> side<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:40.109> it's<00:03:40.260> purely<00:03:40.530> practical

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
the road side so it's purely practical

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.599 
the road side so it's purely practical
reasons<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:41.820> challenge<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:43.489> all<00:03:44.489> right

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
reasons of challenge to that all right

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.110 
reasons of challenge to that all right
so<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:45.359> bike<00:03:45.690> then<00:03:46.019> it's<00:03:46.350> not<00:03:46.680> far<00:03:47.120> from

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
so this bike then it's not far from

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.470 
so this bike then it's not far from
running<00:03:48.569> I'll<00:03:48.930> be<00:03:49.109> able<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.380> run<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.709> up<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.480> so

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
running I'll be able to run it up so so

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.349 
running I'll be able to run it up so so
the<00:03:51.690> intention<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.920> next<00:03:53.220> film<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:54.090> to

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
the intention and in the next film is to

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.170 
the intention and in the next film is to
get<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.630> started<00:03:55.170> up<00:03:55.319> run<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.709> up<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.310> Troy's

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
get it started up run it up and Troy's

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.340 
get it started up run it up and Troy's
outside<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:59.280> all<00:03:59.549> I've<00:03:59.700> got<00:03:59.850> to<00:03:59.940> do<00:04:00.150> I've<00:04:01.109> got

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
outside so all I've got to do I've got

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.890 
outside so all I've got to do I've got
the<00:04:01.440> dad<00:04:01.650> pipe<00:04:01.980> made<00:04:02.310> up<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.420> section

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
the dad pipe made up and the section

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.410 
the dad pipe made up and the section
underneath<00:04:04.200> which<00:04:04.650> divides<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.489> into<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.180> two

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
underneath which divides it into the two

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.520 
underneath which divides it into the two
silencers<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.410> just<00:04:07.680> need<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.489> fit<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.030> answers

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
silencers I just need to fit so answers

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.140 
silencers I just need to fit so answers
so<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.889> will<00:04:11.010> be<00:04:11.130> done<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.609> next<00:04:11.880> film

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
so that will be done in the next film

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.229 
so that will be done in the next film
and<00:04:12.389> the<00:04:13.380> other<00:04:13.530> thing<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:13.859> I'm

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
and the other thing that I'm

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.569 
and the other thing that I'm
concentrating<00:04:15.239> on<00:04:15.359> is<00:04:16.320> this<00:04:16.530> cover<00:04:16.950> around

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
concentrating on is this cover around

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.680 
concentrating on is this cover around
the<00:04:17.729> shop<00:04:18.260> because<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.620> some<00:04:20.690> suggest

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
the shop because of that some suggest

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.020 
the shop because of that some suggest
that<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:22.590> might<00:04:22.830> be<00:04:23.010> better<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.430> leave<00:04:23.789> the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
that it might be better to leave the

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.570 
that it might be better to leave the
shop<00:04:24.330> as<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.020> open<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.979> can<00:04:26.160> be<00:04:26.280> signed

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
shop as it is open so it can be signed

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.190 
shop as it is open so it can be signed
and<00:04:26.850> not<00:04:27.090> cover<00:04:27.389> it<00:04:27.600> up<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.950> others<00:04:29.310> have<00:04:29.490> set

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
and not cover it up and others have set

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.670 
and not cover it up and others have set
the<00:04:31.200> cover<00:04:31.440> is<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.680> good<00:04:31.889> idea<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.810> I've<00:04:34.320> had<00:04:34.500> an

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
the cover is a good idea so I've had an

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.390 
the cover is a good idea so I've had an
idea

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
idea

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.350 
idea
don't<00:04:36.030> fall<00:04:36.330> strikes<00:04:36.870> in<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.590> middle<00:04:38.360> of

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
don't fall strikes in the middle of

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.609 
don't fall strikes in the middle of
those<00:04:39.690> two<00:04:40.050> ideas

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:41.619 
those two ideas

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:44.219 
those two ideas
I'm<00:04:42.009> not<00:04:42.219> gonna<00:04:42.339> say<00:04:42.639> yet<00:04:42.939> but<00:04:43.899> I'll<00:04:43.989> show<00:04:44.019> you

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
I'm not gonna say yet but I'll show you

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.599 
I'm not gonna say yet but I'll show you
in<00:04:44.499> the<00:04:44.649> next<00:04:45.159> film<00:04:46.349> but<00:04:47.349> for<00:04:47.559> now<00:04:47.709> I<00:04:48.129> am

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:48.609 
in the next film but for now I am
