something<00:00:39.360> we're<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.809> looking<00:00:39.930> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
something we're going to be looking to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.810 
something we're going to be looking to
improve<00:00:40.440> over<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.800> course<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> next<00:00:41.610> few

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
improve over the course of the next few

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.430 
improve over the course of the next few
games<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.050> we've<00:00:43.320> been

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
games and as you can see we've been

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.590 
games and as you can see we've been
setting<00:00:43.680> new<00:00:43.860> targets<00:00:44.309> scoring<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.390> goal<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
setting new targets scoring one goal and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.940 
setting new targets scoring one goal and
getting<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:45.989> assist<00:00:46.260> again<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.680> shouldn't

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
getting one assist again which shouldn't

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.069 
getting one assist again which shouldn't
be<00:00:47.010> too<00:00:47.070> difficult<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.640> us<00:00:47.789> also<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
be too difficult for us also get in a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
be too difficult for us also get in a
minimum<00:00:49.620> average<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.980> six<00:00:50.190> point<00:00:50.430> seven<00:00:50.700> which

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
minimum average of six point seven which

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.910 
minimum average of six point seven which
should<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.449> quite<00:00:51.660> easy<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.620> goal

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
should be quite easy and a goal

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
should be quite easy and a goal
conversion<00:00:53.610> rate<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.239> eighteen

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
conversion rate of I think eighteen

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.840 
conversion rate of I think eighteen
percent<00:00:54.860> but<00:00:55.860> yeah<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.190> head<00:00:56.340> off<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> our<00:00:56.730> next

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
percent but yeah we head off to our next

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.569 
percent but yeah we head off to our next
game<00:00:57.030> against<00:00:57.270> crystal<00:00:57.570> palace<00:00:57.600> um<00:00:58.460> back<00:00:59.460> in

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
remember so once again it should be a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.740 
remember so once again it should be a
relatively<00:01:10.260> easy<00:01:10.619> game<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:10.950> us<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:12.180> we

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
relatively easy game for us but we

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.840 
relatively easy game for us but we
started<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> game<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.500> well<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:14.010> lot

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
started off the game really well a lot

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.840 
started off the game really well a lot
of<00:01:14.880> pressure<00:01:15.360> early<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.990> oh<00:01:16.200> well<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.310> lot<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of pressure early on oh well a lot of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.310 
of pressure early on oh well a lot of
pressure<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.360> those<00:01:18.570> men<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> board<00:01:19.200> early

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
pressure to those men on the board early

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320 
pressure to those men on the board early
on<00:01:19.560> forcing<00:01:20.159> them<00:01:20.280> into<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.610> error<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.060> think

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
on forcing them into the error I think

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.749 
on forcing them into the error I think
jizzle<00:01:22.290> scores<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:22.860> his<00:01:23.040> first<00:01:23.490> touch<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.160 
jizzle scores with his first touch of
the<00:01:24.030> ball<00:01:24.180> he<00:01:24.540> swim<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:24.930> playing<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the ball he swim there playing a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
the ball he swim there playing a
defender<00:01:25.560> under<00:01:25.799> pressure<00:01:26.150> forcing<00:01:27.150> them<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
defender under pressure forcing them to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.819 
defender under pressure forcing them to
lose<00:01:27.450> possession<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.049> yet<00:01:28.229> literally<00:01:28.710> his

the<00:01:39.960> game<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.409> had<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.369> early

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the game like we had I think the early

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.920 
the game like we had I think the early
goal<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:42.060> helped<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> people<00:01:42.689> say

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
goal really helped the people say

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.300 
goal really helped the people say
there's<00:01:43.079> no<00:01:43.170> momentum<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.619> FIFA<00:01:43.950> who

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
there's no momentum and FIFA who

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.740 
there's no momentum and FIFA who

basically had them under pressure for
the<00:01:45.840> rest<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> game<00:01:46.350> unfortunately<00:01:47.310> for
