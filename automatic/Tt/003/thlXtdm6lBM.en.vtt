OS<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.099> controller<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.420> Alienware<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
OS in the controller so Alienware I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
OS in the controller so Alienware I
wanted<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.280> some<00:00:35.489> money<00:00:35.670> off<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.030> box

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
wanted to make some money off this box

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.389 
wanted to make some money off this box
that<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:36.899> were<00:00:36.989> making<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> decided<00:00:38.219> just

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
that they were making so I decided just

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.790 
that they were making so I decided just
to<00:00:38.700> put<00:00:38.969> Windows<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.230> then<00:00:40.440> kind<00:00:40.649> of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
to put Windows on it and then kind of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.750 
to put Windows on it and then kind of
make<00:00:40.890> their<00:00:41.070> own<00:00:41.870> overlay<00:00:42.870> over<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
make their own overlay over it so it

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.459 
make their own overlay over it so it
would<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.940> compatible<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.719> work<00:00:45.989> really<00:00:46.200> easy

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
would be compatible and work really easy

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.639 
would be compatible and work really easy
without<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> keyboard<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.610> mouse<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.180> sugar

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
without a keyboard and mouse just sugar

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.150 
without a keyboard and mouse just sugar

before<00:03:51.870> about<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:53.190> upgrades<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:54.810> can

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
before about the upgrades you can

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.430 
before about the upgrades you can
upgrade<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.919> through<00:03:56.310> Alienware<00:03:56.849> first<00:03:57.440> you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
upgrade it through Alienware first you

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.860 
upgrade it through Alienware first you
can<00:03:58.620> choose<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.130> say<00:03:59.280> when<00:03:59.489> i<00:03:59.609> 7<00:04:00.120> i<00:04:00.209> 5<00:04:00.510> stuff

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
can choose to say when i 7 i 5 stuff

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.229 
can choose to say when i 7 i 5 stuff
like<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:01.260> they<00:04:01.799> give<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.099> choices<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:03.090> then

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
like that they give you choices and then

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.120 
like that they give you choices and then
you<00:04:03.329> can<00:04:03.450> put<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.630> terabyte<00:04:04.349> hard<00:04:04.530> drive<00:04:04.859> more

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
you can put a terabyte hard drive more

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.759 
you can put a terabyte hard drive more
ram<00:04:05.400> 8<00:04:05.819> gigs<00:04:06.060> ram<00:04:06.269> whatever<00:04:06.660> like<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:06.900> but

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
ram 8 gigs ram whatever like that but

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.680 
ram 8 gigs ram whatever like that but
then<00:04:07.889> also<00:04:08.099> so<00:04:08.549> you<00:04:08.579> get<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:08.940> two<00:04:09.299> years<00:04:09.540> down

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
then also so you get it two years down

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.300 
then also so you get it two years down
the<00:04:09.840> line<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:10.230> want<00:04:10.380> some<00:04:10.530> more<00:04:10.680> RAM<00:04:10.889> or

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
the line you want some more RAM or

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.129 
the line you want some more RAM or
bigger<00:04:11.609> hard<00:04:11.880> drive<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.569> can<00:04:12.720> just<00:04:12.870> swap<00:04:13.079> it

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
bigger hard drive you can just swap it

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.440 
bigger hard drive you can just swap it
out<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.620> can<00:04:13.739> swap<00:04:13.980> out<00:04:14.130> everything<00:04:14.730> but<00:04:15.389> the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
out you can swap out everything but the

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.819 
out you can swap out everything but the
GPU<00:04:16.140> since<00:04:16.409> the<00:04:16.620> custom<00:04:17.099> one<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.430> build

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
GPU since the custom one and build

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.200 
GPU since the custom one and build
into<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:19.359> motherboard<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.849> that's<00:04:21.849> kind<00:04:22.120> of

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
into the motherboard so that's kind of

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.499 
into the motherboard so that's kind of
impressive<00:04:23.520> these<00:04:24.520> councils<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.300> we<00:04:25.360> have

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
impressive these councils that we have

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.659 
impressive these councils that we have
right<00:04:25.690> now<00:04:25.720> we<00:04:26.020> can't<00:04:26.289> upgrade<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.860> we're<00:04:27.520> just

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
right now we can't upgrade it we're just

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.570 
right now we can't upgrade it we're just
basically<00:04:28.449> stuck<00:04:29.139> with<00:04:29.470> whatever<00:04:29.919> hardware

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
basically stuck with whatever hardware

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.469 
basically stuck with whatever hardware
we<00:04:30.759> get<00:04:31.060> until<00:04:32.310> Microsoft<00:04:33.310> or<00:04:33.669> entender<00:04:34.180> or

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
we get until Microsoft or entender or
