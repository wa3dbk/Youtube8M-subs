hi I'm David llega with Big Bear Lake
Fire<00:00:10.550> Department<00:00:11.150> and<00:00:11.389> today<00:00:11.780> we're<00:00:11.960> going<00:00:11.990> to

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110

talk<00:00:12.320> about<00:00:12.530> how<00:00:12.950> do<00:00:13.010> you<00:00:13.190> properly<00:00:13.520> limb<00:00:14.000> up<00:00:14.150> a

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
talk about how do you properly limb up a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.450 
talk about how do you properly limb up a
tree<00:00:14.630> that's<00:00:15.170> around<00:00:15.470> your<00:00:15.710> house<00:00:15.920> to<00:00:16.189> make<00:00:16.340> it

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
tree that's around your house to make it

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.640 
tree that's around your house to make it
more<00:00:16.580> fire<00:00:16.880> resistive<00:00:17.570> in<00:00:17.750> an<00:00:18.170> event<00:00:18.439> of<00:00:18.529> a

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
more fire resistive in an event of a

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
more fire resistive in an event of a
fire<00:00:18.860> that<00:00:18.920> comes<00:00:19.340> through<00:00:19.520> your

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
fire that comes through your

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.550 
fire that comes through your
neighborhood<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.689> right<00:00:20.900> behind<00:00:21.050> me<00:00:21.380> is<00:00:21.529> a

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
neighborhood so right behind me is a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.920 
neighborhood so right behind me is a
white<00:00:21.800> fir<00:00:22.070> tree<00:00:22.369> it<00:00:22.580> has<00:00:22.820> low<00:00:23.330> hanging

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
white fir tree it has low hanging

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.990 
white fir tree it has low hanging
branches<00:00:24.590> that<00:00:25.160> we're<00:00:25.340> going<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.550> eliminate

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
branches that we're going to eliminate

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.460 
branches that we're going to eliminate
these<00:00:26.180> smaller<00:00:26.570> ones<00:00:26.840> down<00:00:27.110> here<00:00:27.140> at<00:00:27.410> the

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
these smaller ones down here at the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.830 
these smaller ones down here at the
ground<00:00:27.770> and<00:00:28.009> make<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:28.970> tree<00:00:29.210> much<00:00:29.390> more<00:00:29.599> fire

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
ground and make this tree much more fire

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.389 
ground and make this tree much more fire
resistant<00:00:31.090> so<00:00:32.090> right<00:00:32.300> now<00:00:32.329> I'm<00:00:33.050> removing<00:00:33.500> dead

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
resistant so right now I'm removing dead

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.610 
resistant so right now I'm removing dead

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
years when you remove these dead

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.080 
years when you remove these dead
branches<00:00:39.140> you<00:00:39.290> want<00:00:39.469> to<00:00:39.609> trim<00:00:40.609> them<00:00:40.820> all<00:00:40.969> the

is I've removed all the dead branches

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.299 
is I've removed all the dead branches

from this white fur these branches are

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.880 
from this white fur these branches are

trees off the ground about six to eight
feet<00:01:12.070> well<00:01:13.070> I'm<00:01:13.220> about<00:01:13.490> six<00:01:13.790> feet<00:01:13.970> tall<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:14.600> as

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
feet well I'm about six feet tall and as

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.410 
feet well I'm about six feet tall and as
you<00:01:15.200> can<00:01:15.350> see<00:01:15.380> we've<00:01:15.829> removed<00:01:16.340> all<00:01:16.700> those

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
you can see we've removed all those

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.420 
you can see we've removed all those
low-lying<00:01:17.899> branches<00:01:18.590> up<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.040> level<00:01:19.220> of

low-lying branches up to the level of
about<00:01:19.640> six<00:01:20.000> feet<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:20.540> that's<00:01:20.990> what<00:01:21.170> we<00:01:21.290> call

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
about six feet and that's what we call

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.670 
about six feet and that's what we call
looming<00:01:21.950> up<00:01:22.630> but<00:01:23.630> there's<00:01:23.780> one<00:01:23.930> final<00:01:24.229> step

looming up but there's one final step

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.399 
looming up but there's one final step
and<00:01:24.950> that<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.969> remove<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.509> excess<00:01:27.079> pine

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
and that is remove the excess pine

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.289
