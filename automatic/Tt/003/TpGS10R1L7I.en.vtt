00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 ah 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.240
 welcome to review curves of the 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.850
 life guys this movie is being 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.310
 Directed by Robert Lawrence and 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.710
 starred by sir that index of my 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.900
 Adams and I feel like I know what 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.530
 better after that my credibility 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.860
 as a film critic 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.740
 will come down but I like how 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.140
 is acting in this movie too 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.770
 previously we saw it in social network and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.270
 he also did a pretty good job 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.030
 I will say that he did a job 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.550
 spectacular and nothing to me that knows how to win 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.470
 an Oscar but is not doing little to 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 little good yes to that the famous boy 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.410
 yes yes yes there goes little by little 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.080
 but good of what it is about curves of the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.720
 life agreements of friends to the movie no 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.480
 of baseball but it does have to very very 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.430
 involved the subject of this sport in 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.680
 where to teach click enjoyment is the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.200
 protagonist he is a hunter of 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.440
 baseball talents 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.510
 then during the movie this one has 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.510
 a relationship quite like here 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.960
 conflictive with her daughter did not take 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.000
 well because his mom died as a child 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.180
 and in those media errors that will not 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.780
 comment 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.440
 but what is it that the plot like that was 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.100
 very simple but it's not about it being 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.300
 a fairly simple movie and that 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.970
 involve this movie I think so 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.760
 was made to be nominated to several 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.160
 prizes but did not arrive until point and they 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.570
 will explain why these tapes are 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.340
 they rotate from the beginning that they are not 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.350
 applied by going in the work in 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.360
 this world and right here when 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.800
 star in its own dangerous a 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.050
 exceptional work the script is perfect 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.570
 and all the scenes are quite 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.479
 taken care of in this tape a lot of 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.590
 that suddenly like the characters 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.899
 get lost is full of clichÃ©s and you say 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.209
 what the hell are going on like I'm 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.130
 to that of my life and with that the 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.020
 magic then 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.590
 a movie that is being 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.480
 directed because even if paralyzed 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.110
 power does not mean that they are made 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.560
 films 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.240
 100 videos the tape is not bad 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.550
 I comment that it is a movie that if you 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.980
 I recommend that you watch it pretty much the video 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.820
 message but I tell you missed that 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.590
 feeling that flavor that is unique and the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.110
 Mr. Kirchner's edition though 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.210
 produced this movie also apart from 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.200
 star the lacks this magic 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:50.610
 then the character like that one 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.730
 He has a conflict but he does not know 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.790
 solve is not like I lost and that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.010
 It confuses the viewer a lot 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.550
 the movie and it says it's me 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.739
 what a wave it is like if you are going to retire 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.680
 is not going to retire I will solve the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.180
 problems little things will solve us 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.980
 where they wanted to take the course of 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.890
 the movie I think that's what 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.600
 he was missing they were served as lost 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.280
 who owes the one on the tape like 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.280
 they take us on a mountain 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.200
 so do not talk, you did not do a job 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.560
 spectacular is a regular job if you 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.930
 I recommend that you see it 2 is good it is not 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.060
 as spectacular as it has us 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.459
 accustomed the clinical gentleman that the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.680
 really left the rod very high so 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.450
 guys this is the choir book of the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.700
 flour they also lose when they are in 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.370
 your city or if you find it in your video 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.400
 favorite rente the one that we remember here 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.269
 rather so guys this was more 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.269
 movie theater
