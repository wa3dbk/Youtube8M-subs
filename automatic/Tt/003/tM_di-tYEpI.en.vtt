 beaten lady case I would say to start 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.329
 at this point that league 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.910
 both put the pans on the fire 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.370
 rosalba uses an earthenware pot as 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.980
 wants the tradition then prepare one 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.680

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.330
 cut the tomatoes they told me that 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.400
 this tomato grows at the foot of the 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:55.010
 vesuvio and says that the earth is more 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.930
 nice nutritious flavor we say 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.990
 magical of our land ai 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.690
 ingredients but why this octopus is 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.610
 call to Luciana let us say the sailors there 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.159
 to saint lucia with their fish 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.439
 and they invented this recipe and da 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.850
 here derives the name force alla reggiana 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.130
 therefore in honor 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.829
 hamlet of naples of santa lucia 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.340
 cut all the tomatoes then to a 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.340
 blow 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.360
 we must not add water because 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:32.100
 work coach that water soy with water 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.960
 soy rightly now water his year 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.830
 it also adds white wine and mixes 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.450
 well 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.670
 rosalba instead waits a little longer 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.800
 because the crock pot is slower 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.830
 to warm up sorry helped me the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.510
 whole shot what the call is 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:54.080
 cut we cut it at the fair yes also 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:57.360
 you the butrint eroti preferably tdf 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.880
 it is because during cooking the heart 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.880
 assumes a position called star 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:11.920
 she has vented not much 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:14.980
 less oil than ever if I talk more 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.970
 light and to do so also angel what 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.190
 let's make 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.410
 add tomatoes then we put 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.610
 immediately the tomatoes you also put them 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.599
 yes we wait a little longer for the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.599
 symbian says the public 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.250
 increased by 1 men and the armchair 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.430
 militant board 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.430
 we add from 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.890
 but rinsed with salt by hand 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:52.020

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.350
 Venetian to assist the youngest 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.350

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.360
 it's a mix with the site but I want it 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.890
 so nice copy it then price you from 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.550
 just a pinch of parsley and then 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.000
 cover and let go for how long 25 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.000
 minutes 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.550
 then come to this point see how 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.500
 I said before that your only 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.540
 shape of a star that tentacles 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.330
 sustainable there are curls they have 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.830
 since at this point I would say first 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.140
 to put the tomato add 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:34.190
 even a little white wine to give that 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.190
 sky paintings of juan white wine 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.490
 at this point I would say that the case of 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.860
 throw the tomatoes put yourself like 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.650
 made just a drop in the speech 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.020
 for eyes also rosalba covers his 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.070
 pot and cook for about 15 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.400

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.000
 add the peeled and well-cooked pumpkin flowers 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.550
 washed with the octopus during cooking, then fry 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.440
 the zucchini is everything I added a 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.020
 pinch of salt 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.600
 our choice instead puts you warm 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.060
 slices of bread in a new pot 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.390
 then a bit that after all not 5 10 minutes e 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.790
