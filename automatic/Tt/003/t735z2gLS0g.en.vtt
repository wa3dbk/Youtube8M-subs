00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.479 
just you know when you're younger you
little<00:03:12.380> more<00:03:12.440> angry<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.130> have<00:03:13.220> something

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
little more angry and you have something

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.180 
little more angry and you have something
to<00:03:13.549> prove<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.060> it's<00:03:14.239> like<00:03:14.799> do<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:15.829> want<00:03:16.070> other

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
to prove so it's like do you want other

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.740 
to prove so it's like do you want other
people<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.549> think<00:03:16.790> you're<00:03:17.090> on<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.359> level<00:03:17.540> with
