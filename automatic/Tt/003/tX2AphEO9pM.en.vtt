you can see this is the packaging that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.549 
you can see this is the packaging that
it<00:00:32.759> ships<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.840> kind<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.290> slide

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it ships in and when you kind of slide

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.830 
it ships in and when you kind of slide
it<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> packaging<00:00:35.579> you're<00:00:36.450> greeted

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
it out of the packaging you're greeted

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.740 
it out of the packaging you're greeted
by<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.020> very<00:00:37.559> lightweight<00:00:38.309> case<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.300> adds<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
by a very lightweight case it adds a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.990 
by a very lightweight case it adds a
little<00:00:40.079> bit<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> bulk<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.730> not

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
little bit of bulk but it really is not

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.779 
little bit of bulk but it really is not
all<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.390> bulky<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.350> utilizes<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.370> sort<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
all that bulky it utilizes this sort of

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.750 
all that bulky it utilizes this sort of
a<00:00:44.879> method<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> clasp<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.219> case<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
a method for a clasp on the case so you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.420 
a method for a clasp on the case so you
open<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.690> close<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:50.039> easy<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
open that and close it it's very easy to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
open that and close it it's very easy to
do<00:00:50.700> over<00:00:51.300> time<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.719> curious<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.440> this

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
do over time I'm curious to see if this

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.619 
do over time I'm curious to see if this
will<00:00:52.949> fracture<00:00:53.280> because<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> just

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
will fracture because this is just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.470 
will fracture because this is just
plastic<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.739> hope<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
plastic so I hope not but that is a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.200 
plastic so I hope not but that is a
point<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.559> call<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> when<00:00:59.850> we<00:00:59.940> open

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
point to call out here and when we open

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
point to call out here and when we open
this<00:01:00.329> up<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.199> see<00:01:01.410> there<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> foam

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
this up as you can see there is a foam

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.820 
this up as you can see there is a foam
insert<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.420> some<00:01:04.049> instructions<00:01:04.680> about

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
insert and then some instructions about

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.190 
insert and then some instructions about
the<00:01:05.010> viewing<00:01:05.700> angle<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.240> well<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> typing

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the viewing angle as well as the typing

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.990 
the viewing angle as well as the typing
angle<00:01:07.500> which<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.040> show<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
angle which I will show you in just a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
angle which I will show you in just a
moment<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.530> far<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> case<00:01:11.220> goes

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
moment here now as far as the case goes

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
moment here now as far as the case goes
you're<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> get<00:01:12.780> partial<00:01:13.560> coverage<00:01:14.010> on

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
you're going to get partial coverage on

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.249 
you're going to get partial coverage on
the<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> mean<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.630> area<00:01:15.960> here

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the back what I mean is this area here

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.130 
the back what I mean is this area here
in<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> open<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> rest<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.420> hard

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
in here is open the rest is a hard

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.560 
in here is open the rest is a hard
plastic<00:01:19.470> shell<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.549> unfortunately<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
plastic shell and unfortunately this

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.800 
plastic shell and unfortunately this
case<00:01:21.810> looks<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.350> designed<00:01:22.909> on<00:01:23.909> an<00:01:24.299> early

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
case looks to be designed on an early

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
case looks to be designed on an early
speculated<00:01:25.799> model<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> mini<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.850> have

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
speculated model of the mini as we have

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.760 
speculated model of the mini as we have
a<00:01:27.000> cutout<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.049> doesn't<00:01:28.290> exist

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
a cutout right here that doesn't exist

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.590 
a cutout right here that doesn't exist
on<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> mini<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.490> when<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:30.000> Target<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
on the mini and when I was at Target I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.210 
on the mini and when I was at Target I
looked<00:01:31.079> at<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> different<00:01:31.829> ones<00:01:31.950> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
looked at all the different ones that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.700 
looked at all the different ones that
they<00:01:32.340> had<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> fit<00:01:34.020> folios<00:01:34.439> had

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
they had and all of the fit folios had

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.789 
they had and all of the fit folios had
that<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.189> hopefully<00:01:35.909> spec<00:01:36.210> will<00:01:36.810> revise<00:01:37.439> this

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that so hopefully spec will revise this

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.670 
that so hopefully spec will revise this
case<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.299> unnecessary<00:01:39.810> cutout

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
case not to have the unnecessary cutout

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.249 
case not to have the unnecessary cutout
this<00:01:41.490> case<00:01:41.790> also<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.420> least<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.840> time<00:01:43.079> of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
this case also at least at the time of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.170 
this case also at least at the time of

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
cutout here just basically lay that into

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.130 
cutout here just basically lay that into
place<00:01:56.520> we're<00:01:56.969> gonna<00:01:57.060> come<00:01:57.390> back<00:01:57.600> around<00:01:57.780> here

place we're gonna come back around here

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.469 
place we're gonna come back around here
push<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.950> corners<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.520> make<00:02:00.090> sure<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
push all the corners in make sure that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.260 
push all the corners in make sure that
every<00:02:01.020> edge<00:02:01.259> has<00:02:01.829> snapped<00:02:02.159> thoroughly<00:02:02.909> into

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
every edge has snapped thoroughly into

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.899 
every edge has snapped thoroughly into
place<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.930> once<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.159> done<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.430> it

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
place and once we have done that it

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.389 
place and once we have done that it
should<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.600> seated<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.770> are<00:02:07.979> good<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.369> go

the one without the cable that is

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.039 
the one without the cable that is
because<00:02:57.159> it<00:02:57.280> won't<00:02:57.459> fit<00:02:57.549> so<00:02:58.269> you'll<00:02:58.780> need<00:02:58.930> to

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
because it won't fit so you'll need to

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.659 
because it won't fit so you'll need to
go<00:02:59.169> with<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.409> cabled<00:02:59.769> version<00:03:00.189> to<00:03:00.370> get<00:03:00.489> that

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:00.669 
go with the cabled version to get that

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.789 
go with the cabled version to get that
to<00:03:00.879> fit<00:03:01.090> here<00:03:01.510> your<00:03:01.719> speaker<00:03:02.049> cutouts<00:03:02.409> and<00:03:02.680> it

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
to fit here your speaker cutouts and it

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.429 
to fit here your speaker cutouts and it
works<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.250> fine<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:04.510> along<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.930> top<00:03:05.109> again

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
works just fine up along the top again

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.170 
works just fine up along the top again
there's<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.859> unnecessary<00:03:06.159> cutout<00:03:06.909> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
there's the unnecessary cutout and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.819 
there's the unnecessary cutout and
hopefully<00:03:07.659> they<00:03:07.810> will<00:03:07.840> fix<00:03:08.169> that<00:03:08.349> in<00:03:08.409> a<00:03:08.590> future

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
hopefully they will fix that in a future

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.940 
hopefully they will fix that in a future

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.330 
are a bit recessed as you look at the
volume<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.449> your<00:03:22.750> rocker<00:03:23.139> switch<00:03:23.560> here<00:03:23.859> so

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
volume and your rocker switch here so

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.890 
volume and your rocker switch here so
you<00:03:24.400> do<00:03:24.669> have<00:03:24.699> to<00:03:24.819> reach<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.359> little<00:03:25.569> bit

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
you do have to reach in a little bit

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.080 
you do have to reach in a little bit
but<00:03:26.139> it's<00:03:26.260> nothing<00:03:26.500> too<00:03:26.889> major<00:03:27.069> again<00:03:27.879> this

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
but it's nothing too major again this

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.059 
but it's nothing too major again this
does<00:03:28.329> not<00:03:28.540> incorporate<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.169> sleep<00:03:29.530> awake<00:03:29.829> so

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
does not incorporate the sleep awake so

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.009 
does not incorporate the sleep awake so
don't<00:03:30.220> expect<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.729> with<00:03:30.849> this<00:03:31.030> case<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.599> when

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
don't expect it with this case and when

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.170 
don't expect it with this case and when
you<00:03:32.109> fold<00:03:32.349> it<00:03:32.530> back<00:03:32.739> it's<00:03:33.159> pretty<00:03:33.489> slim<00:03:33.879> and

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
you fold it back it's pretty slim and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.360 
you fold it back it's pretty slim and
pretty<00:03:34.540> lightweight<00:03:35.049> it's<00:03:35.560> easier<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.220> hold

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
pretty lightweight it's easier to hold

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.240 
pretty lightweight it's easier to hold
the<00:03:36.609> mini<00:03:36.849> with<00:03:37.209> this<00:03:37.479> case<00:03:37.810> than<00:03:38.799> without<00:03:39.189> it

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
the mini with this case than without it

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.729 
the mini with this case than without it
gives<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.909> a<00:03:39.939> little<00:03:40.239> bit<00:03:40.389> of<00:03:40.449> grippy<00:03:41.049> area<00:03:41.530> of

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
gives you a little bit of grippy area of

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.920 
gives you a little bit of grippy area of
the<00:03:42.010> case<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.459> you're<00:03:42.579> not<00:03:42.759> overreaching<00:03:43.540> on

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
the case so you're not overreaching on

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.110 
the case so you're not overreaching on
to<00:03:44.229> your<00:03:44.379> device<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:45.310> should<00:03:45.370> play<00:03:45.790> pretty

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
to your device it should play pretty

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.539 
to your device it should play pretty
well<00:03:46.209> with<00:03:46.599> screen<00:03:46.720> protectors<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.400> only

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
well with screen protectors and the only

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.339 
well with screen protectors and the only
other<00:03:48.729> thing<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.269> will<00:03:49.359> call<00:03:49.720> out<00:03:49.780> on<00:03:50.109> this

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
other thing that I will call out on this

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.740 
other thing that I will call out on this
is<00:03:51.069> there<00:03:51.430> are<00:03:51.459> some<00:03:51.669> areas<00:03:51.909> that<00:03:52.090> maybe<00:03:52.569> don't

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
is there are some areas that maybe don't

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.659 
is there are some areas that maybe don't
seem<00:03:53.019> like<00:03:53.199> a<00:03:53.229> perfect<00:03:53.949> fit<00:03:54.009> it<00:03:54.400> kind<00:03:54.609> of

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
seem like a perfect fit it kind of

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.119 
seem like a perfect fit it kind of
raises<00:03:54.909> up<00:03:55.239> a<00:03:55.359> little<00:03:55.540> bit<00:03:55.780> nothing<00:03:56.650> too<00:03:56.919> major

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
raises up a little bit nothing too major

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.569 
raises up a little bit nothing too major
I<00:03:57.759> suppose<00:03:58.479> you<00:03:58.689> could<00:03:59.049> use<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.799> kind<00:04:00.459> of

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
I suppose you could use this kind of

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.429 
I suppose you could use this kind of
latch<00:04:00.759> just<00:04:00.790> like<00:04:01.359> that<00:04:01.569> but<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:01.959> doesn't<00:04:02.259> seem

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
latch just like that but it doesn't seem

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.129 
latch just like that but it doesn't seem
to<00:04:02.799> when<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.579> move<00:04:03.759> around<00:04:03.909> really<00:04:04.299> hold<00:04:04.750> so

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
to when you move around really hold so

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.710 
to when you move around really hold so
not<00:04:05.859> a<00:04:05.889> big<00:04:06.159> deal<00:04:06.340> there<00:04:06.579> either<00:04:06.909> and<00:04:07.269> as<00:04:07.569> far

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
not a big deal there either and as far

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.689 
not a big deal there either and as far
as<00:04:07.780> stands<00:04:08.229> go<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.680> really<00:04:09.099> like<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.430> stand

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
as stands go I really like the stand

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.879 
as stands go I really like the stand
feature<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.269> this<00:04:10.419> case<00:04:10.479> so<00:04:10.930> first<00:04:11.199> off<00:04:11.439> all

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
feature in this case so first off all

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.890 
feature in this case so first off all
you<00:04:12.040> got<00:04:12.159> to<00:04:12.280> do<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.639> kind<00:04:12.879> of<00:04:12.970> open<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.359> up<00:04:13.509> and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
you got to do is kind of open it up and

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.129 
you got to do is kind of open it up and
you<00:04:14.560> get<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.709> stand<00:04:15.040> there<00:04:15.750> you're<00:04:16.750> going<00:04:16.900> to

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
you get a stand there you're going to

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.830 
you get a stand there you're going to
get<00:04:17.259> another<00:04:17.440> stand<00:04:17.829> here<00:04:18.250> as<00:04:18.849> well<00:04:19.209> as<00:04:19.449> right

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
get another stand here as well as right

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.580 
get another stand here as well as right
here<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.409> also<00:04:21.220> right<00:04:22.150> here<00:04:22.599> and<00:04:22.779> they<00:04:23.380> all

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
here and also right here and they all

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.360 
here and also right here and they all
hold<00:04:23.950> well<00:04:24.520> remember<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.330> fit<00:04:25.810> folio<00:04:26.289> on<00:04:26.650> the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
hold well remember the fit folio on the

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.689 
hold well remember the fit folio on the
I<00:04:27.430> pad<00:04:27.910> in<00:04:28.180> these<00:04:28.690> couple<00:04:29.110> last<00:04:29.620> stands<00:04:30.130> really

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
I pad in these couple last stands really

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.610 
I pad in these couple last stands really
always<00:04:30.850> fell<00:04:31.180> out<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.600> those<00:04:31.750> stand<00:04:32.169> modes

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
always fell out of those stand modes

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.920 
always fell out of those stand modes
this<00:04:33.160> one<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.580> not<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:34.030> case<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.479> suspect

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
this one is not the case I suspect

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.140 
this one is not the case I suspect
because<00:04:35.080> it's<00:04:35.410> much<00:04:35.590> lighter<00:04:35.949> and<00:04:36.190> it<00:04:36.760> holds

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
because it's much lighter and it holds

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.760 
because it's much lighter and it holds
it<00:04:37.270> quite<00:04:37.630> well<00:04:37.660> you're<00:04:38.199> also<00:04:38.350> gonna<00:04:38.530> get<00:04:38.710> a

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
it quite well you're also gonna get a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.110 
it quite well you're also gonna get a
typing<00:04:39.190> angle<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.729> way<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:40.000> they

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
typing angle and the way that they

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.939 
typing angle and the way that they
demonstrate<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.840> do<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.110> is<00:04:41.380> take<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.830> and

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
demonstrate to do this is take it and

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.030 
demonstrate to do this is take it and
basically<00:04:42.850> fold<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.449> in<00:04:43.600> just<00:04:44.290> like<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.710> and

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
basically fold it in just like this and

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.520 
basically fold it in just like this and
now<00:04:45.729> you<00:04:45.790> have<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.120> nice<00:04:46.360> typing<00:04:46.900> angle<00:04:47.199> you

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
now you have a nice typing angle you

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.110 
now you have a nice typing angle you
know<00:04:47.620> I'm<00:04:47.770> impressed<00:04:48.040> by<00:04:48.310> this<00:04:48.370> case<00:04:48.790> I<00:04:49.090> really

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
know I'm impressed by this case I really

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.439 
know I'm impressed by this case I really
hope<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:50.590> spec<00:04:51.010> can<00:04:51.250> come<00:04:51.490> back<00:04:51.669> and<00:04:51.970> revise

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
hope that spec can come back and revise

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.810 
hope that spec can come back and revise
it<00:04:52.500> just<00:04:53.500> make<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:53.800> little<00:04:54.010> bit<00:04:54.250> cleaner<00:04:54.490> so

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
it just make it a little bit cleaner so

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.060 
it just make it a little bit cleaner so
it<00:04:54.940> doesn't<00:04:55.360> have<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.870> unnecessary<00:04:56.229> cut<00:04:56.949> out

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
it doesn't have the unnecessary cut out

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.390 
it doesn't have the unnecessary cut out
and<00:04:57.310> also<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:58.810> maybe<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.350> utilizes<00:04:59.740> that<00:05:00.010> sleep

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
and also so maybe it utilizes that sleep

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.700 
and also so maybe it utilizes that sleep
awake<00:05:00.699> feature<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.419> I<00:05:01.720> would<00:05:01.930> definitely<00:05:02.470> see

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
awake feature and I would definitely see

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.460 
awake feature and I would definitely see
this<00:05:02.860> as<00:05:02.919> being<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.430> top<00:05:03.699> contender<00:05:04.180> for<00:05:04.960> now<00:05:05.139> I

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
this as being a top contender for now I

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.070 
this as being a top contender for now I
am<00:05:05.770> going<00:05:05.949> to<00:05:06.280> give<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:06.550> case<00:05:06.820> a<00:05:07.030> 4<00:05:07.419> out<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.720> 5

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
am going to give this case a 4 out of 5

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.529 
am going to give this case a 4 out of 5
it's<00:05:08.470> not<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:08.740> bad<00:05:09.010> case<00:05:09.280> for<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.639> money<00:05:09.789> it

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
it's not a bad case for the money it

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.439 
it's not a bad case for the money it
provides<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.229> great<00:05:11.560> level<00:05:11.889> of<00:05:12.010> protection<00:05:12.729> and

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
provides a great level of protection and

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.629 
provides a great level of protection and
again<00:05:13.840> I<00:05:14.139> just<00:05:14.169> think<00:05:14.440> they<00:05:14.710> need<00:05:14.889> to<00:05:15.039> clean

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
again I just think they need to clean

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.340 
again I just think they need to clean
that<00:05:15.669> up<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.300> it<00:05:16.360> looks<00:05:16.510> a<00:05:16.570> little<00:05:16.660> bit<00:05:16.840> nicer

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
that up so it looks a little bit nicer

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.129 
that up so it looks a little bit nicer
and<00:05:17.650> maybe<00:05:18.220> he's<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.850> sleep<00:05:19.210> awake<00:05:19.510> but<00:05:19.750> this

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
and maybe he's that sleep awake but this

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.040 
and maybe he's that sleep awake but this
spec<00:05:20.410> fit<00:05:20.860> folio<00:05:21.310> is<00:05:21.520> going<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:21.820> get<00:05:21.970> my<00:05:22.240> 4<00:05:22.690> out
