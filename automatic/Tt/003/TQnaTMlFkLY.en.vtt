00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
your ipad to across the room with one of

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.229 
your ipad to across the room with one of
these<00:03:11.380> which<00:03:11.680> would<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:11.950> pick<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.400> would

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
these which would you pick I would

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.539 
these which would you pick I would
rather<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.810> big<00:03:14.019> groups<00:03:14.290> really<00:03:14.890> yeah<00:03:15.340> I

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
rather have the big groups really yeah I

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.009 
rather have the big groups really yeah I
think<00:03:15.790> it's<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.269> would<00:03:16.420> protect<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.870> more

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
think it's this would protect it more

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.620 
think it's this would protect it more
than<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:18.489> do<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:19.209> because<00:03:19.420> it's

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
than this I I do just because it's

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.360 
than this I I do just because it's
thicker<00:03:19.840> takes<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.709> different<00:03:20.859> approach<00:03:21.040> these

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
thicker takes a different approach these

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.800 
thicker takes a different approach these
buttons<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.910> don't<00:03:22.060> actually<00:03:22.209> touch<00:03:22.600> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
buttons you don't actually touch the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.930 
buttons you don't actually touch the
volume<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.680> does<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.430> was<00:03:24.730> difficult

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
volume it does and that was difficult

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.330 
volume it does and that was difficult
for<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.720> students<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.829> for<00:03:27.040> some<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.250> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
for the students and for some of the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.860 
for the students and for some of the
adults<00:03:27.609> too<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.820> be<00:03:28.030> able<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.180> press<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.750> make

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
adults too to be able to press and make

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.270 
adults too to be able to press and make
sure<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.230> was<00:03:29.350> on<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.590> right<00:03:29.739> spot<00:03:29.920> they

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
sure that it was on the right spot they

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.979 
sure that it was on the right spot they
couldn't<00:03:30.579> control<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:31.090> sound<00:03:31.359> quite<00:03:31.630> as<00:03:31.780> much

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
couldn't control the sound quite as much

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.740 
couldn't control the sound quite as much
the<00:03:32.470> microphone<00:03:33.040> was<00:03:33.700> covered<00:03:34.150> when<00:03:34.480> we<00:03:34.630> were

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
the microphone was covered when we were

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.770 
the microphone was covered when we were
recording<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:36.220> they<00:03:36.340> actually<00:03:36.519> there<00:03:37.150> was<00:03:37.750> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
recording so they actually there was a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.449 
recording so they actually there was a
slight<00:03:38.109> bug<00:03:38.350> with<00:03:38.560> big<00:03:38.739> grips<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
slight bug with big grips and that the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.800 
slight bug with big grips and that the
camera<00:03:39.820> holes<00:03:40.000> not<00:03:40.150> big<00:03:40.209> enough<00:03:40.390> just<00:03:40.720> a

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
camera holes not big enough just a

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.009 
camera holes not big enough just a
slight<00:03:41.079> bug<00:03:41.320> with<00:03:41.670> em<00:03:42.670> edge<00:03:42.970> they<00:03:43.540> covered<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
slight bug with em edge they covered the

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.599 
slight bug with em edge they covered the
microphone<00:03:44.530> yet<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.190> very<00:03:45.340> muffled

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
microphone yet so it's a very muffled

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.090 
microphone yet so it's a very muffled
sound<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:47.109> when<00:03:47.290> you're<00:03:47.470> recording<00:03:47.859> your

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
sound and when you're recording your

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.599 
sound and when you're recording your
voices<00:03:48.630> little<00:03:49.630> close<00:03:49.810> up<00:03:50.019> on<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.200> net<00:03:50.609> so

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
voices little close up on a net so

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.580 
voices little close up on a net so
that's<00:03:52.120> something<00:03:52.359> to<00:03:52.480> think<00:03:52.540> about

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
that's something to think about

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.979 
that's something to think about
you<00:03:53.890> gotta<00:03:54.100> check<00:03:54.400> every<00:03:54.850> port<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.450> make<00:03:55.780> sure

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
you gotta check every port and make sure

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.280 
you gotta check every port and make sure
that<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.319> have<00:03:56.530> access<00:03:56.819> otherwise<00:03:57.819> you<00:03:58.750> risk

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
that you have access otherwise you risk

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.160 
that you have access otherwise you risk
turning<00:04:00.130> something<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.819> makes<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.900> device

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
turning something that makes the device

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.039 
turning something that makes the device
easier<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:02.920> use<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.459> nicer<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.120> hold<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.900> do

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
easier to use and nicer to hold and do

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.559 
easier to use and nicer to hold and do
more<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.319> a<00:04:05.470> headache<00:04:05.650> so<00:04:06.220> before<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:06.819> buy<00:04:06.970> 200

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
more of a headache so before you buy 200

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.440 
more of a headache so before you buy 200
of<00:04:07.690> these<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.260> might<00:04:08.470> want<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:09.299> think<00:04:10.299> about

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
of these you might want to think about

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.509 
of these you might want to think about
all<00:04:10.780> well<00:04:11.200> otherwise<00:04:11.739> you'd<00:04:11.980> be<00:04:12.069> getting<00:04:12.340> out

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
all well otherwise you'd be getting out

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.449 
all well otherwise you'd be getting out
a<00:04:12.549> drill<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.690> one<00:04:14.230> that'd<00:04:14.380> be<00:04:14.410> fun<00:04:14.769> this

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
a drill and that one that'd be fun this

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.449 
a drill and that one that'd be fun this
is<00:04:15.519> really<00:04:16.239> it's<00:04:17.019> heavy<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.799> heavy<00:04:18.130> first

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
is really it's heavy it is heavy first

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.860 
is really it's heavy it is heavy first
thing<00:04:18.609> you<00:04:18.700> notice<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.120> this<00:04:19.299> goes<00:04:19.510> with<00:04:19.720> the

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
thing you notice it this goes with the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.660 
thing you notice it this goes with the
end<00:04:20.019> right

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
end right

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.040 
end right
Suz<00:04:22.530> I'll<00:04:22.800> go<00:04:22.950> ahead<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.310> try<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.490> put<00:04:23.730> it<00:04:23.850> in

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
Suz I'll go ahead and try to put it in

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.530 
Suz I'll go ahead and try to put it in
it's<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.170> very<00:04:25.500> tight<00:04:26.340> slap<00:04:26.760> I'll<00:04:27.120> be<00:04:27.330> back<00:04:27.510> in

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
it's a very tight slap I'll be back in

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.850 
it's a very tight slap I'll be back in
about<00:04:27.720> in<00:04:28.140> two<00:04:28.290> days<00:04:30.320> it's<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.410> well<00:04:31.620> protected

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
about in two days it's a well protected

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.940 
about in two days it's a well protected
it's<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:32.910> case<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.270> protects<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.780> device

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
it's a case that protects the device

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.700 
it's a case that protects the device
extremely<00:04:34.950> well<00:04:35.100> yeah<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.260> kids<00:04:37.470> are<00:04:37.590> now

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
extremely well yeah and the kids are now

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.190 
extremely well yeah and the kids are now
having<00:04:37.950> hooks<00:04:38.310> on<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.970> end<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.570> each<00:04:39.840> corner

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
having hooks on the end in each corner

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.760 
having hooks on the end in each corner
which<00:04:41.010> makes<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.340> easy<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:42.410> if<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.560> want<00:04:43.710> to

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
which makes it easy to if you want to

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.020 
which makes it easy to if you want to
hang<00:04:43.920> it<00:04:43.950> up<00:04:44.100> around<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.400> classroom<00:04:44.880> as

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
hang it up around the classroom as

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.330 
hang it up around the classroom as
opposed<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.420> having<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.870> lay<00:04:46.110> oh<00:04:46.470> cool<00:04:47.070> yeah<00:04:47.280> I

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
opposed to having to lay oh cool yeah I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.010 
opposed to having to lay oh cool yeah I
had<00:04:47.640> flat<00:04:48.000> or<00:04:48.240> something<00:04:48.540> else<00:04:48.690> if<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:48.900> had

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
had flat or something else if you had

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.200 
had flat or something else if you had
some<00:04:49.170> hooks<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.500> could<00:04:49.650> set<00:04:49.830> it<00:04:49.920> up<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.310> really

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
some hooks you could set it up to really

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.820 
some hooks you could set it up to really
make<00:04:51.420> it<00:04:51.510> easier<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.960> manage<00:04:52.140> and<00:04:52.410> take<00:04:52.590> less

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
make it easier to manage and take less

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.820 
make it easier to manage and take less
space<00:04:53.690> so<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.810> one<00:04:54.990> thing<00:04:55.170> I<00:04:55.350> will<00:04:55.590> say<00:04:55.620> about

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
space so the one thing I will say about

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.040 
space so the one thing I will say about
this<00:04:56.370> is<00:04:56.610> that<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:57.150> was<00:04:57.270> designed<00:04:57.570> by<00:04:57.720> hatch

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
this is that it was designed by hatch

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.290 
this is that it was designed by hatch
who<00:04:58.440> they're<00:04:59.220> very<00:04:59.460> tuned<00:04:59.760> in<00:04:59.910> to<00:05:00.030> classroom

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
who they're very tuned in to classroom

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.970 
who they're very tuned in to classroom
needs<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:01.140> they<00:05:01.260> would<00:05:01.440> think<00:05:01.620> of<00:05:01.800> something

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
needs and they would think of something

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.860 
needs and they would think of something
like<00:05:02.100> this<00:05:02.400> yeah<00:05:02.760> cuz<00:05:03.060> that's<00:05:03.240> that's<00:05:03.630> really

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
like this yeah cuz that's that's really

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.360 
like this yeah cuz that's that's really
nice<00:05:04.140> hanging<00:05:05.010> up<00:05:05.490> right<00:05:05.760> that's<00:05:06.390> great<00:05:07.370> yeah

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
nice hanging up right that's great yeah

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.630 
nice hanging up right that's great yeah
so<00:05:09.000> whoa<00:05:10.310> yeah<00:05:11.310> how'd<00:05:11.760> I<00:05:11.790> do<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:13.490> that's<00:05:14.490> the

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
so whoa yeah how'd I do that that's the

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.990 
so whoa yeah how'd I do that that's the
formula<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.120> takes<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.480> put<00:05:15.630> that<00:05:16.700> um<00:05:17.700> do<00:05:17.940> you

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
formula it takes to put that um do you

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.180 
formula it takes to put that um do you
have<00:05:18.090> any<00:05:18.120> thoughts<00:05:18.510> on<00:05:18.750> them<00:05:19.050> on<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:19.710> clear

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
have any thoughts on them on the clear

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.030 
have any thoughts on them on the clear
plastic<00:05:21.170> protectors<00:05:22.170> I<00:05:23.420> really<00:05:24.420> haven't<00:05:24.570> seen

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
plastic protectors I really haven't seen

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.250 
plastic protectors I really haven't seen
the<00:05:26.040> need<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.520> have<00:05:26.730> them<00:05:26.970> if<00:05:27.540> anything<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.110> me

always<00:06:07.680> a<00:06:07.830> possibility<00:06:08.010> there's<00:06:08.520> always<00:06:08.640> a

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
always a possibility there's always a

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.410 
always a possibility there's always a
possibility<00:06:09.090> I<00:06:09.780> have<00:06:10.080> some<00:06:10.680> smaller<00:06:11.040> ones

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
possibility I have some smaller ones

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.420 
possibility I have some smaller ones
here<00:06:12.420> but<00:06:13.320> basically<00:06:13.440> they<00:06:13.920> follow<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.400> same

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
here but basically they follow the same

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.290 
here but basically they follow the same
principle<00:06:15.030> and<00:06:15.180> Abbey

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
other yeah this one actually uses a

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.800 
other yeah this one actually uses a
print<00:06:25.980> of<00:06:26.070> bacterial<00:06:26.610> plastic
