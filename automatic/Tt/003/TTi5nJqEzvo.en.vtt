colors in part two we're going to build
a<00:00:14.150> little<00:00:14.269> bit<00:00:14.389> on<00:00:14.509> some<00:00:14.870> of<00:00:14.960> the<00:00:15.049> concepts<00:00:15.440> we

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
a little bit on some of the concepts we

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.920 
a little bit on some of the concepts we
talked<00:00:15.919> about<00:00:16.070> in<00:00:16.340> part<00:00:16.550> 1<00:00:16.790> of<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:17.000> video<00:00:17.090> so

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
talked about in part 1 of the video so

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.929

channel and watch part 1 first let's

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.839 
channel and watch part 1 first let's
start<00:00:27.410> by<00:00:27.559> recapping<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:28.130> concept<00:00:28.640> that<00:00:28.730> we

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
start by recapping the concept that we

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.400 
start by recapping the concept that we
covered<00:00:29.180> in<00:00:29.270> part<00:00:29.480> 1<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:29.809> series<00:00:29.869> and

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
covered in part 1 of this series and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.530 
covered in part 1 of this series and
that<00:00:30.890> is<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.250> way<00:00:31.340> that<00:00:31.520> light<00:00:31.790> is<00:00:31.969> absorbed

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
that is the way that light is absorbed

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.569 
that is the way that light is absorbed
by<00:00:32.689> water<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.260> therefore<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.040> intensity<00:00:34.460> of

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
by water and therefore the intensity of

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.729 
by water and therefore the intensity of
colors<00:00:34.879> are<00:00:35.000> reduced<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:36.109> in<00:00:36.260> this<00:00:36.379> figure<00:00:36.559> you

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
colors are reduced so in this figure you

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.229 
colors are reduced so in this figure you
can<00:00:36.800> see<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.460> lures<00:00:37.730> that<00:00:37.850> are<00:00:37.969> above

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
can see that the lures that are above

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.470 
can see that the lures that are above
the<00:00:38.420> surface<00:00:38.629> at<00:00:39.320> 0<00:00:39.769> meters<00:00:40.010> receive<00:00:40.609> 100%<00:00:41.149> of

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
the surface at 0 meters receive 100% of

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.880 
the surface at 0 meters receive 100% of
the<00:00:41.539> daylight<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.079> so<00:00:42.260> they<00:00:42.589> have<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.739> hundred

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
the daylight and so they have a hundred

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.700 
the daylight and so they have a hundred
percent<00:00:43.129> of<00:00:43.519> their<00:00:44.149> color<00:00:44.390> intensity<00:00:44.899> but<00:00:45.559> by

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
percent of their color intensity but by

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.529 
percent of their color intensity but by
the<00:00:45.769> time<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:46.160> get<00:00:46.249> down<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.760> greater<00:00:47.239> depth

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
the time you get down to greater depth

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.899 
the time you get down to greater depth
around<00:00:47.719> about<00:00:48.079> 10<00:00:48.320> meters<00:00:48.679> or<00:00:48.829> 33<00:00:49.339> feet<00:00:49.609> under

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
around about 10 meters or 33 feet under

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:51.939 
around about 10 meters or 33 feet under
really<00:00:50.210> clear<00:00:50.449> conditions<00:00:50.659> the<00:00:51.530> amount<00:00:51.859> of

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
really clear conditions the amount of

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.250 
really clear conditions the amount of
light<00:00:52.249> that<00:00:52.280> has<00:00:52.609> received<00:00:52.999> that<00:00:53.480> depth<00:00:53.809> is

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
light that has received that depth is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.259 
light that has received that depth is
only<00:00:54.530> about<00:00:54.739> 22<00:00:55.309> percent<00:00:55.489> of<00:00:55.819> what<00:00:55.940> strikes

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
only about 22 percent of what strikes

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.599 
only about 22 percent of what strikes
the<00:00:56.420> surface<00:00:56.649> so<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.769> color<00:00:58.010> intensity<00:00:58.429> of

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
the surface so the color intensity of

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.069 
the surface so the color intensity of
the<00:00:58.670> lures<00:00:58.879> is<00:00:59.149> very<00:00:59.600> very<00:00:59.899> much<00:01:00.140> lower<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
the lures is very very much lower so the

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.229 
the lures is very very much lower so the
point<00:01:03.289> that<00:01:03.440> I'd<00:01:03.559> like<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.800> make<00:01:04.159> is<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.940> is<00:01:05.030> not

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
point that I'd like to make is it is not

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.180 
point that I'd like to make is it is not
actually<00:01:05.690> what<00:01:05.960> fish<00:01:06.229> are<00:01:06.380> capable<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:06.980> seeing

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
actually what fish are capable of seeing

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.700 
actually what fish are capable of seeing
not<00:01:07.430> what<00:01:07.640> their<00:01:07.790> eyes<00:01:07.940> can<00:01:08.390> see<00:01:08.810> but<00:01:09.560> it's

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
not what their eyes can see but it's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.320 
not what their eyes can see but it's
what's<00:01:09.950> available<00:01:10.310> for<00:01:10.730> them<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.850> see<00:01:11.120> that's

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
what's available for them to see that's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.420 
what's available for them to see that's
important<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.290> imagine<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:12.710> this<00:01:12.890> black<00:01:13.130> box

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
important so imagine that this black box

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.490 
important so imagine that this black box
represents<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.060> dark<00:01:14.270> room<00:01:14.510> and<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:15.440> are

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
represents a dark room and you and I are

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.300 
represents a dark room and you and I are
standing<00:01:16.010> in<00:01:16.100> it

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
standing in it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.770 
standing in it
and<00:01:16.520> if<00:01:16.700> I<00:01:16.820> were<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.970> ask<00:01:17.120> you<00:01:17.360> what<00:01:17.540> color

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
and if I were to ask you what color

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.540 
and if I were to ask you what color
shirt<00:01:18.080> I<00:01:18.260> was<00:01:18.410> wearing<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:19.190> wouldn't<00:01:19.400> be<00:01:19.460> able

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
shirt I was wearing you wouldn't be able

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.640 
shirt I was wearing you wouldn't be able
to<00:01:19.640> tell<00:01:19.850> me<00:01:20.030> is<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:20.900> because<00:01:21.320> your<00:01:21.530> eyes

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
to tell me is that because your eyes

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.710 
to tell me is that because your eyes
can't<00:01:22.220> see<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.640> color<00:01:22.820> or<00:01:23.180> is<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.480> because

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
can't see the color or is that because

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.600 
can't see the color or is that because
the<00:01:23.900> shirt<00:01:24.080> doesn't<00:01:24.230> have<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.500> color<00:01:24.740> no<00:01:25.040> of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
the shirt doesn't have a color no of

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.070 
the shirt doesn't have a color no of
course<00:01:25.910> not<00:01:26.060> it's<00:01:26.120> just<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:26.690> there's<00:01:26.900> not

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
course not it's just that there's not

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.630 
course not it's just that there's not
enough<00:01:27.290> light<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.130> appropriate

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
enough light of the appropriate

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.160 
enough light of the appropriate
wavelengths<00:01:29.180> present<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:29.990> room

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
wavelengths present in the room

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.410 
wavelengths present in the room
theorized<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.250> be<00:01:31.370> able<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.700> detect<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.270> so

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
theorized to be able to detect it so

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.630 
theorized to be able to detect it so
it's<00:01:33.140> what's<00:01:33.380> important<00:01:33.980> here<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.340> what<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
it's what's important here is what the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.910 
it's what's important here is what the
fish<00:01:34.820> are<00:01:35.000> able<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.510> see<00:01:35.780> because<00:01:36.050> it's<00:01:36.500> there

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
fish are able to see because it's there

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
fish are able to see because it's there
for<00:01:37.160> them<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.310> see

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.300 

now<00:01:41.110> bear<00:01:41.350> with<00:01:41.560> me<00:01:41.710> for<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.890> moment<00:01:42.010> or<00:01:42.280> two

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
now bear with me for a moment or two

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.440 
now bear with me for a moment or two
because<00:01:42.520> I'm<00:01:42.700> going<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:42.910> take<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.150> back<00:01:43.300> to

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
because I'm going to take you back to

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.150 
because I'm going to take you back to
your<00:01:43.510> junior<00:01:43.840> high<00:01:43.870> school<00:01:44.200> days<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:44.680> we're

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
your junior high school days and we're

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.950 
your junior high school days and we're
going<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.340> refresh<00:01:45.760> your<00:01:45.940> memory<00:01:46.000> on<00:01:46.330> how<00:01:46.810> it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
going to refresh your memory on how it

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.870 
going to refresh your memory on how it
is<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.470> human<00:01:47.800> eye<00:01:47.890> or<00:01:47.920> any<00:01:48.220> animals<00:01:48.550> I<00:01:48.670> for

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
is the human eye or any animals I for

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.690 
is the human eye or any animals I for
that<00:01:48.970> matter<00:01:49.150> detects<00:01:50.050> color<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:51.400> you<00:01:51.460> may

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
that matter detects color so you may

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.630 
that matter detects color so you may
remember<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.240> there<00:01:52.840> are<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:52.990> range<00:01:53.230> of

remember that there are a range of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.219 
remember that there are a range of
wavelengths<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.760> light<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:55.240> are<00:01:55.840> within<00:01:55.990> the

wavelengths of light at once it then

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.710 
wavelengths of light at once it then
makes<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> interpretation<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.360> object

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
makes the interpretation that the object

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.699 
makes the interpretation that the object
that<00:02:19.780> we're<00:02:19.930> looking<00:02:20.050> at<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:20.560> white<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
left hand side of this slide we've got a

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.360 
left hand side of this slide we've got a
light<00:02:25.510> source<00:02:25.840> that's<00:02:26.080> emitting<00:02:26.560> all<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.280> the

light source that's emitting all of the
wavelengths<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.850> visible<00:02:27.910> light<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:29.050> when

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
wavelengths of visible light and when

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.840 
wavelengths of visible light and when
those<00:02:29.350> wavelengths<00:02:29.680> bounce<00:02:30.310> off<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.610> an

those wavelengths bounce off of an
object<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.530> then<00:02:32.530> are<00:02:32.650> reflected<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.310> picked

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
object and then are reflected and picked

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.880 
object and then are reflected and picked
up<00:02:33.730> by<00:02:33.880> our<00:02:33.910> eye<00:02:34.090> then<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.170> eye<00:02:35.200> interprets

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
up by our eye then the eye interprets

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.860 
up by our eye then the eye interprets
that<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.400> object<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:37.000> being<00:02:37.239> white<00:02:39.720> now<00:02:40.720> if

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
that that object is being white now if

that that object is being white now if

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
the color of that object is red then all

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.880 
the color of that object is red then all
of<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.420> wavelengths<00:02:43.959> except<00:02:44.230> for<00:02:44.380> red<00:02:44.620> are

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
of the wavelengths except for red are

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.350 
of the wavelengths except for red are
absorbed<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:47.380> Reds<00:02:47.709> reflected<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.489> our<00:02:49.330> eye

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
absorbed the Reds reflected and our eye

absorbed the Reds reflected and our eye
interpreter<00:02:50.049> that<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.650> being<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.920> red<00:02:51.100> object

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
interpreter that is being a red object

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.620 
interpreter that is being a red object
if<00:02:53.769> it's<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.070> green<00:02:54.250> object<00:02:54.700> obviously<00:02:55.330> all<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
if it's a green object obviously all the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.030 
if it's a green object obviously all the
wavelengths<00:02:56.170> other<00:02:56.320> than<00:02:56.530> green<00:02:56.769> get

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
wavelengths other than green get

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.520 
wavelengths other than green get
absorbed<00:02:57.459> NRI<00:02:58.060> picks<00:02:59.049> up<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.320> green

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
absorbed NRI picks up the green

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.110 
absorbed NRI picks up the green
wavelengths<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.250> decides<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.850> it's<00:03:01.060> a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
wavelengths and decides that it's a

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.360 
wavelengths and decides that it's a
green<00:03:01.299> effect<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.799> so<00:03:02.920> forth<00:03:03.220> and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
green effect and so on and so forth and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.259 
green effect and so on and so forth and
we<00:03:03.430> can<00:03:03.549> go<00:03:03.640> through<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.940> whole<00:03:03.970> color

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
we can go through the whole color

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.850 
we can go through the whole color
spectrum<00:03:04.420> but<00:03:04.810> I'm<00:03:04.930> sure<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.440> idea

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
spectrum but I'm sure you get the idea

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.160 
spectrum but I'm sure you get the idea
now<00:03:06.190> obviously<00:03:06.760> we<00:03:06.940> don't<00:03:07.120> see<00:03:07.420> objects<00:03:08.140> that

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
now obviously we don't see objects that

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.070 
now obviously we don't see objects that
are<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.769> one<00:03:08.950> color<00:03:09.220> all<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.489> time<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:10.570> our

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
are just one color all the time so our

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.229 
are just one color all the time so our
eyes<00:03:11.410> has<00:03:11.799> that<00:03:11.980> spatial<00:03:12.340> component<00:03:13.000> as<00:03:13.060> well

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
eyes has that spatial component as well

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.610 
eyes has that spatial component as well
and<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.600> pick<00:03:13.810> up<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.380> red

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
and can pick up that this is a red

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.740 
and can pick up that this is a red
sphere<00:03:14.920> with<00:03:15.130> yellow<00:03:15.400> dots<00:03:15.610> because<00:03:15.850> we<00:03:16.600> get

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
sphere with yellow dots because we get

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.000 
sphere with yellow dots because we get
different<00:03:17.080> wavelengths<00:03:17.500> reflected<00:03:17.920> from

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
different wavelengths reflected from

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.259 
different wavelengths reflected from
different<00:03:18.430> parts<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> object<00:03:21.060> okay<00:03:22.060> let's

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
different parts of the object okay let's

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.090 
different parts of the object okay let's
get<00:03:22.420> under<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.720> important<00:03:23.170> stuff<00:03:23.380> what

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
get under the important stuff what

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.770 
get under the important stuff what
happens<00:03:24.430> when<00:03:24.640> we<00:03:24.730> shine<00:03:24.910> white<00:03:25.269> light<00:03:25.299> with

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
happens when we shine white light with

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.300 
happens when we shine white light with
all<00:03:25.900> its<00:03:26.049> various<00:03:26.380> wavelengths<00:03:26.590> into<00:03:27.130> water

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
all its various wavelengths into water

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.460 
all its various wavelengths into water
and<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:28.239> very<00:03:28.420> interesting<00:03:28.930> thing<00:03:29.080> we<00:03:29.200> find

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and the very interesting thing we find

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.870 
and the very interesting thing we find
is<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:29.769> some<00:03:30.160> wavelengths<00:03:30.730> are<00:03:30.820> absorbed

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
is that some wavelengths are absorbed

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.060 
is that some wavelengths are absorbed
faster<00:03:31.420> than<00:03:31.750> others<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.680> longer

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
faster than others so the longer

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.440 
faster than others so the longer
wavelengths<00:03:33.640> like<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.910> Reds<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.360> the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
wavelengths like the Reds and the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.240 
wavelengths like the Reds and the
oranges<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.840> yellows<00:03:35.260> are<00:03:35.500> absorbed<00:03:35.950> much

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
oranges and yellows are absorbed much

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.130 
oranges and yellows are absorbed much
earlier<00:03:36.640> in<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.850> water<00:03:37.000> column<00:03:37.269> than<00:03:37.959> the

earlier in the water column than the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.560

greens<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.709> Blues<00:03:38.920> are<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:40.299> under

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
greens and the Blues are so under

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.850 
greens and the Blues are so under

so what does all this mean in terms of

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.570 
so what does all this mean in terms of
how<00:04:36.210> fish<00:04:36.660> can<00:04:36.900> see<00:04:37.110> lure<00:04:37.350> colors<00:04:37.740> well<00:04:38.400> let's

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
how fish can see lure colors well let's

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.130 
how fish can see lure colors well let's
use<00:04:38.790> this<00:04:38.940> color<00:04:39.210> for<00:04:39.360> dog<00:04:39.540> I<00:04:39.690> don't<00:04:39.810> think

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
use this color for dog I don't think

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.510 
use this color for dog I don't think
anyone<00:04:40.440> would<00:04:40.530> actually<00:04:40.800> paint<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.160> lure<00:04:41.310> this

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
anyone would actually paint a lure this

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.030 
anyone would actually paint a lure this
color<00:04:41.790> but<00:04:42.510> let's<00:04:42.750> use<00:04:42.990> him<00:04:43.110> as<00:04:43.260> an<00:04:43.380> example<00:04:43.710> so

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
color but let's use him as an example so

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.680 
color but let's use him as an example so
if<00:04:44.190> we<00:04:44.340> shine<00:04:44.580> white<00:04:44.910> light<00:04:44.940> on<00:04:45.330> him<00:04:45.450> with<00:04:45.570> all

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
if we shine white light on him with all

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.350 
if we shine white light on him with all
its<00:04:45.840> various<00:04:46.169> wavelengths<00:04:46.730> we<00:04:47.730> can<00:04:47.760> see<00:04:48.150> that

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
its various wavelengths we can see that

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.909 
its various wavelengths we can see that
those<00:04:48.510> wavelengths<00:04:48.810> reflect<00:04:49.410> off<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.800> that's

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
those wavelengths reflect off and that's

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.770 
those wavelengths reflect off and that's
what<00:04:50.130> enables<00:04:50.610> our<00:04:50.730> eye<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.940> perceive<00:04:51.540> those

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
what enables our eye to perceive those

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.980 
what enables our eye to perceive those
colors<00:04:52.169> but<00:04:52.890> if<00:04:53.010> we<00:04:53.160> drop<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.430> lid<00:04:53.850> down<00:04:54.030> into

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
colors but if we drop that lid down into

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.390 
colors but if we drop that lid down into
the<00:04:55.080> water<00:04:55.290> column<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.620> little<00:04:55.650> bit<00:04:55.980> so<00:04:56.370> let's

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
the water column a little bit so let's

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.130 
the water column a little bit so let's
drop<00:04:56.700> him<00:04:56.850> down<00:04:57.030> into<00:04:57.240> a<00:04:57.330> freshwater<00:04:57.600> lake<00:04:57.840> to

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
drop him down into a freshwater lake to

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.960 
drop him down into a freshwater lake to
a<00:04:58.169> depth<00:04:58.380> of<00:04:58.470> around<00:04:58.740> about<00:04:58.950> five<00:04:59.640> or<00:04:59.820> six

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
a depth of around about five or six

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.909 
a depth of around about five or six
meters<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.510> you<00:05:01.020> see<00:05:01.200> that<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.560> red

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
meters and you see that the red

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.890 
meters and you see that the red
wavelengths<00:05:02.190> are<00:05:02.880> starting<00:05:03.270> to<00:05:03.360> be<00:05:03.480> absorbed

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
wavelengths are starting to be absorbed

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.300 
wavelengths are starting to be absorbed
so<00:05:03.990> there's<00:05:04.169> no<00:05:04.260> red<00:05:04.500> wavelengths<00:05:05.070> here<00:05:05.190> to

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
so there's no red wavelengths here to

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.909 
so there's no red wavelengths here to
reflect<00:05:05.700> off<00:05:05.910> for<00:05:06.660> our<00:05:06.750> eye<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:06.930> then<00:05:07.410> pick<00:05:07.770> up

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
reflect off for our eye to then pick up

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.370 
reflect off for our eye to then pick up
and<00:05:08.190> interpret<00:05:08.669> as<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.790> red<00:05:09.000> color<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:09.930> those

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
and interpret as a red color so those

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.620 
and interpret as a red color so those
parts<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.950> lure<00:05:11.100> that<00:05:11.190> are<00:05:11.400> red<00:05:11.630> suddenly

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
parts of the lure that are red suddenly

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
yellows would start to disappear and so

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.400 
yellows would start to disappear and so
on<00:05:35.729> and<00:05:35.970> so<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.570> when<00:05:36.750> you<00:05:36.780> get<00:05:36.930> down<00:05:37.169> to

dark blues disappear so the largest

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.730 
dark blues disappear so the largest
appears<00:05:42.360> gray<00:05:42.750> to<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:43.050> fish<00:05:43.200> at<00:05:43.350> that<00:05:43.470> depth

appears gray to the fish at that depth

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.230 
appears gray to the fish at that depth
regardless<00:05:44.430> of<00:05:44.520> what<00:05:44.640> colors<00:05:44.940> has<00:05:45.060> been

regardless of what colors has been

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.140 
regardless of what colors has been
painted<00:05:46.669> so<00:05:47.669> let's<00:05:47.850> put<00:05:48.000> all<00:05:48.030> that

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
painted so let's put all that

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.760 
painted so let's put all that
information<00:05:48.750> up<00:05:48.840> on<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.020> screen<00:05:49.110> at<00:05:49.470> the<00:05:49.530> same

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
information up on the screen at the same

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.670 
information up on the screen at the same
time<00:05:50.040> so<00:05:50.790> you<00:05:50.850> can<00:05:51.030> see<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.330> same<00:05:51.570> lure<00:05:51.870> at

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
time so you can see the same lure at

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.500 
time so you can see the same lure at
those<00:05:52.890> various<00:05:53.250> depths<00:05:53.520> looks<00:05:53.880> very<00:05:54.270> very

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
those various depths looks very very

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.360 
those various depths looks very very
different<00:05:54.660> because<00:05:55.260> a<00:05:55.710> lot<00:05:55.919> of<00:05:55.950> the<00:05:56.070> colors

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
different because a lot of the colors

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.620 
different because a lot of the colors
have<00:05:56.460> disappeared<00:05:57.000> by<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.150> time<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.540> gets

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
have disappeared by the time it gets

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.390 
have disappeared by the time it gets
down<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:57.930> a<00:05:58.410> great<00:05:58.590> depth<00:05:58.830> so<00:05:58.979> really<00:05:59.310> it

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
down to a great depth so really it

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.710 
down to a great depth so really it
doesn't<00:05:59.640> matter<00:05:59.820> what<00:06:00.090> color<00:06:00.300> you've<00:06:00.539> painted

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
doesn't matter what color you've painted

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.810 
doesn't matter what color you've painted
your<00:06:00.960> lure<00:06:01.140> if<00:06:01.919> it's<00:06:02.160> swimming<00:06:02.400> around<00:06:02.580> about

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
your lure if it's swimming around about

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.029 
your lure if it's swimming around about
that<00:06:02.970> 35<00:06:03.479> 40<00:06:03.900> meter<00:06:04.080> mark

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
that 35 40 meter mark

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.600 
that 35 40 meter mark
then<00:06:05.159> all<00:06:05.309> the<00:06:05.430> Fischer<00:06:05.729> gotta<00:06:05.879> see<00:06:06.089> is<00:06:06.240> great

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
then all the Fischer gotta see is great

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.399 
then all the Fischer gotta see is great
right<00:06:08.610> well<00:06:08.849> the<00:06:08.969> obvious<00:06:09.150> question<00:06:09.900> is<00:06:10.050> how

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
right well the obvious question is how

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.469 
right well the obvious question is how
can<00:06:10.619> I<00:06:10.710> use<00:06:11.039> as<00:06:11.189> information<00:06:11.789> to<00:06:12.180> help<00:06:12.389> me

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
can I use as information to help me

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.790 
can I use as information to help me
choose<00:06:12.719> the<00:06:12.930> right<00:06:13.110> lure<00:06:13.319> color<00:06:13.589> for<00:06:13.770> a

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
choose the right lure color for a

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.879 
choose the right lure color for a
particular<00:06:14.039> fishing<00:06:14.490> situation<00:06:15.680> so<00:06:16.680> it's<00:06:16.830> a

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
particular fishing situation so it's a

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.709 
particular fishing situation so it's a
case<00:06:17.069> of<00:06:17.129> knowing<00:06:17.639> when<00:06:17.909> a<00:06:17.939> particular<00:06:18.330> lure

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:18.719 
case of knowing when a particular lure

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:20.209 
case of knowing when a particular lure
color<00:06:19.020> can<00:06:19.199> actually<00:06:19.439> be<00:06:19.589> important<00:06:20.009> when<00:06:20.129> it

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
color can actually be important when it

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:21.920 
color can actually be important when it
can<00:06:20.309> be<00:06:20.339> seen<00:06:20.639> by<00:06:20.789> the<00:06:20.849> fish<00:06:21.059> and<00:06:21.330> what<00:06:21.809> we

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
can be seen by the fish and what we

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.480 
can be seen by the fish and what we
found<00:06:22.169> in<00:06:22.409> this<00:06:22.529> presentation<00:06:23.039> is<00:06:23.279> that<00:06:23.339> a

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
found in this presentation is that a

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.859 
found in this presentation is that a
long<00:06:23.669> wavelength<00:06:23.939> light<00:06:24.479> doesn't<00:06:24.749> penetrate

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:24.869 
long wavelength light doesn't penetrate

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:26.929 
long wavelength light doesn't penetrate
very<00:06:25.409> deeply<00:06:25.499> evening<00:06:26.279> to<00:06:26.369> really<00:06:26.729> really

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:26.939 
very deeply evening to really really

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:29.359 
very deeply evening to really really
clear<00:06:27.270> water<00:06:27.509> under<00:06:27.749> perfect<00:06:28.139> conditions<00:06:28.369> and

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:29.369 
clear water under perfect conditions and

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:31.070 
clear water under perfect conditions and
that<00:06:29.610> means<00:06:29.819> that<00:06:29.939> red<00:06:30.149> and<00:06:30.270> orange<00:06:30.569> can't<00:06:30.930> be

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
that means that red and orange can't be

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.809 
that means that red and orange can't be
seen<00:06:31.349> at<00:06:31.529> that's<00:06:31.710> much<00:06:31.979> beyond<00:06:32.309> about<00:06:32.520> 10

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
seen at that's much beyond about 10

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.670 
seen at that's much beyond about 10
meters<00:06:33.149> deep<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:33.539> in<00:06:34.020> most<00:06:34.229> fresh<00:06:34.469> water

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
meters deep and in most fresh water

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.399 
meters deep and in most fresh water
systems<00:06:35.069> it'll<00:06:35.339> be<00:06:35.399> much<00:06:35.580> less<00:06:35.879> than<00:06:35.909> that<00:06:36.409> so

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
systems it'll be much less than that so

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:38.689 
systems it'll be much less than that so
you<00:06:37.469> should<00:06:37.649> avoid<00:06:37.889> using<00:06:38.309> reds<00:06:38.490> and<00:06:38.580> oranges

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
you should avoid using reds and oranges

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.549 
you should avoid using reds and oranges
on<00:06:39.089> your<00:06:39.240> lures<00:06:39.419> if<00:06:39.689> you<00:06:39.809> intend<00:06:40.139> to<00:06:40.169> fish<00:06:40.409> them
