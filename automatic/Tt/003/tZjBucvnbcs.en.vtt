for<00:00:02.070> triangle<00:00:02.610> universe<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.959> design<00:00:04.319> starts

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
for triangle universe this design starts

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.369 
for triangle universe this design starts
on<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:04.920> center<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.400> your<00:00:05.549> quilting<00:00:06.060> space<00:00:06.390> and

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
on the center of your quilting space and

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.370 
on the center of your quilting space and
it<00:00:07.500> starts<00:00:07.859> with<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.309> large<00:00:08.840> triangular<00:00:09.840> shaped

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
it starts with a large triangular shaped

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.919 
it starts with a large triangular shaped
spiral<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.150> start<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.750> center

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
spiral so you start in the center

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.950 
spiral so you start in the center
creating<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.740> triangle<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.639> keep<00:00:14.960> spraying

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
creating a triangle you keep spraying

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.359 
creating a triangle you keep spraying
out<00:00:16.560> stitching<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.550> line<00:00:17.820> longer<00:00:18.660> and

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
out stitching that line longer and

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.519 
out stitching that line longer and
swirling<00:00:20.369> around<00:00:20.930> until<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.050> get<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
swirling around until you get to the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.340 
swirling around until you get to the
edges<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.250> your<00:00:23.279> quilting<00:00:23.789> space<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:25.230> you

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
edges of your quilting space and if you

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.529 
edges of your quilting space and if you
have<00:00:25.529> trouble<00:00:25.859> keeping<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.519> triangle<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
have trouble keeping this triangle the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.230 
have trouble keeping this triangle the
lines<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.199> straight<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.890> even<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:30.029> mark

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
lines of it straight and even just mark

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.600 
lines of it straight and even just mark
it<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.689> absolutely<00:00:31.410> no<00:00:31.560> big<00:00:31.800> deal<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
it it's absolutely no big deal just to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.209 
it it's absolutely no big deal just to
take<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> small<00:00:33.510> ruler<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.140> Mark<00:00:34.770> these<00:00:34.980> lines

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
take a small ruler and Mark these lines

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.979 
take a small ruler and Mark these lines
to<00:00:35.460> make<00:00:35.640> sure<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.090> straight<00:00:36.420> straight

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
to make sure that they straight straight

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.860 
to make sure that they straight straight
and<00:00:37.200> even<00:00:37.680> now<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.969> second<00:00:39.480> part<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
and even now the second part of the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.010 
and even now the second part of the
design<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.670> two<00:00:41.910> steps<00:00:42.149> first

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
design is actually in two steps first

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.590 
design is actually in two steps first
you're<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.649> stitch<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.160> echo<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.879> your

you're going to stitch an echo of your
baseline<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.379> starting<00:00:46.890> line<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.690> then

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
baseline of your starting line and then

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.959 
baseline of your starting line and then
you're<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> stitch<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.860> between<00:00:50.610> kind

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you're going to stitch in between kind

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.600 
you're going to stitch in between kind
of<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.270> wide<00:00:51.870> channel<00:00:52.500> between<00:00:53.100> your

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
of in that wide channel between your

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.330 
of in that wide channel between your
foundational<00:00:54.360> line<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.440> echo<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.920> just

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
foundational line and that echo you just

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.950 
foundational line and that echo you just
stitched<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.879> you're<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> stitch

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
stitched and you're going to stitch

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.979 
stitched and you're going to stitch
small<00:00:58.500> triangles<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.699> simply<00:00:59.989> bouncing

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
small triangles just simply bouncing

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.470 
small triangles just simply bouncing
from<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.770> top<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.460> area<00:01:02.879> down<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
from the top of one area down to the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.109 
from the top of one area down to the
bottom<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> other<00:01:04.290> back<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.220> forth<00:01:05.580> until

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
bottom of the other back and forth until

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.899 
bottom of the other back and forth until
you<00:01:07.049> filled<00:01:07.350> an<00:01:07.500> entire<00:01:07.619> channel<00:01:08.400> with

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you filled an entire channel with

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.780 
you filled an entire channel with
smaller<00:01:09.390> triangles<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
smaller triangles so it really is a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.789 
smaller triangles so it really is a
triangle<00:01:12.210> universe<00:01:12.840> because<00:01:13.380> you've<00:01:13.619> got

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
triangle universe because you've got

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.100 
triangle universe because you've got
this<00:01:13.979> large<00:01:14.310> triangle<00:01:14.760> shaped<00:01:15.360> spiral<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
this large triangle shaped spiral and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.469 
this large triangle shaped spiral and
little<00:01:16.830> triangles<00:01:17.400> stitched<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
little triangles stitched up in the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.469 
little triangles stitched up in the
channels<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.110> between<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.180> see

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
channels in between so here you can see

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.230 
channels in between so here you can see
I'm<00:01:21.600> filling<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.140> bit<00:01:22.380> more<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.400> triangle

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
I'm filling a bit more of this triangle

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.780 
I'm filling a bit more of this triangle
channel<00:01:24.990> area<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.770> I've<00:01:26.159> stitched<00:01:26.400> all<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
channel area and I've stitched all the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.390 
channel area and I've stitched all the
way<00:01:26.909> into<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.299> center<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:28.229> these<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
way into the center with these and it's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
way into the center with these and it's
just<00:01:29.729> simply<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> matter<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> bouncing<00:01:31.079> back

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
just simply a matter of bouncing back

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.310 
just simply a matter of bouncing back
and<00:01:31.470> forth<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:33.000> perfectly<00:01:33.270> honest<00:01:34.079> it's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
and forth to be perfectly honest it's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.859 
and forth to be perfectly honest it's
actually<00:01:35.130> easier<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> stitch<00:01:36.150> these<00:01:36.390> small

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
actually easier to stitch these small

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.590 
actually easier to stitch these small
tiny<00:01:37.320> triangles<00:01:38.130> within<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.119> nice<00:01:39.390> little

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
tiny triangles within this nice little

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.810 
tiny triangles within this nice little
channel<00:01:40.259> than<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.189> stitch<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
channel than it is to stitch the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.600 
channel than it is to stitch the
starting<00:01:42.360> triangular<00:01:43.110> shape<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.340> main

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
starting triangular shape the main

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.149 
starting triangular shape the main
reason<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.329> when<00:01:46.049> something<00:01:46.259> small<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
reason is when something small and

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.100 
reason is when something small and
complex<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.390> eye<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.780> going

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
complex like this your eye is not going

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.469 
complex like this your eye is not going
to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.290> caught<00:01:49.560> by<00:01:49.860> mistakes<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:51.090> that

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
to be caught by mistakes I know that

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.109 
to be caught by mistakes I know that
might<00:01:51.659> seem<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> little<00:01:52.110> counterintuitive<00:01:53.119> but

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
might seem a little counterintuitive but

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.569 
might seem a little counterintuitive but
whenever<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.750> something<00:01:55.049> big<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.950> it's

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
whenever you have something big if it's

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.670 
whenever you have something big if it's
Wiggly<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.360> wobbly<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.259> doesn't<00:01:58.500> look

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
Wiggly and wobbly and it doesn't look

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.530 
Wiggly and wobbly and it doesn't look
like<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.040> meant<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.820> be<00:02:00.030> Wiggly<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
like you meant for it to be Wiggly and
