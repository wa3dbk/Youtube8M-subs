painted<00:02:22.050> sometimes<00:02:23.040> human<00:02:23.400> hair<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.670> actually

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
painted sometimes human hair is actually

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.160 
painted sometimes human hair is actually
a<00:02:24.060> little<00:02:24.209> too<00:02:24.300> soft

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
a little too soft

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.250 
a little too soft
making<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> foundation<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.880> wig<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.420> sewing

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
making the foundation of a wig is sewing

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.870 
making the foundation of a wig is sewing
a<00:02:28.440> lot<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> techniques<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:29.430> use<00:02:29.520> are

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
a lot of the techniques that we use are

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.280 
a lot of the techniques that we use are
similar<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> techniques<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.810> Draper<00:02:31.050> who

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
similar to the techniques of Draper who

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.559 
similar to the techniques of Draper who
makes<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.680> pattern<00:02:32.190> for<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.520> costume<00:02:33.030> might<00:02:33.239> make

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
makes a pattern for a costume might make

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.470 
makes a pattern for a costume might make
the<00:02:34.530> actual<00:02:34.739> tying<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.580> hair<00:02:35.790> into<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> wig

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the actual tying the hair into the wig

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.080 
the actual tying the hair into the wig
is<00:02:36.840> probably<00:02:37.590> most<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.190> latch<00:02:38.489> hooking<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
is probably most like latch hooking a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.260 
is probably most like latch hooking a
rug<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:40.319> tool<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.340> little<00:02:41.520> bit<00:02:41.880> different

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
rug the tool is a little bit different

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.100 
rug the tool is a little bit different
but<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.450> technique<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.900> tying<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.620> knot<00:02:43.950> is

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
but the technique of tying the knot is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.500 
but the technique of tying the knot is
essentially<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.260> same

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.600 

when<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.780> wig<00:02:51.080> is<00:02:51.200> finished<00:02:51.470> being<00:02:51.650> built<00:02:51.680> the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
when a wig is finished being built the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.490 
when a wig is finished being built the
next<00:02:52.849> step<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.239> style<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.049> we<00:02:54.260> can<00:02:54.409> do

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
next step is to style it and we can do

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.839 
next step is to style it and we can do
that<00:02:54.620> in<00:02:54.769> a<00:02:54.829> lot<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:54.980> different<00:02:55.159> ways<00:02:55.430> we<00:02:55.700> can

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
that in a lot of different ways we can

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.399 
that in a lot of different ways we can
style<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.569> with<00:02:56.689> a<00:02:56.720> curling<00:02:57.019> iron

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
style it with a curling iron

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.100 
style it with a curling iron
sometimes<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.459> haircut<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.480> sometimes

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
sometimes like haircut and sometimes

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.170 
sometimes like haircut and sometimes
that<00:03:00.230> needs<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:00.470> be<00:03:00.530> sent<00:03:00.769> on<00:03:00.829> rollers<00:03:01.310> okay<00:03:02.120> so

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
that needs to be sent on rollers okay so

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.610 
that needs to be sent on rollers okay so
now<00:03:02.360> I'm<00:03:02.480> ready<00:03:02.659> to<00:03:02.720> brush<00:03:02.959> through<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:05.620> this

now I'm ready to brush through this this

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.280 
now I'm ready to brush through this this

week is supposed to look messy like
she's<00:03:09.560> put<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:09.890> up<00:03:09.980> very<00:03:10.099> quickly<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.879> she's

she's put it up very quickly and she's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.339 
she's put it up very quickly and she's
not<00:03:12.290> in<00:03:12.440> her<00:03:12.590> right<00:03:12.739> mind<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:14.690> I'm<00:03:14.959> pretty<00:03:15.140> much

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.320 

maybe<00:03:50.100> we<00:03:50.280> should<00:03:50.430> start<00:03:50.640> by<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:50.940> cutting<00:03:51.150> a

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
maybe we should start by just cutting a

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.430 
maybe we should start by just cutting a
little<00:03:51.420> off<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.690> length<00:03:54.020> this<00:03:55.020> is<00:03:55.080> a<00:03:55.230> very

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
little off the length this is a very

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.990 
little off the length this is a very
strange<00:03:55.650> feeling<00:03:55.890> because<00:03:56.100> it's<00:03:56.400> like<00:03:56.550> about

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
strange feeling because it's like about

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.340 
strange feeling because it's like about
your<00:03:57.120> hair<00:03:58.670> looks<00:03:59.670> great<00:04:00.000> yeah<00:04:00.390> once<00:04:01.080> we<00:04:01.170> get

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
your hair looks great yeah once we get

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
the wigs on stage now we're gonna have a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.610 
the wigs on stage now we're gonna have a
wig<00:04:08.190> fitting<00:04:08.430> with<00:04:09.150> Brian<00:04:09.540> Keene<00:04:09.989> who<00:04:10.320> plays

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
wig fitting with Brian Keene who plays

wig fitting with Brian Keene who plays
Mitch<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.520> streetcar<00:04:11.880> hold<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.959> very<00:04:13.170> front

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
Mitch in streetcar hold the very front

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.110 
Mitch in streetcar hold the very front
of<00:04:13.590> this<00:04:13.739> yeah<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.220> would<00:04:14.489> probably<00:04:14.820> start

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
of this yeah I would probably start

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.340 
of this yeah I would probably start
there<00:04:15.330> just<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.510> little<00:04:15.540> further<00:04:15.840> forward<00:04:16.200> than

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
there just a little further forward than

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.949 
there just a little further forward than
we<00:04:16.650> think<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.549> then<00:04:17.669> we'll<00:04:17.820> slide<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.120> back

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
we think it and then we'll slide it back

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.550 
we think it and then we'll slide it back
I<00:04:18.989> left<00:04:19.590> sideburns<00:04:20.280> on<00:04:20.459> here<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.380> think<00:04:22.380> we

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
I left sideburns on here I think we

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.260 
I left sideburns on here I think we
could<00:04:22.860> end<00:04:23.070> up<00:04:23.220> just<00:04:23.280> cutting<00:04:24.060> them<00:04:24.180> off

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
could end up just cutting them off

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.850 
could end up just cutting them off
completely<00:04:24.720> looking<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.260> think<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.710> means
