00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
didn't before two things you have a box

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.420 
didn't before two things you have a box
and<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.940> have<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.180> circle<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:41.769> box<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.280> for

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.940 
and you have a circle the box is for
focus<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.540> can<00:02:43.840> move<00:02:44.079> that<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.560> spot

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
there and then in the bottom left you'll

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.680 
there and then in the bottom left you'll
see<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.109> square<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.859> a<00:03:00.130> circle<00:03:00.280> icon<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.209> you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690

can push the circle icon it goes red and

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.050 
can push the circle icon it goes red and
that<00:03:05.019> means<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:05.500> blocked<00:03:05.859> you<00:03:06.609> do<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.820> exact
