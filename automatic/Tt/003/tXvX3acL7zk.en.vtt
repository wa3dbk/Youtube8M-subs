I can pretty much give you a quick

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.799 
I can pretty much give you a quick
rundown<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.980> how<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> went<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> new<00:00:45.629> one

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
rundown and how it went with the new one

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.520 
rundown and how it went with the new one
in<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.320> walk<00:00:46.829> over<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> my<00:00:47.460> bike<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
in so walk over here to my bike and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.520 
in so walk over here to my bike and
here's<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> new<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
here's the new one and this is the this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.220 
here's the new one and this is the this
is<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> old<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.629> this<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> guess<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
is the old one this one I guess the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.040 
is the old one this one I guess the
grooves<00:00:55.559> wear<00:00:55.829> out<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.899> know

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
grooves wear out in this and you know

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.349 
grooves wear out in this and you know
goes<00:00:58.559> right<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.820> doesn't<00:01:00.059> put

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
goes right in here and it doesn't put

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.490 
goes right in here and it doesn't put
enough<00:01:00.570> pressure<00:01:00.719> against<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> cam<00:01:01.469> chain

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
enough pressure against the cam chain

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.579 
enough pressure against the cam chain
tensioner<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.719> doesn't<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.930> know<00:01:04.019> les<00:01:04.320> flops

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
tensioner and doesn't you know les flops

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.399 
tensioner and doesn't you know les flops
around<00:01:04.739> mine<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:06.290> 5500<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
around mine was doing it at 5500 to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.450 
around mine was doing it at 5500 to
$6,000<00:01:08.100> range<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:09.420> annoying<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
$6,000 range really annoying so this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.640 
$6,000 range really annoying so this
came<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.540> eight<00:01:12.720> mill<00:01:12.900> bolts<00:01:13.320> bolts

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
