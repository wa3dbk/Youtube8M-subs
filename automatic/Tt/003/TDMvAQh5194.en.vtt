battery grip which isn't actually as
heavy<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> original<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
heavy as the original one because the

heavy as the original one because the
original<00:01:38.159> ones<00:01:38.280> made<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.729> metal<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
original ones made out of metal the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.580 
original ones made out of metal the
third-party<00:01:39.780> ones<00:01:39.990> are<00:01:40.170> made<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.439> plastic

third-party ones are made out of plastic

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.639 
third-party ones are made out of plastic
but<00:01:41.060> having<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.090> battery<00:01:42.509> grip<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:42.899> with

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
but having that battery grip there with

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.590 
but having that battery grip there with
the<00:01:43.740> extra<00:01:44.070> battery<00:01:44.220> did<00:01:44.670> add<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.149> lot<00:01:45.570> of

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the extra battery did add a lot of

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.560 
the extra battery did add a lot of
weight<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.890> 5d<00:01:47.189> mark<00:01:47.369> ii<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.880> itself<00:01:48.390> is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
weight and the 5d mark ii in itself is

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440 
weight and the 5d mark ii in itself is
already<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.930> huge<00:01:49.290> camera<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.210> need

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
already a huge camera you know you need

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.800 
already a huge camera you know you need
big<00:01:51.810> hands<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.259> hold<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.619> well<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.540> yeah<00:01:54.689> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
big hands to hold it well and yeah it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.749 
big hands to hold it well and yeah it
was<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.110> big<00:01:55.290> setup<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.979> general<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
was just a big setup in in general so I

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.520 
was just a big setup in in general so I
eventually<00:01:57.240> took<00:01:57.600> off<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> battery<00:01:58.140> grip<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
eventually took off the battery grip and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.560 
eventually took off the battery grip and
I<00:01:58.680> went<00:01:58.890> without<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.219> battery<00:01:59.460> grip<00:01:59.670> for<00:02:00.119> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
I went without the battery grip for you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.100 
I went without the battery grip for you
know<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.869> until<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.860> until<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.460> decided<00:02:03.210> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
know up until up until I I decided to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.660 
know up until up until I I decided to
sell<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> camera<00:02:05.299> but<00:02:06.299> now<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:07.710> wait<00:02:08.550> I'll

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
sell the camera but now so wait I'll

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.150 
sell the camera but now so wait I'll
just<00:02:08.849> go<00:02:08.940> back<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.300> with<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.599> big<00:02:09.780> cameras<00:02:10.229> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
just go back so with the big cameras I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.800 
just go back so with the big cameras I
generally<00:02:11.760> didn't<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.300> battery<00:02:12.540> up<00:02:12.690> now

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
generally didn't like the battery up now

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.510 
generally didn't like the battery up now
if<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.020> was<00:02:13.140> doing<00:02:13.260> professional<00:02:13.950> photography

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
if I was doing professional photography

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760 
if I was doing professional photography
so<00:02:15.300> if<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.510> was<00:02:15.630> like<00:02:15.750> covering<00:02:16.020> events<00:02:16.290> and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
so if I was like covering events and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.530 
so if I was like covering events and
getting<00:02:17.310> paid<00:02:17.460> for<00:02:17.640> my<00:02:17.760> work<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.390> would

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
getting paid for my work I think I would

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.620 
getting paid for my work I think I would
definitely<00:02:18.900> use<00:02:19.350> drip<00:02:19.740> bodies<00:02:20.210> no<00:02:21.210> question

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
definitely use drip bodies no question

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.050 
definitely use drip bodies no question
just<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.930> have<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.230> extra<00:02:22.700> extra<00:02:23.700> battery

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
just to have that extra extra battery

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.530 
just to have that extra extra battery
there<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:26.250> vertical<00:02:26.520> orientation<00:02:26.790> you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
there and the vertical orientation you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.090 
there and the vertical orientation you
know<00:02:27.630> just<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:28.050> when<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.320> need<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.980> then

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
know just for when I need it and then

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.890 
know just for when I need it and then
I'd<00:02:29.340> still<00:02:29.670> have<00:02:29.850> extra<00:02:30.240> batteries<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.750> my

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
I'd still have extra batteries in my

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.460 
I'd still have extra batteries in my
pockets<00:02:31.290> at<00:02:31.380> all<00:02:31.530> times<00:02:31.770> just<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.280> make<00:02:32.310> sure

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
pockets at all times just to make sure

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.690 
pockets at all times just to make sure
so<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:34.980> that's<00:02:35.100> my<00:02:35.280> take<00:02:35.490> with<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
so you know that's my take with the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.610 
so you know that's my take with the
bigger<00:02:35.940> camera<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.630> 5d<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.230> really

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
bigger camera so with the 5d I really

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.750 
bigger camera so with the 5d I really
didn't<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:37.950> using<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.400> battery<00:02:38.550> grip

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
didn't like using the battery grip

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.910 
didn't like using the battery grip
because<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.450> extra<00:02:39.930> waking<00:02:40.260> weight<00:02:40.680> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
because of the extra waking weight and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.270 
because of the extra waking weight and
extra<00:02:41.160> bulk<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.700> added<00:02:43.040> because<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.070> was

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
extra bulk that it added because I was

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.800 
extra bulk that it added because I was
mainly<00:02:44.790> using<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.210> general<00:02:45.450> work<00:02:45.600> but

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
mainly using it for general work but

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.060 
mainly using it for general work but
with<00:02:45.930> professional<00:02:46.410> work<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.740> would

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
with professional work I would

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.890 
with professional work I would
definitely<00:02:47.430> use<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.700> battery<00:02:47.940> grip<00:02:48.090> now<00:02:48.270> I've

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
definitely use the battery grip now I've

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.030 
definitely use the battery grip now I've
been<00:02:49.020> using<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.550> t3i<00:02:50.550> for<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.880> while<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:51.180> and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
been using the t3i for a while now and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.710 
been using the t3i for a while now and
this<00:02:53.040> particular<00:02:53.640> battery<00:02:53.940> grip<00:02:54.210> on<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.570> is

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
this particular battery grip on it is

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.450 
this particular battery grip on it is
actually<00:02:55.080> my<00:02:55.200> roommate's<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.740> don't<00:02:55.890> have<00:02:56.100> I

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
actually my roommate's I don't have I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.830 
actually my roommate's I don't have I
don't<00:02:56.580> own<00:02:56.940> own<00:02:57.780> one<00:02:58.080> forma<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.830> my<00:02:58.950> cameras

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
don't own own one forma for my cameras

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.930 
don't own own one forma for my cameras
but<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:01.020> this<00:03:01.260> camera<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:02.010> doesn't<00:03:02.370> really<00:03:02.790> add

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
but on this camera it doesn't really add

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.110 
but on this camera it doesn't really add
that<00:03:03.420> much<00:03:04.080> weight<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:05.310> even<00:03:05.910> with<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
that much weight and this even with the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
that much weight and this even with the
battery<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.540> feels<00:03:06.900> lighter<00:03:07.860> than<00:03:08.130> my<00:03:08.250> 5d<00:03:08.550> mark

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
battery it feels lighter than my 5d mark

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.120 
battery it feels lighter than my 5d mark
ii<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.120> overall<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.050> Nate<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.620> does<00:03:10.800> make<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
ii so overall it Nate it does make the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.470 
ii so overall it Nate it does make the
grip<00:03:11.280> better<00:03:11.460> so<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:11.850> these<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.180> smaller

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
grip better so with these like smaller

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.630 
grip better so with these like smaller
cameras<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.080> do<00:03:13.350> think<00:03:13.710> that<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:14.190> battery<00:03:14.490> up

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
cameras I do think that the battery up

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.760 
cameras I do think that the battery up
is<00:03:14.820> bene<00:03:15.030> beneficial<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:15.990> just<00:03:16.200> for<00:03:16.470> when<00:03:16.650> you

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
is bene beneficial not just for when you

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.800 
is bene beneficial not just for when you
want<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.160> extra<00:03:17.250> battery<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.570> want

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
want that extra battery but if you want

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.320 
want that extra battery but if you want
you<00:03:19.620> know<00:03:19.710> a<00:03:19.740> nice<00:03:20.040> grip<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:21.090> know<00:03:21.210> the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
you know a nice grip and you know the

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.910 
you know a nice grip and you know the
vertical<00:03:21.690> orientation<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.320> doesn't<00:03:22.590> add<00:03:22.710> too

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
vertical orientation it doesn't add too

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.250 
vertical orientation it doesn't add too
much<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.970> terms<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.240> size<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:24.750> not<00:03:24.840> that

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
much and in terms of size it's not that

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.860 
much and in terms of size it's not that
big<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.710> actually<00:03:25.860> like<00:03:26.220> like<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.300> size<00:03:27.510> more

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
big I actually like like this size more

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.960 
big I actually like like this size more
than<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.290> like<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:28.950> when<00:03:29.100> it's<00:03:29.250> without<00:03:29.850> the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
than I like it when it's without the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.100 
than I like it when it's without the
battery<00:03:30.150> grip<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:30.570> with<00:03:30.720> these<00:03:30.810> smaller

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
battery grip so with these smaller

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.890 
battery grip so with these smaller
cameras<00:03:31.620> like<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.280> rebel<00:03:32.580> series<00:03:32.900> so

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
cameras like that the rebel series so

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.750 
cameras like that the rebel series so
that's<00:03:34.080> like<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.290> 100<00:03:34.740> series<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.340> Canon

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
that's like the 100 series of the Canon

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.950 
that's like the 100 series of the Canon
or<00:03:35.910> with<00:03:36.150> something<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.690> some<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
or with something that some of the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.380 
or with something that some of the
smaller<00:03:37.050> Nikon<00:03:37.650> cameras<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.340> battery<00:03:39.240> group

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
smaller Nikon cameras a battery group

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.660 
smaller Nikon cameras a battery group
might<00:03:39.630> actually<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.530> nice<00:03:40.890> option<00:03:41.160> this<00:03:41.520> one

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
might actually be a nice option this one

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.950 
might actually be a nice option this one
is<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.790> third-party<00:03:42.210> one<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:42.720> can<00:03:42.840> get

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
is a third-party one so you can get

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.710 
is a third-party one so you can get
these<00:03:43.080> for<00:03:43.470> anywhere<00:03:44.310> between<00:03:44.400> like<00:03:44.730> twenty

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
these for anywhere between like twenty

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.390 
these for anywhere between like twenty
to<00:03:45.960> forty<00:03:46.350> dollars<00:03:46.650> I'm<00:03:46.770> guessing<00:03:47.040> twenty<00:03:47.280> to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
to forty dollars I'm guessing twenty to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.490 
to forty dollars I'm guessing twenty to
fifty<00:03:47.520> dollars

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
fifty dollars

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.140 
fifty dollars
definitely<00:03:49.500> not<00:03:49.620> as<00:03:50.100> much<00:03:50.130> as<00:03:50.460> that<00:03:50.580> like<00:03:50.910> I

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
definitely not as much as that like I

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.240 
definitely not as much as that like I
think<00:03:51.450> it's<00:03:51.570> 200<00:03:52.110> for<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.350> original<00:03:52.710> one<00:03:52.860> so<00:03:52.890> I

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
think it's 200 for the original one so I

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.160 
think it's 200 for the original one so I
think<00:03:53.820> it's<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.360> great<00:03:54.480> investment<00:03:54.810> you

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
think it's a it's a great investment you

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.930 
think it's a it's a great investment you
can<00:03:55.260> add<00:03:55.440> your<00:03:55.890> two<00:03:56.130> batteries<00:03:56.460> in<00:03:56.610> here<00:03:56.760> for

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
can add your two batteries in here for

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.000 
can add your two batteries in here for
extra<00:03:57.330> battery<00:03:57.690> life<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.050> again<00:03:58.290> on<00:03:58.500> these

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
extra battery life and again on these

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.530 
extra battery life and again on these
small<00:03:59.250> cameras<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.790> grip<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.150> definitely

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
small cameras the grip is definitely

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.230 
small cameras the grip is definitely
nice<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:00.960> as<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.740> depends<00:04:02.070> on<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.880> camera

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
nice so as it depends on on the camera

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.840 
nice so as it depends on on the camera
that<00:04:03.270> you're<00:04:03.480> using<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.110> also<00:04:04.890> on<00:04:05.280> your<00:04:05.430> hands

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
that you're using and also on your hands

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.850 
that you're using and also on your hands
and<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:08.640> on<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:09.780> guess<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.200> level<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.560> comfort

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
and and on I guess the level of comfort

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.550 
and and on I guess the level of comfort
that<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.310> camera<00:04:12.000> gives<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:12.840> by<00:04:13.020> itself<00:04:13.380> and

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
that the camera gives you by itself and

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.620 
that the camera gives you by itself and
with<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.830> grip<00:04:14.070> because<00:04:14.430> again<00:04:14.910> with<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.270> 5d

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
with the grip because again with the 5d

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.920 
with the grip because again with the 5d
mark<00:04:15.840> ii<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.500> eventually<00:04:17.040> became<00:04:17.310> like

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
mark ii it eventually became like

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.360 
mark ii it eventually became like
uncomfortable<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.080> use<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.350> battery<00:04:19.620> grip<00:04:19.859> at

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
uncomfortable to use the battery grip at

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.969 
uncomfortable to use the battery grip at
all<00:04:20.400> times<00:04:21.140> whereas<00:04:22.140> with<00:04:22.350> this<00:04:22.470> camera<00:04:22.830> i

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
all times whereas with this camera i

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.980 
all times whereas with this camera i
could<00:04:23.190> i<00:04:23.430> could<00:04:23.940> totally<00:04:24.450> use<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.750> battery

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
could i could totally use the battery

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.390 
could i could totally use the battery
grip

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
grip

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.640 
grip
like<00:04:25.790> everyday<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.540> and<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:27.169> wouldn't<00:04:27.500> bother

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
like everyday and and it wouldn't bother

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.180 
like everyday and and it wouldn't bother
me<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:28.100> that's<00:04:28.699> my<00:04:28.880> take<00:04:29.090> on<00:04:29.240> battery<00:04:29.630> grips

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
me so that's my take on battery grips

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.800 
me so that's my take on battery grips
one<00:04:31.190> last<00:04:31.550> thing<00:04:31.669> I'd<00:04:31.910> like<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.120> add<00:04:32.330> is<00:04:32.360> if

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
one last thing I'd like to add is if

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.600 
one last thing I'd like to add is if
you're<00:04:33.290> going<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.620> get<00:04:33.800> one<00:04:33.979> and<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.370> don't

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
you're going to get one and you don't

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.360 
you're going to get one and you don't
want<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.940> spend<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.600> money<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.979> original

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
want to spend the money on the original

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.070 
want to spend the money on the original
ones<00:04:37.520> these<00:04:37.760> thirty<00:04:38.000> parts<00:04:38.389> third-party<00:04:38.810> ones

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
ones these thirty parts third-party ones

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.530 
ones these thirty parts third-party ones
are<00:04:39.260> great<00:04:39.440> especially<00:04:39.949> if<00:04:40.310> it's<00:04:40.430> like<00:04:40.550> um<00:04:40.729> you

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
are great especially if it's like um you

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.909 
are great especially if it's like um you
know<00:04:41.570> your<00:04:41.810> entry-level<00:04:42.110> body<00:04:42.500> that's<00:04:42.740> made

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
know your entry-level body that's made

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.400 
know your entry-level body that's made
out<00:04:42.949> of<00:04:43.070> plastic<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:44.210> battery<00:04:44.540> grip<00:04:44.660> usually

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
out of plastic the battery grip usually

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.100 
out of plastic the battery grip usually
matches<00:04:45.889> matches<00:04:46.370> your<00:04:46.669> camera<00:04:47.030> body<00:04:47.150> whereas

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
matches matches your camera body whereas

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.650 
matches matches your camera body whereas
with<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.800> higher<00:04:49.070> model<00:04:49.430> like<00:04:49.699> the<00:04:49.790> 5d<00:04:50.030> if<00:04:50.570> you

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
with the higher model like the 5d if you

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.090 
with the higher model like the 5d if you
buy<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.840> third<00:04:51.080> party<00:04:51.410> battery<00:04:51.650> grip<00:04:51.860> it's

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
buy a third party battery grip it's

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.070 
buy a third party battery grip it's
usually<00:04:52.280> plastic<00:04:52.669> whereas<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.449> original<00:04:53.900> one

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
usually plastic whereas the original one

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.820 
usually plastic whereas the original one
is<00:04:54.320> usually<00:04:55.190> magnesium<00:04:56.060> alloy<00:04:56.330> just<00:04:56.600> like<00:04:56.830> the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
is usually magnesium alloy just like the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.529 
is usually magnesium alloy just like the
higher-end<00:04:58.220> body<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:58.760> that's<00:04:59.060> something<00:04:59.449> to

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
higher-end body so that's something to
