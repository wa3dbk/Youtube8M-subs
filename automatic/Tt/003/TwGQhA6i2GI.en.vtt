00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello everyone who watches my channel 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.030
 such a majority, in principle, I would say 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.730
 tito of 90 from 100 percent probably 90 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.740
 exactly on my channel are those who watch 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.470
 It is here that reviews before eating drinks there 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.529
 there vlog 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 I now wanted to say that I letplay 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.750
 I've always liked to do 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.789
 flyspley 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 over on the past channel their affairs are very much 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.680
 food reviews and vlog on the contrary are few 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 I switched the other way on this channel 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.669
 food and video blog review us drinks I became 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.430
 do more 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.410
 all its then there is more to the little letspleev 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 but recently I started doing again 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.399
 many yearsplay and well i mean i do i 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.270
 as i said what i do what 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.399
 I like it because it's like this 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.399
 my business is every kind of person 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.079
 should understand that nobody 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 nobody owes nothing to anyone 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.940
 owes nothing here and no one has the right 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.399
 no one to demand something yes I myself 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.010
 also such that I said that my 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.229
 leytspley favorite they like play not 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.610
 those games that I want, yes, I like myself 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.930
 it's my fault that I was like 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.509
 wrong because how would 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.640
 but any man he is all he wants something 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.479
 and makes you his work here that is as though 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.210
 do not 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.790
 type is wrong for someone to specify the type 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.189
 but did not do explay better than food or 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.990
 there on the contrary do not play this game playing 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.909
 another one and i would like to say something i 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.520
 when i feel like i will do flyspley 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.020
 continue but I will now make a separate 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.460
 playlist and because i have now 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.159
 it turns out all in a heap 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.689
 and flysplay and review and everything else but i 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.259
 I will make a separate playlist and for 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.030
 letspleev 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.369
 individual video blog playlists 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.590
 individual beverage review playlists 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.060
 and food here and when you come on 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.810
 my channel and you will come for example 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.329
 playlist 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.820
 what is it there for whether it is on ideas and that 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.170
 that one that's all there will be convenient 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.579
 because I myself, too, in this all 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.380
 a bunch up to sort through these all videos 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.260
 inconvenient according to those people 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.360
 look all the more so 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.640
 as if before you go on the channel for example what 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.290
 look and duet here dofiga video by 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.520
 games 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.800
 so I'll make a separate let's play 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.810
 now let's play and not brush if i like how 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.520
 wanted when i'll be them when me 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.830
 want them and will just do and 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.350
 they will be in a separate playlist this 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.540
 everything will be separately as it were laid out by 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.640
 shelves and who does not need just be 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.860
 will not watch playlist shorter by 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.000
 letplay we will all be pure playlist 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.870
 watch it on the video would be all 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.670
 so here yes I'm shorter I'm usually like this 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.200
 I sit down to play and write down the whole 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.660
 the session that is here I get 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.860
 several videos then go and spread 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.990
 and a video about food there so well and drinks plus 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.150
 vlog I always post at the end 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.430
 because if i posted a video on 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.040
 eating at the very beginning then a bunch of years 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.440
 and that would all be they would stay on 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.780
 top and video food for example yes she left 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.640
 down here but i'm so like a lot of years play 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.950
 Put them all out first. 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.739
 session and only then at the very end 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.190
 video food here now I'm still here 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.910
 lay out 4 3 there jake and wider 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.550
 the fourth video there 6 them I am now 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.110
 lay out like 6 lay out so I immediately then 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.430
 I'll post a video idea of ​​drinks that is 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.220
 do you understand the whole session 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.160
 Spread time when I play like this 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.420
 that everyone who waits like yes you I will 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.430
 just be a single catch 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.920
 watch not the whole channel is purely separate 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.640
 playlists and everything on the channel itself 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.230
 I have a lot of everything on the playlist and of course 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.090
 more convenient here how many channels do not watch 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.830
 Everywhere there is a playlist and I'm on the archive 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.650
 the channel also made playlists but on this i 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.480
 for some reason I stopped doing I don't know, but this 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.430
 my mistake yes I confess because as 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.170
 I myself too uncomfortable right here 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.570
 me video manager here is all the videos in a heap 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.190
 and playlists too 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.890
 more convenient to navigate there what where 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.890
 video so here so
