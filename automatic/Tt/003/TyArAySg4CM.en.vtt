00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.800
 thousand dollars we buy the property a 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.510

 electronics and won first place in the 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.820
 science fair to grant a degree in 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.890
 this was a small problem with seeing 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.170

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.630
 Circus goal is to eliminate completely 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.000
 to this gentleman since he is an archenemy and 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.000
 well there we received the goat call 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.000

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.640

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.740
 let's start the first mission that is 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.840
 great and good that means air attack 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.460
 as the name says it let's use 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.900
 Ciboure their small toys and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.380
 good and we look at the kinematics that 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.380
 says everything 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:34.050
 in the ring 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.050
 Wow 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.510
 or two 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.229
 and a half 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 one 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.270
 do not 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.920
 go away 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.920
 once and for all 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.780
 you are 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.120
 on foot 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.120
 and well you saw the cinematheque and everything 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.480
 the rest I want to tell you that we started 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.870
 the mission is crazy and he wants 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.610
 destroy it completely to your little ones 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.610
 small planes since they are toy 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:11.520
 the little deadly weapon is what a toy 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.520
 and good the threat begins 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.940
 and good 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.120
 together 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.540
 and good to come forward and always look 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.030
 watch the map 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.950
 and especially when I have a blunt point 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.650
 there are times when one is wrong and all for 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.810
 there has already expired eliminated and all 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.680
 the rest 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:47.050
 an example happened to me bigger than there was 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:49.319
 eliminated and that seems perfect to me 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.629
 He is looking sideways 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:04:00.950
 as you can see I students because there 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:04:00.950
 is appearing 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.069
 appear from our fast and know you 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.069
 have me here 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.100
 this 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.190
 1 and at the end I think it started to fail 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.380
 because he began to trust 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.209
 well, it seems perfect to me and here 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.060
 playful lord 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.180
 and leave the city completing the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.740
 three goat missions and good deeds 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.960
 possible for him to leave and he 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.960
 disappear from the city of this death 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.140
 I 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.510
 with business then it 's how you can see 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:51.400
 and a very tall one appears but they have to 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:53.790
 be attentive to fill them all 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:59.360
 they are totally but they do the means 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:02.689
 necessary that he can not do anything else 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.529
 good situation for our nation 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:09.099
 wants to transmit and well yes 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.099
 peking 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:17.720
 as you can see on the map and I look towards 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.720
 one and another one comes together 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.130
 I would like these years 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.370
 in a constant movement then that 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.900
 you have to be is currently in 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.930
 that you know that they will reach 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.090
 that point then 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.550
 come here you can not do anything but 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.409
 we call live the point to where 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.330
 arrives 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.330
 and shoot and it only shoots 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:44.039
 like that emotion of being grabbing 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:52.010
 and 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:54.370
 at the end exactly from now on but 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.370
 your 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.780
 the aim fails says they understand me 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.460
 have a point where noises eliminate 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.240
 and I think not 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.770
 about four seconds that is that and of 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.530
 law the mind is eliminated 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.960
 well exactly and it is not long before 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.000
 this mission is finished and it's something easy 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.280
 but only exactly right now is 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.639
 when he trusted me and started to fail and 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.639
 good 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.110
 I did it a perfect inner state 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.910
 besides perfect and good that 's what 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.910
 I wanted because if it's not worth 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.340
 if he laughs 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:46.800
 although good then he with his 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.490
 small web thinks he has done 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.200
 too much damage to each other good berklee is not 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.710
 gives up and he totally wants 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.310
 destroy it and make it annoy 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.310
 and see you in the next
