longer

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.690 

we<00:01:00.960> need<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.230> carefully<00:01:01.770> select<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.250> pieces

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.800 
we need to carefully select the pieces
just<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.090> make<00:01:03.239> sure<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.570> you're

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
just to make sure that you're

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.320 
just to make sure that you're
strategically<00:01:04.680> placing<00:01:04.979> them<00:01:05.370> now<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.180> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
strategically placing them now this is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.730 
strategically placing them now this is
perfect<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.870> if<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.050> have<00:01:07.200> straight<00:01:07.560> or

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
perfect for if you have straight or

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.170 
perfect for if you have straight or
curly<00:01:08.010> hair<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.580> feeling<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
curly hair I have a feeling that this

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.670 
curly hair I have a feeling that this
probably<00:01:09.540> lasts<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.020> curly<00:01:10.229> hair<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> little

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
probably lasts in curly hair a little

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.920 
probably lasts in curly hair a little
bit<00:01:10.890> longer<00:01:11.160> but<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.330> you've<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.479> straight

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
bit longer but if you've got straight

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.210 
bit longer but if you've got straight
hair<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.380> still<00:01:13.619> something<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.920> works

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
hair this is still something that works

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.010 
hair this is still something that works
for<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.610> make<00:01:14.970> sure<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.150> blend<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.960 
going to show you I do later is I pick
apart<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.890> highlight<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.580> to<00:01:44.670> kind<00:01:44.880> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
apart the highlight it's just to kind of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.520 
apart the highlight it's just to kind of
blend<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:45.690> natural<00:01:46.020> hair<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.320> more

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
blend them in my natural hair a bit more

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.499 
blend them in my natural hair a bit more
but<00:01:47.039> I<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.580> how<00:01:47.820> silver<00:01:48.300> looks

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
but I really like how silver looks

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.779 
but I really like how silver looks
against<00:01:48.840> dark<00:01:49.229> hair<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.460> lighter

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
against dark hair if you have lighter

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.150 
against dark hair if you have lighter
hair<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.270> blonde<00:01:51.509> hair<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.440> pink<00:01:52.860> or

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
hair like blonde hair I think a pink or

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.430 
hair like blonde hair I think a pink or
a<00:01:53.190> green<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:53.759> look<00:01:53.910> amazing<00:01:54.229> again<00:01:55.229> it's

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
a green would look amazing again it's

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.320 
a green would look amazing again it's
the<00:01:55.560> same<00:01:55.590> kind<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.250> principle<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.940> just<00:01:57.149> take

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
the same kind of principle you just take

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.210 
the same kind of principle you just take
some<00:01:57.509> eyeshadow<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> rub<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.740> against<00:01:59.130> your

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
some eyeshadow and rub it against your

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:11.440 
some eyeshadow and rub it against your
hair<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.520> this
