00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.530 
in him that he does not want to be kept
silent<00:05:31.480> because<00:05:32.940> everyone<00:05:33.940> is<00:05:34.120> probably

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
silent because everyone is probably

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.270 
silent because everyone is probably
seeing<00:05:34.870> him<00:05:35.110> as<00:05:35.230> a<00:05:35.260> failure<00:05:35.560> most<00:05:35.890> importantly

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
seeing him as a failure most importantly

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.400 
seeing him as a failure most importantly
he's<00:05:36.580> seeing<00:05:36.820> himself<00:05:37.030> as<00:05:37.420> a<00:05:37.450> failure<00:05:37.810> so<00:05:38.350> you

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
he's seeing himself as a failure so you

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.230 
he's seeing himself as a failure so you
can<00:05:38.560> understand<00:05:38.950> why<00:05:39.190> he<00:05:39.520> would<00:05:39.670> so<00:05:39.940> quickly

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
can understand why he would so quickly

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.630 
can understand why he would so quickly
want<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.810> rush<00:05:41.080> out<00:05:41.350> and<00:05:41.650> try<00:05:42.040> to<00:05:42.070> take<00:05:42.310> on<00:05:42.460> the

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
want to rush out and try to take on the

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.610 
want to rush out and try to take on the
Fire<00:05:42.820> Nation<00:05:42.850> just<00:05:43.540> by<00:05:43.720> himself<00:05:43.870> not<00:05:44.410> let

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
Fire Nation just by himself not let

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.710 
Fire Nation just by himself not let
anyone<00:05:44.860> else<00:05:45.100> get<00:05:45.670> involved<00:05:46.180> he's<00:05:46.330> tired<00:05:46.600> of

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
anyone else get involved he's tired of

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.270 
anyone else get involved he's tired of
other<00:05:46.870> people<00:05:47.230> getting<00:05:47.530> hurt<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.920> mean<00:05:48.100> it's

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
other people getting hurt I mean it's

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.890 
other people getting hurt I mean it's
just<00:05:48.400> even<00:05:49.240> though<00:05:49.330> he's<00:05:49.450> done<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.660> lot<00:05:49.720> of

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
just even though he's done a lot of

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.450 
just even though he's done a lot of
great<00:05:50.140> things<00:05:50.170> that's<00:05:50.650> not<00:05:50.800> what<00:05:50.950> he<00:05:51.010> sees<00:05:51.250> he

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
great things that's not what he sees he

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.950 
great things that's not what he sees he
sees<00:05:51.670> failure<00:05:52.090> after<00:05:52.210> failure<00:05:52.390> after<00:05:52.720> failure

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
sees failure after failure after failure

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.530 
sees failure after failure after failure
so<00:05:53.770> I<00:05:53.800> thought<00:05:54.100> this<00:05:54.250> was<00:05:54.460> a<00:05:54.490> good<00:05:54.760> coming<00:05:55.450> to

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
so I thought this was a good coming to

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.220 
so I thought this was a good coming to
grips<00:05:55.720> of<00:05:55.930> that<00:05:56.140> this<00:05:56.410> was<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.590> really<00:05:57.340> nice

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
grips of that this was a really nice

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.720 
grips of that this was a really nice
this<00:05:59.230> was<00:05:59.410> a<00:05:59.440> really<00:05:59.680> nice<00:05:59.920> way<00:06:00.130> of<00:06:00.160> showing

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
this was a really nice way of showing

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.570 
this was a really nice way of showing
what<00:06:01.060> he<00:06:01.090> has<00:06:01.480> to<00:06:01.720> deal<00:06:01.930> with<00:06:02.230> after<00:06:03.190> being<00:06:03.400> out

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
what he has to deal with after being out

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.460 
what he has to deal with after being out
for<00:06:03.610> so<00:06:03.970> long<00:06:04.300> on<00:06:04.510> top<00:06:04.750> of<00:06:04.930> that<00:06:05.050> he's<00:06:05.440> just

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
for so long on top of that he's just

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.870 
for so long on top of that he's just
been<00:06:05.800> out<00:06:05.920> of<00:06:06.040> commission<00:06:06.280> and<00:06:06.550> like<00:06:06.730> I<00:06:06.820> said

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
been out of commission and like I said

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.390 
been out of commission and like I said

madness<00:06:43.770> that<00:06:43.919> glider<00:06:44.360> you<00:06:45.360> know<00:06:45.449> I<00:06:45.479> source<00:06:45.810> of

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
madness that glider you know I source of

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.779 
madness that glider you know I source of
attending<00:06:46.319> where<00:06:46.650> he<00:06:46.740> sets<00:06:47.129> it<00:06:47.250> up<00:06:47.370> and<00:06:47.610> lets
