00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
liquid measuring cup and this was a

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.099 
liquid measuring cup and this was a
little<00:04:19.030> thing<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.269> talk<00:04:19.420> first<00:04:19.630> time<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:19.959> I

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
little thing to talk first time in I

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.170 
little thing to talk first time in I
like<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.470> transfer<00:04:20.920> this<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.820> this<00:04:21.970> because

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
like to transfer this to this because

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.200 
like to transfer this to this because
it's<00:04:22.300> easy<00:04:22.420> to<00:04:22.570> pour<00:04:22.900> my<00:04:23.050> pancakes<00:04:23.560> and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
essentially all you do here is let it go

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.250 
essentially all you do here is let it go
and<00:04:30.160> then<00:04:30.250> don't<00:04:30.670> mix<00:04:30.940> out<00:04:31.120> like<00:04:31.450> all<00:04:31.720> the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
and then don't mix out like all the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.590 
and then don't mix out like all the
lumps<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.030> just<00:04:34.030> kind<00:04:34.180> of<00:04:34.210> show<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.360> briefly

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
lumps and just kind of show you briefly

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.150 
lumps and just kind of show you briefly
how<00:04:34.810> this<00:04:35.170> works<00:04:35.410> what<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:35.740> do<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:35.980> come<00:04:36.100> in

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
how this works what you do you come in

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.510 
how this works what you do you come in
with<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:37.420> you<00:04:37.630> slowly<00:04:38.040> do<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.250> and

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
with this and you slowly do that and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.400 
with this and you slowly do that and
that's<00:04:39.760> that's<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.420> technique<00:04:40.870> is<00:04:40.960> for<00:04:41.140> but

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
that's that's that technique is for but

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.200 
that's that's that technique is for but
just<00:04:42.340> going<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.520> show<00:04:42.670> you<00:04:42.730> that<00:04:42.940> so<00:04:43.060> if<00:04:43.150> you

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
just going to show you that so if you

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.040 
just going to show you that so if you
kind<00:04:43.330> of<00:04:43.450> make<00:04:43.540> sure<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:43.750> don't<00:04:43.840> have<00:04:43.960> to

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
kind of make sure you don't have to

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.620 
kind of make sure you don't have to
worry<00:04:44.170> about<00:04:44.290> any<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:45.250> know<00:04:45.370> spillage<00:04:46.000> that

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
worry about any you know spillage that

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.000 
worry about any you know spillage that
