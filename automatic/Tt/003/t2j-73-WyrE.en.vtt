leaves<00:00:41.840> just<00:00:41.989> sitting<00:00:42.410> in<00:00:42.500> this<00:00:42.620> really<00:00:43.040> big

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
leaves just sitting in this really big

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.060 
leaves just sitting in this really big
terra<00:00:43.520> cotta<00:00:43.730> pot<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:44.300> also<00:00:44.900> use<00:00:45.230> colanders<00:00:45.770> as

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
terra cotta pot I also use colanders as

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.210 
terra cotta pot I also use colanders as
well<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:47.120> I<00:00:47.750> didn't<00:00:48.410> have<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:48.530> colander<00:00:48.920> big

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
well but I didn't have a colander big

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.000 
well but I didn't have a colander big
enough<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.420> this<00:00:50.870> pot<00:00:51.110> is<00:00:51.320> good<00:00:51.500> because<00:00:51.710> it's

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
enough so this pot is good because it's

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.680 
enough so this pot is good because it's
breathable<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:52.670> want<00:00:53.030> something<00:00:53.480> that's

the bottom this is a planter pot and I'm
just<00:00:58.790> going<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.000> leave<00:00:59.180> this<00:00:59.390> here<00:00:59.750> for<00:01:00.470> a<00:01:00.500> few

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.290 
just going to leave this here for a few
days<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.430> it<00:01:01.550> depends<00:01:01.970> on<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.149> humidity

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
days and it depends on the humidity

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.540 
days and it depends on the humidity
could<00:01:02.960> take<00:01:03.140> anywhere<00:01:03.500> up<00:01:03.560> to<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.860> week<00:01:04.190> or<00:01:04.489> it

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550

could<00:01:04.699> take<00:01:04.880> a<00:01:04.910> few<00:01:05.000> days<00:01:05.390> if<00:01:05.750> it's<00:01:05.899> really

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
could take a few days if it's really

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.920 
could take a few days if it's really
humid<00:01:06.710> you'll<00:01:07.430> probably<00:01:07.729> want<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.330> put<00:01:08.660> it<00:01:08.780> in

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
humid you'll probably want to put it in

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.810 
humid you'll probably want to put it in
your<00:01:09.050> oven<00:01:09.170> on<00:01:09.410> a<00:01:09.470> very<00:01:09.800> low<00:01:10.040> heat<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:10.640> I

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
your oven on a very low heat but I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.600

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
prefer to Sun dry it if I can and then

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.300
