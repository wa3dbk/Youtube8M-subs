flawless and the quality shows it's
going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> four<00:02:00.540> piece<00:02:00.930> design<00:02:01.439> so

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
going to be a four piece design so

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.530 
going to be a four piece design so
you're<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:03.149> main

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
you're going to have this one main

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.060 
you're going to have this one main
backbone<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.409> going<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> attach<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.860> your

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
backbone that's going to attach to your

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
backbone that's going to attach to your
motorcycle<00:02:05.640> you're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.869> top

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
motorcycle you're going to have a top

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.100 
motorcycle you're going to have a top
spine<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.979> runs<00:02:08.220> across<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:09.090> top<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.509> then

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
spine that runs across the top and then

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.360 
spine that runs across the top and then
you're<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.560> these<00:02:10.800> two<00:02:11.069> brackets

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
you're going to have these two brackets

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.520 
you're going to have these two brackets
that<00:02:11.760> mount<00:02:12.000> off<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.480> side

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that mount off the side

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.900 
that mount off the side
so<00:02:13.650> there<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> little<00:02:14.550> bit<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.730> light

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so there is a little bit of light

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.390 
so there is a little bit of light
assembly<00:02:15.330> required<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.980> one<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.160> things

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
assembly required and one of the things

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.710 
assembly required and one of the things
that<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.880> mean<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.510> is

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.870 
as the frame and the spine of this whole
unit<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.060> if<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:25.650> use<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.700> little

part of the actual design of this unit
it's<00:02:50.100> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.310> reuse<00:02:50.550> your<00:02:50.790> OEM<00:02:51.120> design<00:02:51.540> turn
