00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
just not consistent enough

just not consistent enough
this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.750> pump<00:00:34.020> action<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> grip<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.360> way

this is pump action with the grip is way

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.020 
this is pump action with the grip is way
better<00:00:36.840> than<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.590> uh<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.730> double

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
better than that uh and that double

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.490 
better than that uh and that double
barrel<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.540> getting<00:00:39.809> knife<00:00:39.989> there<00:00:40.290> after

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
barrel is just getting knife there after

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.660 
barrel is just getting knife there after
picking<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> double<00:00:41.340> kill<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
picking up the double kill it just it

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.310 
picking up the double kill it just it
just<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:45.300> consistent<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:45.899> hit<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.200> you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
just more consistent one hit and you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840 
just more consistent one hit and you
could<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.770> four<00:00:47.010> rounds<00:00:47.460> instead<00:00:47.760> of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
could you have four rounds instead of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.350 
could you have four rounds instead of
two<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:49.829> spaz<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.370> probably<00:00:50.610> even<00:00:50.700> more<00:00:50.820> even

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
two the spaz is probably even more even

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.810 
two the spaz is probably even more even
better<00:00:52.910> it<00:00:53.910> does<00:00:55.340> there's<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.670> less

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
better it does there's a little less

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.310 
better it does there's a little less
damage<00:00:57.239> than<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.539> one<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.199> like

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
damage than this one I think is like

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.860 
damage than this one I think is like
five<00:00:58.559> less<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> pellet<00:00:59.370> but<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.120> semi-automatic

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
five less a pellet but if semi-automatic

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.500 
five less a pellet but if semi-automatic
and<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.140> eight<00:01:01.320> rounds<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.699> yeah<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.270> here

and has eight rounds so yeah right here

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
and has eight rounds so yeah right here

shotguns got a pretty good range it

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.230 
shotguns got a pretty good range it
doesn't<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.719> spazz<00:01:57.990> range<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:59.000> it's<00:02:00.000> got

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

its got good range and I shot him I shot

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.069 
its got good range and I shot him I shot
him<00:02:02.399> inside<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> area<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> jammer<00:02:03.840> so

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
him inside the area of the jammer so

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.959 
him inside the area of the jammer so
obviously<00:02:04.799> they<00:02:05.280> didn't<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.640> where<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> was

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
obviously they didn't know where I was

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.779 
obviously they didn't know where I was
coming<00:02:06.299> at<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:07.920> where<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> jammer<00:02:08.640> is

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
coming at so that's where the jammer is

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.070 
coming at so that's where the jammer is
coming<00:02:09.060> from<00:02:09.239> I'm<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.420> trying<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> stay

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
coming from I'm just trying to stay

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.600 
coming from I'm just trying to stay
toward<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> area<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:11.039> it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
toward the area of it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.250 
toward the area of it
but<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:11.910> picked<00:02:12.330> my<00:02:12.420> third<00:02:12.630> kill<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:13.080> right

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
but I picked my third kill up right

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.390 
but I picked my third kill up right
there<00:02:13.440> because<00:02:13.740> he<00:02:13.830> didn't<00:02:14.040> know<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.220> was<00:02:14.370> that

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
there because he didn't know I was that

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.330 
there because he didn't know I was that
either<00:02:14.610> because<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.000> was<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.330> jammer<00:02:15.600> area

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
either because I was in the jammer area

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.380 
either because I was in the jammer area
that's<00:02:17.340> why<00:02:17.460> I'm<00:02:17.550> running<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.000> jammer<00:02:18.240> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that's why I'm running in the jammer you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.000 
that's why I'm running in the jammer you
can<00:02:18.510> run<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.750> jammer<00:02:18.990> or<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.410> motion<00:02:19.590> sensor

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
can run the jammer or the motion sensor

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.120 
can run the jammer or the motion sensor
with<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> shotgun<00:02:20.750> both<00:02:21.750> are<00:02:21.930> equally<00:02:22.200> well<00:02:22.470> but

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
with a shotgun both are equally well but

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.470 
with a shotgun both are equally well but
if<00:02:23.250> you're<00:02:23.370> gonna<00:02:23.460> have<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> lot<00:02:23.790> close-quarter

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
if you're gonna have a lot close-quarter

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
if you're gonna have a lot close-quarter
