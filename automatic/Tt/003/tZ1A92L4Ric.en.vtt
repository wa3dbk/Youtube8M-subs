00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.350
 because the prices of gasoline have greatly tormented because 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.209
 that today it is essential for the professionals as for the 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:11.569
 reduce fuel costs eco-driving has become 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.569
 a necessity 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.040
 yes based on the principle that we said yesterday that if we accelerate and it disturbed 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.500
 the electronic injection system and we would consume more 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.350
 in this driving school driving professionals are from 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.900
 more and more solicited to evoke with the producers of tomorrow 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.010
 the principles of eco-driving, especially in dynamic urban areas 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.339
 anticipation and maximum is a lot with my opinion it handle 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.059
 when one is not exempt is in my opinion it manage once you 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.010
 have passed all the rapporteurs 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.620
 the savings are less significant it was that lies all that is 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.720
 climb and descent to avoid at all costs anticipation traffic 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.979
 so it's mostly in town 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.529
 where it's going to take more effort and where the savings will be 

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:55.709
 narrowly more significant anticipate traffic to avoid 

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:58.069
 unnecessary acceleration and braking 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:02.069
 be vigilant about fuel consumers like air conditioning or 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.369
 unsuspected or shut down the engine for stops greater than 30 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.789
 seconds in France all these principles are not assets make requests 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.090
 drivers often have a real questioning of their driving habits 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.030
 while ensuring security 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.150
 here 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.900
 this debate does not feel any acceleration 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.980
 the goal being to have a look as far as possible to have a 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.580
 anticipation that is really optimized that is to say that I arrive on a 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.450
 roundabout I stop - acceleration 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.050
 but we will not change the 5 years 10 years 15 years or 20 years of license on a 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.670
 one hour delivery 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.390
 so obviously it will take for business in our habits 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.150
 that all users who have more than fifty licenses be reformed 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.260
 regular way because the natural is very often back to where 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.190
 we intervene we know that three years after the training the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.110
 consumer behavior hearing that 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.370
 to relocate today 40% of trips are less than 2 km 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.940
 not more than 5 minutes 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.230
 driving professionals therefore advocates taking the right 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.140
 used to ride the bike for trips shorter than 6 km and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.840
 mainly in urban areas beyond that some bad habits 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.560
 must be banned like rolling in neutral I stop accelerating 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.579
 well i'm going to have my consumption exceeds 0 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.199
 if a contrario I unplugged injectors open open and that the 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.079
 people to consume fuel 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.279
 and I am also very dangerous because my car is no longer 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.810
 mastered at liberated energetic kinetics it's very obvious you 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.079
 can see that to consume in freewheel 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.689
 all these cumulated gestures to make pay a lot 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.489
 on the basis of 20 thousand kilometers a year and by adopting eco-driving a 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.229
 driver can consider saving nearly 520 euros in the year
