look real and no explanation whatsoever
I<00:00:41.280> don't<00:00:41.520> even<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> mega

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
I don't even know if this is a mega

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360 
I don't even know if this is a mega
evolution<00:00:42.899> or<00:00:43.020> anything<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.530> doesn't<00:00:44.219> seem

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
evolution or anything it doesn't seem

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.299 
evolution or anything it doesn't seem
like<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.719> don't<00:00:46.200> know<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.160> don't

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
like it but I don't know I really don't

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
like it but I don't know I really don't
know<00:00:47.520> I'm<00:00:47.730> seriously<00:00:48.420> confused<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.289> we

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
know I'm seriously confused because we

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
know I'm seriously confused because we
would<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.770> seen<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.190> coro<00:00:50.399> coro<00:00:50.640> but

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
would have seen this in coro coro but

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
would have seen this in coro coro but
it's<00:00:51.510> not<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.809> Coral<00:00:52.079> coral<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.890> what's<00:00:53.100> going

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
it's not in Coral coral so what's going

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.209 
it's not in Coral coral so what's going
on<00:00:53.489> now<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> second<00:00:54.870> page<00:00:55.050> shows<00:00:55.829> another

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
on now the second page shows another

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.340 
on now the second page shows another
never-before-seen<00:00:57.180> Pokemon<00:00:57.750> much<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
never-before-seen Pokemon much like the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.560 
never-before-seen Pokemon much like the
slowbro<00:00:58.890> slowpoke<00:00:59.430> thing<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.730> saw<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
slowbro slowpoke thing we saw but this

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
slowbro slowpoke thing we saw but this
one<00:01:00.719> looks<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.020> oughta<00:01:01.230> know<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
one looks like oughta know now this

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.619 
one looks like oughta know now this
doesn't<00:01:02.370> seem<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> mega<00:01:03.059> evolution

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
doesn't seem to be a mega evolution

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.359 
doesn't seem to be a mega evolution
either<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> don't<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.650> any<00:01:04.890> signs<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
either because I don't see any signs of

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.310 
either because I don't see any signs of
mega<00:01:05.580> evolution<00:01:05.670> anywhere<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> could<00:01:07.260> be

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
mega evolution anywhere so this could be

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.580 
mega evolution anywhere so this could be
an<00:01:07.680> actual<00:01:08.159> evolution<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> different<00:01:10.350> form

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
an actual evolution or a different form

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.080 
an actual evolution or a different form
now<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.040> was<00:01:11.130> an<00:01:11.220> actual<00:01:11.400> evolution<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
now if it was an actual evolution that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.280 
now if it was an actual evolution that
would<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.360> weird<00:01:12.570> because<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.080> mega

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
would be weird because with mega

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
would be weird because with mega
evolution<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:13.860> kind<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.310> kind<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
evolution they kind of they kind of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
evolution they kind of they kind of
stopped<00:01:15.090> giving<00:01:15.330> Pokemon<00:01:15.900> actual<00:01:16.470> evolutions

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
stopped giving Pokemon actual evolutions

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.249 
stopped giving Pokemon actual evolutions
but<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.150> still<00:01:18.330> strange<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:18.990> we

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
but this is still strange because we

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.840 
but this is still strange because we
don't<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.470> mega<00:01:19.799> evolution<00:01:20.310> anywhere<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
don't see mega evolution anywhere and it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 
don't see mega evolution anywhere and it
wasn't<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.210> coro<00:01:21.420> coro<00:01:21.659> what<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.770> on

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
wasn't in coro coro what is going on

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.730 
wasn't in coro coro what is going on
that<00:01:23.520> they<00:01:23.640> leaked<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.900> accident

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that they leaked this like on accident

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.960 
that they leaked this like on accident
or<00:01:25.799> something<00:01:26.009> I'll<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.490> more<00:01:26.700> information

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
or something I'll have more information
