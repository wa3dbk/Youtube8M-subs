for<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.479> football<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.259> become<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> part<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
for that football to become a part of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.200 
for that football to become a part of
your<00:01:35.100> hand<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> two-minute<00:01:36.090> drill

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
your hand that's a two-minute drill

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
your hand that's a two-minute drill
don't<00:01:36.479> take<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.810> long<00:01:37.020> again<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
don't take that long again you can do a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.249 
don't take that long again you can do a
pre<00:01:38.250> practice<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.909> tell<00:01:39.540> guys<00:01:39.689> they<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
pre practice I tell guys they can do it

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.450 
pre practice I tell guys they can do it
anytime<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.040> sitting<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.369> front

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
anytime they can do it sitting in front

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910 
anytime they can do it sitting in front

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
of TV set at home it's just a matter of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.200 
of TV set at home it's just a matter of
spending<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> little<00:01:44.520> bit<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.759> time<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.090> get

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
spending a little bit of time to get

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.630 
spending a little bit of time to get
better<00:01:45.390> at<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> okay<00:01:46.530> our<00:01:47.100> next<00:01:47.159> drill

something we call push and pivot okay
very<00:01:50.399> simple<00:01:51.170> drill<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.710> again

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
very simple drill that will do again

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.209 
very simple drill that will do again

looking for the first step or two of
that<00:02:19.230> play<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.590> told<00:02:19.769> him<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.849> push<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.329> pivot

the ball as that ball comes back to them

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.619 
the ball as that ball comes back to them
it's<00:02:29.159> not<00:02:29.280> perfect<00:02:30.060> because<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.329> don't<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:30.599> a

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
it's not perfect because we don't have a

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.330 
it's not perfect because we don't have a
center<00:02:31.019> here<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.409> would<00:02:31.739> make<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.069> little

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
center here that would make it a little

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.000 
center here that would make it a little
bit<00:02:32.489> better<00:02:32.609> but<00:02:33.510> we're<00:02:34.409> putting<00:02:34.769> an<00:02:34.890> emphasis

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
bit better but we're putting an emphasis

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.399 
bit better but we're putting an emphasis
on<00:02:35.609> things<00:02:35.909> that<00:02:36.030> sometimes<00:02:36.599> get<00:02:36.900> overlooked

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
on things that sometimes get overlooked

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.470 
on things that sometimes get overlooked
and<00:02:37.739> sometimes<00:02:38.609> people<00:02:39.000> don't<00:02:39.090> even<00:02:39.180> talk

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
and sometimes people don't even talk

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.420 
and sometimes people don't even talk
about<00:02:39.540> or<00:02:39.930> work<00:02:40.109> on<00:02:40.290> but<00:02:40.530> again<00:02:40.739> we<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:41.189> want

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
about or work on but again we just want

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.880 
about or work on but again we just want
to<00:02:41.700> emphasize<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.120> about<00:02:42.659> once<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.049> week<00:02:43.079> say

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
to emphasize that about once a week say

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.319 
to emphasize that about once a week say
unless<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.250> got<00:02:44.370> seat<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.730> football<00:02:45.120> so

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
unless you got seat to football so

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.759 
unless you got seat to football so
pulling<00:02:45.780> guard<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.109> not<00:02:46.139> going<00:02:46.409> to<00:02:46.470> knock<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
pulling guard is not going to knock the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.330 
pulling guard is not going to knock the
ball<00:02:46.889> out<00:02:46.950> or<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:49.260> got<00:02:49.409> to<00:02:49.470> avoid<00:02:49.709> false<00:02:50.040> steps

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
ball out or you got to avoid false steps

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.460 
ball out or you got to avoid false steps
just<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:50.700> get<00:02:50.849> yourself<00:02:50.940> away<00:02:51.450> from<00:02:51.510> Center<00:02:52.049> so

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
just to get yourself away from Center so

just to get yourself away from Center so
you're<00:02:52.620> not<00:02:52.739> getting<00:02:53.010> tripped<00:02:53.280> up<00:02:53.430> okay

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359

technique<00:02:54.930> warmup<00:02:55.590> okay<00:02:56.000> our<00:02:57.000> warmup<00:02:57.629> is

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
technique warmup okay our warmup is

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.080 
technique warmup okay our warmup is
nothing<00:02:59.819> unique<00:03:00.260> but<00:03:01.260> what<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.829> is<00:03:02.250> I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
nothing unique but what it is is I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.830 
nothing unique but what it is is I
believe<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.799> opportunity<00:03:05.579> for

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
believe this is the opportunity for

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.610 
believe this is the opportunity for
quarterbacks<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:07.680> fine-tune<00:03:08.370> adjust<00:03:09.620> make

quarterbacks to fine-tune adjust make

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.860 
quarterbacks to fine-tune adjust make
minor<00:03:10.950> changes<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:12.359> throwing<00:03:12.689> motion

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
minor changes to the throwing motion
