really<00:02:44.599> Scratchy<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.910> couldn't<00:02:46.910> tell<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.269> what

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
really Scratchy I couldn't tell you what

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.970 
really Scratchy I couldn't tell you what
kind<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.810> makes<00:02:48.049> it<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:48.739> definitely

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
kind of makes it is but it's definitely

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.840 
kind of makes it is but it's definitely
not<00:02:49.370> too<00:02:50.269> hard<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:51.049> my<00:02:51.290> opinion<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
not too hard in my opinion it it's the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.059 
not too hard in my opinion it it's the
harder<00:02:53.239> type<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.690> it's<00:02:53.810> not<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:54.380> extremely

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
harder type that it's not like extremely

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:07.960
