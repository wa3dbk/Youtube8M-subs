relative<00:02:01.910> to<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.090> game<00:02:02.270> I'm<00:02:02.630> just<00:02:02.690> very

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
I'm hoping that we can maybe break some

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.609 
I'm hoping that we can maybe break some
people<00:02:07.850> stereotypes<00:02:08.390> about<00:02:08.600> Canada<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.229> show

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
people stereotypes about Canada and show

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.860 
people stereotypes about Canada and show
the<00:02:09.710> world<00:02:09.830> what<00:02:09.890> we<00:02:10.069> got

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
