00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.390 
on my front on jeez it's more heavier
than<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.430> thought<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.640> would<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:33.890> I'm<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
than I thought it would be I'm on the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.640 
than I thought it would be I'm on the
back<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:36.439> there<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:38.000> sash<00:01:39.000> mold<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.200> opened

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100
