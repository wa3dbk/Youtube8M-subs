generation<00:00:35.100> 1<00:00:35.370> mostly<00:00:35.940> due<00:00:36.030> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
generation 1 mostly due to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.340 
generation 1 mostly due to
transformation<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.020> bend<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
transformation but they do bend at the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.540 
transformation but they do bend at the
knee<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:38.960> then<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.020> arms<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.500> rotate<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
knee and then the arms can rotate and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
knee and then the arms can rotate and
bend<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.940> elbow<00:00:42.239> hinge<00:00:42.840> their<00:00:42.989> double

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
