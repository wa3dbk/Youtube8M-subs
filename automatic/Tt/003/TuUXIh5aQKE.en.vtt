00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.080
 ok chris watch out for me 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.580
 Now do the soundtrack and you take 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.369
 the gameplay just where the video is on 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.349
 17 seconds I start making 123 g 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.970
 and at go through the also of play 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.770
 me exactly at 17 seconds the gameplay 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.800
 has lotte of the school mp info is gone 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.800
 okay, well, perfect then I start now 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.230
 321 what is youtube and cordial 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:48.190
 Welcome to another gameplay 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:49.570
 here german top game play stop people 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.769
 what's up with marseille scorpions? 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.860
 again on the mic for you and you see 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.360
 today a triple nuclear threat kilo 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.369
 You think carrots then and how 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.269
 you can make a living 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.580
 maybe it should be that bad 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.960
 not to be but in any case yes one 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.720
 stair nuclear plays on the name 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.880
 of zoom from the emp clan in any case 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.799
 as apocalypse would say quite hot 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.390
 Iron because this gameplay is easy 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.740
 really blatantly off and a chip in 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.360
 Lukla is working extremely hard 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.189
 connected to the calculator do not know 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.540
 So I do not know who of you everything 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.860
 in normal nuclear could have done 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.409
 her I definitely times in the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.909
 comments reindrÃ¼cken but definitely 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.520
 the game is for time and enlighten 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.570
 always and at the moment on the nuclear 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.939
 I can do the normal nokia now 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.170
 actually relatively common and now it works 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.270
 on it but now I see nokia 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.649
 just a triple nuclear so with the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.450
 1 94 meters in my opinion 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.899
 meanwhile best weapon in all black 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.090
 ops 2 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.409
 and what I find very interesting about it 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.909
 it's just a nuclear stairway because of that 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.439
 so nadja that's almost a 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.140
 time management problem which had since 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.549
 Although yes is a round multi with those 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.929
 most are played for enough 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.880
 I can explain why that is 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.259
 you just have two enemies on one 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.789
 Person not as in ground war and one 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.770
 opponent per person or less quits 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.329
 then 005 enemy per person you 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.130
 just have two opponent professors 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.299
 when things are going well and that's why 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.799
 all the high score is there too 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.030
 currently in multimar plays because of that 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.679
 I also liked a call for the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.999
 have opponents really well under control 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.780
 because you can shoot each other 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.579
 a little bit so, yes 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.850
 attention of those then lost 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.440
 it works and in any case it is 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.930
 time management ruin because a round with 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.360
 it is ten minutes that is one has 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.620
 Well, let's say we spawnen as 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.600
 end also takes a bit like that 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.250
 three minutes for a nuclear time 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.690
 is really blatant because three 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.280
 minutes for a nuclear that means 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.020
 just you have 10 kills per minute 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.000
 and there has to be practical 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.170
 and all the time 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.250
 On the child you can also see it very well 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.380
 actually I have to go to the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.850
 I'm running sports and I'm playing at the moment 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.650
 even with the right bit of amazon the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.880
 first whiskey a 96 better since came here 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.860
 already two games for a mobile phone 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.840
 sorry two games vibrated from the came 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.840
 here too lately high yes and 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.890
 that's why he knows just how 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.180
 works because with the game I 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.620
 had always been so often doing the power 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.670
 really a lot but it is just clear of 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.440
 door as Nokia has even not 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.150
 that's why he would do this 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.860
 gameplay in any case of a likes yes 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.940
 to put it this way because you have to 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.100
 that's really what you are 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.240
 permanently under stress you have the sport 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.560
 just practically all the time 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.670
 just does not know it then manages to do it 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.290
 you really stop because you know 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 if I'm not a kid 30 seconds now 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.630
 do not care enough teachers of the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.370
 not much longer 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.420
 and all the luck you got for it 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.590
 Of course it still needs of course 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.900
 definitely not too 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.940
 So underestimate by three people the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.320
 trip in lukla is really not an easy one 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.140
 history whereby I see that the 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.060
 Most of them I had not thought 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.989
 that's funny the other day he was 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.780
 have played together so my 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.250
 colleague there was just david claire and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.350
 There he was coldly rolled by the ksg 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.530
 it's just so over the top bad find 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.450
 I can definitely go to another 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.799
 topic on the one hand this clear structure 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.380
 currently on youtube masi and indeed 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.610
 this gameplay is clear from the mp and 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.410
 I think at the moment it will be you 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.820
 also noticed that here relative 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.459
 many and many others 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.769
 at the relatively many emp apocalypto 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.810
 Gameplay is easy 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.549
 that they clan the plans like the clans 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.750
 That's what you call it 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.010
 youtube at the moment very widespread 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.630
 are simply meant as a 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.549
 classic statement again 20 people 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.989
 and if you are so dmb or apocalypto clan 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.820
 looks at then you see, of course 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.040
 that also extremely good people are mostly 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.930
 So 20 real beasts, so to speak, yes 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.220
 and if these people then practical 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.600
 Durable gameplay games will be the 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.829
 of course on youtube disseminated what the 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.019
 clan of course a bit more 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.549
 attention brings what we sounded 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.360
 Of course it also brings clicks and stuff 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.040
 on and on 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.209
 and therefore it is easy at the moment so 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.739
 really crass on the start but I know 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.930
 already noticed 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.549
 Well, definitely in the western one 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.840
 jump on this train and 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.070
 Although I have a little mentioned 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.630
 and impact ex clear 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.400
 This one can be on all consoles 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.060
 represent so on the playstation or 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.770
 xbox 360 and on the pc and on everyone 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.300
 case, I hereby offer you to mine 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.560
 To visit the channel link in the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.060
 video description and then there everyone 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.410
 information about the clear channel too 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.729
 because I now also incidentally 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.969
 operate because if you the small one 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.259
 channel and my channel 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.369
 Do you have the chance at the clear tournament 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.239
 what I will align in the near future 

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:44.979
 to agree 

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:46.149
 So if the good player says that we are 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.409
 in any case the correctness says because 

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:48.489
 i still have nice people for it 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.509
 Of course, it's not all good again 

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:50.529
 is a complete nonsense that the 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.129
 Sympathy is definitely in the 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:52.599
 foreground 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.679
 That's why I thought of the audience 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.599
 Here I can talk again 

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:57.610
 So I'm so easy here, so to speak 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.929
 to visit main channel to me 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.489
 Subscribe in any case with in the 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:02.709
 complaining tournament in any case 

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:03.759
 far comes because people in a small 

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:05.409
 too late right bock I have now 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.549
 First of all, I've experienced that too 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.839
 I play a bit in the team because of me 

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:09.219
 my, you just can not do that much 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:10.779
 otherwise, if you have fun now, have fun 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.309
 Robbie plays that was just right 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:13.239
 fun is always where the kids are 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:15.309
 come here because we just in each 

00:05:13.239 --> 00:05:16.329
 round duration orbital have with you think 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:17.589
 the swag on two still reasonably 

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:18.610
 bearable because without shit I am there 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:19.899
 The game was honest with you 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.309
 to throw in the trash cans because 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:22.569
 I just do not have fun at all 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:25.209
 So that was right 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.439
 bad in any case, yes let's hear 

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:27.999
 in any case, this yellowish like 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.019
 for the crass chip in nuclear 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.939
 this job is a must 

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:32.139
 to be told again and looks like 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.129
 Shortly said to me when the buck 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.699
 and it does not work out, too 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.589
 not bad 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.419
 He then rings skin clean until 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.419
 next time marcel
