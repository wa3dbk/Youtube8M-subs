even<00:02:42.810> though<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.140> ipad<00:02:43.470> mini<00:02:43.500> will<00:02:44.010> be<00:02:44.130> a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
even though the ipad mini will be a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.300 
even though the ipad mini will be a
little<00:02:44.520> wider<00:02:45.030> than<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.990> nexus<00:02:46.320> 7<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:46.980> it

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
little wider than the nexus 7 and it

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.380 
little wider than the nexus 7 and it
seems<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.910> way<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:49.110> closer<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:50.390> you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
seems to be that way it's closer to you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.540 
seems to be that way it's closer to you
know<00:02:51.510> something<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.440> isn't<00:02:53.160> going<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.400> take

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
know something that isn't going to take

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.240 
know something that isn't going to take
two<00:02:53.730> hands<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.150> hold<00:02:54.330> or<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:55.250> actually

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
two hands to hold or to actually

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.730 
two hands to hold or to actually
navigate<00:02:56.930> certainly<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.110> will<00:02:58.260> be<00:02:58.410> smaller

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
navigate certainly it will be smaller

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.610 
navigate certainly it will be smaller
