00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi to all the boys and welcome his 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.240
 Today IT gaming gives overseas I want 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.580
 show you for once not late 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.440
 those that were metal drop meccano 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.480
 the night of this week that is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.099
 that sucks that breaking of bales 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 why say that this is the definition 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.390
 more appropriate than cerberus by terzo 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.460
 the one with the stau is the only one up 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.160
 mars available for both 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.140
 platforms and without the embers therefore there 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.090
 it takes about 20 minutes to complete it 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 going really fast without it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.689
 get lost in small talk of this 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.250
 week with my first character 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.680
 the soccer player I found a close of 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.899
 secret hand a shotgun that I have 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 immediately discarded one because I already had it 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.070
 found so many past and did not like it 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.960
 after trying this because of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.850
 statistics that are quite low 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.710
 quite mediocre, much weaker 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.559
 of pump shotgun statistics 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.360
 he normally uses hide and seek 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.610
 secondly because he had perks 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.440
 shit I said in a comment me 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.510
 apparently of the last saw but I repeat it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.730
 even now when I look for weapons 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.949
 legendary in the night I love you 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.140
 I only look for if they have at least three gods 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.489
 four because you mention what I mean 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.350
 you all know the weapons have a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.850
 available two main bonuses plus 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.250
 two below upgrades as I call them 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.720
 me where you can choose one of the three 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.310
 bonus available 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 that's about weapons 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.360
 legendary I try to have at least three 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.439
 of these four bonus good points 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.060
 decent 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.680
 if this is not the case I will delete the weapon 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.360
 simply because I know I can 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.040
 find the best in the future is this 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.790
 the reason why I discarded this 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.920
 Shotgun 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.320
 second night , you will have read it 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.630
 even the title was now finally got 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.909
 found my second orange 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.770
 alarms how the fuck you want to call ron 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.930
 so let's say what the week is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.610
 I was one of those sculae I tell you 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 second because as you might already have 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.990
 seen in my past 11 videos too much 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.990
 hygiene the same that came out tlc and darkness 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.850
 from the deep bang that remains if they are 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 aware and having as a goal 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.759
 that of having at least three copies of 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.860
 all the weapons that I'm sure of 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.990
 Use the strongest weapons you know it 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.759
 break ice that the Roma are 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.960
 glad to have finally found the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.909
 my second 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.890
 needless to say more because I presume 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.880
 you all know that in Rome it is the gallaro 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.099
 as I call it 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.660
 then if it's right, I don't know and finally 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.910
 to finish off my third 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.520
 and last canada 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.890
 I found 9 energy ascendants a 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.840
 pretty shitty group because over 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.430
 not to use it does not run to 300 aside 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.440
 but to finish this week 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.120
 let us say that I am satisfied and satisfied 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.710
 to have the gallion the weapon that to 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.240
 moment is one of the strongest in the game 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.120
 and the more I found you my second 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.830
 precisely of this rocket launcher and I am
