 always said and like this epidemic 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.099
 but the government also spoke in 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.680
 Fundraising is great opinion 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.730
 journals artists musicians for example 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.800
 compared to that when we see by 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.619
 example in our country 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.210
 conscious crisis there is a problem the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.009
 harvest times you have the impression 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.300
 that our artists to us church a little 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.290
 this side also humanitarian of their 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.730
 work why this trial to artists 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.950
 about the artists who are in charge of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.120
 mobilize the crowds no how he has me 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.500
 says why not because without them 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 compatriots who is cut off when visiting 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.660
 artists can come only was 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.100
 pushed without a napole into one that have the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.219
 charge 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.289
 do you find normal that your 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.480
 fine command traffic the v2 are 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.449
 to get $ 2 3 million for 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.940
 fight the waitress this is what we 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.439
 we said if I feared I hope the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 sick 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:09.570
 I hope because if this is the case we 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.090
 will tell me that the like we do not have too much 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.680
 well dollars to put in this center 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.479
 Fortunately Miss happening to us that I 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.150
 you address back and training the army 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.320
 national he told us no they received 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.450
 orders from the higher hierarchy 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.180
 to put enough money for 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.320
 whether it is inna Congolese land and that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.970
 we rejoiced because we were 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.759
 worried to learn that our 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.049
 government is on the quest for two 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.329
 millions and a half dollars for 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.150
 fight this mixture had to be prompted to 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.340
 really start madam I come back on 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.950
 some I consider to be 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.479
 network things is simply 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.430
 a government that jumped on 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.360
 the opportunity to go offer two million 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.899
 five hundred thousand dollars 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.250
 in haiti a few years ago and want 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.310
 you have your letters start on 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.040
 buys a fund call you say that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.920
 you need 2500 I hope and 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.750
 misunderstandings I hope but now I 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.190
 believe that we are all soothed because 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.410
 that the government has told us 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.710
 reassured we put the means to 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.600
 seal national deputy 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.180
 it's really the amount will be a lot 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.770
 higher for wealth 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.180
 scientific and health not so health 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.910
 Health is priceless 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 1 and the situation in which we 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.580
 are today he does not have any bonuses 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.590
 reduce your remuneration for example 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.270
 your whole salary but good for 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.950
 increase why not but only if 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.780
 she stayed there but it does not want 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.160
 to be taboo in not there it's because 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.110
 we talked about it but I wonder 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.940
 ask me the question if this envelope 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.340
 by decreasing it she will really do 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.020
 what it takes to increase the wrapped 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.190
 at the level of the diffusion recession such 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.480
 the question is not to decrease by one 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.830
 side the defense is to find the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.780
 means is to find money 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.900
 we are a country that must see who has 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.140
 a budget a capacity and mining in 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.400
 the monuments a capacity of 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.520
 mobilization of four billion 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.610
 dollars for a budget from a neighboring country 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.340
 of angola that to 81 billion dollars 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.290
 of budget and you ask me to go 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.820
 state dinner can remove all 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.050
 emoluments of all the deputies 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.600
 you will adjust the apples of how 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.520
 I do not think that we want in 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.140
 this moment is to bring back those who are 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.940
 at low level let's say more interesting at 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.860
 instead of waiting for those who are in 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.690
 know it's not normal it's all about 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.880
 does agree with you in the wc that 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.489
 have helped is to look no there are people 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.440
 who have too much population not 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.030
 it wonders first population 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.310
 to improve their daily lives 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.070
 the everyday life of the population we 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.930
 sit on gold money 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.910
 diamond as much all the reserves and the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.950
 most important wealth is the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.070
 human resource that we study this past 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.489
 No, I think we should not let 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.550
 scapegoats it's the deputies the 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.890
 senators there is a leader this is the 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.750
 government that actually faces 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.850
 against damascus one is oneself not the oil 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.110
 in this country like those of others but 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.450
 normal that we do not exploit the contract 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.070
 that we lose exploits we see it we 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.000
 do not even see the fallout in the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.130
 series 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.870
 fights in the state incomes of which 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.920
 I think it's necessary to do this 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.930
 which is important it was the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.540
 government sets up a 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.470
 policy for good mentor 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.420
 economic activities that the country is at 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.700
 the height of his answers 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.000
 the defendants because there we are 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.640
 in one in a kind of twice he 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.050
 is that foreigners expats who 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.760
 is in the sixth line 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.070
 they get rich they pass and the 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.760
 convince that we are going to put his de 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.980
 cover ends under these conditions then 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.500
 I saw more tinder thiam 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.780
 ordinary condition that they speak to me 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.380
 that is with one hand ten elected seven 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.910
 civilians killed because we are talking about an 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.120
 show them in south africa that me 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.500
 want them to surprise us and who 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.850
 affect us a lot because we 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.020
 think he would put forward as 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.600
 vanina knows too little 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.760
 ok so really that his soul is resting in 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.990
 peace because our army just lost a 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.990
 venom brave soldiers
