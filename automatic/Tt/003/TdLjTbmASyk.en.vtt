about right now uh I want to convince
you<00:00:56.910> all<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.270> subtlety<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.870> still<00:00:58.140> an

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you all that subtlety is still an

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.979 
you all that subtlety is still an
amazing<00:00:58.649> spec<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.789> honestly<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.750> it's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
amazing spec and I honestly think it's

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
amazing spec and I honestly think it's
better<00:01:01.500> than<00:01:01.770> mutilated<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> know<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.670> ton

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
better than mutilated and I know a ton

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.160 
better than mutilated and I know a ton
of<00:01:02.940> people<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.239> gonna<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.870> ass<00:01:04.019> about

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
of people are gonna be on my ass about

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.460 
of people are gonna be on my ass about
that<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.630> can't<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.869> over<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> fact<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that but I can't get over the fact that

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.980 
that but I can't get over the fact that
subtlety<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.159> still<00:01:08.549> very<00:01:08.939> viable<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.869> right

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
subtlety is still very viable all right

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.080 
subtlety is still very viable all right
now<00:01:10.080> basically<00:01:10.439> subtlety<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.760> high

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
now basically subtlety is the very high

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.200 
now basically subtlety is the very high
burst<00:01:12.450> spec<00:01:12.840> um<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:14.340> only<00:01:14.760> problem<00:01:15.000> with

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
burst spec um the only problem with

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.999 
burst spec um the only problem with
mutilate<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.259> consistent

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
mutilate is that it's got consistent

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
mutilate is that it's got consistent
damage<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.939> there's<00:01:18.180> hardly<00:01:18.570> any<00:01:18.930> burst<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
damage but there's hardly any burst and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.219 
damage but there's hardly any burst and
it's<00:01:20.250> good<00:01:20.610> damage<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.930> arena

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
it's good damage but you know in arena

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.310 
it's good damage but you know in arena
and<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.979> PvP<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.670> general<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.299> need<00:01:24.570> burst<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and in PvP in general you need burst to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.980 
and in PvP in general you need burst to
do<00:01:25.439> anything<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.909> subtlety<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.630> still<00:01:27.869> my

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
do anything so subtlety is still my

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
in a full kidney and then I shadow

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.370 
in a full kidney and then I shadow
blades<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> kidney<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.630> usually<00:01:45.960> will

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
blades that kidney and that usually will

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.200 
blades that kidney and that usually will
force<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.890> trinket<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.729> they<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:47.970> drink

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
force a trinket and if they don't drink

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.030 
force a trinket and if they don't drink
it<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.750> they're<00:01:49.110> gonna<00:01:49.320> take<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> lot<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it then they're gonna take a lot of

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160 
it then they're gonna take a lot of
damage<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.119> trinket<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:51.899> that

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
damage but if they do trinket then that

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.710 
damage but if they do trinket then that
will<00:01:52.380> leave<00:01:52.530> them<00:01:52.680> open<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.310> full<00:01:53.970> cheap<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
will leave them open to a full cheap the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.300 
will leave them open to a full cheap the
next<00:01:54.960> time<00:01:55.079> i<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.259> my<00:01:55.350> shadow<00:01:55.560> dance<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:55.979> so

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
next time i get my shadow dance up so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.280 
next time i get my shadow dance up so
yeah<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.820> kind<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.360> lose-lose<00:01:57.780> situation

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
yeah it's kind of a lose-lose situation

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.020 
yeah it's kind of a lose-lose situation
for<00:01:58.320> them<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.759> about<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.969> like

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
for them but like think about it like

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.850 
for them but like think about it like
this<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.840> pop<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.290> shadow<00:02:01.590> blades

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
this if you pop your shadow blades

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.740 
this if you pop your shadow blades
alongside<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.850> shadow<00:02:03.030> dance<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.570> can

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
alongside your shadow dance they can

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.179 
alongside your shadow dance they can
just<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.049> deterrence<00:02:04.560> or<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.070> ice

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
just like deterrence or they can ice

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.100 
just like deterrence or they can ice
block<00:02:05.460> or<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.329> something<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> get

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
block or they can do something to get

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.050 
block or they can do something to get
away<00:02:07.229> from<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.799> your<00:02:08.160> cooldowns<00:02:08.550> all<00:02:08.819> at

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
away from all of your cooldowns all at

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.630 
away from all of your cooldowns all at
once<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:10.110> they<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:11.310> you're<00:02:11.520> out

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
once and if they do that then you're out

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.820 
once and if they do that then you're out
of<00:02:11.670> cool<00:02:11.879> downs

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
of cool downs

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.510 
of cool downs
and<00:02:12.950> they're<00:02:13.550> not<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.590> you're<00:02:15.860> all

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
and they're not and you're all

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.890 
and they're not and you're all
right<00:02:16.610> one<00:02:16.850> thing<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.210> I<00:02:17.330> want<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.780> mention

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
right one thing that I want to mention

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.130 
right one thing that I want to mention
for<00:02:18.440> sure<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.860> always<00:02:19.760> use<00:02:19.970> backstab<00:02:20.570> now

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
for sure is always use backstab now

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.590 
for sure is always use backstab now
backstab<00:02:21.650> cost<00:02:22.160> five<00:02:22.490> more<00:02:22.790> energy<00:02:23.150> than<00:02:23.360> he

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
backstab cost five more energy than he

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.320 
backstab cost five more energy than he
mo<00:02:23.720> does<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.170> he<00:02:24.800> mo<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.310> honestly<00:02:25.700> does<00:02:26.090> not

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
mo does and he mo just honestly does not

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.790 
mo does and he mo just honestly does not
uh<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:28.640> not<00:02:28.820> good<00:02:29.180> basically<00:02:30.080> it's<00:02:30.440> kind<00:02:30.680> of

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
uh it's not good basically it's kind of

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.430 
uh it's not good basically it's kind of
bad<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.310> every<00:02:31.760> way<00:02:31.910> possible<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.900> only<00:02:33.260> time

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
bad in every way possible the only time

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.950 
bad in every way possible the only time
i<00:02:33.470> use<00:02:33.740> he<00:02:33.920> mo<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.280> one<00:02:35.000> when<00:02:35.420> i<00:02:35.450> can't<00:02:35.810> get

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
i use he mo is one when i can't get

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.530 
i use he mo is one when i can't get
behind<00:02:36.110> them<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.650> use<00:02:36.770> backstab<00:02:37.250> are<00:02:37.490> two<00:02:38.180> when

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
behind them to use backstab are two when

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.750 
behind them to use backstab are two when
I<00:02:38.570> want<00:02:38.870> quicker<00:02:39.170> combo<00:02:39.650> points<00:02:39.800> because<00:02:40.520> that

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
I want quicker combo points because that

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.340 
I want quicker combo points because that
five<00:02:40.940> energy<00:02:41.330> does<00:02:41.600> add<00:02:41.810> up<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:42.140> if<00:02:42.260> I

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
five energy does add up like if I

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.470 
five energy does add up like if I
desperately<00:02:42.830> need<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.430> redirect<00:02:44.150> kidney<00:02:44.360> on<00:02:44.450> a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
desperately need a redirect kidney on a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.820 
desperately need a redirect kidney on a
healer<00:02:44.810> or<00:02:44.870> something<00:02:45.200> then<00:02:45.380> I'll<00:02:45.470> chemo<00:02:45.800> for

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
healer or something then I'll chemo for

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.760 
healer or something then I'll chemo for
that<00:02:46.100> redirect<00:02:46.490> kidney<00:02:46.810> but<00:02:47.810> still<00:02:48.170> backstab

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
that redirect kidney but still backstab

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.770 
that redirect kidney but still backstab
is<00:02:49.040> usually<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.490> way<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.640> go<00:02:49.790> one<00:02:50.330> thing<00:02:50.570> if

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
is usually the way to go one thing if

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.449 
is usually the way to go one thing if
you<00:02:50.900> cannot<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.470> behind<00:02:51.770> your<00:02:51.950> target<00:02:52.310> like

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
you cannot get behind your target like

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.820 
you cannot get behind your target like
if<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.670> cannot<00:02:53.030> backstab<00:02:53.510> then<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.170> would<00:02:54.530> hemo

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
if you cannot backstab then I would hemo

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.770 
if you cannot backstab then I would hemo
because<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.730> worst<00:02:56.000> thing<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.330> can<00:02:56.450> do<00:02:56.630> as<00:02:56.750> a

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
because the worst thing you can do as a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.840 
because the worst thing you can do as a
rogue<00:02:56.990> is<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.410> get<00:02:57.560> energy<00:02:57.980> capped<00:02:58.220> because

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
rogue is to get energy capped because

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.310 
rogue is to get energy capped because
think<00:02:59.030> about<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.270> like<00:02:59.330> this<00:02:59.510> when<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.290> are

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
think about it like this when you are

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.550 
think about it like this when you are
full<00:03:00.770> on<00:03:00.800> energy<00:03:01.370> you're<00:03:02.209> not<00:03:02.450> regen<00:03:03.050> at<00:03:03.410> all

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
full on energy you're not regen at all

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.680 
full on energy you're not regen at all
that's<00:03:04.070> wasted<00:03:04.610> time<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.209> could<00:03:05.540> be

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
that's wasted time that you could be

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.480 
that's wasted time that you could be
regen<00:03:06.110> again<00:03:06.320> urge<00:03:06.440> e<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:07.040> want<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.340> make<00:03:07.459> sure

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
regen again urge e you want to make sure

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.240 
regen again urge e you want to make sure
that<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.910> always<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:09.140> never<00:03:09.620> get<00:03:09.890> energy

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
that you always just never get energy

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.250 
that you always just never get energy
capped<00:03:10.459> because<00:03:11.180> if<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.420> do<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.870> lose<00:03:12.080> out<00:03:12.230> on

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
capped because if you do you lose out on

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.800 
capped because if you do you lose out on
dps<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.040> it's<00:03:13.550> just<00:03:13.880> it's<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.150> bad<00:03:14.300> thing<00:03:14.510> so

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
dps and it's just it's a bad thing so

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
dps and it's just it's a bad thing so
always<00:03:14.990> make<00:03:15.140> sure<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.530> you're<00:03:15.650> sitting

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
always make sure that you're sitting

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.410 
always make sure that you're sitting
underneath<00:03:16.250> your<00:03:16.520> max<00:03:16.730> energy<00:03:16.940> when<00:03:17.300> you're

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
underneath your max energy when you're

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.390 
underneath your max energy when you're
in<00:03:17.540> combat<00:03:17.720> another<00:03:18.620> good<00:03:18.769> option<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.220> if

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
in combat another good option is if

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.160
