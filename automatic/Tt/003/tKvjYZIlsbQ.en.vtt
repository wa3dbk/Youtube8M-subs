00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this recipe last night with I used

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
this recipe last night with I used
romaine<00:01:33.360> lettuce<00:01:33.600> was<00:01:34.229> very<00:01:34.500> good<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
romaine lettuce was very good but I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.640 
romaine lettuce was very good but I
think<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:36.030> Chinese<00:01:36.780> chicken

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.630 
think that when I make Chinese chicken
salad<00:01:38.750> normally<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.170> vlcd<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.860> use<00:01:41.280> cabbage

percent<00:04:58.770> pure<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.849> says<00:05:00.150> well<00:05:00.449> in<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.750> back<00:05:01.020> if

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
percent pure it says well in the back if

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.310 
percent pure it says well in the back if
you'll<00:05:01.590> notice<00:05:01.849> there<00:05:02.849> are<00:05:03.120> five<00:05:03.630> grams<00:05:04.110> of

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
you'll notice there are five grams of

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.800 
you'll notice there are five grams of
carbohydrates<00:05:05.039> and<00:05:05.310> those<00:05:05.699> account<00:05:06.210> for<00:05:06.570> the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
carbohydrates and those account for the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
carbohydrates and those account for the
sugar<00:05:07.020> there<00:05:07.320> sugar<00:05:07.800> in<00:05:08.160> this<00:05:09.110> vinegar<00:05:10.110> there

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
sugar there sugar in this vinegar there

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.800 
sugar there sugar in this vinegar there
is<00:05:10.919> no<00:05:11.130> sugar<00:05:11.490> in<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.789> red<00:05:11.970> wine<00:05:12.180> vinegar<00:05:12.630> so

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
is no sugar in the red wine vinegar so

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.790 
is no sugar in the red wine vinegar so
that's<00:05:12.960> why<00:05:13.139> I'm<00:05:13.289> going<00:05:13.410> to<00:05:13.500> use<00:05:13.620> this

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
that's why I'm going to use this

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.270

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
although the best pop would probably be

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.580 
although the best pop would probably be
apple<00:05:17.280> cider<00:05:17.550> vinegar<00:05:18.050> would<00:05:19.050> be<00:05:19.169> very<00:05:19.320> good
