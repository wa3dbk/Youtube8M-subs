later or you can use um ghost stuff and
put<00:04:09.540> miso<00:04:11.600> in<00:04:12.600> here<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:15.590> dumped<00:04:16.590> in<00:04:16.980> that<00:04:17.340> miso

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
put miso in here and dumped in that miso

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.440 
put miso in here and dumped in that miso
soup<00:04:18.270> and<00:04:18.650> mixed<00:04:19.650> with<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.160> that<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:21.180> the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
soup and mixed with it in that is the

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:29.150 
soup and mixed with it in that is the
other<00:04:21.600> way<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:24.890> liquid<00:04:26.090> fold<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.240> up<00:04:28.040> kind<00:04:29.040> of

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
other way to liquid fold this up kind of

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.960 
other way to liquid fold this up kind of
solve<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.669> miso<00:04:30.240> but<00:04:31.140> if<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.370> don't<00:04:32.580> have<00:04:32.760> that

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
solve it miso but if you don't have that

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.110 
solve it miso but if you don't have that
that's<00:04:33.150> fine<00:04:33.480> just<00:04:33.840> dump<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:35.250> missile<00:04:35.640> inside

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
that's fine just dump the missile inside

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.060 
that's fine just dump the missile inside
and<00:04:37.340> maybe<00:04:38.340> 30<00:04:38.850> second<00:04:39.740> miso<00:04:40.740> going<00:04:40.980> to

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
and maybe 30 second miso going to

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.550 
and maybe 30 second miso going to
dissolve

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.750 

you<00:04:43.700> gently<00:04:44.700> mix<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.919> you<00:04:49.980> still<00:04:50.310> have<00:04:50.520> this

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
you gently mix so you still have this

00:04:50.760 --> 00:05:04.560 
you gently mix so you still have this
one

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.990 

when<00:05:05.570> me<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.230> is<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:07.670> so<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:10.610> is<00:05:10.820> the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
when me so is it so this is the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.230 
when me so is it so this is the
Mississippi<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.750> you<00:05:12.590> taste<00:05:12.980> it<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.550> it's

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
Mississippi and you taste it and it's

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.510 
Mississippi and you taste it and it's
too<00:05:14.750> weak<00:05:15.110> put<00:05:15.770> more<00:05:16.430> miso<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:18.070> hopefully<00:05:19.070> you

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
too weak put more miso and hopefully you

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.550 
too weak put more miso and hopefully you
don't<00:05:19.730> put<00:05:19.940> too<00:05:19.970> much<00:05:20.260> missile<00:05:21.260> from

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
don't put too much missile from

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.290 
don't put too much missile from
beginning<00:05:22.070> but<00:05:22.820> if<00:05:23.620> too<00:05:24.620> strong<00:05:25.400> which<00:05:25.760> is<00:05:25.790> too

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
beginning but if too strong which is too

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.320 
beginning but if too strong which is too
salty<00:05:26.780> maybe<00:05:27.710> you<00:05:27.920> have<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.340> add<00:05:28.520> more<00:05:29.030> water

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
salty maybe you have to add more water

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:39.040 
salty maybe you have to add more water
or<00:05:30.100> dashi<00:05:31.100> stock<00:05:36.790> so<00:05:37.790> this<00:05:38.300> is<00:05:38.510> how<00:05:38.750> to<00:05:38.810> make

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
or dashi stock so this is how to make

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.860 
or dashi stock so this is how to make
authentic<00:05:40.210> Japanese<00:05:41.210> miso<00:05:41.870> soup<00:05:42.290> and

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
basically you can use any vegetables

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.380 
basically you can use any vegetables
from<00:05:47.300> your<00:05:47.600> refrigerator<00:05:48.170> and<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.760> recommend

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
mushroom mushrooms taste very good and

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.840 
mushroom mushrooms taste very good and
also<00:05:53.090> fried<00:05:53.870> tofu<00:05:54.170> which<00:05:54.860> is<00:05:55.040> very<00:05:55.280> good<00:05:55.520> and

also fried tofu which is very good and

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.590 
also fried tofu which is very good and
we<00:05:55.940> don't<00:05:56.840> call<00:05:57.080> it's<00:05:57.980> miso<00:05:58.310> soup<00:05:58.670> but<00:05:59.090> we

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
we don't call it's miso soup but we

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.160 
we don't call it's miso soup but we
sometimes<00:06:00.020> put<00:06:00.560> pork<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:01.820> that<00:06:02.510> is<00:06:02.660> very<00:06:02.900> good

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
sometimes put pork and that is very good

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.000 
sometimes put pork and that is very good
because<00:06:03.410> of<00:06:03.800> fat<00:06:04.070> flavor<00:06:04.510> but<00:06:05.510> anyway<00:06:06.050> this<00:06:06.770> is

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
because of fat flavor but anyway this is

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.360 
because of fat flavor but anyway this is
