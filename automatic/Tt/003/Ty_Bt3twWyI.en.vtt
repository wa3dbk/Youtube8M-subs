that<00:01:35.820> was<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.450> took<00:01:36.689> us<00:01:36.750> 86<00:01:37.650> 87

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
that was because it just took us 86 87

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.950 
that was because it just took us 86 87
88<00:01:38.490> minutes<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.060> finally<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.509> over<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> line

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
88 minutes to finally get over the line

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.450 
88 minutes to finally get over the line

and get that goal what do / team was

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.550 
and get that goal what do / team was
trying<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> defend<00:01:42.030> against<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:43.170> I'm

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
trying to defend against this now I'm

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.410 
trying to defend against this now I'm
not<00:01:44.009> asking<00:01:44.310> us<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> play<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:45.210> Sir<00:01:45.390> Alex

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
not asking us to play like Sir Alex

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.050 
not asking us to play like Sir Alex
Ferguson<00:01:46.200> side<00:01:46.500> I'm<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:47.369> asking<00:01:47.640> us<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> play

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
Ferguson side I'm not asking us to play

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.690 
Ferguson side I'm not asking us to play
like<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.079> Busby<00:01:49.409> Babes<00:01:49.439> blades<00:01:49.979> all<00:01:50.340> I'm

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
like the Busby Babes blades all I'm

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.819 
like the Busby Babes blades all I'm
asking<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.329> good<00:01:51.689> competent<00:01:52.320> football

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
asking for is good competent football

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.590 
asking for is good competent football
because<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:53.460> not<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:53.759> we've<00:01:54.060> seen<00:01:54.329> in

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
because that's not what we've seen in

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
because that's not what we've seen in
this<00:01:54.750> recent<00:01:54.990> run<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.829> might<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.310> picked

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this recent run now we might have picked

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.459 
this recent run now we might have picked
up<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.790> lot<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> points<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.570> also<00:01:57.840> think<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.259> lost

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
up a lot of points I also think we lost

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.410 
up a lot of points I also think we lost
a<00:01:58.680> lot<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.829> points<00:01:59.280> points<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.329> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
a lot of points points that are going to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
a lot of points points that are going to
be<00:02:00.540> massively<00:02:01.049> key<00:02:01.320> when<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.560> comes<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
be massively key when it comes to the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.310 
be massively key when it comes to the
end<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> season<00:02:02.369> too<00:02:03.180> many<00:02:03.420> stupid<00:02:03.750> draws

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
end of the season too many stupid draws

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.119 
end of the season too many stupid draws
and<00:02:05.180> yeah<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.390> could<00:02:06.630> say<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.020> couple<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.469> stupid

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
and yeah I could say a couple of stupid

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
and yeah I could say a couple of stupid
defeats<00:02:08.640> especially<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:09.810> today

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
defeats especially this one today

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.220 
defeats especially this one today
because<00:02:10.790> draw<00:02:11.790> was<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> minimum<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:12.989> got

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
because draw was a minimum that we got

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.880 
because draw was a minimum that we got
our<00:02:13.319> expert

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
our expert

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.040 
our expert
go<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> places<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.550> Swansea<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.630> can't<00:02:15.900> be

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
go to places like Swansea we can't be

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.440 
go to places like Swansea we can't be
coming<00:02:16.380> away<00:02:16.590> with<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.220> loss<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.790> going<00:02:18.060> oh<00:02:18.240> it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
coming away with a loss and going oh it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.720 
coming away with a loss and going oh it
wasn't<00:02:18.660> one<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.900> those<00:02:19.050> days<00:02:19.350> because<00:02:20.250> it

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
wasn't one of those days because it

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.370 
wasn't one of those days because it
wasn't<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.209> those<00:02:21.360> days<00:02:21.630> for<00:02:21.840> us<00:02:21.900> today<00:02:22.080> I

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
wasn't one of those days for us today I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.430 
wasn't one of those days for us today I
thought<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.459> played<00:02:23.610> better<00:02:24.080> now<00:02:25.080> there's<00:02:25.380> a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
thought we played better now there's a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.780 
thought we played better now there's a
difference<00:02:25.800> between<00:02:25.860> saying<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.490> we<00:02:26.580> played

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
difference between saying that we played

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.059 
difference between saying that we played
well<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.600> played<00:02:27.840> bad<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> lot<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.890> use

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
well and we played bad and a lot of use

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.310 
well and we played bad and a lot of use
don't<00:02:29.340> seem<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.700> get<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.330> concept<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.050> there

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
don't seem to get the concept that there

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.610 
don't seem to get the concept that there
isn't<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.100> yes<00:02:33.000> or<00:02:33.180> no<00:02:33.240> good<00:02:34.200> or<00:02:34.380> bad

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
isn't just a yes or no good or bad

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.280 
isn't just a yes or no good or bad
answer<00:02:35.010> we've<00:02:36.000> been<00:02:36.240> playing<00:02:36.510> poorly<00:02:36.930> and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
answer we've been playing poorly and

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.990 
answer we've been playing poorly and
sometimes<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.070> been<00:02:38.220> better<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.760> sometimes

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
sometimes it's been better and sometimes

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.449 
sometimes it's been better and sometimes
it's<00:02:39.390> been<00:02:39.600> worse<00:02:39.870> but<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.709> never<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.130> good

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
it's been worse but it's never just good

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.530 
it's been worse but it's never just good
or<00:02:41.670> bad<00:02:42.290> today<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.739> was<00:02:43.980> slightly<00:02:44.550> better<00:02:44.850> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
or bad today it was slightly better and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.990 
or bad today it was slightly better and
we<00:02:46.050> still<00:02:46.290> lost<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.280> does<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.489> mean<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.730> we

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
we still lost so does that mean that we

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.270 
we still lost so does that mean that we
should<00:02:48.180> just<00:02:48.390> accept<00:02:48.810> poor<00:02:49.380> performances<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
should just accept poor performances and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.370 
should just accept poor performances and
hope<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.610> we<00:02:50.760> get<00:02:50.880> lucky<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.600> come<00:02:51.840> over<00:02:52.110> win

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
hope that we get lucky and come over win

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.680 
hope that we get lucky and come over win
no<00:02:52.920> because<00:02:53.370> good<00:02:53.790> performances<00:02:54.480> will

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
no because good performances will

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.040 
no because good performances will
eventually<00:02:55.230> lead<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.500> good<00:02:56.070> results<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:58.019> same

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
eventually lead to good results the same

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.140 
eventually lead to good results the same
way<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:58.709> today<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.220> bad<00:02:59.459> performances

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
way like today that bad performances

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.840 
way like today that bad performances
eventually<00:03:00.660> lead<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.230> be<00:03:01.380> coming<00:03:01.850> unstuck

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
eventually lead to you be coming unstuck

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.720 
eventually lead to you be coming unstuck
and<00:03:03.300> getting<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.140> defeat<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:05.130> I've<00:03:05.489> made

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730

some notes on it I'm trying to remember

possession in midfield today which I

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.749 
possession in midfield today which I
thought<00:06:11.110> was<00:06:11.229> a<00:06:11.289> massive<00:06:11.770> step<00:06:12.220> forward<00:06:12.610> in<00:06:12.699> a
