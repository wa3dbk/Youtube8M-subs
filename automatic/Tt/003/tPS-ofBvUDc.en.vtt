00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.320
 me and on with my baby 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.419
 Week one or the other 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.369
 have noticed that after the fifth 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.839
 video or after the sixth the seventh 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.060
 and eighth did not come 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.189
 because my little one is a bit sad 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.999
 what got sick and yes there goes the 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.100
 family stop 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.560
 but now it goes on and today gives 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.540
 it the video to our buggy many 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.310
 asked me what we thought 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.450
 twin cars have what a buggy 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.610
 We drive and our estate car has the hab 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.530
 I was selling from easy loose 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.750
 Unfortunately , I have only photos but in the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.490
 internet could just google it 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.420
 and you will be well with information 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.790
 be served 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.720
 we were very happy with the easy 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.210
 walker yes because he was really great 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.430
 because he was so narrow so 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.409
 I am even good at the apartment 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.820
 Come through the doors I hope so 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.829
 only 75 inches wide or 74 so came 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.840
 really through all the doors in the house and 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.210
 I could also see the babies in the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.439
 pram so calm in the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.509
 twin cars exactly 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.229
 and the good thing is that you stop that 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.539
 Tubs then has them as buggy later 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.719
 can transform and also if you can 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.569
 The maxi cosi gets the adapter as well 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.429
 So it really can make a difference 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.619
 beautiful dare look at him 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.770
 of course he has his price he costs 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 I can so around 1200 euro if you 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.710
 So yes, buy everything so complete 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.950
 Kombipaket that he maybe 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.069
 interesting for those who actually have one 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.929
 booker book so want to get one 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.959
 buga brewdog ii is called exactly that 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.420
 costs new, I believe from 1800 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.359
 euro and that's just a good one 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.600
 alternative is just as fast as that 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.420
 beautiful 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.130
 the only thing the ise loose 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.810
 not that you can stop the buggies 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.319
 walde 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.060
 can set directions so in the easy 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.340
 Walker is just that way you can 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.590
 in the direction of travel put in the buga 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.569
 bodo kiep is that just so that you stop 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.120
 yes you can choose both chair you have to 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.690
 just look what you prefer but from 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.790
 In any case, a great recommendation 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.209
 Now we have a buggy because we 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.890
 just the rest of the stroller 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.650
 just did not need it anymore and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.620
 A buggy is also enough for us 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.390
 years ago we experienced on vacation we drive 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.540
 now on vacation, we just wanted 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.910
 something small handy and yes 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.950
 I'll show you now our new 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.569
 buggy we have and so I hope that 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.630
 you like the video and you also switch 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.610
 tomorrow one to the last video of this 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.130
 Baby is the one I owe anyway 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.200
 have called and hope that you this 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.630
 series has fallen off you go with the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.330
 buggy and that's our buggy and he is 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.190
 kept in a nice anthracite so 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.319
 Can you really for girls and boys 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.600
 use 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.850
 he is so small for a twin 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.850
 they were small and that was us too 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.519
 very important because he is for the holidays 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.620
 want to use something very important to me 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.560
 was also that he steered very well 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.160
 is also agile and that's him 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.530
 So you can steer it with one hand 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.709
 and I was also important that I stop 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.569
 get started everywhere 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.720
 here you see again the special 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.579
 protection is also great when the sun is shining 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.269
 too strong in the stroller or buggy 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.560
 seems you also times since 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.630
 you can always keep the children 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.120
 see that we are not good too you can 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.920
 to stop or leave open like that 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.690
 I like it most of the time 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.700
 open so I also so what the children 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.620
 do 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.690
 here you have another bin me 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.700
 do become clean my drink as more 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.400
 you see again or in here 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.159
 pacifier replacement pacifier down here 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.530
 the baskets were there, i always put them 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.299
 jack in a circle rhine like a blanket or 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.380
 action if it's a bit too cold 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:22.139
 should be here you see again so 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.270
 just grab a crease three 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.919
 piece of the number and there you can 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:32.610
 Roof hold back and you 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.699
 Do you have the five exactly what I think 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.550
 very good as it is padded again 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:41.130
 and at the handles you can see the position 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.949
 of the seat stop changing in three 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.539
 positions you see it again if 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.050
 the children can sleep that is called 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.760
 beautiful place in the sleeping position 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.380
 I'm also great that you can not 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.240
 only one position has but three 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.360
 different depending on how it is 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.360
 fit 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.930
 Here we have the footrest you ever 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.949
 after how you want to have her on 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.320
 can adjust 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.360
 when the babies are awake it makes 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.090
 underneath and when you are sleeping 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.090
 high and yes that's how it looks 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:22.130
 You can see it can be great 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.130
 So depending on how you need it 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.069
 here we have the six tires one man 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.990
 can adjust individually 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.660
 either they should all move 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.849
 or not and you can stop it 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:43.940
 I do all the front tires 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:47.060
 leave always loose yes behind but the 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.539
 brake and yes if you just on it 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.080
 presses with the board is the car 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:56.090
 already fixed yes and that was it 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.009
 actually that's it in 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.139
 the dare first I'm really there he is 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.870
 especially for the price he excites 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.479
 costs 169 euros since you do not do anything 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.410
 wrong with and now I show you 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:11.360
 still like me the dare in our dare 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.460
 stop transporting it as you put it together 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.400
 works and you see here you just have to 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.740
 keep the small lever and then after 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.960
 pull up and then you can do it 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.960
 Schwuppdiwupps also merge and 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.639
 when parking is the same only 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.009
 That's why it's solidified on the sides 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.740
 so if you just get him out, yes 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:34.430
 whole thing does not have to be apart 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:37.810
 just pull both together and then 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.810
 is actually ready to drive 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.300
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:56.199
 and see you at another 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.199
 closes again
