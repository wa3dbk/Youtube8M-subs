with how you craft regular sticks with
wood<00:00:43.579> planks<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.910> put<00:00:45.149> two<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:45.930> top<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.230> each

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
wood planks you put two on top of each

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.330 
wood planks you put two on top of each
other<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.360> stone<00:00:49.170> towards<00:00:49.530> now

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
other and you get to stone towards now

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.010 
other and you get to stone towards now
for<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:52.350> need<00:00:53.090> see<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> gray<00:00:54.660> area

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
for this you need see with the gray area

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.510 
for this you need see with the gray area
is<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:55.649> where<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> stick<00:00:56.309> singer

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
is that's where the stick singer

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
is that's where the stick singer
replaced<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.899> place<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:58.980> here

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
replaced so you place one here one here

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
replaced so you place one here one here
and<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> back<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.960> can

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
see the wooden handle so the one hand

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.149 
see the wooden handle so the one hand
will<00:01:03.030> go<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> material<00:01:04.830> block

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
will go here and then a material block

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.630 
will go here and then a material block
over<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.240> say<00:01:06.510> iron<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.490> go

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
over there so to say iron right so go

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
over there so to say iron right so go
myself<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:09.030> iron<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.840> each<00:01:10.020> material<00:01:10.340> would

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
myself an iron now each material would

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340 
myself an iron now each material would
have<00:01:11.640> them<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> different<00:01:12.510> durability<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
have them a different durability and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
have them a different durability and
different<00:01:14.130> blocks<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.670> actually<00:01:14.790> cut

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
different blocks they can actually cut

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.770 
different blocks they can actually cut
up<00:01:15.619> now<00:01:16.820> some<00:01:17.820> materials<00:01:18.330> actually<00:01:18.630> might

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
up now some materials actually might

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.510 
up now some materials actually might
require<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.479> get<00:01:23.119> fit<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.360> I

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
require more like if I get fit right I

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.950 
require more like if I get fit right I
get<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.720> put<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:30.259> and

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
get that and I put that in like so and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.370 
get that and I put that in like so and
they<00:01:33.960> will<00:01:34.110> craft<00:01:34.439> me<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.040> pitcher<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.090> salt

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
they will craft me a pitcher at salt

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.260 
they will craft me a pitcher at salt
obviously<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.680> Diamonds<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.460> don't<00:01:39.090> need

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
obviously the Diamonds also don't need

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.590 
obviously the Diamonds also don't need
that<00:01:39.420> now<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:41.520> demonstrate<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.420> kind

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
so you put that block their offset over

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.290 
so you put that block their offset over
the<00:02:03.119> Dons<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:04.409> put<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.740> top<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.479> two

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
you can actually put these back together

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.170 
you can actually put these back together
if<00:02:47.730> you're<00:02:47.850> not<00:02:47.940> happy<00:02:49.400> put<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.520> like<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
there you go well that's only using one

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:02.480 
there you go well that's only using one
block<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:56.130> using<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.580> saw<00:02:56.790> at<00:02:57.420> all<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.890> like

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
block so so using the saw at all so like

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.100 
block so so using the saw at all so like
I<00:03:02.520> need<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.730> use<00:03:02.970> both<00:03:03.180> ways<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.900> will

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
I need to use both ways but I will

I need to use both ways but I will
rather<00:03:04.320> use<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.760> saw<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:07.350> get<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.680> have<00:03:07.920> your

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
rather use the saw you get to have your

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.670 
rather use the saw you get to have your
two<00:03:08.790> out<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.240> then<00:03:09.390> actually<00:03:09.570> use<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.930> to

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
two out of and then actually use it to

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.160 
two out of and then actually use it to
device<00:03:11.040> now<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:12.120> actually<00:03:12.300> cut<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.690> down<00:03:12.810> more

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
device now you actually cut it down more

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.680 
device now you actually cut it down more
than<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.820> so<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.880> get<00:03:14.970> your<00:03:15.030> two<00:03:15.240> blocks<00:03:15.540> and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
than that so you get your two blocks and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.199 
than that so you get your two blocks and
you<00:03:15.720> do<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:15.990> again<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:16.980> get<00:03:17.250> stuff<00:03:17.940> to

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
you do it again and you get stuff to

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.990 
you do it again and you get stuff to
more<00:03:18.500> then<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.680> can<00:03:19.800> cut<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:19.980> again<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.850> get

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
more then you can cut it again you get

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.170 
more then you can cut it again you get
more<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.350> can't<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:22.980> anymore<00:03:23.220> but<00:03:24.000> you

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
more so you can't do anymore but you
