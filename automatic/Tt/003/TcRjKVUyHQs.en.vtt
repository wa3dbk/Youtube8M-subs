 Upon purchase before I heard they state that there are everything 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.240
 but now these snapshots 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.210
 we have a new takes ex 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.609
 there also at 1.16 pm deme I don't have that 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.440
 no video made of it 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.970
 you can win and you can take a lot of names, and only then can you 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.170
 use 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.720
 with a take work you can say a spokesman for klaas by the way a 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.320
 proposal from another joke 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.730
 and giver horse you have to give your voice country its name 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.160
 but for example a crew not this is the sla's and now look out of class 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.880
 and the indices are also other names de bombast and edouard 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.550
 and to give a day for the other name, for example, wombat 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.699
 with three times the ordinary 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.980
 if you were often full of them, the shim would go away in great demand 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.630
 we created can just continue to use 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.840
 this horse tamed this do not miss this after all the first to sit down at one 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.210
 cake 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.590
 you have to give a name because the state is not known that is not possible 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.970
 this horse was known was not henk you could also be given another name 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.970
 by sitting up like that again and expressed in worth 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.060
 that's basically everything 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.310
 also canada 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.399
 you can only kneel that with the cell through and not with a cross on 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.460
 they have removed the answer 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.910
 and so getting van der spuy vanhooren channels is not bad 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.830
 if even you can only find it in the dots that is how it actually was 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.910
 and in Nederhorst 60 you do not see where his image 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.470
 and also obey six clubs in the sp also takes away from that you can 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 now also found in three sets 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.600
 and neat continued 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.100
 but that is actually from 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.270
 and from the hear together and as 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.270
 I think we had all this from a Turkish 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.840
 realist we can just give it a try we think it is a pity that I am not sure 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.770
 9 Felice You Can't Name King Because If You Don't 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.480
 right on a spring so you cubs an inter party of it 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.579
 to sell 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.169
 then we go to the next block 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:15.419
 to dress her up 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.110
 you can do it over ever need evercool 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.639
 is right here 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.749
 if you have a small one there is lee in the sky view high end rug content 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.359
 it looks like it is pretty strong for fling it is also resistant to 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.699
 ten types than normal system 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.569
 and then normally small there 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.019
 so that is depends on itself 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.029
 pretty nice block nice color winter weather more drawing teacher too 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.729
 a cool clock 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.749
 I did not expect that they would not do that, but they did 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.079
 nine goals so and then you get a buy run 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.439
 block cool 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.650
 I became and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.619
 I really like the church itself 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:56.589
 it is better than normal black full this has a really black color 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.829
 toko subsequently training really looks a bit gray 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.930
 nice clock 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.130
 and with a cool wsf blocks the clocks quickly satisfied with partly new to this 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.149
 added thirteen d6 10 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:12.459
 but they now simply have respire nine offers so with get you clooks 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.389
 His name is Zeeburg which was very appreciative 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.749
 okay but these are the streak know what i know is in multiple 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:21.499
 orient your chief 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.059
 that's that 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:27.839
 then we get to know sti once when also a kraft spd because so proud 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.699
 strings in the middle a slime ball 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.609
 and then you don't get two editions 64 2 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.249
 and if you can't do anything with it 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.229
 Then you can have a teaser niece and secretly not 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:41.129
 two songs kathy bad examples you can for example order to bathmen 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.820
 take 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.910
 it's more often 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.729
 and the known horse now walk with you but he knew that 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.969
 with this is actually the boss 6 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:50.489
 if now that they come 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.050
 this was pretty much everything again from this website you can really look at that 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.609
 later you can, depending on the thumb, behind favorites and come with of course 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.750
 if I have forgotten something 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.389
 if you just have to say 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.080
 and then say until next time and baloyi 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.880
