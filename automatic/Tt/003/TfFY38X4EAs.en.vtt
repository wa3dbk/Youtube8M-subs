00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.760
 hello everybody we are in this 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.520
 second episode on this day will 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:27.270
 I will explain how to color the writing like 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.130
 become a designer first of all 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.349
 obviously start right away then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.870
 we click twice here where this is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.870
 space then two more times on the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.230
 material and here are a list failure 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.170
 and the various settings all foot 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 click go from camera color we do to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.310
 red or blue 2 better than a little more 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.750
 slow 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.630
 ok then go on reflections to do the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.120
 reflected but you see this reflection 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.080
 very much in the sense that it is not seen 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.650
 just blue is a pure reflection and then 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.590
 you have to go to facebook to do it 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:17.969
 appear this way for the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:22.200
 brightness so for the strength you see ok 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:25.679
 instead of an effect what 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.950
 we do go riders at no no no 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.780
 sorry this lante what spies on you 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.200
 a high moment I was wrong to speak 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.640
 sorry guys and then there's this aspect 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.939
 she who has not yet understood what 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.259
 it works like it works but i leave it 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.280
 always a apecar I think point to serve 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:52.170
 then halo to practically give light 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.670
 around the object but given by lights 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.780
 internal external light 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 I always put 50 and 250 is not much 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.439
 powerful in short 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.200
 close quiet a lot is just a 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:11.120
 click as hard as I did and you are 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:14.900
 ready to do so already has a color on 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:22.620
 very nice yes a gandhi york yes 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:24.840
 let's vote yes even if I am 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 glimpsed but I don't care much about the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.580
 football so don't think badly about color or 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.049
 wrong therapy when I'm wrong 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:44.329
 send my reflection party and then 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:47.939
 then 50 and project 56 are a myth 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.470
 done close they did wrong you don't 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.060
 strong click 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:03:03.420
 ok perfect and put two more here 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:06.689
 colors and make here c1 and how many no buts 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:15.030
 I am a magician and what less blue will be 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:21.829
 here in the middle instead if you want blue 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:25.980
 compayito so and there will be gray 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:31.400
 we indicate black in between the special one 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:35.340
 I don't do it and it's good 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:44.280
 the head is also of age as is 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:47.659
 see ne yo yo yo blue ok now but 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.129
 color the floor the floor 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:53.640
 let's make black white and the blue of the neo 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.579
 blue 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:04.709
 who cares are very good at mise 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:07.349
 little bit of bending but I never have to always 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:13.579
 same thing 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:19.799
 obviously every one of his holds the 156 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:21.540
 floor and here we are ok I was wrong 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.530

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:29.370
 curious color does it when you want to do 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.500
 the effect of riders I did not leave here 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.090
 nothing like you see already there is something that 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:44.220
 not going now I'll explain a double right away 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:47.580

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.900
