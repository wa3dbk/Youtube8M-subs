having<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.849> PC<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:09.840> most<00:00:10.440> people<00:00:10.740> will<00:00:10.860> say

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
having a PC but most people will say

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.290 
having a PC but most people will say
well<00:00:11.219> it's<00:00:11.309> way<00:00:11.429> more<00:00:11.460> expensive<00:00:11.820> is

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
well it's way more expensive is

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.030 
well it's way more expensive is
something<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.719> can't<00:00:13.110> afford<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.679> sure

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
something that I can't afford to do sure

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.039 
something that I can't afford to do sure
it<00:00:14.309> may<00:00:14.429> be<00:00:14.490> great<00:00:14.820> but<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.389> can't<00:00:15.660> afford<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
it may be great but if I can't afford to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.630 
it may be great but if I can't afford to
do<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.199> then<00:00:16.440> obviously<00:00:16.560> I'm<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:17.130> gonna<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.490> it

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
do it then obviously I'm not gonna do it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.910 
do it then obviously I'm not gonna do it
but<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.630> if<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.779> told<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.320> not<00:00:19.470> actually

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
but what if I told you it's not actually

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.099 
but what if I told you it's not actually
as<00:00:20.039> expensive<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.880> think<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:21.930> if<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
as expensive as you think and what if I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.920 
as expensive as you think and what if I
told<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.529> how<00:00:23.039> much<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.220> spent<00:00:23.730> last<00:00:24.029> year<00:00:24.449> on

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
PC gaming and what if I told you that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.439 
PC gaming and what if I told you that
that<00:00:28.320> was<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:28.710> less<00:00:29.160> than<00:00:29.519> how<00:00:30.119> much<00:00:30.300> it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
that was actually less than how much it

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.910 
that was actually less than how much it
would<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.660> cost<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:31.109> I'd<00:00:31.230> done<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> same<00:00:31.740> on

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
would have cost if I'd done the same on

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.880 
would have cost if I'd done the same on
my<00:00:32.219> console<00:00:33.110> let's<00:00:34.110> elaborate<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:34.680> bit

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
of release and now auto 14 games are

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.590 
of release and now auto 14 games are
bought<00:03:17.310> through<00:03:17.579> Steam<00:03:17.910> sales<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.510> that

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
bought through Steam sales and that

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.599 
bought through Steam sales and that
includes<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.959> little<00:03:19.109> bit<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.380> DLC<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.250> stuff

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
includes a little bit of DLC and stuff

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.090 
includes a little bit of DLC and stuff
but<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.269> point<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.900> bought<00:03:22.140> more<00:03:22.739> stuff

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
but the point is I bought more stuff

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.740 
but the point is I bought more stuff
through<00:03:23.640> Steam<00:03:23.880> sales<00:03:24.150> than<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.359> did<00:03:24.510> through

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
through Steam sales than I did through

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.500 
through Steam sales than I did through
full<00:03:25.019> retail<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:26.010> will<00:03:26.190> came<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.510> 343

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
full retail and that will came to 343

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.390 
full retail and that will came to 343
pounds<00:03:27.540> now<00:03:28.170> as<00:03:28.230> for<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.500> 14<00:03:28.890> games<00:03:29.100> that

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
pounds now as for the 14 games that

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.569 
pounds now as for the 14 games that
weren't<00:03:29.760> full<00:03:30.030> price<00:03:30.269> I'm<00:03:31.230> assuming<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:32.010> say

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
weren't full price I'm assuming that say

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.280 
weren't full price I'm assuming that say
you<00:03:32.640> bought<00:03:32.880> all<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.390> same<00:03:33.569> sort<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.840> stuff<00:03:34.049> on

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
you bought all the same sort of stuff on

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.949 
you bought all the same sort of stuff on
a<00:03:34.319> console<00:03:34.739> I'm<00:03:34.950> assuming<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.940> that's<00:03:36.780> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
a console I'm assuming and that's the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.539 
a console I'm assuming and that's the
price<00:03:37.170> I've<00:03:37.350> allocated<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.430> would

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
price I've allocated is that it would

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.819 
price I've allocated is that it would
cost<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.819> about<00:03:38.910> 12<00:03:39.239> pounds<00:03:39.390> 50<00:03:39.930> now<00:03:40.560> I'd<00:03:40.680> like

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
cost you about 12 pounds 50 now I'd like

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:41.900 
cost you about 12 pounds 50 now I'd like
to<00:03:40.950> think<00:03:41.069> that's<00:03:41.190> quite<00:03:41.340> generous<00:03:41.880> but

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
to think that's quite generous but

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.660 
to think that's quite generous but
obviously<00:03:42.569> some<00:03:42.840> may<00:03:43.319> argue<00:03:43.560> well<00:03:44.010> no<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.370> can

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
obviously some may argue well no you can

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.190 
obviously some may argue well no you can
get<00:03:44.790> stuff<00:03:45.030> cheaper<00:03:45.359> than<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.810> some<00:03:46.139> of

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
get stuff cheaper than that and some of

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.050 
get stuff cheaper than that and some of
its<00:03:46.350> DLC<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.459> would<00:03:47.670> say<00:03:47.880> we're<00:03:48.030> probably

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
its DLC but I would say we're probably

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.030 
its DLC but I would say we're probably
averaged<00:03:48.630> out<00:03:48.810> or<00:03:49.019> about<00:03:49.230> 12<00:03:49.530> pounds<00:03:49.889> if<00:03:49.980> you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
averaged out or about 12 pounds if you

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.550 
averaged out or about 12 pounds if you
bought<00:03:50.220> those<00:03:50.340> 14<00:03:50.760> items<00:03:51.319> but<00:03:52.319> I'm<00:03:52.410> not

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
bought those 14 items but I'm not

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.530 
bought those 14 items but I'm not
including<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.130> this<00:03:53.250> cost<00:03:53.519> any<00:03:53.790> fees<00:03:54.180> like

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
including in this cost any fees like

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.930 
including in this cost any fees like
Xbox<00:03:54.959> Live<00:03:55.139> or<00:03:55.170> Playstation<00:03:55.350> Plus<00:03:56.069> so<00:03:56.400> you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
Xbox Live or Playstation Plus so you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.970 
Xbox Live or Playstation Plus so you
can't<00:03:57.180> really<00:03:57.540> argue<00:03:57.690> with<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.319> too<00:03:58.500> much<00:03:58.680> but

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
can't really argue with it too much but

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.559 
can't really argue with it too much but
obviously<00:03:59.370> take<00:03:59.609> it<00:03:59.730> with<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> pinch<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.359> salt

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
obviously take it with a pinch of salt

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.509 
obviously take it with a pinch of salt
because<00:04:00.750> this<00:04:01.440> is<00:04:01.620> an<00:04:01.739> estimate<00:04:02.040> but<00:04:02.400> that

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
because this is an estimate but that

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.449 
because this is an estimate but that
estimate<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.079> 575<00:04:04.079> pounds<00:04:04.769> so<00:04:05.100> that's<00:04:05.220> five

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
estimate is 575 pounds so that's five

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.420 
estimate is 575 pounds so that's five
hundred<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.910> seventy<00:04:06.180> five<00:04:06.329> pounds<00:04:06.600> versus

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
hundred and seventy five pounds versus

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.150 
hundred and seventy five pounds versus
343<00:04:08.430> pounds<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:09.269> means<00:04:09.450> I've<00:04:09.630> saved<00:04:10.160> 232

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
343 pounds that means I've saved 232

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.430 
343 pounds that means I've saved 232
pounds<00:04:11.430> by<00:04:11.760> playing<00:04:12.000> all<00:04:12.180> my<00:04:12.329> stuff<00:04:12.569> on<00:04:12.780> PC

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
pounds by playing all my stuff on PC

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.830 
pounds by playing all my stuff on PC
rather<00:04:14.069> than<00:04:14.310> on<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.549> games<00:04:14.880> console<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.690> it's

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
rather than on a games console and it's

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.060 
rather than on a games console and it's
true<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.139> you<00:04:16.200> may<00:04:16.320> not<00:04:16.500> have<00:04:16.560> spent<00:04:16.889> that

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
true that you may not have spent that

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.920 
true that you may not have spent that
much<00:04:17.280> money<00:04:17.310> but<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.120> fact<00:04:18.329> that<00:04:18.389> you<00:04:18.510> can<00:04:18.750> on

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
much money but the fact that you can on

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.900 
much money but the fact that you can on
a<00:04:18.959> PC<00:04:19.350> because<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:19.829> less<00:04:20.039> it's<00:04:20.459> all<00:04:20.700> valid

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
a PC because it's less it's all valid

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.029 
a PC because it's less it's all valid

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
you've got to do direct comparisons and

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.350 
you've got to do direct comparisons and
all<00:04:23.190> of<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.370> sudden<00:04:23.729> PC<00:04:24.090> game

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
all of a sudden PC game

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.140 
all of a sudden PC game
actually<00:04:24.960> appears<00:04:25.259> to<00:04:25.379> be<00:04:25.469> slightly<00:04:25.710> cheaper

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
actually appears to be slightly cheaper

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.490 
actually appears to be slightly cheaper
than<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.270> does<00:04:27.449> if<00:04:27.719> you<00:04:27.840> did<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.080> on<00:04:28.199> a<00:04:28.229> games

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
than it does if you did it on a games

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.529 
than it does if you did it on a games
console<00:04:28.949> so<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.520> can<00:04:29.610> add<00:04:29.699> up<00:04:29.819> that<00:04:29.849> 200

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
cycle which I'd like to think it's being

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.929 
cycle which I'd like to think it's being
generous<00:04:34.409> and<00:04:34.710> then<00:04:35.219> that's<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.819> know

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
generous and then that's you know

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.119 
generous and then that's you know
getting<00:04:36.180> on<00:04:36.270> for<00:04:36.449> 1,000<00:04:37.020> pounds<00:04:37.409> of<00:04:37.500> savings

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
fees for PS Plus and Xbox Live that's a

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.499 
fees for PS Plus and Xbox Live that's a

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
hell of a lot of money and while it will

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.990 
hell of a lot of money and while it will
cost<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:46.050> tiny<00:04:46.379> bit<00:04:46.650> more<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:47.400> initial

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000

of<00:04:50.639> course<00:04:50.849> a<00:04:51.090> lot<00:04:51.479> of<00:04:51.509> people<00:04:51.629> will<00:04:52.110> then<00:04:52.379> use

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
of course a lot of people will then use

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.200 
of course a lot of people will then use
that<00:04:52.650> money<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.129> upgrade<00:04:53.430> their<00:04:53.610> PC<00:04:54.000> that's

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
that money and upgrade their PC that's

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.640 
that money and upgrade their PC that's
where<00:04:54.479> this<00:04:54.599> whole<00:04:54.750> illusion<00:04:54.990> comes<00:04:55.409> from

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
where this whole illusion comes from

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.159 
where this whole illusion comes from
that<00:04:56.189> PC<00:04:56.430> gaming<00:04:56.759> requires<00:04:57.270> more<00:04:57.960> money

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
that PC gaming requires more money

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.510 
that PC gaming requires more money
because<00:04:58.469> you've<00:04:58.560> got<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.770> keep<00:04:58.860> upgrading<00:04:59.400> it

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
because you've got to keep upgrading it

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.890 
because you've got to keep upgrading it
it's<00:04:59.879> just<00:05:00.000> that<00:05:00.090> people<00:05:00.210> were<00:05:00.509> saving<00:05:00.810> the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
it's just that people were saving the

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.959 
it's just that people were saving the
money<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.379> that<00:05:01.919> they're<00:05:02.129> realizing<00:05:02.639> that

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
money and that they're realizing that

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.540 
money and that they're realizing that
this<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.389> my<00:05:03.659> hobby<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.199> like<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:05.039> I'm<00:05:05.340> going

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
this is my hobby I like this I'm going

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.070 
this is my hobby I like this I'm going
to<00:05:05.610> upgrade<00:05:05.729> my<00:05:05.909> PC<00:05:06.419> so<00:05:06.629> it<00:05:06.719> gets<00:05:06.900> better

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
to upgrade my PC so it gets better

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.929 
to upgrade my PC so it gets better
graphics<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.650> stuff<00:05:07.800> like<00:05:07.949> that<00:05:08.189> so<00:05:08.759> I<00:05:08.789> hope

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:08.939 
graphics and stuff like that so I hope

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.269 
graphics and stuff like that so I hope
that's<00:05:09.060> cleared<00:05:09.419> up<00:05:09.569> the<00:05:09.990> illusion<00:05:10.529> of<00:05:10.710> the

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:11.279 
that's cleared up the illusion of the

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.969 
that's cleared up the illusion of the
cost<00:05:11.639> behind<00:05:12.000> PC<00:05:12.330> gaming<00:05:12.569> I'd<00:05:13.379> like<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.710> add

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
cost behind PC gaming I'd like to add

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.769 
cost behind PC gaming I'd like to add
that<00:05:14.189> most<00:05:14.400> of<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.699> is<00:05:14.819> just<00:05:15.120> because<00:05:15.449> of

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
that most of that is just because of

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:17.540 
that most of that is just because of
license<00:05:16.229> fees<00:05:16.439> because<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.979> don't<00:05:17.129> pay<00:05:17.370> any

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
license fees because you don't pay any

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.550 
license fees because you don't pay any
money<00:05:17.639> to<00:05:17.789> Sony<00:05:18.270> or<00:05:18.419> Microsoft<00:05:18.449> but<00:05:19.319> the<00:05:19.379> point

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
money to Sony or Microsoft but the point

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.119 
money to Sony or Microsoft but the point
is<00:05:20.000> genuinely<00:05:21.000> cheaper<00:05:21.389> to<00:05:21.539> game<00:05:21.689> on<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.840> PC<00:05:22.259> at

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 
is genuinely cheaper to game on a PC at

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:24.980 
is genuinely cheaper to game on a PC at
least<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.759> games<00:05:24.000> are<00:05:24.240> while<00:05:24.629> the<00:05:24.750> hardware

is<00:05:25.259> a<00:05:25.439> bit<00:05:25.620> more<00:05:25.740> expensive<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.370> of<00:05:26.699> course

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
is a bit more expensive and of course

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.029 
is a bit more expensive and of course
you<00:05:27.270> get<00:05:27.419> all<00:05:27.569> the<00:05:27.689> other<00:05:27.840> advantages<00:05:28.560> which

is<00:05:31.919> 8<00:05:32.099> reasons<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:33.330> have<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.479> gaming<00:05:33.779> PC<00:05:34.080> cost

is 8 reasons to have a gaming PC cost
was<00:05:34.560> one<00:05:34.770> of<00:05:34.889> them<00:05:34.979> but<00:05:35.129> there<00:05:35.219> are<00:05:35.279> many<00:05:35.550> other

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
was one of them but there are many other

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.700 
was one of them but there are many other
reasons<00:05:36.000> of<00:05:36.719> course<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.289> main<00:05:37.409> one<00:05:37.560> being

reasons of course the main one being
that's<00:05:37.919> a<00:05:38.039> PC<00:05:38.400> but<00:05:38.969> obviously<00:05:39.750> that's<00:05:39.900> all<00:05:40.139> in

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
that's a PC but obviously that's all in

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
cleared up a lot of the confusion it's

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.909 
cleared up a lot of the confusion it's
the<00:05:45.300> main<00:05:45.449> point<00:05:45.750> that<00:05:45.839> I<00:05:46.020> would<00:05:46.560> want<00:05:46.860> to
