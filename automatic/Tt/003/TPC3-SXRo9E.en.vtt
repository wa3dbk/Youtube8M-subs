00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
killstreaks do not add to your kill so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.929 
killstreaks do not add to your kill so
you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.830> say<00:01:19.920> put<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.280> sentry<00:01:20.580> gun<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
then have it roll out of course ten

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.840 
then have it roll out of course ten
kills<00:01:22.619> by<00:01:22.799> itself<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.670> those

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
you will so I ended up using a sentry
gun<00:01:43.560> which<00:01:43.860> you'll<00:01:44.340> notice<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> second

kind<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.869> provide<00:01:49.710> me<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> little<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
kind of provide me with a little a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.850 
kind of provide me with a little a
little<00:01:51.240> buffer<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> little<00:01:51.780> heads<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.200> and

little buffer and a little heads up and
I<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.280> think<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> hardcore<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.329> by<00:01:54.720> far<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
I do think the hardcore was by far the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.410 
I do think the hardcore was by far the
easiest<00:01:55.200> mode<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.729> trend

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
easiest mode to do this in a trend

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.940

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
both regular and hardcore definitely the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.920 
both regular and hardcore definitely the
easiest<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930

and I'm camping out up clubs trying to
get<00:02:14.080> these<00:02:14.200> these<00:02:14.560> last<00:02:14.890> kills<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.730> we'll

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
get these these last kills and we'll

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.350 
get these these last kills and we'll
notice<00:02:16.960> but<00:02:17.200> here<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.190> next<00:02:18.370> round<00:02:18.610> it's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
notice but here in the next round it's

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.540 
notice but here in the next round it's
really<00:02:19.660> kind<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:19.960> when<00:02:20.320> having<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.130> this

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
really kind of when having this this

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.850 
really kind of when having this this
kill<00:02:21.790> Street<00:02:21.970> setup<00:02:22.590> ends<00:02:23.590> up<00:02:23.680> being

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
kill Street setup ends up being

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.630 
kill Street setup ends up being
dividends<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.740> is<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.040> second<00:02:27.340> half<00:02:27.520> of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
dividends so this is that second half of

challenge much more quickly than that I

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.710 
challenge much more quickly than that I
was<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.549> maybe<00:03:51.670> have<00:03:52.000> more<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.360> an<00:03:52.480> aggressive

something<00:04:01.060> more<00:04:01.209> objective<00:04:01.840> based<00:04:02.110> with<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
something more objective based with the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.789 
something more objective based with the
ideal<00:04:03.730> way<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:03.940> do<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.269> but<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:05.230> know<00:04:05.350> again<00:04:05.620> I
