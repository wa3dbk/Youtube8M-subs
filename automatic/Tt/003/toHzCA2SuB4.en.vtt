be using for now the surround is
actually<00:02:21.750> more<00:02:21.959> than<00:02:22.200> what<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.560> looks<00:02:22.709> like

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
actually more than what it looks like

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.430 
actually more than what it looks like
actually<00:02:23.989> as<00:02:24.989> pushed<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:25.980> down<00:02:26.959> this<00:02:27.959> this

side you can't really tell but it's a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.350 
side you can't really tell but it's a
little<00:02:30.890> higher<00:02:31.890> than<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.280> actually<00:02:32.430> looks<00:02:32.760> um

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
bumped magnets look re audio magnet boot

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.580 
bumped magnets look re audio magnet boot
and<00:02:53.760> I'm<00:02:54.239> sure<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.900> single<00:02:55.230> stack

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.470

thing<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.750> was<00:03:03.840> worried<00:03:04.140> about<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.890> floor<00:03:05.160> that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
thing I was worried about the floor that

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.490 
thing I was worried about the floor that
I<00:03:05.459> didn't<00:03:05.850> know<00:03:06.019> whether<00:03:07.019> or<00:03:07.200> not<00:03:07.290> they'll

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
I didn't know whether or not they'll

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.780 
I didn't know whether or not they'll
have<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.829> is<00:03:08.060> since<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.480> dual<00:03:09.660> sub

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
have it is since this is the dual sub

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.410 
have it is since this is the dual sub
not<00:03:11.790> dual<00:03:12.060> brand<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:13.040> just<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.100> macro<00:03:14.459> dual

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
not dual brand but just a macro dual

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.440 
not dual brand but just a macro dual
voice<00:03:15.959> coil<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.639> was<00:03:17.639> hoping<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.359> would

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
voice coil I was hoping that it would

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.110 
voice coil I was hoping that it would
have<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.959> dual<00:03:19.260> prongs<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.250> does<00:03:20.489> and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
have the dual prongs like this does and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.900 
have the dual prongs like this does and
I'm<00:03:21.269> happy<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.780> does<00:03:22.549> that's<00:03:23.549> one<00:03:23.730> little

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
I'm happy that it does that's one little

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.979 
I'm happy that it does that's one little
thing<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.239> was<00:03:24.359> worried<00:03:24.569> about<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.810> I'm<00:03:27.810> going
