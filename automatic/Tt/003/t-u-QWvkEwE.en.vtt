00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
professional integrity we'd be teaching

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.990 
professional integrity we'd be teaching
in<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.320> variety<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.770> ways<00:01:54.009> many<00:01:54.729> of<00:01:54.850> them

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
in a variety of ways many of them

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.990 
in a variety of ways many of them
innovative<00:01:55.630> since<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.440> 19th<00:01:57.070> century<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.700> I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
innovative since the 19th century and I

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.639 
innovative since the 19th century and I
think<00:01:58.179> what<00:01:58.330> laureate<00:01:58.810> brings<00:01:59.080> is<00:01:59.289> huge

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
think what laureate brings is huge

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.499 
think what laureate brings is huge
strength<00:01:59.979> in<00:02:00.280> understanding<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.060> delivering
