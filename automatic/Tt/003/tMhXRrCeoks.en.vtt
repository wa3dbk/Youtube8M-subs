00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.510
 I'm already interested in shooting with the apple watch 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.080
 Just that girl 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.840
 Military fame was I strong mind that it is the core im 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:18.720
 ctu is a little disappointing 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 And saying Shiteya' customized to at 1 ghz family fortunes to say in the 8-guy 3 ghz 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.500

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.360
 Oh golden so so 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.870

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.900
 this 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:36.700

 I just want to customize it 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:53.360
 It means that Shut up by 22 built-heavy jumps 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:57.110
 Well, it also edits What if what we definitely are a just Hey child Murai-kun, I think there 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.450
 Put in over the writing is the Kana effect by pounding 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.000
 What do you say 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:10.580
 If you can't write, you can't hit the head until you're there- 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:16.190
 Well I'm honest I think it's not bad, but I'm brave to buy after all 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.980
 It is about 100,000 yen if it is 5 yen so if it is about 200,000 yen and sounds normally 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.480
 Just 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.570

 First of all there like that book it loose and that chat like 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.440
 That picture 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:48.580

 Nante's had both Hatsuhatsu usbc 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.030
 It seems like only usbc came- rather than thinking that it was pretty heady 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.920

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.140
 Here it is here 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.490
 It 's a rumored thing called usbc 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.060
 Well ordinary usb ne 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:29.580
 The name is quite small compared to this 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:34.410
 In the picture book 8 the other side on the other side is a little bigger than the other in comparison with lightning 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.820
 I feel the there you following God stopped countries such as guess this this one of a total of I came'm in the left incomplete 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.480
 It seems to be 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:44.170
 Just because webs of cats are not popular 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.159
 What will happen to mother charging is also included in the charge

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.860
 It may be an outlet 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.280
 The next one seems to be able to charge the cat 's usb 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.280
 It may be possible to charge from the mobile battery for a moment 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.470

 It is Toka movement of Ciro not liked Well this I if there until either can be charged to underground 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.950

 If you look at that kind of reference opinion after all, after all the various things 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:19.169
 It's a good thing when you open the application or something 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.919
