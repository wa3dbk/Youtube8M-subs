00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.240
 go out 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.450
 and how about friends and friends 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.309
 I told another video because here they 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.070
 I bring another new guide in minecraft 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.380
 about what was the sensor of the 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.730
 of furnace this object this object of 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.189
 rest serves to activate mechanisms 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.430
 of registration through a very function 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.310
 curious what is this function is how is it 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.200
 as a sale it is a solar panel and when 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.300
 this comes to light a will activate 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.980
 redstone good so what's interesting not 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.110
 let's focus on the topic I'm going to 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.390
 put the action some examples and I'll 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.769
 give important information is not 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.940
 you realize that the kraft is 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.859
 from what was the light sensor 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.589
 diurnal of these three wooden things 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.589
 then three these quartz if I'm not wrong 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.000
 and three of three glass in others 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.309
 glass blocks and then I would come out 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.199
 what was the daylight sensor that 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.839
 is here in the repsol here in 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.500
 mechanisms here to the right that what 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.470
 I feel like a cell phone 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.110
 then now a very important thing that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.300
 you should know is that this is active active 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.430
 redstone with daylight then 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.170
 Now that day you realize that 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.510
 there is sun hits you can activate 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.710
 redstone and how many blocks or how many 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.630
 network powders are active active only 8 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.760
 counted active account 8 here are the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.190
 8 is we burn the 56 now I do not know if 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.640
 owns 6 without wanting but you do not give 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.640
 notice that he 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.469
 I can not count 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.250
 today I think if they are 8 if I'm not wrong 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.299
 see let's see this look only 1 2 3 4 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.710
 5 6 7 8 ready are eight blocks the ninth 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.000
 I do not activate it anymore. 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.190
 activates the registration lamp on the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.290
 eighth if it is still very important 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.820
 that you should know if you want me to activate more 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.220
 it is very simple, you simply put a 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.930
 repeater and then you follow him you follow and 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.940
 the repeater arrives again at 15 then 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.090
 you put another repeater and if so, no 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.780
 it's indeed very simple registration not now 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.550
 if you want to activate rest at night there 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.920
 to do another little thing, leave nothing else 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.480
 I grab there, there's no need to do another 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.190
 little thing not if you want me to activate the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.940
 Restón de noche that activates lamps or 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.480
 something like that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.880
 you have to basically invest this 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.940
 mechanism as simple inverted 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.280
 we put redstone then we put a block 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.709
 we put a repsol torch and then 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.630
 will be activated is this night light 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.010
 as I will explain in a while this 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.470
 you can also activate this 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.970
 from below him that for example here 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.000
 I have an activated piston that for example 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.860
 look or can you 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.860
 activate and deactivate there was activated 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.620
 look at putting it back down 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.030
 there we are and from above not that I do not 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.070
 I've tried so look for you too 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.050
 above which is very useful now what 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.360
 that I'm not sure and in fact from the 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.160
 pc if it happened is that I had to paste the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.610
 light directly and if the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.580
 light directly because this one was not going this 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.350
 I was not going to light the rest not then 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.570
 you have to mostly put it on the air 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.820
 free if I 'm not wrong to see if it's a 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.180
 ok time I think that in the consoles there 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.270
 happens the same I think let's see let's 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.620
 see where by here if this one of the 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.420
 You can put seams where you want 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.670
 if I'm not wrong because in the pc 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.230
 there was an update that if you weigh ' 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.239
 he did not hit him directly he was not going to 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.010
 work here are the examples that 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.739
 obviously they will look at night in fact 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.410
 I want to say hello to a friend who 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.320
 helped to do this is called fader is is 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.630
 a gamertag because that's the one and that's what 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.760
 helped me to do what the lamp was 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.250
 and the house this also accompanied me a 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.010
 here in the world here 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.050
 just spend the company and spend it a 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.489
 great regards to reynders you are watching this 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.980
 thank you for everything and I send you a 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.459
 greeting 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.959
 here are the examples you realize that 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.340
 I have a lamp that Redstone 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.110
 I had already done but with another mechanism 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.480
 when the sensor was not yet 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.400
 daylight in my channel that you open how 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.870
 it works just like a house that 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.810
 it works in exactly the same way 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.489
 in the day you have this natural light 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.440
 you realize that it has some small windows 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.120
 also and at night, here I have the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.230
 Daylight sensor that is hidden 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.600
 by the way with pictures here 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.989
 because at night it will activate what 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.040
 out light good I'll cut quickie 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.040
 so that it is done at night 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.630
 and ready as is the accounts is activated 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.360
 this fully automatic at night 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.889
 just when the sun disappears this one 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.330
 thing that I forgot to mention is that 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.860
 I did not make this lamp of this lamp 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.900
 I took it out of a channel called art 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.669
 kraft a youtuber boston channel that 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.550
 I really like to see this lamp made by him 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.710
 I do not give all my credit to him and after 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.470
 account that the lamp and the light were activated 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.150
 of the night of the night in the light of 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.090
 night of our house pitifully 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.590
 this redstone is good this one fell 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.780
 the box that we had here fell 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.850
 the rest moved because the box fell 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.260
 but then there is this thing that does not have 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.140
 nothing bad is not a window that does not 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.520
 There is nothing wrong with that, in your case and 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.070
 The table also back was that 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.900
 we had here pitifully not after 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.660
 account that all active was activated the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.730
 reverse mechanism that I did this one of 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.290
 resistón also and finally because this one 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.480
 it was not activated good obviously is not going to 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.150
 activate because we did not put anything not 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.040
 Mira does not activate because it is dark and 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.170
 we did not do the reverse mechanism nor 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.670
 nothing of that and then it's basically for 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.830
 what serves what was 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.840
 the sensor of this day reminds 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.060
 I'm not going to do this tutorial on 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.830
 this moment nor this one nothing else he was a 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.930
 guide so you know what it's for 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.420
 how many blocks can activate the set was 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.680
 a basic guide as I like to call it and 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.050
