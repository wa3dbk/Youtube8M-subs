 little more minecraft video from 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.869
 minecraft baguette and we already 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.390
 I agree and I can not 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.259
 the minecraft pocket you get used to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.849
 since and when I am the new and yes 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.490
 I introduce you today 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.890
 I show you these today as one 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.910
 minecraft server on the current 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.410
 minecraft beta 1.8 can create like 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.820
 The version was ready but expected 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.240
 keep the still packed version 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.450
 I would stop the version 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.820
 recommend the yes how should I say 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.890
 who only make a server for friends 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.710
 then want public servers for people 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.780
 it is not yet recommended 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.430
 you have to look later then 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.939
 is that here in parentheses too 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.960
 that's 1.8 then but we see 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.549
 which has below 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.979
 the link to download and still sets 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.340
 a description yes we save that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.600
 whole and that just under load in 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.479
 time is like oh man always 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.960
 unlock powerhouse and save here 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.170
 above the command to create one 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.119
 starter that is now the command for 32 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.520
 bit and I translated has in the description 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.109
 normal commands for 32 and 64 bit 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.649
 in and then we can use the internet 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:41.039
 browser can close this 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:43.350
 power package all pull and create 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.560
 then a new all in one 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.130
 then we add new text documents there 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.170
 like to save the command to file 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.530
 among we ran just once 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.090
 but as at is very important and also that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.389
 her with that and also with her 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.700
 file type then selects all files from 

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:09.060
 we can save that can close that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.679
 the text document comes to delete and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.290
 then we can easily make the server 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.920
