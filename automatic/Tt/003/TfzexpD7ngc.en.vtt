one of the major questions I wrestled
with<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.400> writing<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.090> book<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:43.020> trying<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
with in writing this book was trying to

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.650 
with in writing this book was trying to
answer<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.130> question<00:02:44.520> how<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:45.030> see<00:02:45.390> human

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
answer the question how can we see human

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.040 
answer the question how can we see human
beings<00:02:46.110> as<00:02:46.760> spiritually<00:02:47.760> different<00:02:48.660> from<00:02:48.930> the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
beings as spiritually different from the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.170 
beings as spiritually different from the
rest<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.380> creation<00:02:49.620> set<00:02:50.160> apart<00:02:50.490> which<00:02:50.850> is<00:02:50.880> of

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
rest of creation set apart which is of

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.390 
rest of creation set apart which is of
course<00:02:51.330> what<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.200> Bible<00:02:52.590> tells<00:02:52.860> us<00:02:53.040> again<00:02:53.280> and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
course what the Bible tells us again and

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.120 
course what the Bible tells us again and
again<00:02:53.670> without<00:02:54.540> simply<00:02:55.200> throwing<00:02:55.770> all<00:02:56.010> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
again without simply throwing all the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.350 
again without simply throwing all the
animals<00:02:56.460> out<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.700> saying<00:02:56.850> they<00:02:56.970> don't<00:02:57.150> matter

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
animals out and saying they don't matter

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.090 
animals out and saying they don't matter
well<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.900> would<00:02:57.990> certainly<00:02:58.170> be<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.500> very<00:02:58.770> lonely

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
well it would certainly be a very lonely

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.400 
well it would certainly be a very lonely
planet<00:02:59.610> without<00:02:59.790> animals<00:03:00.660> we<00:03:01.020> were<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.230> only

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
planet without animals we were the only

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.680 
planet without animals we were the only
animals<00:03:01.770> on<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.130> well<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:03.030> literally<00:03:03.330> wouldn't

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
animals on it well we literally wouldn't

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.330 
animals on it well we literally wouldn't
be<00:03:03.810> who<00:03:03.990> we<00:03:04.140> are<00:03:04.170> without<00:03:04.470> them<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
be who we are without them and the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.550 
be who we are without them and the
further<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.000> got<00:03:06.240> back<00:03:06.510> into<00:03:06.810> history<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.350> more

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
further I got back into history the more

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
apparent it became that talking about

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.040 
apparent it became that talking about
humanity<00:03:11.310> without<00:03:11.820> including<00:03:12.630> animal

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
humanity without including animal

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
creation is sort of talking about Edward

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.260 
creation is sort of talking about Edward
grinning<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.100> let's<00:03:17.310> remove<00:03:17.640> all<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> carbon

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
grinning but let's remove all the carbon

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.060 
grinning but let's remove all the carbon
molecules<00:03:18.720> okay<00:03:19.080> we<00:03:19.260> know<00:03:19.380> Edward<00:03:19.710> grinnin<00:03:19.950> is

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
molecules okay we know Edward grinnin is

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.980 
molecules okay we know Edward grinnin is
fine<00:03:20.250> but<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:20.550> just<00:03:20.790> I'm<00:03:20.940> full<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.270> carbon<00:03:21.690> so

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
fine but so just I'm full of carbon so

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.260 
fine but so just I'm full of carbon so
yeah<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.220> know<00:03:23.250> we<00:03:23.460> need<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.730> carbon<00:03:24.090> if

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
yeah so you know we need the carbon if

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.460 
yeah so you know we need the carbon if

saying<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.920> animals<00:03:32.250> actually<00:03:32.400> make<00:03:32.700> us

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
saying that animals actually make us

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.200

more<00:03:33.060> human<00:03:33.320> yeah<00:03:34.460> not<00:03:35.460> even<00:03:35.490> more<00:03:35.850> human<00:03:36.090> we

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
more human yeah not even more human we

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.360 
more human yeah not even more human we
would<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:36.570> be<00:03:36.630> human<00:03:37.050> without<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:38.130> think

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
if you read the Bible with that idea in

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.400 
if you read the Bible with that idea in
mind<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.940> see<00:03:42.180> evidence<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:43.020> everywhere

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410
