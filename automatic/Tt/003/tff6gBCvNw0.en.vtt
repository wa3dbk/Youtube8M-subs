00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
very nice I figured I thought with them

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.570 
very nice I figured I thought with them
just<00:01:58.630> being<00:01:58.869> those<00:01:59.250> without<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.399> top

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
just being those without the top

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.700 
just being those without the top
brackets<00:02:01.210> they<00:02:01.450> move<00:02:01.780> more<00:02:02.369> but

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
brackets they move more but

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
brackets they move more but
her<00:02:05.160> smooth<00:02:05.550> there's<00:02:05.850> no<00:02:05.970> vibration<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.840> them

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
her smooth there's no vibration on them

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.420 
her smooth there's no vibration on them
you<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.260> see<00:02:07.500> clearly<00:02:07.880> where<00:02:08.880> is<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.149> good
