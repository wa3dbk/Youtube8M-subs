00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
as it compresses it gives energy return

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.490 
as it compresses it gives energy return
this<00:00:38.380> orthotic<00:00:39.310> it<00:00:39.760> gives<00:00:40.120> rigid<00:00:40.660> control<00:00:41.230> and

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
this orthotic it gives rigid control and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.830 
this orthotic it gives rigid control and
then<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.130> go<00:00:42.340> smoothly<00:00:42.850> transitioned<00:00:43.660> off
