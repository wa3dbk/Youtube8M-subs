but I'm amazed at what came out this

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.070 
but I'm amazed at what came out this
time<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:01.700> second<00:04:02.150> time<00:04:02.180> wasn't<00:04:02.720> even<00:04:02.930> this

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
time the second time wasn't even this

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.760 
time the second time wasn't even this
good<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.790> all<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.660> really<00:04:06.020> did<00:04:06.320> different<00:04:06.740> was

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
good and all I really did different was

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.530 
good and all I really did different was
the<00:04:07.550> magnesium<00:04:08.030> sulfate<00:04:08.900> so<00:04:09.800> I<00:04:10.540> really

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
the magnesium sulfate so I really

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.840 
the magnesium sulfate so I really
recommend<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:12.230> magnesium<00:04:12.620> sulfate<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:13.610> guess

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
recommend the magnesium sulfate I guess

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.600 
recommend the magnesium sulfate I guess
that<00:04:14.060> really<00:04:14.270> did<00:04:14.680> loosen<00:04:15.680> up<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:18.049> internal

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610
