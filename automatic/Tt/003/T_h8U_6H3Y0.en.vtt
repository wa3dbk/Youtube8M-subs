full review of this lens er f1r is
coming<00:00:37.649> soon<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.510> that's<00:00:39.719> done

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
coming soon as well so when that's done

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170

I'll<00:00:40.290> include<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.920> link<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> review<00:00:41.640> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
I'll include the link to the review of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.020 
I'll include the link to the review of
this<00:00:42.989> as<00:00:43.200> well<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.129> we're<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
this as well but for now we're going to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330 
this as well but for now we're going to
compare<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:45.690> head-to-head<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.100> think

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
compare them head-to-head and I think

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.650 
compare them head-to-head and I think
it'll<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.640> an<00:00:47.730> interesting<00:00:48.059> comparison

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it'll be an interesting comparison

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.529 
it'll be an interesting comparison
because<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> thrunite<00:00:50.039> TN<00:00:50.430> 12<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.230> listed<00:00:52.230> as

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
because the thrunite TN 12 is listed as

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.709 
because the thrunite TN 12 is listed as
1050<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.719> its<00:00:55.410> max<00:00:55.770> lumens<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:57.239> lens<00:00:57.510> er

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
1050 as its max lumens and this lens er

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.950 
1050 as its max lumens and this lens er
is<00:00:57.840> listed<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.430> 1000<00:00:59.430> okay<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.870> know

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
is listed as 1000 okay so you know

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.219 
is listed as 1000 okay so you know
around<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.649> same<00:01:01.949> maximum<00:01:02.640> lumens<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.870> they

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
around the same maximum lumens and they

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.250 
around the same maximum lumens and they
both<00:01:04.470> use<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.979> same<00:01:05.250> type<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.580> battery<00:01:06.240> an<00:01:06.540> 18

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
both use the same type of battery an 18

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.340 
both use the same type of battery an 18
650<00:01:07.799> lithium-ion<00:01:08.729> battery<00:01:09.510> okay<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:09.960> very

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
650 lithium-ion battery okay so very

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
650 lithium-ion battery okay so very
comparable<00:01:11.060> this<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.360> more<00:01:13.229> compact<00:01:14.119> right

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
comparable this is more compact right

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.960 
comparable this is more compact right
and<00:01:15.360> there's<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> big<00:01:16.200> price<00:01:16.820> differential<00:01:17.820> as

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and there's a big price differential as

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600 
and there's a big price differential as
well<00:01:18.590> okay<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> comparison<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
well okay the comparison is going to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
well okay the comparison is going to
have<00:01:20.759> two<00:01:21.030> parts<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
have two parts one is going to be a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.749 
have two parts one is going to be a
closer<00:01:23.369> range<00:01:24.229> comparison<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.759> around

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
closer range comparison at around around

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.020 
closer range comparison at around around
like<00:01:26.880> 15<00:01:27.420> feet<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.860> longer<00:01:29.640> range

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
like 15 feet and then a longer range

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
like 15 feet and then a longer range
comparison<00:01:30.930> which<00:01:31.500> I'll<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.890> from<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
comparison which I'll do from a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.760 
comparison which I'll do from a
second-story<00:01:32.670> window<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.810> little<00:01:34.229> bit<00:01:34.380> longer

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
second-story window a little bit longer

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.039 
second-story window a little bit longer
distance<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.479> meant<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.960> be

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
distance and this is not meant to be

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.980 
distance and this is not meant to be
super<00:01:37.439> scientific<00:01:38.509> alright<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:39.630> not<00:01:39.750> meant

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
super scientific alright it's not meant

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.830 
super scientific alright it's not meant
to<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.110> super<00:01:40.409> scientific<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:42.119> showing<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
to be super scientific just showing you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.330 
to be super scientific just showing you
what<00:01:43.020> these<00:01:43.200> lights<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.159> can

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
what these lights can do and you can

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.609 
what these lights can do and you can
judge<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.759> yourself<00:01:44.869> with<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:46.079> eye<00:01:46.110> through

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
judge for yourself with your eye through

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.920 
judge for yourself with your eye through
the<00:01:46.770> camera<00:01:47.280> okay<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.060> let's<00:01:48.390> roll<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the camera okay so let's roll in the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.660 
the camera okay so let's roll in the
comparison<00:01:49.560> footage<00:01:49.890> which<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.250> filmed

addition<00:05:07.349> to<00:05:07.469> using<00:05:07.860> flashlights<00:05:08.400> I<00:05:08.610> also

nerdy<00:05:11.219> interest<00:05:11.909> in<00:05:13.159> how<00:05:14.159> they<00:05:14.370> perform<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.770> I

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
nerdy interest in how they perform so I

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.939 
nerdy interest in how they perform so I
really<00:05:17.280> like<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:17.699> light<00:05:17.969> but<00:05:18.539> honestly<00:05:19.080> if<00:05:19.469> I

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
really like this light but honestly if I

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.369 
really like this light but honestly if I
was<00:05:20.099> not<00:05:20.310> also<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.759> flashlight<00:05:21.180> collector<00:05:22.139> I

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
was not also a flashlight collector I

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.010 
was not also a flashlight collector I
don't<00:05:23.129> know<00:05:23.250> if<00:05:23.430> I<00:05:23.580> would<00:05:23.819> have<00:05:23.909> spent<00:05:24.750> that

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
don't know if I would have spent that

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.909 
don't know if I would have spent that
much<00:05:25.879> on<00:05:26.879> a<00:05:27.330> flashlight<00:05:27.810> what<00:05:28.319> this<00:05:28.469> is<00:05:28.650> you

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
much on a flashlight what this is you

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.800 
much on a flashlight what this is you
know<00:05:29.039> less<00:05:29.250> than<00:05:29.490> half<00:05:29.669> the<00:05:29.699> price<00:05:30.120> so<00:05:30.569> I<00:05:30.629> guess

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
know less than half the price so I guess

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.510 
know less than half the price so I guess
I<00:05:30.960> would<00:05:31.080> say<00:05:31.289> if<00:05:31.500> you're<00:05:31.949> on<00:05:32.099> a<00:05:32.130> tight<00:05:32.490> budget
