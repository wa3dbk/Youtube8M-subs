00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.040
 how to take care of your phone's battery 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.130
 mobile 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.970
 all right 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.360
 this includes smartphones and 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.790
 modern smells with touch screen 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.580
 includes the least modern cell phones 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.450
 which they are those with the pantallita to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.450
 color with 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.300
 little buttons down is called little camera and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.300
 others and also includes the older 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 which are single color screens with 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.090
 botoncitos y tapita and others ok this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.350
 includes all those phones all 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.330
 tap phones for tablets 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.030
 also laptops 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:49.590
 they are also included and since they have 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.920
 the lithium ion battery 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.930
 and prevent them from falling below 5 the battery is 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.340
 that were used a few years ago had 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.260
 memory effect so it was recommended 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.620
 completely download these batteries 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.200
 before loading it instead the new 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.590
 they are just the opposite the batteries of 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.410
 lithium do not have that memory effect for 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.020
 what is not necessary to wait for it 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.040
 discharge completely to return to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.560
 load it 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.880
 In fact it is recommended that your cargo 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.740
 never go down 5 or 10% never let 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.689
 Turn off 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.020
 this means that the cell phone 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.340
 asks 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.990
 battery charge you have to charge the battery 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.689
 just like that 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.730
 avoid leaving one hundred percent 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.270
 long time 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.480
 in the same way that it is bad that it is 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 always in low load percentages 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.080
 it is also 100% 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.570
 permanently it is because of this that 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.420
 It is recommended that once it has 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.860
 fully charged disconnect the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.590
 charger 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.860
 in other words forget the habit of 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.780
 leave the phone charging all night 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:14.230
 on the little table that's wrong 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.130
 leave in a 40 or 50% if they are going to leave 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.069
 to use the device leave the battery with 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.530
 40% approximately, many people 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.540
 they believe that to have the battery during 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.510
 long time the best is 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.660
 keep it at 100% load instead 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.170
 It is better to keep it over 50% load 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.360
 in fact that is the reason why 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.430
 normally the phones when you take them out 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.880
 for the first time in the box they come with a 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.040
 40 or 50 percent that is if it's going to be 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.590
 a long plane trip and I will not use 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.960
 the phone I should leave it at 50 per 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.000
 one hundred 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.920
 Beware of the chargers that 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.100
 We use the vast majority of 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.130
 phones use a microusb port of 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.040
 charge but that does not mean that all 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.830
 the chargers with those ports are 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.610
 the best for our devices or 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.090
 It is recommended to use the original charger 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.820
 of the brand is not necessary to load by 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.250
 full we do not have to wait until 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.070
 that the battery is discharged up to 5% 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.410
 or that is filled up to 100% for 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.460
 connect and disconnect the charger not 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.400
 it matters we can connect by 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:36.060
 example with 25% and disconnect the with 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.060
 70% does not do anything to our battery 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.700
 calibrate the battery every several months 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.709
 consists of completely downloading the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.050
 battery until the phone goes off 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.020
 completely and connect the charger 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.599
 for several hours with the device 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.690
 off until it's loaded by 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.910
 full 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.480
 it was completely discharged the 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.260
 phone 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.840
 what I connect has paid 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.519
 sesionÃ³ battery when the disconnected 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.730
 and the battery is already calibrated 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.670
 again when it reaches 100% that 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.470
 it means that the battery is made 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.010
 charge completely and is again 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.690
 calibrated this can be done every 23 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.470
 months 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.470
 Full battery alarm and theft 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.620
 this for android is free and this more 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.930
 seen with the battery that fills it 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.419
 an alarm sounds with a little music that 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.340
 it says the battery was fully charged 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:43.660
 just download from the google play 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.550
 what helps me protect my battery from 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.370
 full charge and when it is by 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.550
 download obviously already has its own 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.830
 alarm so I wait until I 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.660
 sound in the food load and I put it to 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.600
 charge and when I sound the alarm of 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.919
 that is full he disconnected it with that 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:06.180
 prevented the battery from spoiling good 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.180
 this is all I hope you liked
