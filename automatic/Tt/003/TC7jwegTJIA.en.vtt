00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
opinion but to get it really mad like it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.090

it<00:01:45.509> takes<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.140> while<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
it takes a while like it's not going to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.740 
it takes a while like it's not going to
automatically<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.880> mad<00:01:48.119> once<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.420> put<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.600> on

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
automatically go mad once you put it on
