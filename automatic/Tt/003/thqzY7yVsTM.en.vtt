slice out slice out great with the wet
shear<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.840> our<00:01:19.049> blades<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
shear with our blades because of the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.550 
shear with our blades because of the
convex<00:01:20.610> blades<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.840> allows<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.500> a

convex blades really allows you to get a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.010 
convex blades really allows you to get a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
nice sliced edge to it you could slide

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.740 
nice sliced edge to it you could slide
your<00:01:25.229> hand<00:01:25.409> out<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.130> desire<00:01:26.509> now<00:01:27.509> watch

your hand out if you desire now watch
what<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.990> mean<00:01:28.200> by<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.579> let's<00:01:29.579> take<00:01:29.759> another

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
what I mean by that let's take another

remember<00:01:34.530> where<00:01:34.890> your<00:01:35.100> hand<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.520> positioned

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
remember where your hand is positioned

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.360 
remember where your hand is positioned
will<00:01:36.810> determine<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.410> degree<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.770> shortness

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
will determine the degree of shortness

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.310 
will determine the degree of shortness
of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> slice<00:01:38.910> so<00:01:39.540> let's<00:01:39.720> slide<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.110> little

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
of the slice so let's slide out a little

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.180 
of the slice so let's slide out a little
bit<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.680> mid-shaft<00:01:42.440> I'm<00:01:43.440> going<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.680> start<00:01:43.950> at

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
bit more mid-shaft I'm going to start at

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.400 
bit more mid-shaft I'm going to start at
the<00:01:44.430> top<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.090> time<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.570> slice<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:46.080> way<00:01:46.260> out

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
the top this time and slice my way out

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.440 
the top this time and slice my way out
to<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> existing<00:01:47.130> length<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.120> that<00:01:48.150> what<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to the existing length so that what I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.120 
to the existing length so that what I
create<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.050> little<00:01:49.320> bit<00:01:49.440> more<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.650> a<00:01:49.740> sliced

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
create is a little bit more of a sliced

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.540 
create is a little bit more of a sliced
diagonal<00:01:50.880> edge<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.500> slice<00:01:52.890> slice

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
diagonal edge so I just slice slice

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.350 
diagonal edge so I just slice slice
slice<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.620> to<00:01:55.830> work<00:01:56.040> from<00:01:56.340> short<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
slice so I get it to work from short to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.350 
slice so I get it to work from short to
long<00:01:58.490> great<00:01:59.490> technique
