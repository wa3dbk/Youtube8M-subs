00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
hi everyone welcome to my place often

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.839 
hi everyone welcome to my place often
I'm<00:00:09.840> asked<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.070> do<00:00:11.280> with<00:00:11.490> things

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
I'm asked what do you do with things

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.770 
I'm asked what do you do with things
like<00:00:12.000> Pam's<00:00:12.599> or<00:00:13.250> grasses<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.639> what's<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
like Pam's or grasses and what's the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.410 
like Pam's or grasses and what's the
best<00:00:16.020> way<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.320> design<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.699> them<00:00:17.910> especially

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
best way to design with them especially

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.060 
best way to design with them especially
when<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.869> look<00:00:19.080> at<00:00:19.230> them<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.650> my<00:00:19.680> sugar

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
when you look at them this is my sugar

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.160 
when you look at them this is my sugar
cane<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.609> actually<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.300> an<00:00:21.570> article<00:00:21.869> that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
cane and I actually have an article that

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.529 
cane and I actually have an article that
I<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.949> submit<00:00:23.550> photographs<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I have to submit photographs for and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.689 
I have to submit photographs for and
then<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.260> article<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.859> magazine<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.490> write

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
then the article and magazine I write

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.750 
then the article and magazine I write
for<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.000> called<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.420> local<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.640> thought

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
for is called a local and I just thought

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.310 
for is called a local and I just thought
well<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.060> will<00:00:30.240> be<00:00:30.300> perfect

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
well this will be perfect

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
well this will be perfect
I'll<00:00:31.470> kill<00:00:31.949> two<00:00:32.189> birds<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.700> stone<00:00:32.910> but

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
I'll kill two birds with one stone but

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.540 
I'll kill two birds with one stone but
when<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> comes<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.649> designing<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.250> grasses

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
when it comes to designing with grasses

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.760 
when it comes to designing with grasses
they<00:00:36.090> are<00:00:36.329> quite<00:00:36.719> difficult<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.469> they

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
they are quite difficult because they

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.459 
they are quite difficult because they
have<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> life<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.640> their<00:00:38.850> own<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.290> how

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
have a life of their own so this is how

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.020 
have a life of their own so this is how
I've<00:00:40.680> solved<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.520> I've<00:00:41.610> done<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.910> I've

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
I've solved of what I've done is I've

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
I've solved of what I've done is I've
gone<00:00:42.210> out<00:00:42.420> I've<00:00:42.600> cut<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> sugar<00:00:43.379> cane<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
gone out I've cut the sugar cane I

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.459 
gone out I've cut the sugar cane I
didn't<00:00:44.460> get<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> big<00:00:44.910> bits<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> cane<00:00:45.629> because

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
didn't get the big bits of cane because

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
didn't get the big bits of cane because
it's<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.219> stringy<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.850> horrible<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it's just all stringy and horrible and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.180 
it's just all stringy and horrible and
the<00:00:48.750> dirt<00:00:49.020> falls<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:49.530> over<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> place<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the dirt falls all over the place and I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.160 
the dirt falls all over the place and I
thought<00:00:50.309> I'll<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:51.120> keep<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> grass

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
thought I'll just keep with the grass

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
thought I'll just keep with the grass
but<00:00:52.469> now<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.460> has<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.730> tendency<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
but now because it has a tendency to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.330 
but now because it has a tendency to
grow<00:00:54.600> really<00:00:54.840> tall<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.530> fall<00:00:55.920> off<00:00:56.129> all

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
grow really tall and just fall off all

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.110 
grow really tall and just fall off all
over<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> place

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
over the place

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.090 
over the place
what<00:00:57.510> I've<00:00:57.629> done<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.140> put<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> into<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.770> VARs

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
what I've done is I put it into a VARs

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
what I've done is I put it into a VARs
with<00:00:59.820> water<00:01:00.090> there<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> VAS<00:01:01.230> comes<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.980> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
with water there and the VAS comes up so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.189 
with water there and the VAS comes up so
that<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.520> helps<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.059> keep<00:01:03.239> everything<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.170> in

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that it helps to keep everything all in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.950 
that it helps to keep everything all in
one<00:01:04.470> place<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:05.100> when<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> comes<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.600> selecting

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
one place now when it comes to selecting

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.469 
one place now when it comes to selecting
your<00:01:07.260> container<00:01:07.830> what<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.270> look

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
your container what I do is I look

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
your container what I do is I look
closely<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> plant<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.220> it's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
closely at the plant and how it's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
closely at the plant and how it's
growing<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.150> when<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> cane

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
growing and when you see the cane

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.560 
growing and when you see the cane
growing<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.040> does<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.850> those<00:01:15.060> bits<00:01:15.390> Lee's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
growing it does have those bits Lee's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.590 
growing it does have those bits Lee's
sort<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.140> barkis<00:01:16.860> sort<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.420> dried<00:01:18.420> off

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
sort of like barkis sort of dried off

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.530 
sort of like barkis sort of dried off
grassy<00:01:19.200> bits<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> stalk<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> selected

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
grassy bits up the stalk so I selected

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.840 
grassy bits up the stalk so I selected
this<00:01:21.780> container<00:01:22.290> which<00:01:22.680> I'm<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.759> going

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this container which I'm now just going

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.859 
this container which I'm now just going
to<00:01:24.119> put<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.369> now<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.570> faced

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
to put into the like so now I'm faced

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
to put into the like so now I'm faced
with<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.320> my<00:01:28.710> goodness<00:01:29.159> what's<00:01:29.400> happening<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
with all my goodness what's happening I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480 
with all my goodness what's happening I
can<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> back<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.619> top<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
can see the back the top of the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.969 
can see the back the top of the
container<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> solve<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.860> I'm

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
container so to solve that what I'm

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.310 
container so to solve that what I'm
going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.640> I'm<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.060> use

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
going to do is I'm going to use

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.469 
going to do is I'm going to use
something<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.430> same<00:01:38.479> colorway

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
something that is of the same colorway

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.249 
something that is of the same colorway
but<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.560> different<00:01:41.070> texture<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.259> pretty

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
but it's a different texture and pretty

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.130 
but it's a different texture and pretty
much<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.740> I'm<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.820> wine<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
much all I'm going to do is wine that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.749 
much all I'm going to do is wine that
around<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> associate<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> I'm<00:01:47.399> only

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
around the associate and I'm only

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.850 
around the associate and I'm only
covering<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.140> could<00:01:49.290> use<00:01:49.439> Marsh<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
covering up you you could use Marsh you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 
covering up you you could use Marsh you
could<00:01:50.159> use<00:01:50.369> whatever<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.659> want<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.020> could

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
could use whatever you want you could

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.630 
could use whatever you want you could
probably<00:01:52.320> use<00:01:52.619> leaves<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.189> push<00:01:53.369> those<00:01:53.579> down

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
probably use leaves and push those down

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.749 
probably use leaves and push those down
but<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.229> found<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.040> studio

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
but I just I found this in the studio

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.730 
but I just I found this in the studio
honor<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.060> our<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.530> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
honor for our that will do so that just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.830 
honor for our that will do so that just
goes<00:01:58.920> into<00:01:59.430> there<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> other<00:02:00.149> thing<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
goes into there and the other thing is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.929 
goes into there and the other thing is
there<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.740> there's<00:02:02.130> bits<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.549> pieces<00:02:02.759> that

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
there if there's bits and pieces that

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.289 
there if there's bits and pieces that
are<00:02:03.180> sort<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.700> falling<00:02:06.210> all

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
are sort of like you know falling all

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.919 
are sort of like you know falling all
over<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.719> place<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:08.509> asparagus<00:02:09.509> film

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
over the place then that asparagus film

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.710 
over the place then that asparagus film
will<00:02:10.050> keep<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.379> all<00:02:10.500> together<00:02:10.679> right<00:02:11.670> now<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.540> I

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
will keep it all together right now as I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.790 
will keep it all together right now as I
said<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.080> didn't

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
said I didn't

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.260 
said I didn't

sort of feel that I need to have a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.960 
sort of feel that I need to have a
couple<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.740> bits<00:02:22.920> into<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.490> found<00:02:23.760> this

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
couple of bits into this I found this

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.910 
couple of bits into this I found this
artificial<00:02:24.900> bamboo<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.470> I'm<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.830> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
artificial bamboo so I'm just going to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.620 
artificial bamboo so I'm just going to
use<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> other<00:02:26.550> thing<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.940> there<00:02:27.210> with

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
use that the other thing is there with

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.170 
use that the other thing is there with
the<00:02:27.810> dark<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.470> back<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.280> container<00:02:30.000> of

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
the dark of the back of the container of

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.990 
the dark of the back of the container of
the<00:02:30.270> basket<00:02:30.810> bringing<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> Flex<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.400> cane

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the basket bringing the Flex the cane

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.030 
the basket bringing the Flex the cane
and<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> stark<00:02:33.750> color<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.380> she<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.770> brings

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and the stark color it she just brings

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.790 
and the stark color it she just brings
that<00:02:35.130> base<00:02:35.550> color<00:02:35.880> up<00:02:36.120> into<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.720> up<00:02:37.080> into<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
that base color up into the up into the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.520 
that base color up into the up into the
design<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.820> can<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.750> sit<00:02:40.020> intervie

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
design so that can just sit intervie

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.100 
design so that can just sit intervie
like<00:02:40.740> that<00:02:40.980> now<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.760> sort<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.300> thought<00:02:42.540> older

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
like that now I sort of thought older

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.600 
like that now I sort of thought older
but<00:02:43.260> quite<00:02:43.470> nice<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.830> have<00:02:43.950> some<00:02:44.130> flowers<00:02:44.430> with

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
but quite nice to have some flowers with

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.350 
but quite nice to have some flowers with
it<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.510> its<00:02:45.720> own<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.260> okay<00:02:46.830> but<00:02:47.460> then<00:02:47.970> I

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
it so on its own it's okay but then I

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.960 
it so on its own it's okay but then I
found<00:02:48.660> these<00:02:49.170> gloriosa<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.640> thought<00:02:50.820> ah

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
found these gloriosa and I thought ah

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.050 
found these gloriosa and I thought ah
I'll<00:02:51.420> use<00:02:51.750> these<00:02:52.050> now<00:02:52.620> these<00:02:53.010> are<00:02:53.370> artificial

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
I'll use these now these are artificial

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.760 
I'll use these now these are artificial
but<00:02:54.480> they're<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.660> beautiful<00:02:55.170> color<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.560> just

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
but they're a beautiful color and I just

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.740 
but they're a beautiful color and I just
thought<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.160> they<00:02:56.280> would<00:02:56.430> lift<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.450> grass

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
thought that they would lift the grass

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.410 
thought that they would lift the grass
now<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.380> really<00:02:58.860> would<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.760> cut<00:02:59.970> these<00:03:00.150> but

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
now I really would like to cut these but

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.030 
now I really would like to cut these but
I've<00:03:00.600> got<00:03:00.780> another<00:03:01.050> design<00:03:01.470> coming<00:03:01.800> out<00:03:01.860> so

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
I've got another design coming out so
