00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.420
 so welcome all your friends with you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.880
 Buratin is the 15th hour of micro-mechanisms 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.820
 today I will show them the obsidian generator and 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.130
 so here is how it looks here just 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 worth distributing below water flows 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 we put redstone here lava appears 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.750
 generated our apse 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.699
 can and generate infinitely and so 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.300
 the biggest charm of this arrangement is 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.840
 the fact that he is a glass and how we see everything 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.120
 generated can generate how many 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 whatever, that is, the length also builds how much 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 but this mechanism is small 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.469
 minus but not significant and that is if 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.510
 we will put riston quickly here and here 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.860
 then here the laurels are gone here and 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 generated by 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.649
 obsidian here and then here and also by 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.170
 full length 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.629
 as can see and then your throne 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.220
 built this mechanism will first take 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.860
 all we need for him 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.939
 buildings that is it is any block red 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.760
 torch dispenser 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.950
 a bucket of water in my case decorative 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.490
 food not to forgive mechanism and 4 buckets 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.869
 lava and because i will build 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.750
 mechanics and 4 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.790
 in length 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.170
 and so let's start so we do 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.650
 recesses in one block 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.860
 we pour water over there like water and we 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.170
 put any block 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.250
 my case is an iron block and here 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.280
 here we put a distributor like this 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.040
 collect red Farka's put Park 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.190
 charge in our strike vedrov buckets 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.979
 lava and all the mechanism from them is not built 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.130
 terribly easy and so let's get it 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:00.950
 check set here with new and 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.710
 generates obsidian itself and so let's same 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.690
 I sort of continue it 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.890
 we continue to deepen to three 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.930
 blocks and pour water 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.900
 we also complete the blocks and set 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:21.370
 again distributors so 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.599
 now put the red torches and charge 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.799
 in distributors 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:31.750
 our lava so well everything is ready now 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:41.920
 we only need to decorate the mechanism 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:45.540
 so here and so well, I still did like this 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.540
 behind such rims 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:58.359
 let us all check how we see everything 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.980
 works all while you were Pinocchio 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.980
