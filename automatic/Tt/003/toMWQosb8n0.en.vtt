 these 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.750
 these are files that are needed for 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.270
 that this works is the file of 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.240
 winrar and this is a code for the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.420
 see that it is true because here it is in 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.710
 each one of the download links of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.710
 Load each file 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.830
 nothing else what you have to do 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.630
 It is folding and ready disappear 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.240
 these files is up to you 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.510
 where they want to save then 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.540
 once they were all downloaded 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:42.740
 the east there is this concision 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.509
 this these two are going to download fast 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.360
 and this also everyone who goes to 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.979
 take longer in this and this which are the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.750
 that are heavier but do not 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.790
 worry about five minutes is 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.550
 more may be moving here in 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.140
 Facebook 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.659
 good 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.540
 already once they downloaded them that has 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.100
 have already been saved wherever they are but 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.170
 If I have memory, I was in a 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.830
 folder that I made the mine a bit clearer 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.110
 here that says unnatural 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.750
 to open the game that they have to do 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.750
 double click wait for it to open 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.069
 since there will be where we can emotions 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.580
 we put the file 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.840
 open 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.490
 and it's going to lead us to this we go here and 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.810
 we will now only leave the file 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.500
 winrar since all these who are here 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.650
 and each one to say this one already of that 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.930
 pressure because I do not need what 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.319
 we need to learn this and these 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.650
 two have already left to use this then 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.650
 we click 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.270
 as well 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.130
 good we have closed because 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.600
 my computer is already made for 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.600
 you should not have that happen 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.310
 good 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.730
 from the game 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:30.620
 z is ab sx 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.450
 if you want to overtake them with a little 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.450
 because they despair with the boy 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.700
 for keyboard the space bar 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.920
 if not 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.950
 we expect a thing intro enter back 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.210
 and when they want to leave, it's not only 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.210
 easy let's go 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.030
 and still do not ignore 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.630
 goes more 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.680
 exit 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.680
 that simple 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.880
