each time and getting lots of
repetitions<00:01:58.960> in<00:01:59.140> maybe<00:02:00.130> I'll<00:02:00.340> pull<00:02:00.580> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
repetitions in maybe I'll pull the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.930 
repetitions in maybe I'll pull the
goalie<00:02:00.900> from<00:02:01.900> behind<00:02:02.230> me<00:02:02.500> again<00:02:02.830> maybe<00:02:03.700> I've

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
goalie from behind me again maybe I've

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.720 
goalie from behind me again maybe I've
cut<00:02:04.750> across<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.350> front<00:02:05.620> of<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.770> neck<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.250> I

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
cut across the front of the neck and I

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.120 
cut across the front of the neck and I
need<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.030> get<00:02:07.150> a<00:02:07.210> shot<00:02:07.570> in<00:02:07.750> from<00:02:08.530> behind<00:02:08.679> my

need to get a shot in from behind my

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.610 
need to get a shot in from behind my
body<00:02:09.429> this<00:02:10.179> device<00:02:10.600> will<00:02:10.840> allow<00:02:10.959> me<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.440> do

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
body this device will allow me to do

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.750 
body this device will allow me to do
that<00:02:11.800> as<00:02:12.040> well<00:02:13.650> lots<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.830> kids<00:02:15.040> get<00:02:15.310> involved

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
that as well lots of kids get involved

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.020 
that as well lots of kids get involved
with<00:02:15.850> their<00:02:16.000> hands<00:02:16.330> too<00:02:16.540> close<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.110> themselves

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
with their hands too close to themselves

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.480 
with their hands too close to themselves
this<00:02:19.030> way<00:02:19.350> would<00:02:20.350> be<00:02:20.380> improper<00:02:21.070> technique

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
this way would be improper technique

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.449 
this way would be improper technique
just<00:02:22.000> pushing<00:02:22.510> forward<00:02:23.500> with<00:02:23.680> their<00:02:23.800> hands<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
just pushing forward with their hands to

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.380 
just pushing forward with their hands to
close<00:02:24.760> pressing<00:02:25.450> down<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.970> puck<00:02:28.180> will

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
close pressing down and the puck will

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.670 
close pressing down and the puck will
never<00:02:28.600> get<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.050> where<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.290> needs<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.590> go

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
never get to where it needs to go

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.550 
never get to where it needs to go
