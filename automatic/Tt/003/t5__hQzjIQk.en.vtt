 outwardly this car is nothing 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.640
 notable from the previous generation

 Vectra 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.550
 however, the car looks 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.800
 really nice

 plasma sky that adds disappointment 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.070
 despite the relatively modest 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.760

 equipped with adaptive color and xenon and 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.310
 such an attempt to compensate for all those

 cant which you know a little 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:50.690

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.620
 here is the company three-spoke steering wheel 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.830
 which is regulated by departure and

 hard year 2009 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.130
 general motors could not afford 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.200
 master new technologies so they 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.550
 bought all the screens that are for the pills 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.770
 old vectors and omegas back in the late 90s 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.360
 Why yes to inject them into 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.280
 new cars 20 years later

 opel modern bartoshek technology 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.480
 here it’s just gigantic in size 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.780
 backlit and even ventilated i 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.340

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.830
 some time opel and here finally 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.800
 give up on your car 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.780
 therefore he has nothing left 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.090
 who sit down and start using 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.100
 entertainment drink because 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.100
 there was no other way out for him

 center console unpleasantly surprised 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.159
 newbie because here is 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.780
 a variety of buttons on top are 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.489
 control buttons staff muffin 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.709
 the word cracks quite a good idea 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.299
 the standard system at the bottom are buttons 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.660
 climate control system 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.879
 In essence, this is a sound fee for cars 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.160
 c-class, these are the things from Renault 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.110
 logan they took that as we said 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.000
 we have not the most complete sets here 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.430
 rich armrest so we here 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.720
 No, even if he didn’t care 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.790
 you can't catch a small thing there 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.860
 dangling back and forth even the same 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.780
 cell phone near the cigarette lighter do not throw 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.030
 because she doesn't physically fit in there 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.129
 the result is a complete bard with 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.640
 this phone and have to endure 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.459
 pocket 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.180
 But you could think it over here alone 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.959
 of the most reliable boxes in the world this 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.030
 6-speed manual 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.979
 gear which in principle does not deliver 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.110
 no trouble for your hapless 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.300
 the owner also had these cars 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.860
 Japanese torque converters which 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.470
 were still less reliable than 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.479
 stirrer crowning idiocy and and schad yamada 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.370
 is a robotic box 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.470
 gears and it essentially represents 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.320
 same electrician only with electric 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.240
 brains love this box 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.340
 head extremely thoughtful and constantly 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.289
 tries to switch however and 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.919
 approaching the hour of replacing the hydraulic 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.440
 clutch 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.630
 get on the back of things you need to be extremely 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.669
 neat and not knowing the chips 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.370
 passengers will be constantly pants 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.599
 wipe the threshold considering I'm here 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.490
 sitting by myself 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.349
 from the knees to the front seat 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.530
 the distances here are quite decent and in 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.910
 In general, it is even convenient but only for two 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.460
 cigarette lighter will touch the armrest 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.160
 accordingly too 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.930
 there is a h1 cup holder and no longer 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.630
 need to wait for anything in the car also 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.550
 will light up and all the pigs and yes if u 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.130
 front passengers have electric 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.620
 windows with closers are you here 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.979
 will have to work hands opid here 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.870
 and you take care go to yourself 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.130
 probably interesting cars with 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.580
 station wagon 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.069
 about the trunk, we of course if you do not 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.860
 enough money for real bulba loss 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.819
 diesel passat wagon opel astra 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.669
 caravan 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.710
 quite a good choice trunk 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.349
 taken in the world with liters not going to force 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.080
 the world with sacks of potatoes is all according to 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.599
 stereotypes here will put you four 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.970
 bag and if you fold the rear seats then 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.750
 can accommodate and 6 I think that this 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.750
 good result 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.940
 opel rides and confident 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.430
 Doors felt insulation there goes 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.590
 here only flocks the turbine is nice 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.020
 picks up a moment somewhere from two two s 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.030
 half a thousand turns due to this and 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.810
 it creates a feeling of bad dynamics 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.229
 the car 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.090
 here stands the electric power he gives 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.160
 at speed pleasant steering 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.410
 some unusual sensations for me but 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.120
 cool as the car was driven to 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.919
 we are from Europe here is a suspension 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.449
 sandwiched it is not adapted to our 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.040
 roads 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:04.050
 harsh on wahab but on speed 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:06.510
 you feel a little more confident there 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.880
 The conclusion is really not bad. 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.680
 dungeon there is this economical turbodiesel 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.850
 the turbine gives some cool 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.460
 cleaning sensations 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.070
 and given the fact that the car costs from 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.350
 80 thousand in the secondary market 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.230
 it adds some examples to her 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.760
 I would buy myself such a machine rather no 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.600
 than yes 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.460
