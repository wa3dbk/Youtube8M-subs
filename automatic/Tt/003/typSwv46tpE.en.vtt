cube world this time I have if you can
see<00:00:06.540> around<00:00:06.690> me<00:00:07.020> I've<00:00:07.319> gotten<00:00:07.710> into<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.919> snow

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
see around me I've gotten into a snow

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.129 
see around me I've gotten into a snow
biome<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.940> just<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.330> bit<00:00:09.480> I'll<00:00:09.660> tell<00:00:09.990> you

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
biome and just a bit I'll tell you

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.379 
biome and just a bit I'll tell you
exactly<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.160> seat<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.910> how<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.090> get

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
exactly what the seat is and how to get

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.620 
exactly what the seat is and how to get
there<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:13.040> on<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.400> map<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:15.000> not<00:00:15.240> showing<00:00:15.450> up

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
there but on the map it's not showing up

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.960 
there but on the map it's not showing up
where<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.929> went<00:00:16.260> because<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.859> reloaded<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.699> but

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
where I went because I reloaded it but

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.510 
where I went because I reloaded it but
basically<00:00:18.270> or<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:19.260> had<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.500> run<00:00:19.770> actually<00:00:20.100> quite

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
basically or I had to run actually quite

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.730 
basically or I had to run actually quite
a<00:00:20.550> long<00:00:20.820> distance<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.140> from<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
a long distance to this from the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.540 
a long distance to this from the
southeast<00:00:23.340> from<00:00:24.150> where<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> start<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.740> when

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
southeast from where you start so when

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.730 
southeast from where you start so when
you<00:00:26.640> start<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.330> run<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> southeast<00:00:28.470> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
you start you run to the southeast to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.080 
you start you run to the southeast to
get<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> snow<00:00:29.340> island<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.760> takes<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
get to the snow island and it takes a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.389 
get to the snow island and it takes a
while<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.599> keep<00:00:31.529> running<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> while<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
while so keep running for a while and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.870 
while so keep running for a while and
now<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.510> give<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.890> seed<00:00:35.610> for

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
now I'm going to give you the seed for

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.139 
now I'm going to give you the seed for
it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.080 
it
so<00:00:36.380> if<00:00:37.380> I'll<00:00:38.100> probably<00:00:38.370> also<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
so if I'll probably also have it on the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.459 
so if I'll probably also have it on the
screen<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> want<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.870> know<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.230> seed

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
screen so if you want to know what seed

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.630 
screen so if you want to know what seed
is<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.160> eight<00:00:41.989> seven<00:00:42.989> four<00:00:43.739> five

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
is here it is it's eight seven four five

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.060 
is here it is it's eight seven four five
six<00:00:45.629> three<00:00:46.520> two<00:00:47.520> nine

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
six three two nine

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.910 
six three two nine
so<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> got<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:52.410> want<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.680> play<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
so if you got that you want to play in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.380 
so if you got that you want to play in
the<00:00:53.010> snow<00:00:53.070> biome<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> got<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the snow biome that's what you got to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.040 
the snow biome that's what you got to
type<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.320> now<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:56.280> gonna<00:00:56.489> check<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:57.050> try

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
type in but now I'm gonna check out try

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.840 
type in but now I'm gonna check out try
and<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.530> city<00:00:58.949> over<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and get to that city over there on the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.479 
and get to that city over there on the
map<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:01.129> in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.609> meantime<00:01:02.820> bite<00:01:03.570> some

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
map and in the meantime bite some

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.320 
map and in the meantime bite some
different<00:01:05.489> snow<00:01:05.670> people<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.150> are<00:01:06.210> here

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
different snow people that are here

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330 
different snow people that are here
whatever<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.380> actually<00:01:07.650> get<00:01:07.770> penguins

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
whatever you can actually get penguins

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.710 
whatever you can actually get penguins
stuff<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.600> not

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
stuff here so it's like it's not

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.690 
stuff here so it's like it's not
pointless<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> different<00:01:11.400> biomes

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
pointless going to the different biomes

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
pointless going to the different biomes
they<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.030> actually<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.540> different<00:01:12.990> stuff

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
they have actually like different stuff

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.950 
they have actually like different stuff
you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.270> finally<00:01:15.659> figured

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you can get and now I finally figured

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.050 
you can get and now I finally figured
out<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.890> animals<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
out what animals I can get with the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.960 
out what animals I can get with the
stuff<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.110> I'll<00:01:19.979> eventually<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.790> that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
stuff I have so I'll eventually do that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.649 
stuff I have so I'll eventually do that
um<00:01:21.420> there's<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.850> over<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:24.420> want<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
um there's a over they don't want to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.740 
um there's a over they don't want to
mess<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.350> would<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.830> nice<00:01:26.040> flower

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
mess with that would be a nice flower

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.510 
mess with that would be a nice flower
you<00:01:27.750> don't<00:01:27.900> want<00:01:28.020> those<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:29.130> something

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
