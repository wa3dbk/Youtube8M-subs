origin<00:02:52.190> h2k<00:02:52.700> fanatic<00:02:53.150> they're<00:02:53.510> above

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
origin h2k fanatic they're above

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.440 
origin h2k fanatic they're above
everyone<00:02:54.380> else<00:02:54.590> sure<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.880> like<00:02:56.090> my<00:02:56.239> thought

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
everyone else sure but like my thought

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.170 
everyone else sure but like my thought
process<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:56.930> like<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.470> feel<00:02:58.459> like<00:02:58.579> origin<00:02:59.060> and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
process is like I feel like origin and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.940 
process is like I feel like origin and
age<00:02:59.299> UK<00:02:59.510> they<00:02:59.810> are<00:02:59.900> successful<00:03:00.470> because<00:03:00.500> they

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
age UK they are successful because they

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.640 
age UK they are successful because they
are<00:03:01.040> more<00:03:01.160> consistent<00:03:01.549> whenever<00:03:02.060> us<00:03:02.650> it's

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
are more consistent whenever us it's

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.520 
are more consistent whenever us it's
like<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.280> think<00:03:05.090> h2k<00:03:05.540> an<00:03:05.720> origin<00:03:06.109> have<00:03:06.290> had

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
like I think h2k an origin have had

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.699 
like I think h2k an origin have had
really<00:03:07.069> rough<00:03:07.280> losses<00:03:07.690> themselves<00:03:08.690> with<00:03:09.560> an

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
really rough losses themselves with an

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.250 
really rough losses themselves with an
origin<00:03:10.100> lost<00:03:10.280> against<00:03:10.519> us<00:03:10.700> those<00:03:11.600> things<00:03:11.750> sk

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
origin lost against us those things sk

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.979 
origin lost against us those things sk
as<00:03:12.380> well<00:03:12.530> yeah<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.280> i<00:03:14.060> think<00:03:14.090> they're<00:03:14.959> very

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
as well yeah and i think they're very
