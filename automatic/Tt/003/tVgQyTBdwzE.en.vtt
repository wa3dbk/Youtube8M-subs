00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.750
 People I left the beauty and make and this is 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.929

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.970
 that it's about a super cool thing and that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.310
 a lot of people ask me 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.529
 Since when I started with a blog talking 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.289
 about nail decoration many 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.689
 decorations stones tools for items 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.710
 what you need to buy to be able to do 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.820
 nail decoration and today came to you 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.070
 which will replace the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.239
 one of the tools is the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.920
 goal scorer are those on business 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.969
 Here are the balls you see. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.000
 people buy is quite the favor 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.640
 and that but you do not have to buy 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.039
 because I 'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.300
 homemade homemade goalscorer 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.579
 Another item is the little sponge 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.000
 that also follows with makeup that is to 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.530
 make the nails with frost darker and 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 mails that is the one in which you will stay 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.990
 a game where you will do or to remember 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.140
 colors is also going to have alternative 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.100
 to this little hiding place and something that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 A lot of people talk there I have one 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.790
 pawn has to be rehearsals I have one 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.189
 Brushes kit has several insert Mario 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 and that in some places it is 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.409
 very clear that I would teach 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.350
 also how you can make your 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.960
 own in heaven so stay tuned in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.479
 video and boss you hurt end 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.060
 so let's start with the scorer has 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.210
 several alternatives to the scorer 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.689
 this first is the toothpick that is 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.810
 the tip of the toothpick until it 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.299
 plan 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.049
 I'll show you to also two 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.900
 support alternatives for eu art 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.509
 the first one is the little glass this little glass I 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.090
 I took picture frame same reason 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.830
 and the second one is the cd that is what I go 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.920
 use here with you 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:23.610
 so let's see the toothpick in practice is just 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.140
 you put a little bit of enamel and 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.140
 make the marine xvii 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.989
 now the second alternative that is the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.300
 orange sprigs 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.459
 You're going to do the same thing with him. 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.940
 You did with a toothpick. 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.300
 Leave me alone until you're flat, then you'll have 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.910
 two sizes of a smaller niche bolle 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:54.989
 and the larger one now the application 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:59.750
 with the orange stick that the same 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.750
 Thing, folks, just lean on the nail 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.300
 without mystery 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.290
 Another alternative is the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:15.780
 ball shape that is simple right 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:21.420
 same people just touch and stamp 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.130
 the nail or you can also use a 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.140
 hair clip 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.760
 the group also has two 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.770
 little ball 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.770
 then there are more variations 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.420
 now as an alternative to 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.780
 make up 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.120
 you can use a new sponge or 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.730
 even an old one that you used to wash the 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.760
 and let it dry well I'll do 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.550
 this new one with you will explain how I 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.320
 shooting when you 're young or old is just cutting 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.670
 and give a little and then only with 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.490
 the soft part 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.330
 you cut a little bit to be able to 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.330
 enjoy it 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:29.870
 is ready to be used and 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.710
 Now let's give you how to make a 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.760
 in heaven for me I art a fine brush 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.060
 It's very yes he will get a brush 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:46.070
 Old Enamel I already finished 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:49.460
 clean and cut the bristles on the 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.560
 amount you prefer I go 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.490
 do it for you two 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.880
 I'll do the thickest and one more 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.120
 to use 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:06.550
 just choose any enamel put 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.860
 in the nail polish and pass the nail 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.070
 So simple people have no mystery 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.070
 none 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.030
 to use the brush again with another 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.260
 Enamel color is only cleaned with cotton and 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.960
 Acetone there is no longer an excuse 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.430
 to say ah I can not do such 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.840
