00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.990 
and some nice wheels but then I
remembered<00:04:27.979> something<00:04:28.190> about<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.699> cars

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
remembered something about this cars

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.870 
remembered something about this cars
siblings<00:04:29.800> even<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.889> regular<00:04:31.070> sonic<00:04:31.550> has<00:04:31.699> a

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
siblings even the regular sonic has a

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.219 
siblings even the regular sonic has a
decent<00:04:32.120> ride<00:04:32.419> setup<00:04:32.750> but<00:04:32.900> now<00:04:32.990> that<00:04:33.139> the

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
decent ride setup but now that the

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.230 
decent ride setup but now that the
suspension<00:04:33.590> has<00:04:33.860> been<00:04:33.889> -<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.370> feels<00:04:34.669> planted

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
suspension has been - that feels planted

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.480 
suspension has been - that feels planted
even<00:04:35.870> when<00:04:36.080> you're<00:04:36.260> pushing<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.710> ok<00:04:37.370> it'll

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
even when you're pushing it ok it'll

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.279 
even when you're pushing it ok it'll
still<00:04:37.789> torque<00:04:38.150> steer<00:04:38.389> on<00:04:38.510> surfaces<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.050> it's

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
still torque steer on surfaces that it's

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.379 
still torque steer on surfaces that it's
not<00:04:39.410> particularly<00:04:39.860> fond<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.490> but<00:04:41.030> generally

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
not particularly fond of but generally

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.760 
not particularly fond of but generally
it<00:04:41.479> strikes<00:04:41.810> just<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.350> right<00:04:42.530> balance

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
it strikes just the right balance

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.980 
it strikes just the right balance
between<00:04:43.010> being<00:04:43.580> comfortable<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.330> being

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
between being comfortable and being

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.260 
between being comfortable and being
grippy

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
grippy

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.760 
grippy
for<00:04:47.270> me<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.600> chef<00:04:47.810> sonic<00:04:48.169> was<00:04:48.320> always<00:04:48.620> an

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
for me the chef sonic was always an

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.010 
for me the chef sonic was always an
also-ran<00:04:49.190> in<00:04:49.580> this<00:04:49.699> kateri<00:04:50.030> mainly<00:04:50.690> because<00:04:50.810> I

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
also-ran in this kateri mainly because I

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.750 
also-ran in this kateri mainly because I
didn't<00:04:51.289> quite<00:04:51.440> get<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.800> styling<00:04:52.250> but<00:04:52.610> also

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
didn't quite get the styling but also

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.800 
didn't quite get the styling but also
because<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.180> always<00:04:53.330> thought<00:04:53.630> they<00:04:53.780> were

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
because I always thought they were

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:01.920 
because I always thought they were
options<00:04:54.260> with<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.440> bit<00:04:54.560> more<00:04:54.740> personality

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.600 

sure<00:05:02.930> this<00:05:03.229> isn't<00:05:03.529> a<00:05:03.620> run-of-the-mill<00:05:04.069> sonic

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
sure this isn't a run-of-the-mill sonic

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.339 
sure this isn't a run-of-the-mill sonic
but<00:05:04.999> it<00:05:05.120> has<00:05:05.270> changed<00:05:05.659> my<00:05:05.809> mind<00:05:06.080> about<00:05:06.229> the

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
but it has changed my mind about the

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.619 
but it has changed my mind about the
name<00:05:06.620> cars<00:05:07.339> related<00:05:07.729> to<00:05:07.819> this<00:05:07.969> one<00:05:08.150> can't<00:05:08.479> be

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
name cars related to this one can't be

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:18.730 
name cars related to this one can't be
all<00:05:08.749> bad<00:05:08.779> surely<00:05:16.569> we're<00:05:17.569> used<00:05:17.779> to<00:05:17.870> RS<00:05:18.259> bad<00:05:18.499> just

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
all bad surely we're used to RS bad just

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.709 
all bad surely we're used to RS bad just
turning<00:05:19.009> normal<00:05:19.370> cars<00:05:19.580> into<00:05:19.999> monsters<00:05:20.569> but

turning normal cars into monsters but

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.510 
turning normal cars into monsters but
that's<00:05:20.870> not<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.289> case<00:05:21.469> here<00:05:21.770> although<00:05:22.370> that's
