00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 xavier towards nardÃ² and welcome a 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.420
 new video today we play kraft robots 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.309
 the robot guys who asked me 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.559
 I actually try the game 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.139
 I already knew and liked it a lot and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.940
 so I took the leap ed 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:33.110
 here's the chance to make a video 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:35.430
 let's see right away this is my bot 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.780
 small box 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.870
 if we take q we have ours 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 plan inventory of pussies with us 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.670
 you can buy etc. 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.030
 and in the end it's a little bit you have to 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.100
 build blocks then type 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.390
 minecraft is a box game so you 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.949
 build your spaceship shuttle 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.539
 helicopter all that is with the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.559
 various weapons etcetera 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.420
 then I'll do this thing 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.270
 besides seeing eggs they are never 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.340
 player so I assume from the fact though 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.799
 that it is a who in the lower right than it is 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.070
 a kind of other minecraft type 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.820
 I guess I was not even a developer then 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.960
 let's do like this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.200
 oh how nice it puts them as if they were 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.890
 theaters because ies is perfect see 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.939
 what is already taking shape 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.240
 surely it will be the strongest vehicle 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.240
 of the world 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.530
 look how it succeeds and style time 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.530
 yes I remain too bad 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.090
 ok ok no because dance because 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.670
 oh my God my God 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.610
 the main purpose of this game is 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.100
 go to the meanwhile destroy all the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.780
 time or go and live 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.740
 the checkpoint I played a 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.390
 nice bit to this game and I must say that I 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.460
 also liked a lot because I have 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.680
 played with two other enemies than between 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.810
 the other is often commented on 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.060
 channel would be in substance and nicola 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.860
 red however our goal usually 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.940
 being the gigantor bots it is very powerful it is 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.850
 that of eliminating the enemy megayacht 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.370
 that are hurting me because I don't have 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.959
 a doctor ok now as you can see if 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.310
 this helicopter doctor who is me 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.230
 taking care of and practically is the one of which 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.300
 the megawatts live 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.209
 let's celebrate the doctor like this now 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.540
 and for sweep it has no more weapons as you can 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.489
 see and as you damage yours 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.010
 pour as you can see if i break 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:59.410
 little blocks a little at a time 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.700
 time also god oh my God oh my God 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.769
 wait wait 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.170
 no no no no should go straight for 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.870
 straight as companies professor eco oddio 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.580
 I'm calm, but you don't get nervous 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.670
 play hey hey you what you want not to 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.580
 install do n't shoot me in alley 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.160
 a thousand times the fruit of my farewell back 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.140
 flip and this is the is the black sheep 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.100
 perfect machine as long as it continues to do 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.100
 back always boasts no 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:32.080
 what the heck happened I think it was 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.459
 a junta that they did because of 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.739
 usually when the enemy team came 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.659
 destroyed by battles, it ended immediately 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.430
 anyway we won as you can see 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.980
 at the top right there is a red bar that 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.890
 it fills up and that is the point of 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.170
 control that is in the process of being 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.530
 capture when the fourth arrives 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.599
 cleat we will have the team of bulls do not you 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.280
 explained how it works the most 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.530
 of building bots 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.489
 practically every time you play if 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:05.650
 win if you lose you will get some money 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:09.609
 called rp will vary based on how many 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.250
 who do you take based on whether you are good or not 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.220
 how many assists how many beautiful things it does 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.840
 in short and then with the enriched ones 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.970
 build you can buy the blocks 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:25.840
 at this moment I took 158 of them 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:29.680
 Thousand are so many, however there are many 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.139
 the fact is that they are in trx tir is 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.960
 just to buy me a little thing 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.900
 in casinos however in for example inter 1 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.970
 you will earn very little but you can 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.820
 contract blocks fair one also the 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.680
 throat because he is not flying after you take off 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:56.680
 teammate is broken then 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:58.000
 do not you crash oh my mister nokia is for 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.479
 come on as you expect I can 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.490
 destroy it by nation type type 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:10.360
 stop i'm stuck oh what is it 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:15.090

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.090
 make me system or my god 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:22.550
 me and a kind son who arrived 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:26.029
 he was fine so gamer you just saw 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.419
 antonio androni stepped in 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:32.990
 my recording from serious gaming e 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.479
 he must always ruin everything with his 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.520
 not pages anyway gamer let me know 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.149
 if you want to see other videos at the stake 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.949
 I like kraft so I might as well 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:45.139
 play again if you like 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.529
 if you liked put it like it download 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.689
 the game because it is very beautiful and then in 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:53.240
 theory there is also my steam in profile 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:54.409
 some you will have to find it and I could 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.020
 add me so we can also 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.639
 play together in case then gamer 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.029
 I would say that for this video everything is there 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.029
 see you next time 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.200
 but it is only on the mountain we are boys 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.920
 conquering the world slowly 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.920
 let's do some laps
