00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.770
 Dear barbecue fans, welcome to 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.980
 another episode of my grill 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.110
 videos today I show you how to 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.200
 really fluffy hamburger rolls 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.390
 but the bands are suitable 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.360
 not only for hamburger but for 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.090
 example for pulled pork too 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.550
 Insert comes a 14 inch touch screen 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.079
 and the quantities refer to 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.510
 ten big rolls 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.820
 if you do not have a rest so 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.100
 the whole works in the grill too 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.539
 the pizza stone or on a baking sheet 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.960
 in the oven, we may first one 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:01:00.160
 look at the required ingredients flour 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.859
 Type 550 warm water milk yeast 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.600
 soft butter sugar salt milk powder 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:10.490
 and sesame in the first step we give 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.250
 150 milliliters of warm water in one 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.880
 medium sized shots and stir 30 grams 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.880
 sugar 1 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.140
 After that we move a cube yeast 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:30.520
 over it and stir until the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:32.470
 Liquefied yeast has left the whole thing 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.630
 We then covered for ten minutes 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.630
 pick up 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.380
 then we give 100 milliliters 15 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:46.750
 percent milk 20 grams of milk powder 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.180
 and ten grams of salt added to the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.330
 conclusion follows an egg and then whisk 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.520
 we all get along well together 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.100
 another bowl we hold ourselves 500 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.610
 gram flour and 60 grams of soft butter 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.470
 so the butter is ready in time 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.770
 out of the refrigerator and let it soften 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.980
 then we will leave the others 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.480
 add ingredients and knead well 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.480
 through to a pond arises 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.420
 we form a ball and let that go 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.910
 dough then for about an hour and 15 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.270
 covered in a warm place 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.340
 go 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.580
 The volume of the dough should be then 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.280
 We have now doubled the dough 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.780
 on a floured work surface 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.220
 through again and then form ten 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.220
 equal balls 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.470
 then we move or pull the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.379
 side inside 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.390
 We do this until we always have 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.870
 becomes more difficult and the ball at the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.580
 surface gets more and more tension 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.580
 this is the so-called grind 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.459
 After that we put in the divided balls 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:22.010
 which lined with a baking paper 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:23.300
 and push the balls some leaf now 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.730
 let's think about the touch 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.910
 Fresh foil from and leave the dough 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.730
 again go for an hour the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.730
 balls then increase in volume again 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.120
 Now it's time for the briquettes 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.090
 to be annealed 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.630
 we need a pak temperature of 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.560
 170 to 180 degrees 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:51.890
 this is equivalent to a 14 inch boy 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.530
 32 briquettes the dough is the same 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.650
 why we are still an idol and 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.910
 two tablespoons of milk need that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.910
 we mix well with each other 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.890
 the risen some balls press 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.750
 We're careful now something again 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.750
 platter and brush them 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.720
 Now we sprinkle something sesame 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.720
 above and then put on the lid 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.260
 the briquettes are likely to go through 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.750
 his 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.000
 we divide ten of these 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.930
 circular and represent the dacia 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.380
 Windhof lay the remaining 22 briquettes 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.960
 we up evenly on the lid at 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.040
 this low under and strong 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.330
 Upper heat is the temperature about 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:55.300
 170 to 180 degrees pack in this form 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.140
 the bands for about 25 to 30 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.970
 minutes until they are golden brown to the top 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.640
 but you can be sure after 20 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.660
 minutes to see if everything is still in the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:12.250
 Green area is in my case fraud 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.590
 the baking time exactly 28 minutes afterwards 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.040
 Let's take the pot from the heat and 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.080
 let the bands cool down 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.420
 now we have great very delicious and 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.680
 airy rolls for hamburger or 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:29.260
 pulled pork try it out in 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.200
 In the future you will always find your bands 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.930
 self made 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.160
 good appetite see you soon your grill scout 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.160
 vivico pm
