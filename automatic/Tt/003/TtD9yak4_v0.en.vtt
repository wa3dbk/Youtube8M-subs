00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.460 

but<00:00:35.240> for<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.480> most<00:00:35.600> part<00:00:35.750> I've<00:00:36.080> gotten<00:00:36.350> over

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
that sickness but as long as I have a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.780 
that sickness but as long as I have a
drink<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.290> should<00:00:39.470> be<00:00:39.590> okay<00:00:39.920> at<00:00:40.340> least<00:00:40.520> I<00:00:40.640> hope

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
so I've tried to record this specific

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.920 
so I've tried to record this specific
part<00:00:46.130> countless<00:00:46.580> times<00:00:46.790> because<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.270> my<00:00:47.600> voice

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
part countless times because of my voice

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.869 
part countless times because of my voice
failing<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:48.860> I<00:00:49.250> really<00:00:49.520> wanted<00:00:49.699> to<00:00:49.760> get

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
failing and I really wanted to get

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:50.799 
failing and I really wanted to get
something<00:00:50.120> out<00:00:50.360> there

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
something out there

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.479 
something out there

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
that is awful

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.470 
that is awful
but<00:02:38.480> we<00:02:38.600> were<00:02:38.720> gonna<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:40.010> will<00:02:40.160> fight<00:02:40.550> to

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
but we were gonna do it we will fight to

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.280 
but we were gonna do it we will fight to
stay<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:41.930> bomber<00:02:42.140> inland<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.640> kind<00:02:43.880> of

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
stay in bomber inland and to kind of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.200 
stay in bomber inland and to kind of
save<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.320> director<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.890> guess<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.610> kind<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.060> feel

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
save the director I guess I kind of feel

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.610 
save the director I guess I kind of feel
bad<00:02:47.330> for<00:02:47.390> him<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:47.870> I'll<00:02:47.990> do<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.200> for<00:02:48.320> him<00:02:48.410> to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
bad for him so I'll do it for him to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.720 
bad for him so I'll do it for him to
throw<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.790> there

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.699 

so<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.629> what<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.900> bodyguards<00:02:55.379> have<00:02:55.530> been

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
so this is what the bodyguards have been

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.009 
so this is what the bodyguards have been
planning<00:02:56.010> if<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.940> do<00:02:57.209> not<00:02:57.330> recall<00:02:57.660> from<00:02:57.959> the

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
planning if you do not recall from the

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.140 
planning if you do not recall from the
last<00:02:58.200> episode<00:02:58.670> they<00:02:59.670> were<00:02:59.730> supposedly

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
last episode they were supposedly

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.850 
last episode they were supposedly
planning<00:03:00.690> something<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> bomber<00:03:01.440> center

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
planning something in the bomber center

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.070 
planning something in the bomber center
so<00:03:02.550> this<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.030> what<00:03:03.180> they've<00:03:03.330> been<00:03:03.480> planning

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
so this is what they've been planning

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.960 
so this is what they've been planning
I<00:03:04.110> guess<00:03:04.709> they<00:03:04.830> probably<00:03:05.040> were<00:03:05.250> practicing<00:03:05.819> up

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
I guess they probably were practicing up

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.500 
I guess they probably were practicing up
for<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:08.489> they're<00:03:09.000> gonna<00:03:09.060> say<00:03:09.300> some

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
for this and they're gonna say some

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.720 
for this and they're gonna say some
words<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.860> they're<00:03:10.980> all<00:03:11.099> gonna<00:03:11.220> laugh<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
words and they're all gonna laugh the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.850 
words and they're all gonna laugh the
same<00:03:11.910> which<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.150> kind<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.540> creepy<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:14.840> that's

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
same which is kind of creepy but that's

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.559 
same which is kind of creepy but that's
the<00:03:16.860> bodyguards<00:03:17.310> for<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.670> guess<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.150> don't

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
the bodyguards for you I guess I don't

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.830 
the bodyguards for you I guess I don't
really<00:03:18.780> know

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
really know

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.750 
really know
so<00:03:21.840> today's<00:03:22.110> Monday<00:03:22.380> black<00:03:23.310> she'll<00:03:23.580> probably

I should have given up see what happens

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.930 
do that see what happens
probably<00:06:20.290> nothing<00:06:20.530> special<00:06:22.560> but<00:06:23.560> um<00:06:23.770> I<00:06:24.310> know

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
probably nothing special but um I know

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.670 
probably nothing special but um I know
this<00:06:25.210> is<00:06:25.270> a<00:06:25.420> pretty<00:06:25.690> short<00:06:25.780> video<00:06:26.110> but<00:06:26.590> I'm

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
this is a pretty short video but I'm

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.950 
this is a pretty short video but I'm
actually<00:06:26.830> going<00:06:27.040> to<00:06:27.100> end<00:06:27.370> it<00:06:27.460> here<00:06:27.580> guys<00:06:27.790> and<00:06:28.150> I

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
actually going to end it here guys and I

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.800 
actually going to end it here guys and I
actually<00:06:29.080> have<00:06:29.380> something<00:06:29.620> saved<00:06:30.010> already<00:06:30.370> I

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
actually have something saved already I

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.030 
actually have something saved already I
don't<00:06:31.810> really<00:06:32.080> want<00:06:32.290> to<00:06:32.350> record<00:06:32.620> for<00:06:32.800> that

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
don't really want to record for that

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.560 
don't really want to record for that
long<00:06:33.310> because<00:06:33.520> my<00:06:33.610> voice<00:06:33.910> is<00:06:34.150> starting<00:06:34.300> to<00:06:34.510> get

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
long because my voice is starting to get

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
long because my voice is starting to get
a<00:06:34.630> little<00:06:34.930> bit<00:06:37.380> scratchy

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
a little bit scratchy

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.130 
a little bit scratchy
so<00:06:39.340> I'm<00:06:39.610> probably<00:06:39.730> gonna<00:06:39.970> end<00:06:40.030> it<00:06:40.180> here<00:06:40.210> cause

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
so I'm probably gonna end it here cause

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.260 
so I'm probably gonna end it here cause
it'd<00:06:41.320> probably<00:06:41.440> get<00:06:41.740> worse<00:06:41.890> as<00:06:42.250> I<00:06:42.670> prolong<00:06:43.090> it

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
it'd probably get worse as I prolong it

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.570 
it'd probably get worse as I prolong it
