00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
cover at the same time that we were

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.070 
cover at the same time that we were
actually<00:01:45.950> designing<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.850> iPad<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.780> two<00:01:47.960> are

could have done before and it's because

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.820 
could have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.970> lot<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.240> new<00:04:28.599> innovation<00:04:29.260> driving

it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:33.820> that's<00:04:34.210> added<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.630> lot<00:04:34.840> more<00:04:34.900> speed<00:04:35.380> to

web sending email and multitasking in
fact<00:04:40.960> it's<00:04:41.349> up<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.710> twice<00:04:41.919> as<00:04:42.160> fast<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:43.330> the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.390 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the
place<00:04:43.690> was<00:04:43.720> made<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.199> biggest<00:04:44.470> chunk<00:04:44.919> is<00:04:45.130> with

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
place was made the biggest chunk is with

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.550 
place was made the biggest chunk is with

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
nine times faster you'll really notice

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.060 
nine times faster you'll really notice
this<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.979> games<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.610> apps<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.210> use<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> lot

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
this in games and apps that use a lot

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.060 
this in games and apps that use a lot
and<00:04:53.280> for<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.330> first<00:04:54.510> time<00:04:54.810> we<00:04:55.260> built<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.620> gyro

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
and for the first time we built the gyro

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.580 
and for the first time we built the gyro
into<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.490> iPad<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.870> gives<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.260> very

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
into this iPad that gives you very

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.620 
into this iPad that gives you very
precise<00:04:59.040> control<00:04:59.610> in<00:04:59.850> multiple<00:05:00.480> dimensions

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
precise control in multiple dimensions

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.560 
precise control in multiple dimensions
and<00:05:01.260> it<00:05:01.560> allows<00:05:01.830> us<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.490> really<00:05:02.520> measure<00:05:03.210> the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
and it allows us to really measure the

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.740 
and it allows us to really measure the
orientation<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.500> iPad<00:05:05.010> in<00:05:05.160> space<00:05:05.750> these

new<00:05:07.020> components<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:07.770> features<00:05:07.950> add<00:05:08.430> all

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
new components and features add all

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.090 
new components and features add all
kinds<00:05:08.910> of<00:05:09.420> possibilities<00:05:09.620> when<00:05:10.620> it<00:05:10.710> comes<00:05:10.920> to

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
kinds of possibilities when it comes to

kinds of possibilities when it comes to
apps<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.610> even<00:05:12.480> though<00:05:12.600> we<00:05:12.750> boosted<00:05:13.170> the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
apps and even though we boosted the

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.350 
apps and even though we boosted the
performance<00:05:13.860> we<00:05:14.130> haven't<00:05:14.580> compromised<00:05:15.120> on

the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.170 
the original iPad defined a category and

I think that I peg tube will really

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.860 
I think that I peg tube will really
define<00:05:42.600> that<00:05:42.780> category<00:05:43.350> for<00:05:43.650> years<00:05:43.890> to<00:05:43.950> come
