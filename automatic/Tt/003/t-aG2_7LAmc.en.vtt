00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.050
 now you think only four times 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.980
 I shot or already all five and not think 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.360
 even i will ram you and I will finish chatillon 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.670
 25t 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.640
 dangerous while alive and hello again 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.900
 today together with mail.ru I represent 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.809
 you video about one more very rare 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.100
 French tank battles 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.220
 st legion 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.239
 Chatillon 25t despite all its 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.610
 unique features in normal battles it almost 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.450
 you will not meet he did not catch the target 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.479
 audience and in vain by the way if all of a sudden someone 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.040
 knows 25t in his name 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.860
 This tank weighing 25 tons is such a build 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.310
 nyashechka I would compare it with the class 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.310
 rogue in lpg and count thanks to his 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.979
 very high mobility and modest 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.229
 dimensions he can slip out 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.290
 it would seem well, absolutely hopeless 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.260
 situations like now for example a little 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.080
 later come back and stick your 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.990
 long sharp poisoned dagger right 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.900
 in the back of the enemy and on this we end with 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.200
 pathos and move on to the harsh realities 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.050
 I personally became interested in this French 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.630
 tanks after looked like on 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.880
 steel hunter plays it too 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 go inquire on his channel 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.170
 there are not only many flyers 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.720
 ground war tanks 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.510
 but other games are also available on that 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.819
 look and learn honestly 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.370
 I did not regret to say that 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.180
 decided to try out this legion hey with t and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.239
 gotten just a crazy experience for 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.129
 last few months it's 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.530
 the only tank that hooked tight 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.690
 its unique style and made 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.420
 play it voraciously for several days 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.879
 in a row and even at night I rolled it out 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.129
 again and again trying to understand what 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.980
 his french secret what choice 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.560
 equipment for it is optimal and what 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.260
 skills it is better to choose a crew with none 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.790
 other tanks I've been fumbled but not 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.849
 already with 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.340
 first minutes it became clear why 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.650
 the audience did not appreciate the chatillon 25t 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.349
 the answer is obvious play battles 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.900
 maximum level on the tank where 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.900
 maximum armor 60 millimeters 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.840
 whose margin is like a car 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.329
 eighth level 2800 units 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.959
 so even with such a specific tool 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.810
 not everyone will like this gameplay 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.870
 This is where the so-Challenge and Challenge 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.840
 at the same time and check for tank skill 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.480
 knowledge in cards but on luck of course 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.819
 a little pity that our armored 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.510
 the audience is not so she thinks 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.829
 practical pragmatic and stern in war 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.680
 as in war 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.769
 ala ger com a la ger who is better 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.159
 prepared for battle that and well done so 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.010
 her choice is thicker armor and caliber 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.370
 guns bigger but still for 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.689
 variety of cars level 10 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.879
 developers can say a huge 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.729
 thank you well so what's our easy 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.720
 middle french chatillon 25t 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:52.819
 what else can he hit in the heart 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.609
 sophisticated tank audiences can be 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.400
 amusing appearance there's not that it 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.220
 the essence of course his chip is automatic 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.239
 drum loading for 5 rounds 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.569
 with a loss of 650 units each 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.690
 it is both the gift and the curse of the tank 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.479
 I did not accidentally say at first that I played 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.970
 while only 25 tons 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:19.070
 because the only way to get used and 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.109
 adjust to this recharge in 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.289
 thirty seven and a half seconds later 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.470
 in 15 seconds from one drum we can 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:30.110
 cause the enemy three thousand 250 units 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.770
 damage right in the face should be enough 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.349
 to destroy tank 8 or even 9 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.310
 level but with the tenth level already 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.009
 more difficult 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.909
 they usually have strength for more than 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.669
 3000 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:46.250
 in one helmet on such an opponent whole 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.560
 a bunch of cafes is better not to pop up like 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.880
 on anybody else but why this 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.430
 do not worth it I already said in 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.770
 besides things are not very good 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.350
 guns chatillion and with stabilization and 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.050
 data rate so realize 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.750
 our drum is better with a full stop a 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.800
 someone twist-twirl and shoot 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.620
 Barta 25 t well, nothing happens but I 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.260
 already talked about the special challenge tello on 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.110
 just this tank is not for everyone 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.260
 if still a little hit in comparison 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.750
 then the chatillon 25t can be compared with the poor 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.500
 the father of the family who is rich only 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.320
 daughters 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.870
 and in our case, its loss stam 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.600
 drum 5 shells but nothing to him 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.480
 boast no he has no strength 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.990
 thick armor it all right during 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.480
 the battle has to borrow from the allies 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.700
 somewhere discharged the enemy must quickly 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.220
 jump out and while he's on codes pair 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.830
 send him straight to 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.710
 weak spots or near you zack 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.630
 sat down two strands and crunch bro nothing 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.780
 around do not notice urgently urgently 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.750
 have time to contribute to the overall victory 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.120
 by sending a couple of shells right in 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.850
 fuel tanks to the enemy of course you can 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.100
 sometimes go in exchange but only in 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.970
 very profitable when one shot 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:12.000
 the enemy we will give him as many as five 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.550
 If we are lucky, the bull of ours Chatillion 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.520
 survive and not explode from the very first 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.510
 headshots very important protection 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.550
 ammunition cases 25t is just a mast 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.160
 hev after such a duel 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.040
 drum mascara and it's time to leave 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.010
 again behind the backs of the faithful allies seconds 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.740
 at 40 50 if you continue all this time 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.440
 be in the firing line then no 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.200
 strength is not enough but to leave very 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.380
 far from the scene of the battle should not be too small 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.140
 if anyone we find there by the way snipers 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.350
 sew Elena's useless half drum 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.690
 go away or past or at every ricochet not 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.490
 punch well what ammunition y 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.830
 he has 50 shells 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.960
 it usually suffices here as I 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.070
 told above and will have to act 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.280
 each 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:05.610
 yes it's not easy to borrow from the team 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.130
 and their pc and armor and give away your damage 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.800
 but differently on this tank play well 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.900
 It does not work if you are such 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.680
 things don't scare but try something 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.170
 new in the game I want that Shatilon 25t 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.320
 as specially created for this purpose 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:25.230
 more now legions and tanks can be taken 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.950
 for rent if they say what to walk 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.190
 so walk 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.990
 you can take it and load it full 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.660
 bbs ammunition 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.840
 but perhaps this is only for 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:39.480
 the most delicate connoisseurs of beautiful video 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:42.810
 prepared a top for you with support 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:45.480
 mail.ru which unique machines are not 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:48.000
 you will find in hangars ground war tanks 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.760
 Thank you for your attention and see you soon 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.570
 in the game by the way do not forget to vote 

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.570
 in social networks and on the forum for the best tt10
