00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
of just like I have no idea

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.620 
of just like I have no idea
it<00:00:09.809> must<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.320> something<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.650> these<00:00:10.769> straps

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
it must be something with these straps

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.470 
it must be something with these straps
gravity<00:00:12.630> it's<00:00:13.440> probably<00:00:13.740> padding<00:00:14.040> this

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
gravity it's probably padding this

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.980 
gravity it's probably padding this
doesn't<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:15.540> guess<00:00:16.940> yeah<00:00:17.940> like<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.359> works<00:00:18.600> well

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990
