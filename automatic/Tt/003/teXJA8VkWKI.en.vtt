ranch and those times where we work on
projects<00:03:24.300> all<00:03:24.420> day<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:25.680> feel<00:03:25.920> like<00:03:25.980> you

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550

really<00:03:26.790> accomplished<00:03:27.330> something<00:03:27.360> it's<00:03:28.200> a

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
really accomplished something it's a

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.070 
really accomplished something it's a
sense<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:29.120> completion<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.540> can't<00:03:30.780> feel

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
sense of completion that you can't feel

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.390 
sense of completion that you can't feel
many<00:03:31.320> other<00:03:31.530> places<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.989> point<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.530> think<00:03:35.220> it's

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
many other places the point I think it's

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.660 
many other places the point I think it's
not<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.820> be<00:03:35.940> obsessed<00:03:36.360> about<00:03:36.600> money<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.140> don't

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
not to be obsessed about money I don't

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.920 
not to be obsessed about money I don't
I<00:03:37.730> don't<00:03:37.940> really<00:03:38.060> think<00:03:38.270> about<00:03:38.390> money<00:03:38.720> that

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
I don't really think about money that

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.990 
I don't really think about money that
much<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.500> think<00:03:39.980> about<00:03:40.160> being<00:03:40.670> productive

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
much I think about being productive

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.150 
much I think about being productive
being<00:03:41.599> fruitful<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.440> know<00:03:42.560> being<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:42.980> man
