00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.400
 yes it seems we began to forget how to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.530
 really looks like transformers to everyone 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.599
 hello with you ive today i would like to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 remember the childhood of the most beautiful 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.400
 time when we had no problems by type 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.279
 where is my life going I'm nothing 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.410
 got old age already knocking on the door 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.449
 so recently I looked transformers 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.670
 michael bay perhaps i won't say 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.040
 bad about this movie, perhaps I'll go 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.640
 only one optimus prime how are you 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.110
 I was singing I remember you completely different 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.640
 today i want to tell you about 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.399
 the time when the cult was born 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.550
 Transformers for me and for many 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.829
 Russians it all started the 90s that time 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.079
 on tv channel 6 which you probably donâ€™t 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.600
 remember the animated series was already broadcast 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.390
 transformer war great power by the way 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.030
 saying the show was released in 1988 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.100
 and we broadcast in 90 Russia then 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.840
 was sloupoki how much enjoyable 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 memories connected with me 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.769
 animated series and yes this animated series 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.840
 filmed the Japanese is anime 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.060
 in those days I certainly did not know about such 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070
 overseas concept like anime for me is 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.020
 just was a great cartoon series not 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.610
 what's more i say for anime 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.799
 haters who are in the comments 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.750
 will write animagus but we 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.820
 distracted let's go back remote tv series 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 the main feature of the cartoons was 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.110
 that optimus and other transformers in this 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.240
 the series were live people they are somehow 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.340
 soulless glands that undoubtedly 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.380
 played on hand cartoon as 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.600
 helped empathize with the main characters 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.729
 also associate yourself with them briefly 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.350
 I will tell you the essence of the series many years ago 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.780
 back some mega cool pepper 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.820
 came up with a new type of robots trans pectore 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.950
 I hope I said it right 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.290
 who needed a pilot person with 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.759
 special bracelets on hand bracelets 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.610
 are the link between 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.649
 completely different forms of life pilot and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.840
 his mechanical body was called a warrior 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.820
 great power well and then not so much 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.610
 it is important to skip this part and then suddenly 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.990
 prosyulelyu 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.520
 shorter to become one with the robot 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.270
 putting on bracelets and solemnly 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.270
 pronounce 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.760
 I will say this series best of 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.650
 all that I saw about transformers 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.300
 by the way he is old enough in him 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.340
 The subject of betrayal 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.870
 moral choice of self-sacrifice and 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.450
 the like of all the numerous 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.880
 TV series about the transformer turned out 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.160
 the most cruel innocent people die 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.740
 here and there destroyed destroyed whole 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.930
 cities at the end of the series so generally the world 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.090
 turns into post-apocalypse yes and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.340
 blood series about flash often in 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.570
 general here everything is seriously talking about 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.060
 this series I can not remember 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.280
 voice acting she was really good 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.890
 done with a soul so to say that only 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.940
 there is a translation of names like your name 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.940
 sprig well or mane click claw 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.150
 despite the abundance of positive 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.580
 I liked the characters most of all 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.770
 flayer there is not the same laser this one 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.660
 flayer this guy is really cool 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.550
 well look at him well he's just 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.260
 awesome very sorry that he quickly 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.720
 becomes a whipping boy in my opinion 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.580
 he is a very cool character series tied 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.380
 I truly remember to this day 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.330
 a few moments that caused 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.120
 special emotions although so much has passed 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.250
 years I still remember especially now 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.560
 I remember the Optimus Prime fight with 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.790
 giga lord 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.830
 sorry, just difficult now 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.420
 utter such names without laughter remember 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.550
 how much I worried about optimus 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.350
 Prime's looking forward to the next 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.190
 series with the hope that everything will be with him 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.260
 alright and think and plugin honestly not 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:54.610
 cried that I can not 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.610
 take and smear 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.400
 i can't die now no 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.819
 in memory for a long time I ran scene 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.170
 Optimus Prime Fights with Skarpanoh 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.910
 notice not laughed battle 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.740
 going on the moon and very remembered 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.690
 the moment he stands looking at the ground 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.340
 utters his speech where the show is 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.049
 was full of events 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.769
 battles that did not give the viewer 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.840
 get bored 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.360
 Now I want to say a few words about music 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.030
 she is awesome she sets the mood 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.919
 each melody in its place me to 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.960
 so far a couple of tracks have a sing 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.270
 leaves the show is really very good 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.870
 and by the way is not tightened that can not 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.480
 not happy 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.910
 there are only 42 series in total 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.460
 in modern and not my type of appearance 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.470
 peace but in the 90s it was certainly not 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.150
 one series about the transformer I can't but 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.040
 note another one was called 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.510
 transformers generation and if i don't 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.310
 wrong of course he came out in 1984 but 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.500
 here unlike the previous series all 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.419
 more familiar transformer is robots 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.490
 leading endless battles with each 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.090
 friend just like minecraft fans and 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.090
 digger 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.080
 this show was pretty good too 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.120
 Optimus Prime has its own here 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.250
 classic recognizable type of truck with 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.860
 trailer on his main sworn enemy 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.900
 megatron transformed into a gun here 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.590
 never understood how he changes size 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.590
 of your body 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.349
 street magic probably even later 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.970
 appearance will change during the plot and he 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.840
 will turn into no less steep 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.000
 galvatron a 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.400
 but since we started talking about him 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.500
 remember the series as Galvatron decided 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.630
 cure madness was taken to the fool on 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.729
 another planet where the ball is ruled 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.069
 the humanoid monkey series is just 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.660
 masterpiece very delivers watch for 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.660
 fungus throne who bombed a bunch 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.030
 and again I can't help noting our 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.610
 Russian dubbing he is just amazing 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.350
 up to those days even voiced with a soul 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.660
 in general, the series was also out of tune 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.520
 filled with a variety of events with a bunch 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.410
 we definitely did not have after these 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.570
 the show began a real explosion 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.669
 transformers were all over the market and 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.010
 store shelves filled to the top with 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.660
 tons of products based on transformers 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.510
 what was just not there 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.210
 chewing gum clothes coloring stickers and 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.700
 most importantly toys god how much do u 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.440
 I had them thanks to the Chinese thanks 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.389
 they had our parents the opportunity 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.620
 buy us these inexpensive but such 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.600
 cool toys 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.760
 by the way in those days there were such cartoons 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.710
 like a voltron or green diver but they 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.630
 somehow did not find my heart's place 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.430
 difference from transformers already passed 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.139
 quite a few years but these cartoons are still 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.600
 watchable don't look obsolete 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.190
 summing up I would say if I 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.870
 had to choose between michael movies 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.120
 Bay and old TV shows about 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.169
 Transformers I do not think would choose 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.240
 old series 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.160
 and then you probably say ive how are you 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.550
 you can compare the movie with the animated series 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.410
 and yes you are probably right they can not 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.810
 compare on just a little bit of me 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.550
 bombed because we look 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.289
 my gosh as he them and sur la dollars that 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.450
 it is what is it really optimus 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:08.789
 prime u but it's just a kapets 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.860
 Well, that's coming to the end of my story 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:13.520
 hopefully older generations plenty 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.810
 ponastalize somehow dumb and word 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.640
 sad but young generation 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.010
 I learned what cartoons we watched and 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.919
 oldies and all this time was telling you 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.970
