00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.360
 trick so we go to the zombies 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.840
 to go 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.210
 hitting because there's still a song 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.610
 next to take it for ass I'm going to my 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.010
 city this is something else 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.580

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.580
 property now yes with everything has seen 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.580
 we start 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.550
 theoretical classes lesson 1 let's meet the 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.520
 Retreat hydrogen is already the typical 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.970
 ready saying the keys to the meat 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.790
 borrowed 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.470
 there are no classes much more men than not 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.410
 I will mention here 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.570
 but the chicken are magicians but card with 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.340
 overtake more badly 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.570
 many things have changed with respect to 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.190
 the previous expansion and they have not put 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.170
 fine for what are we going to cheat now 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.700
 I like it more, it 's very good, but we 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.410
 have come in first place they have 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.270
 Dedicated to taking things from us inquisition 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.550
 removed guardian of the ancient kings 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.380
 removed now of devotion removed 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.490
 blinding light is now slow that we do not 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.260
 let's fuck or fuck 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.610
 so removed however we 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.380
 we find the powder that we're going 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.570
 gaining the release enters ort more 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.460
 of sacrifice every minute and a half 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.080
 abstinence every 30 seconds not bad 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.150
 35 percent chopper 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.360
 fucking divine storm free of time 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.130
 in when life lesson two 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.600
 Ticos statistics I do not get in pvp 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.280
 we have detached ourselves from the temper and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.320
 jgj power we have new statistics 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.880
 very cool like versatility and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.369
 multi hit the shovel challenge this expansion 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.960
 you should look for mastery versatility and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.520
 fairly simple haste with the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.810
 arrival of the new statistics the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.580
 shovel retreat has now changed a 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.990
 but it's very easy to know what 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.520
 team must choose first 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.050
 we must raise the reputation with the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.759
 vanguard of bryn the of great ace 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.229
 flagged at least having this 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.670
 reputation we can buy in the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.050
 intendants the pieces that grant us 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.030
 versatility these pieces have 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.770
 absolute priority considering 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.880
 of course we should take the bonus 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.560
 of four pieces for 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.420
 always choose those of celerity and 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.770
 expertise and given that in this expansion there 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.390
 there is refor that we do not have to 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.190
 worry about nothing but the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 spells I'll make it easy for you 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.760
 enchantment for here and there and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.470
 rings is called equal offering of 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.330
 versatility for the brand weapon of 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.890
 Bleeding force is quite expensive but 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.300
 to the toilet to throw a ticket to me 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.099
 you will ask why so much versatility 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.660
 well you could say it's the new 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.310
 temple makes you hit more and you 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.880
 stick less for a class like the retr 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.590
 and it is crucial in pvp lesson 3 talents and 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.940
 phones the truth is that it has not 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.380
 changed too much with respect to the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.030
 previous expansion there may be some 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.470
 that another variation according to what 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.819
 you face but most of the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.769
 cases the talents are the following 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.299
 long arm of the law union of justice 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.680
 selfless healing clemency 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.540
 holy avenger sacred christmas and 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.370
 final verdict and the Benedictine glyphs 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.200
 the templar charged with guilt and manu 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.910
 freedom and already has no more now 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.380
 well according to the situation and your way of 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.489
 game there are talents and taps that should 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.230
 change from what we have 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.790
 predefined for example if we 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.470
 we face casters the talent of 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.180
 Unbreakable spirit will not be much 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.099
 more useful since we will be more protected 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.290
 If we do not like to go to the bus, which would be 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.819
 of assholes and cocks but you can 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.340
 happen we could take away the avenger 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.290
 sacred and put the divine purpose 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.610
 the storm comes free and that this 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.349
 talent makes that we can throw the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.970
 free verdict you also become 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.260
 in a submachine gun with sword as to 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.910
 the latest talents of the stamps 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.349
 empowered there's not much to say you're going 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.239
 changing seal to go west on 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.860
 bufo you need and is already yet 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.750
 if we use the seraphim and the sentence 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.340
 of execution combined with the wings the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.170
 avenger bleeding and ratchet damage 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.610
 you can put it means as for the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.110
 glyphs there are a couple of them that you can 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.730
 put you if they help you in your style of 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.500
 game the divine storm helps you 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.599
 heal do not give you 4% of your life each time 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.250
 that you throw it very interesting the glyph 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.290
 of glory word increases your bathroom a 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.910
 3% for each load of shape wear also 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.829
 it's pretty good lesson 4 rotation in 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.299
 serious you have a retires to 100 and I have 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.130
 to explain in what order you have to 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.060
 throw your four attack points 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.980
 uyuyuy where that is very simple what 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.170
 you have available you throw it and so on 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.829
 the other die before you order 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.239
 lesson 5 macros the macros will be in 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.829
 the description of this video so that 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.329
 I will say them in absurd speed are the 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.920
 following for the focus the way 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.569
 to focus is to take focus short the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.980
 focus with the macros of the hands we're going 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.660
 to do a trick, people just make a 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.460
 case and then together with laying on of hands 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.140
 that can not be used in sand for itself 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.730
 throw them twice inadvertently if you take 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.380
 the talent that I mention though in 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.000
 Sometimes you can mess up wasting the 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.590
 so instead we invented a 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.030
 success that gives us a few seconds in the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.010

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.830
 group with the protection is not necessary 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.690
 the caster queens since having 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.610

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.110

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.980
 other defensives from other classes like the 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.450
 Wizard's cube and the tension of the joint 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.890

 because once finished they will finish t 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.390
 to avoid this we will put the 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.040
 following rules that would justify the 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.500
 use of the first pomp imminent death 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.300

 in cutting the disc in mass is 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.849
 too fast or you study it or
