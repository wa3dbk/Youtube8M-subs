his prostate cancer um you know casted

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.910 
his prostate cancer um you know casted
over<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> prostate<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> Gleason

no I know but I always I did yet well a

they're bigger I know you're thinking

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
they're bigger I know you're thinking
