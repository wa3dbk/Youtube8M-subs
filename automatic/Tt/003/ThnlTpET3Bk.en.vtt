life so I played with glue I designed
with<00:00:24.839> glue<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.439> test<00:00:25.769> glue<00:00:26.099> today's

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
with glue and I test glue today's

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.419 
with glue and I test glue today's
project<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:27.839> using<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.710> glue<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.189> was

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
project I'm using a glue that I was

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.579 
project I'm using a glue that I was
testing<00:00:29.970> kind<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.689> playing<00:00:30.900> at<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.169> same<00:00:31.380> time

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
testing kind of playing at the same time

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.220 
testing kind of playing at the same time
and<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.949> came<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.490> great<00:00:32.850> project<00:00:33.239> today

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and it came out this great project today

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.819 
and it came out this great project today
I'm<00:00:34.530> using<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.070> lanes<00:00:35.489> platinum<00:00:36.180> bond<00:00:36.829> 7800

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
I'm using the lanes platinum bond 7800

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.189 
I'm using the lanes platinum bond 7800
glue<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.730> an<00:00:38.879> all-purpose<00:00:39.420> glue<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.170> can

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
glue it's an all-purpose glue you can

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.369 
glue it's an all-purpose glue you can
use<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.829> wood<00:00:41.160> metal<00:00:41.789> glass<00:00:42.510> ceramics

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
use it on wood metal glass ceramics

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.610 
use it on wood metal glass ceramics
leather<00:00:44.059> fiberglass<00:00:45.059> rubber<00:00:45.420> hard<00:00:46.109> plastic

and<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.219> much<00:00:47.399> more<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.420> if

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
and so much more so you can see that if

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.970 
and so much more so you can see that if
industrial<00:00:50.160> glue<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:52.350> glue<00:00:52.559> when<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.829> comes

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
industrial glue the glue when it comes

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
industrial glue the glue when it comes
out<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.280> package<00:00:53.640> has<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.940> nozzle<00:00:54.359> I<00:00:54.750> just

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
out of the package has a nozzle I just

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
out of the package has a nozzle I just
put<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.649> aside<00:00:56.149> take<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.390> lid<00:00:57.600> off<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:59.390> see

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
put that aside take the lid off and see

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119 
put that aside take the lid off and see
this<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.750> pointer<00:01:01.379> thing<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:02.039> going

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
this little pointer thing you're going

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.040 
this little pointer thing you're going
to<00:01:02.190> push<00:01:02.519> it<00:01:02.730> upside<00:01:03.179> down<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.390> into<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
to push it upside down right into the

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.910 
to push it upside down right into the
glue<00:01:04.350> nozzle<00:01:06.320> just<00:01:07.320> kind<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.590> work<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> around

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
glue nozzle just kind of work it around

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.010 
glue nozzle just kind of work it around
a<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.220> bit<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.729> opens<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:12.020> I'm

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
a little bit so that opens it up I'm

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.940 
a little bit so that opens it up I'm
using<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.590> nonstick<00:01:14.270> foil<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.770> going

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
using a nonstick foil and I'm just going

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.679 
using a nonstick foil and I'm just going
to<00:01:16.979> squeeze<00:01:17.250> my<00:01:17.549> glue<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.329> see<00:01:18.540> I've

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
to squeeze my glue out you can see I've

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.359 
to squeeze my glue out you can see I've
kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.560> indented<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.310> heart<00:01:20.880> shape<00:01:22.369> just

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
kind of indented a heart shape just

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.530 
kind of indented a heart shape just
squeeze<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.939> out

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.660 

like<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:31.900> now<00:01:32.770> it's<00:01:32.980> going<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.280> just<00:01:33.520> take

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
like so now it's going to just take

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.300 
like so now it's going to just take
probably<00:01:34.570> about<00:01:34.840> an<00:01:35.290> hour<00:01:35.320> or<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:35.650> for<00:01:36.160> it<00:01:36.280> to

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
probably about an hour or so for it to

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.460 
probably about an hour or so for it to
settle<00:01:36.730> down<00:01:36.820> it<00:01:37.270> takes<00:01:37.540> all<00:01:37.750> night<00:01:37.780> for<00:01:38.230> it<00:01:38.320> to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
settle down it takes all night for it to

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.760 
settle down it takes all night for it to
dry<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.820> while<00:01:40.000> it's<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:40.480> wet<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:41.440> you<00:01:41.560> want<00:01:41.710> to

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
dry but while it's so wet if you want to

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.410 
dry but while it's so wet if you want to
take<00:01:41.950> maybe<00:01:42.220> some<00:01:42.490> little<00:01:42.700> beads<00:01:42.910> or<00:01:43.150> some

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
take maybe some little beads or some

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.720 
take maybe some little beads or some
little<00:01:43.660> plastic<00:01:44.020> marbles<00:01:44.470> or<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.550> little

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
where it just kind of flattens up and it

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.660 
where it just kind of flattens up and it
comes<00:02:04.000> up<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:05.050> can<00:02:05.259> push<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.530> down<00:02:05.830> you<00:02:06.430> kind

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
comes up you can push it down you kind

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.400 
comes up you can push it down you kind
of<00:02:06.790> kind<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.119> work<00:02:07.240> with<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.570> this<00:02:08.050> one<00:02:08.259> looks

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
of kind of work with it this one looks

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.840 
of kind of work with it this one looks
like<00:02:08.560> it's<00:02:08.800> going<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.040> stay<00:02:09.280> in<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.640> heart

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
like it's going to stay in the heart

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.590 
like it's going to stay in the heart
shape<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.170> dries<00:02:11.470> all<00:02:11.740> night<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:13.330> how<00:02:13.480> it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
shape when it dries all night see how it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.449 
shape when it dries all night see how it
flattens<00:02:13.930> out<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.620> really<00:02:14.890> cool<00:02:15.070> thing<00:02:15.340> about

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
flattens out the really cool thing about

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.670 
flattens out the really cool thing about
this<00:02:15.730> glue<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.840> has<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.020> really<00:02:17.470> nice

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
this glue is it has a really nice

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.560 
this glue is it has a really nice
texture<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.459> has<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> very<00:02:18.970> stiff<00:02:19.420> textured<00:02:21.570> so

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
texture it has a very stiff textured so

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.750 
texture it has a very stiff textured so
it<00:02:22.720> holds<00:02:22.930> its<00:02:23.110> shape<00:02:23.250> now<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:24.640> trim<00:02:25.030> it

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
it holds its shape now you can trim it

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
it holds its shape now you can trim it
this<00:02:27.760> one<00:02:27.940> needs<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.180> little<00:02:28.300> bit<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.510> trimming

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
this one needs a little bit of trimming
