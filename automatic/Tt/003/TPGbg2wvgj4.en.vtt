00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello my name is arthur and today 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.620
 I will introduce you to a series of petrol 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.530
 ergo max inverter generators 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.690
 rated power from 800 to 2400 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.309
 watt on the example of this here most 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.340
 popular generators 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.640
 ergomax er 2000th rated power 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.260
 1600 watt gasoline generator before 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.170
 just intended to develop 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.099
 AC in the absence of 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.320
 electrical connections 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.269
 This generator belongs to the newest 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 type of generators so-called 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.800
 inverter word inverter means 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.820
 that there is a special generator 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 the electronic unit 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.379
 it serves to convert current 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.300
 coming from the coils of the current generators 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.520
 standard purity 50 hertz 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.010
 with this current coming windings 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.360
 generator can be any frequency in 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.730
 this is fundamental 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.789
 technical difference inverter 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.289
 generators from traditional 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.449
 the use of inverters allows you to achieve 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.480
 certain advantages compared to 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.670
 conventional generators the most important thing is that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 inverter generators are very economical 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.640
 and because it automatically adjusts 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.979
 engine speed 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.490
 whichever is the load to them 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.290
 connected the more load those 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.720
 the motor shaft starts to rotate faster 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.659
 at the same time it consumes just as much 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.150
 fuel as you need from traditional 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.030
 generators fuel consumption is weakly dependent 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.220
 from the connected load important difference 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.229
 inverter generators about traditional 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.329
 is that they are always at any 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.509
 operating modes give out practically 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.070
 perfect sine wave output current such 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.680
 high quality current is important to 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.119
 sensitive equipment 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.549
 the next important difference is 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.100
 that the inverter generators are smaller and 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.189
 easier usually with the same power 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.470
 another advantage is reliability 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.180
 generators are so reliable that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.070
 the manufacturer has the opportunity 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.860
 set an extended period on them 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.200
 2 year warranty now more details 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.270
 about generator device to connect 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.090
 electrical devices are used here these 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.390
 standard AC sockets 220 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.850
 volt 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.069
 in addition to alternating current, the generator can 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.429
 issue and direct current which serves 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.810
 for 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.700
 rare standard car 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.680
 battery battery can 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.150
 connect through the clamps here 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.909
 Included in delivery 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.010
 generator generator is equipped with protection 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.829
 which automatically opens the circuit 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.150
 power supply if connected to it 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.730
 overload 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.069
 other automatic protection will work 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.230
 If the crankcase is not enough oil to 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.409
 protection did not work need to be maintained 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.719
 oil within operating limits this generator 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.010
 equipped with a four-stroke engine 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.500
 power of 3 horsepower and 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.349
 with overhead valves he 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.510
 start up manually 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.180
 Now we will start the generator before this 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:55.079
 need to perform a series of actions 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:57.889
 first check the oil level second 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.889
 pour fuel 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.400
 third open the fuel cap valve 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:11.870
 tank 4 switch the throttle in position 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.920
 start 5 turn on the engine now 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.920
 you can run a generator 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.970
 Now the generator is running at idle 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.310
 go while consuming the minimum 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.209
 amount of fuel let's measure it 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.930
 parameter as you see the voltage 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.489
 frequency meets the standards 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.650
 now we measure the current parameters on 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.610
 generator output when connected 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.610
 electric loads 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.349
 Well, that was heard as the engine changed 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.390
 operation mode all parameters correspond 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.370
 OK now we check really 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.720
 can you connect a generator 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.720
 sensitive digital technology 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.830
 but here I am before your eyes hooked up 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.720
 a laptop and it worked well if its 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.210
 connect to a conventional generator 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.560
 there is always a risk of failure we are with you 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.870
 met with a new ruler 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.350
 generators ergo max on the example here 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.080
 this one here model year 2000 oh generator 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.210
 reliable all the parameters of his work 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.680
 corresponds to the manufacturer 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.210
 while the generator has a number 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.250
 advantages generator economical 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.260
 compact delivers high quality current 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.260
 and most importantly , she has two years warranty
