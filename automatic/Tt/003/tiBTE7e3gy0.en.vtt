you<00:00:12.840> can<00:00:12.900> see<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> few<00:00:13.559> things<00:00:13.769> as<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.940> black

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
you can see a few things as a one black

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.760 
you can see a few things as a one black
why<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.599> come<00:00:15.870> down<00:00:16.080> that's<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> end<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
why I come down that's the end the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.760 
why I come down that's the end the
negative<00:00:17.130> voltage<00:00:17.820> tap<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> UH<00:00:18.960> PMS<00:00:19.500> all

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
negative voltage tap for the UH PMS all

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.400 
negative voltage tap for the UH PMS all
the<00:00:20.460> cell<00:00:20.670> wire<00:00:20.910> taps<00:00:21.510> were<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.810> place<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the cell wire taps were in place so the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.700 
the cell wire taps were in place so the
whole<00:00:22.560> BMS<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.189> all<00:00:23.570> laid<00:00:24.570> out<00:00:24.600> there's<00:00:25.529> also

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
whole BMS is all laid out there's also

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380 
whole BMS is all laid out there's also
even<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> thermal<00:00:26.400> sensor<00:00:26.699> down<00:00:26.849> me<00:00:27.000> afloat<00:00:27.240> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
even a thermal sensor down me afloat and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.929 
even a thermal sensor down me afloat and
underneath<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.900> unethically<00:00:28.680> atop<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.880> we

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
underneath the unethically atop so we

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.370 
underneath the unethically atop so we
keep<00:00:30.150> an<00:00:30.330> eye<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> battery<00:00:30.960> temperatures

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
keep an eye on the battery temperatures

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.370 
keep an eye on the battery temperatures
and<00:00:32.719> actually<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:33.840> thing<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> point

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and actually one thing I want to point

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.660 
and actually one thing I want to point
out<00:00:34.559> last<00:00:34.800> time<00:00:34.920> around<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.399> guess<00:00:35.489> maybe

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
out last time around I guess maybe

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.790 
out last time around I guess maybe
didn't<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.059> clear<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> red<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
didn't to clear you can see the red the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.580 
didn't to clear you can see the red the
main<00:00:37.950> throttle<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.790> also<00:00:39.420> put<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.719> pv6<00:00:40.050> plot

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
main throttle and also put in a pv6 plot

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.340 
main throttle and also put in a pv6 plot
box<00:00:40.890> that's<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> run<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.610> sound<00:00:41.910> racer<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.290> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
box that's to run that sound racer so I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200 
box that's to run that sound racer so I
can<00:00:43.559> get<00:00:43.680> both<00:00:44.190> independently<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.969> each<00:00:45.059> other

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
can get both independently of each other

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.610 
can get both independently of each other
just<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.510> piece<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> fishing<00:00:45.989> line<00:00:46.260> hold<00:00:46.500> them

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
just a piece of fishing line hold them

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.830 
just a piece of fishing line hold them
two<00:00:46.770> together<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> moment<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> may

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
two together for the moment and it may

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.470 
two together for the moment and it may
be<00:00:48.899> prominence<00:00:49.410> good<00:00:49.590> fishing<00:00:49.920> line<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.120> I've

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
be prominence good fishing line so I've

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.630 
be prominence good fishing line so I've
brought<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> BMS<00:00:52.800> amount<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.399> over

110 volt input right there it goes to a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.010 
110 volt input right there it goes to a
little<00:01:35.700> junction<00:01:36.060> box<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.659> then<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> comes

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
little junction box and then it comes

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
little junction box and then it comes
into<00:01:37.409> some<00:01:37.560> internal<00:01:37.829> circuitry<00:01:38.340> here<00:01:38.579> so

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
into some internal circuitry here so

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.719 
into some internal circuitry here so
there's<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> relay<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.960> control<00:01:40.409> AC<00:01:41.009> power<00:01:41.460> on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.139 
the car is plugged in so the BMS can
make<00:01:48.990> decisions<00:01:49.170> about<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:50.070> I've<00:01:51.000> had

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
make decisions about what to do I've had

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.149 
make decisions about what to do I've had
to<00:01:51.270> pull<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> battery<00:01:52.200> charger<00:01:52.590> pot<00:01:52.799> somehow

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
to pull the battery charger pot somehow

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.590 
to pull the battery charger pot somehow
managed<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.670> blown<00:01:53.939> fuse<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
managed to get a blown fuse in the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
managed to get a blown fuse in the
output<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.079> quite<00:01:55.290> sure<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.560> did<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
output not quite sure I did that but a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.420 
output not quite sure I did that but a
little<00:01:57.119> test<00:01:57.329> fuse<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:59.009> whole<00:01:59.159> thing<00:01:59.340> is

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
little test fuse the whole thing is

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.959 
little test fuse the whole thing is
working<00:01:59.850> so<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.420> guess<00:02:01.380> I'm<00:02:01.590> good<00:02:01.829> go<00:02:02.790> get<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
working so I guess I'm good go get a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.670 
working so I guess I'm good go get a
couple<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> replacement<00:02:03.659> fuses<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> way<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
couple of replacement fuses on the way I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.600 
couple of replacement fuses on the way I
also<00:02:05.189> added<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.840> bolted<00:02:06.840> down<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
also added in the bolted down the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.639 
also added in the bolted down the
12-volt<00:02:08.610> batteries<00:02:09.090> get<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.649> cell

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
12-volt batteries get the little cell

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.170 
12-volt batteries get the little cell
log<00:02:10.860> eight<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> can

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
log eight on it so you can

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.319 
log eight on it so you can
see<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.079> second<00:02:13.379> there<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.709> then

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
see that for a second there and then

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.240 
see that for a second there and then
dc-to-dc<00:02:15.329> converter<00:02:16.049> that's<00:02:16.769> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.040> bring

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
dc-to-dc converter that's going to bring

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.420 
dc-to-dc converter that's going to bring
down<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:18.170> main<00:02:19.170> tak<00:02:19.409> bolted<00:02:19.829> down<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.219> keep

down the main tak bolted down and keep

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.360 
down the main tak bolted down and keep
feeding<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.790> 12-volt<00:02:21.359> keep<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.750> wall<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
feeding that 12-volt keep that wall and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.250 
feeding that 12-volt keep that wall and
you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.489> see<00:02:23.640> where<00:02:23.730> i<00:02:23.790> pull<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.030> 12<00:02:24.629> volt<00:02:24.719> or

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
you can see where i pull the 12 volt or

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.899 
you can see where i pull the 12 volt or

just about ready to button this thing up

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.869 
just about ready to button this thing up
do<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> little<00:02:55.409> more<00:02:55.560> testing<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.040> at<00:02:56.700> this

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
do a little more testing but at this

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.039 
do a little more testing but at this
point<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.329> all<00:02:57.389> looking<00:02:57.569> pretty<00:02:57.870> good

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
point it's all looking pretty good

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.670 
point it's all looking pretty good
electrically<00:02:58.620> and<00:03:00.230> trying<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.290> look<00:03:01.379> for<00:03:01.560> any

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
electrically and trying to look for any

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.330 
electrically and trying to look for any
last<00:03:02.069> last<00:03:02.609> minute<00:03:02.909> items<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.389> do<00:03:03.540> before<00:03:04.260> i

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
last last minute items to do before i

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.990 
last last minute items to do before i
turn<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.549> start<00:03:05.730> working<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:07.620> body<00:03:08.000> so

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
turn and start working on the body so

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.659 
turn and start working on the body so
that'll<00:03:09.239> be<00:03:09.299> coming<00:03:09.450> up<00:03:09.689> next<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.230> i<00:03:11.219> can't

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
that'll be coming up next and i can't

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.770 
that'll be coming up next and i can't
wait<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.939> make<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.180> thing<00:03:12.329> finally<00:03:12.540> look

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
wait to make this thing finally look

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.200 
wait to make this thing finally look
like<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> car
