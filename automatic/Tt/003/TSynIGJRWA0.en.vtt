00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.030
 to games today 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.419
 the Greens are canceled 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.369
 We can say that we have earned a lot of money from Rheine 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.029
 Switzerland brought there are point taken away 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.349
 but due to the fact that we are so from the 20 minute 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.909
 had a relatively large amount of play 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.919
 this does not really come into play well 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.479
 in the initial phase, even the criticism of the spÃ¶ but then the team has 

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:30.819
 increased and have 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.679
 Percentage chances are being played out both buildings halftime already because that 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.700
 one or the other gate will make you far away 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.950
 advertised directly from the holder of the euro in the game has been pressure built up 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
 Greens do not really want us anymore 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.230
 In the end, we coaches had confirmed that we were getting stronger 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.220
 and Olic was commanded unerringly and then finally 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.090
 was rewarded by the fact that we were with the 1 1 that maybe a bit 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270
 Lucky not less is beautiful 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.010
 Percent came to 1 compensation 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.340
 and so that really stands and stroke 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340
 One point would be highly deserved in the overall open 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.440
 then the first is a sleepy one 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.930
 Zenit is not there because it was then the age of the team stand 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.670
 but now had against the ruler 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.740
 it should be completely abandoned 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.880
 the coach of the SC Dortelweil order situation pays off nevertheless 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.280
 Not 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.540
 30 clock Samana 10 40 clock brutally from the Internet on the new weapons law before 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.670
 Court has been made outside player and Volvo 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.570
 Mr. Schleicher claims for himself but nothing else than that 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.140
 right means for that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.260
 45 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.710
 for danger made praying openly 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.710
 we just deserved it 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.340
 4 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.670
 so we have to go to court to draw the paint 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.010
 to come 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.150
 I do not close that 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 long-term view 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 this is what the best players answer 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 most goals threw 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.239
 Chevron won 1 0 is at the top 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.909
 September 2001 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.089
 improved 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.499
 Player coach referee and 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.329
 Heinz Zanner became the Alizee Sery 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.389
 TomTom and thus the standards 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.420
 and 18 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.909
 Bronze rewards 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.119
 average 1 1 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:27.950
 last year gave the 40 2 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.950
 who today is the key to the big opportunities 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.449
 Consequently, it will take days and weeks 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.289
 Florence and Manchester in the 87 45 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.249
 down we have we have come 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.309
 "We do not want victims but percent 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.309
 when the ball and answer build 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.539
 that is at 1 1 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.829
 League today another 1 it's already 14 30 clock 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.539
 know today 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.629
 Fifth, not so vulnerable 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.089
 leave today 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:06.739
 want with it and the word 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.889
 what do you all mean 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:08.869
 ready for that 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.629
 little chance that both opponents did not work out did not work but 5 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.079
 5 percent so reconstruction ahead 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.189
 and then you get played badly by the ADAC 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.679
 pressure from the beginning 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.789
 but problems work 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.369
 good at feeling 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.509
 always get into the game better 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.199
 because then I came more from the game 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.989
 one or the other chance of a porn lives 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.989
 without that one day was ten percent 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.749
 At that time, 2 4 billion were still around 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.059
 because with the city are oysters 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.359
 Eliminate Brigitte 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.629
 the flanks from the left 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.699
 but in the end, class really wants chances on one too much 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.459
 that profits own resources Pedersen nothing to do but the kind of area code the 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.259
 the chances of winning Cup were happy 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:56.989
 It was a good chance 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.989
 July comes steps later, he shoots twice two cards 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:02.479
 So opportunity was there 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.189
 not quite as much more needs 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.369
 Microsoft has so many opportunities 

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:09.369
 Kerstin Stremmel do not comment on the allegations 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.499
 Tip-off is always a bit addictive next week 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.519
 until Christmas "Of course I was left open yesterday 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.749
 even further up Gunter Haug 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:22.150
 Try everything on a draw and he has not changed anything 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.180
 In the evening is around all three shareholders 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.669
 all right for Folker Heinecke
