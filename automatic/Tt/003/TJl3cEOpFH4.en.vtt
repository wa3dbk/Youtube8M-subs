00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.380
What up y’all? This week we takin
it to the STREETS with The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.360
Fo’teen year old Pony Boy Curtis
jus’ walkin home one night, minding his

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.160
own damn bidness when all the sudden- “Break
Yo’self Fool!” Five hoods from West Side crew

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.829
roll up and start layin a whoop on my boy
when “HOLD UP”- Pony Boy’s East side

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.690
bruthas drop in and shake dem haters off.
See, fo years there been beef goin on between

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.920
The Socs, or the West Side rich kids, and
the “Greasers,” the East side po’ kids.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.260
Pony boy livin’ in the slums with
his two brothers Sodapop and Darry. And when

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.300
Pony on da streets, he and his bros always
rollin deep with some otha’ Greasers- Johnny,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.949
Steve, Two-Bit, and crazy white-boy Dallas
Winston, or Dally for short.

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.819
Later, Johnny, Dallas, and Pony Boy
chillin at da drive-in when they start throwin

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:05.500
game at these two soc biddies named Cherry
and Marcia. When Dallas bails and Two-Bit

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.490
shows up, da boys decide to keep it gangsta
and offer da ladies a ride home. While they

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.939
rollin up to the hoopty, tho, da girls boytoys
Bob and Randy step to em afta’ poundin’ way too

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.100
much crunk joose. Mad-dogging ensues and da
sh** bout to go down when da womenses break

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.280
it up and head home with their men.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.460
Dat night, Pony boy and Johnny pass
out while they soakin’ in dat night sky,

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.350
so when Pony get home, Darry all like “Muthafuka
where you been? I been stayin up all night

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.500
waitin fo yo ass.” Darry get all riled up and WHACK-

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.219
gives em five across da face. All to’ up
bout it, Pony Boy books it to the park where

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.929
he meets up with his boy Johnny. Just then
“Oh Damn!”- Outta nowhere Randy, Bob,

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.399
and da rest of dem Soc haters jump our boys!
It’s almost lights out for Pony Boy, whose

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.530
ass bout to get drowned, til Johnny whips
out his blade and shanks Bob. WOOOO he dead!

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.260
Buggin like crazy, Pony and Johnny
hit up crazy-ass Dallas, who throws em a piece,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.679
fiddy bucks, and tell em to get outta town
and lay low in an abandoned church til things

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:06.590
cool off.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.929
Bout one boring-ass week later, Dallas show
up and take em to a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.130
Dairy Queen and tell em what’s goin down in town:
The Socs and da Greasers bout have an all-out

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.060
rumble in da streets. Cherry on our side now
actin’ like a spy, and da law is ridin’

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.880
Pony Boy and Johnny’s asses HARD- even got
they descriptions in the paper. Johnny decide

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.140
he gonna turn himself in pleadin’ self defense,
but errybody head back to the church first.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.920
When they get there, it straight BLAZIN wit
lil’ kids trapped inside! Johnny, Pony,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.040
and Dallas keep it clutch and save all the
churrin, but when da roof caves in, Johnny’s

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.080
back gets fu**ED up and he dies at da hospital.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.660
Dallas gets so crunk bout Johnny dyin’ that
he boosts some sh** from da grocery sto’

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.360
and now he on the run from the 5-0. Pony and
da boys try to help a brutha out, but da fuzz

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.270
get to Dallas first and pump him full of lead.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.820
Pony Boy sees da whole thing go down, and
realize dat Dallas’s heart been shat on

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.240
so much, dat he probably wanted to die.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.960
With all this messed up sh** goin’ on around
them, Soda get Darry and Pony to stop bustin’

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.200
eachothers asses all the time, cuz they all
they got left. Pony Boy gets straight with

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.980
the law, but he havin’ trouble at school.
Teach hooks him up and say he can write a

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.890
paper if he wanna pass English. After thinkin’
bout all da mess dat went down with Dallas,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.200
he realize dat people need to hear da truth:
The world ain’t JUST a whack-ass place.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.680
There’s good in there, and otha’ people
stugglin jus like you. So keep a lookout for

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.090
peeps who need a hand, and don’t judge a
book by its cover. Pony actually start writing

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.100
a book which ends up being da book you just
read...

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.760
Even though Da Outsiders was written fo’
adolescent kids, it sho as hell pissed off

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.620
a lot of adults.. Matta’ fact, this book
keep it so real dat when it came out, parents

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.120
were trippin dat it describe young people
talkin mess, smokin’ cigs, and dodgin’

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.290
the law. But what really make dis work so
legit, is how Hinton don’t shy away from

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.510
da beef between the social classes.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.710
See at first Pony Boy and da crew thinkin
dat they so different from da Socs cuz they

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.510
born with phat stacks, whereas da Greasers
gotta bust they ass for a livin and ain’t

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.650
got sh** to their name.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.930
A life full of empty pockets and no opportunities
can make a man cold as ice- like Dallas. And

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.430
when you on the struggle like dat, da only
thing you got is yo pride to keep you strong,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.859
and yo gang to get yo back.

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.030
“We’re all we’ve
got left. We ought to be able to stick together

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.530
against everything. If we don’t have each
other, we don’t have anything. If you don’t

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.870
have anything, you end like Dallas...and I
don’t mean dead, either. I mean like he

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.120
was before. And that’s worse than dead.”
(176)

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.280
But eventually Pony-Boy realize dat whether
you got swole dollas or no dollas, errybody

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.910
got problems- even the Socs. And in that way
they ain’t so different. Cherry help him

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.050
understand dat when she say:

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.570
“I’ll bet you think
the Socs have it made. The rich kids, the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.580
West-side Socs. I’ll tell you something,
Ponyboy, and it may come as a surprise. We

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.150
have troubles you’ve never even heard of.
You want to know something?’ She looked

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.750
me straight in the eye. ‘Things are rough
all over.’” (34-35)

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.100
All throughout this book Ponyboy feelin’
like he an Outsider- even when he wit his

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.000
own crew. But no matta’ how tight you are
with someone, there always gonna be differences

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.170
between one person and anotha. And even if
it’s a fat-ass social gap like da one between

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.440
da Greasers and da Socs, there’s always
a chance to build a bridge and pave it with

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.600
gold, playa.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.270
In fact, da poem “Nothing Gold can Stay”
by Robert Frost gets a shoutout in da book

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.280
dat schools Pony boy real good.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.530
“I’ve been thinking
about it, and that poem, that guy that wrote

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.200
it, he meant you’re gold when you’re a
kid, like green. When you’re a kid everything’s

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.560
new, dawn.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.620
It’s just when you get used to everything
that it’s day. Like the way you dig sunsets,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.760
Pony. That’s gold. Keep that way, it’s
a good way to be.” (178)

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.630
There’s gold inside erry homie, and dats
what you gotta get at if you wanna be able

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.620
to connect wit’ people. So stay gold by
pre- ordering the Thug Notes book. We been

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.400
workin’ our asses off on this bad boy. It’s
got breakdowns of the 16 most assigned books

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.210
made of 100% real talk. So click the link
in the description and throw down some change

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.480
fo’ yo boy Sparky. Thanks for watchin’
y’all. Peace.
