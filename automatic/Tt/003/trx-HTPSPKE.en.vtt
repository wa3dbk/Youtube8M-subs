00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.839
 The other party thank you and placement is here Final Fantasy Record Keeper 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.970
 I 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.560
 Many times formal in the hope in the celebration you have your wish to everyone as there is also in Um title 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.710
 It's not a story 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:20.179
 Let alone there is that eh that I thought when I bit 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.490
 That newly started recently started and since this year 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.240
 shame 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 The sound code keeper of the cat increases as the one who got it increases and there are a lot of people who look at it with appreciation 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.759
 I 'm welcome but it's fine 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.450
 Aside from having increased abilities and special moves to that head, the friend function was added 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.650
 From 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.480
 For example, is not it has become more to support the way was nothing billing for everyone 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:46.480
 In Toka Special Moves or its ability 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:49.989
 Also recommended, for example, this this and if the effect and use it use it in this in Toka'll duplicate 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.430
 So there are a lot of things, but it's actually like a fine rule 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:59.500
 In if there lot of things that do not know myself back have gotten a lot of comments section 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:03.610
 There are a lot of things like market price even if you 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.790
 Of course there is a lack of study of oneself, but even oneself doing quite well 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.260
 It Deko to be a lot to think if there ah 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.120
 I know amazing that sort of still or rather those who started Come to to something early days how intends cat 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.229
 I thought it would be nice to keep 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.490
 So say, for example, break and say what you want to ask whether you what you want to because 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:24.860
 Kate uses his Special Moves like this 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:31.820
 You are in the Doi area. It is not good to use this and this in reverse. 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.539
 I hope you can support it with the knowledge you have, so if you can do that, it will be 1 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.799
 Main school 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:39.480
 For example'm good to this place is checked all to the comments section for the say everyone 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.630
 I think there will be many people who are not 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:47.760
 I think so I received information 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.900
 Of course, for example, this is why it is different from what I wrote 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.600
 I I think that there 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:59.500
 It so I think let's once verification is I myself Gakukko Author in where to be inconclusive 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:04.210
 Especially for those recently started, including 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:08.470
 I 'd like to take videos that share information or something like this 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:13.930
 So I hope you will teach me some of the knowledge you know 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.620
 For example, but, for example, now there are high power breaks and par breaks. 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.490
 Is not it 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.030
 Hyper processing is on, but after hitting hyperflakes, par play 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:28.370
 If it is piled up, the hyper breaker will disappear, and it will be over-written by par break 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.520
 Because it will end up, I sometimes hit a hyperbreak and this is the amount I cut here with a par break 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.780
 Come on in 's so I'd some people Rassharu thought I here is shaved 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.480
 When was this Yes I do I So if I Chau public type I rather par play 9 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.780
 After I hit it , I cut off in Aso and I feel so bad, but I am broken 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.430
 You have to do something like get hyper 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.599
 Is not there is a status Lee Kita mountain of that sort of thing whether after Hoop 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:56.500
 Certainly in I is superimposed swelling regarding the status reel or break system 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:01.090
 I us to lower the status reel Tteetto Ne defense force and magic defense of the enemy but 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:06.610
 Certainly such should overlap each other in this and the status reel on which hit hyper break 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:10.360
 Wrote that went so you make a mistake make sure I'm sorry we thought that Itadaketara 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:16.209
 Of course not be a brake system made it look I do I do this kind of thing 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.520
 Perhaps it's all becomes in the Moselle feel to select score even in the Sera 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.540
 An 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.090
