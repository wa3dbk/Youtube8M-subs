00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.919
Welcome to Mutevazi Lezzetler video pages!

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.159
at this episode, we will share a cake recipe

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.719
"Cake with Honey and Rice"

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.879
let's see the ingredients list at first, then we will see how to cook it

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:22.439
3 eggs

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:27.599
1/2 cup of sunflower oil

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.559
1/2 cup of honey

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.839
1/3 cup of rice

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:37.119
1/3 cup of coconut

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:40.479
1/3 cup of sultanas

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:43.359
1 pack of baking powder

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.799
1 pack of vanilla

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:48.079
1 cup of milk

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.919
and 2 + 1/2 cups of sifted flour

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.199
after the ingredients list, let's see how to cook it

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.479
we have 3 eggs, I'm breaking them

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:14.599
and adding 1/2 cup of honey on it

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:20.959
as you can notice, we are not using sugar, we are using honey instead

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.719
to give a natural taste to our cake

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.559
now I'm mixing it for a while

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:40.959
it is enough to whisk it

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:48.959
now, I'm adding the milk and 1/2 cup of sunflower oil

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.679
and urgently I'm adding rice

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.559
I've boiled the rice with 1 cup of milk

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.559
over very low heat

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.839
now I'm adding coconut...

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.959
and flour, the flour is sifted as it is mentioned

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.319
I'm adding vanilla and baking powder also

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:35.079
I'm mixing it for a while more

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.439
finally I'm adding the sultanas

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.879
I'm mixing it for a while just to lay the raisins homogenously in the mixture

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:05.919
now I can pour the mixture into the greased mould

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.599
I've poured the cake mixture into the mould

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.359
now I'm placing the mould into the oven which is heated to 338 F and baking the cake for 1 hour at least

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.679
after the 1 hour baking

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.879
the cake is baked

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.879
now, I can reverse it over the service plate

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.679
it has grown very well, it is color also nice

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:49.639
after cooling it for a while, actually it would be better to cool it down more...

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.359
you can slice and serve it

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.759
Bon Appetite! Afiyet Olsun!
