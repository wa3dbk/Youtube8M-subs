you need is almond this is roughly a cup
of<00:00:18.660> almonds<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.580> actually<00:00:20.939> pre<00:00:21.480> soaked

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
of almonds and I actually pre soaked

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.070 
of almonds and I actually pre soaked
this<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.920> about<00:00:23.039> 8<00:00:23.340> hours<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:24.090> reason<00:00:24.930> you

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
this for about 8 hours the reason you

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.009 
this for about 8 hours the reason you
want<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> soak<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:27.150> becomes<00:00:27.570> more

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
want to soak this is it becomes more

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.730 
want to soak this is it becomes more
digestible<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:30.019> also<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.140> takes<00:00:31.349> away<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
digestible and also it takes away the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.440 
digestible and also it takes away the
bitter<00:00:32.149> flavor<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:34.350> know<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:36.120> don't
