covering the bed the comparator and the
ender<00:00:14.940> portal<00:00:15.299> frame<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:16.920> let's<00:00:17.670> get<00:00:17.850> started

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
ender portal frame so let's get started

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.929 
ender portal frame so let's get started
with<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> bed<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:20.100> way<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> bed<00:00:20.460> works<00:00:20.640> is

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
with the bed the way the bed works is

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.109 
with the bed the way the bed works is
well<00:00:21.510> kind<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.199> normal<00:00:22.500> bed<00:00:22.789> if<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.910> step

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
well kind of like a normal bed if I step

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.000 
well kind of like a normal bed if I step
on<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> pressure<00:00:24.570> plate<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.289> then<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> try

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
on the pressure plate here then I try

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.250 
on the pressure plate here then I try
and<00:00:26.070> use<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> bed<00:00:26.519> now<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.330> daytime<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and use the bed now it's daytime so it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.679 
and use the bed now it's daytime so it
says<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:28.769> only<00:00:28.800> sleep<00:00:29.070> at<00:00:29.189> night<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:30.570> let

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
says you can only sleep at night so let

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.979 
says you can only sleep at night so let
me<00:00:30.779> go<00:00:31.109> ahead<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.289> set<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> time<00:00:31.830> tonight

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
me go ahead and set the time tonight

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.569 
me go ahead and set the time tonight
alright<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.040> night<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> can

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
alright and now that it's night I can

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.250 
alright and now that it's night I can
just<00:00:35.730> step<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> pressure<00:00:36.239> plate<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
just step on the pressure plate and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.920 
just step on the pressure plate and
notice<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> darkens<00:00:38.250> my<00:00:38.430> vision<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.570> try<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
notice it darkens my vision if I try and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.830 
notice it darkens my vision if I try and
move<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:41.100> doesn't<00:00:41.280> let<00:00:41.460> me<00:00:41.550> move<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.149> then

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
move it it doesn't let me move and then

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.479 
move it it doesn't let me move and then
it<00:00:42.960> sets<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> time<00:00:43.379> today<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.920> my<00:00:44.250> spawn

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it sets the time today and my spawn

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.819 
it sets the time today and my spawn
point<00:00:44.760> has<00:00:44.879> actually<00:00:45.149> been<00:00:45.270> set<00:00:45.510> too<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.260> go

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
point has actually been set too so I go

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:47.660 
point has actually been set too so I go
ahead<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> kill<00:00:47.219> myself

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
ahead and kill myself

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
ahead and kill myself
see<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> respawn<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> bed<00:00:49.890> here

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
see I respawn right back on the bed here

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.350 
see I respawn right back on the bed here
so<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.010> basically<00:00:53.190> reimplemented<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
so I basically reimplemented all the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.950 
so I basically reimplemented all the
features<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:55.469> bed<00:00:55.800> has<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:57.030> redstone

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
features that a bed has with redstone

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.180 
features that a bed has with redstone
and<00:00:57.989> command<00:00:58.379> blocks<00:00:59.000> there's<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:01.190> daylight

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and command blocks there's a daylight

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
and command blocks there's a daylight
sensor<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.210> come<00:01:03.510> look<00:01:03.780> on

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
sensor and actually if you come look on

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500 
sensor and actually if you come look on
the<00:01:04.049> outside<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.739> thing<00:01:04.970> there's<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the outside of this thing there's the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.149 
the outside of this thing there's the
daylight<00:01:06.810> sensor<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:07.830> kind<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
daylight sensor is actually kind of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.170 
daylight sensor is actually kind of
visible<00:01:08.369> from<00:01:08.549> underneath<00:01:09.770> but<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
visible from underneath but this is a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.490 
visible from underneath but this is a
daylight<00:01:12.450> sensor<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.869> tells<00:01:13.020> whether<00:01:13.290> it's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
daylight sensor that tells whether it's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.630 
daylight sensor that tells whether it's
day<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.680> night

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
day or night

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.630 
day or night
and<00:01:15.560> that<00:01:16.560> tooked<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> gates

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and that tooked up to some and gates

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.780 
and that tooked up to some and gates
here<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:19.320> command<00:01:19.860> block<00:01:19.979> over<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.460> says

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
here this command block over here says

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
here this command block over here says
it<00:01:21.479> tells<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> player<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.409> only<00:01:22.530> sleep

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it tells the player you can only sleep

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.170 
it tells the player you can only sleep
at<00:01:22.890> night<00:01:23.450> this<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.509> over<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:26.180> we're

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
at night this one over here we got we're

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.630 
at night this one over here we got we're
setting<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> spawn<00:01:27.780> point<00:01:28.140> immediately<00:01:28.640> we

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
setting the spawn point immediately we

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.819 
setting the spawn point immediately we
add<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.720> blindness<00:01:31.079> effect<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.710> was

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
add the blindness effect and that was

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.789 
add the blindness effect and that was
what<00:01:32.009> caused<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.430> screen<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.850> dark<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
what caused the screen to go dark and

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.310 
what caused the screen to go dark and
then<00:01:34.799> there's<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> big<00:01:35.310> long<00:01:35.610> delay<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.360> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
then there's a big long delay and and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.080 
then there's a big long delay and and
after<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> end<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> delay<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.729> time<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
after the end of the delay the time is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.080 
after the end of the delay the time is
set<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.509> zero<00:01:40.170> which<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.159> evening<00:01:41.970> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
set to zero which is you know evening of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
set to zero which is you know evening of
the<00:01:42.180> day<00:01:42.299> there's<00:01:42.570> also<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:43.110> RS<00:01:44.040> nor<00:01:44.189> latch

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the day there's also this RS nor latch

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
the day there's also this RS nor latch
with<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> timer<00:01:45.090> thingy<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:46.020> keeps<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
with a timer thingy that keeps the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.310 
with a timer thingy that keeps the
player<00:01:46.939> within<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.119> certain<00:01:48.299> radius<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
player within a certain radius of that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.830 
player within a certain radius of that
pressure<00:01:49.829> plate<00:01:50.159> essentially<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.659> that's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pressure plate essentially so that's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.749 
pressure plate essentially so that's
what's<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.770> lot<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.310> command

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
what's going on here a lot of command

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.039 
what's going on here a lot of command
block<00:01:53.970> stuff<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.390> kind<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.600> cooled<00:01:54.750> actually

block stuff it's kind of cooled actually

block stuff it's kind of cooled actually
that<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.409> reimplemented<00:01:57.049> with<00:01:58.049> just

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that you can reimplemented with just

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.999 
that you can reimplemented with just
command<00:01:59.040> blocks<00:01:59.659> even<00:02:00.659> even<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> darkness

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and keeping the player in place and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.020 
and keeping the player in place and
everything<00:02:04.430> that's<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
everything that's all there is for the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.850 
everything that's all there is for the
bed<00:02:06.180> next<00:02:06.659> i'm<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.020> an<00:02:07.229> portal<00:02:07.590> frame

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
bed next i'm going to do an portal frame

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.080 
bed next i'm going to do an portal frame
the<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.599> end<00:02:09.750> portal<00:02:09.989> frame<00:02:10.760> ok<00:02:11.760> here's<00:02:11.970> what

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the the end portal frame ok here's what

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.300 
the the end portal frame ok here's what
it<00:02:12.180> looks<00:02:12.330> like

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
it looks like

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.620 
it looks like
I<00:02:13.340> had<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.819> little<00:02:14.030> bit<00:02:14.120> trouble<00:02:14.450> with<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
I had a little bit trouble with the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.070 
I had a little bit trouble with the
colors<00:02:14.959> they<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.680> look<00:02:15.830> exactly<00:02:16.130> right<00:02:16.520> and

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
colors they can look exactly right and

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.809 
colors they can look exactly right and
similarly<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> comparator<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:19.520> this

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
similarly for the comparator so this

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.610 
similarly for the comparator so this
episode<00:02:20.000> they<00:02:20.390> don't<00:02:20.540> look<00:02:20.720> exactly<00:02:21.050> perfect

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
episode they don't look exactly perfect

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.620 
episode they don't look exactly perfect
but<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.420> guy<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:24.080> way<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.290> works<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.920> you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
but so this guy the way it works is you

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.839 
but so this guy the way it works is you
can<00:02:26.630> put<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:26.870> eyes<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.260> ender<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:28.700> will

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
can put in eyes of ender and it will

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.500 
can put in eyes of ender and it will
slowly<00:02:29.120> fill<00:02:29.510> up<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:31.280> socket<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.090> drop

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
slowly fill up the the socket so I drop

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.140 
slowly fill up the the socket so I drop
in<00:02:32.690> an<00:02:32.780> eye<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:33.019> ender<00:02:33.319> oh<00:02:33.590> my<00:02:34.459> cats<00:02:34.700> meowing<00:02:35.000> in

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
in an eye of ender oh my cats meowing in

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.140 
in an eye of ender oh my cats meowing in
the<00:02:35.209> background<00:02:35.269> so<00:02:35.840> loud<00:02:36.080> Oh<00:02:38.680> kitty

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
are you throw in an eye of ender and and

are you throw in an eye of ender and and
and<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.600> starts<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.080> appear<00:02:48.380> okay<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.799> just<00:02:48.860> have

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
and it starts to appear okay I just have

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.940 
and it starts to appear okay I just have
to<00:02:49.160> get<00:02:49.280> through<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:51.230> starts<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.620> appear

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
to get through this it starts to appear

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.280 
to get through this it starts to appear
and<00:02:52.220> as<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.640> put<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.090> more<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.420> more<00:02:53.510> more<00:02:54.140> of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
and as I put in more and more more of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.229 
and as I put in more and more more of
the<00:02:54.560> eye<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.400> ender<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:55.730> going<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:55.940> show<00:02:56.090> up

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
the eye of ender it's going to show up

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.080 
the eye of ender it's going to show up
here<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.290> don't<00:02:58.220> exactly<00:02:58.489> want<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.819> spam

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
here and so I don't exactly want to spam

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.229 
here and so I don't exactly want to spam
it<00:02:59.330> but<00:02:59.630> keep<00:03:00.560> putting<00:03:00.830> them<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.130> whoops<00:03:01.880> drop

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
it but keep putting them in whoops drop

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.509 
it but keep putting them in whoops drop
that<00:03:02.390> one<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.630> wrong<00:03:02.750> place<00:03:03.340> keep<00:03:04.340> putting

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
that one in the wrong place keep putting

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.220 
that one in the wrong place keep putting
a<00:03:04.580> man<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.420> gonna<00:03:05.540> keep<00:03:05.780> showing<00:03:06.140> up

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
a man and it's gonna keep showing up

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.620 
a man and it's gonna keep showing up
more<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.530> more<00:03:06.709> of<00:03:06.799> that<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.480> course

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
more and more of that this is of course

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.589 
more and more of that this is of course
using<00:03:09.019> my<00:03:09.170> structure<00:03:09.980> spawner<00:03:10.370> filter<00:03:10.790> to

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
using my structure spawner filter to

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.809 
using my structure spawner filter to
spawn<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:12.500> stuff<00:03:12.830> using<00:03:13.130> falling<00:03:13.549> sand

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
spawn and this stuff using falling sand

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.470 
spawn and this stuff using falling sand
and<00:03:14.060> whatever<00:03:14.480> okay<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.739> as<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:16.040> get<00:03:16.099> to<00:03:16.549> that

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
and whatever okay so as I get to that

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.210 
and whatever okay so as I get to that
was<00:03:17.570> 11<00:03:17.870> when<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.260> put<00:03:18.440> my<00:03:18.470> 12th<00:03:18.859> in<00:03:19.010> it's

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
was 11 when I put my 12th in it's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.349 
was 11 when I put my 12th in it's
actually<00:03:19.489> going<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.670> complete<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.030> portal

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
actually going to complete the portal

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.960 
actually going to complete the portal
and<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:21.650> center<00:03:22.220> of<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.400> eye<00:03:22.870> becomes<00:03:23.870> the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
and the center of the eye becomes the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.420 
and the center of the eye becomes the
the<00:03:25.970> end<00:03:26.120> portal<00:03:26.480> here<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.739> requires<00:03:28.040> 12

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the end portal here so it requires 12

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.580 
the end portal here so it requires 12
just<00:03:28.730> like<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:28.970> normal<00:03:29.329> portal<00:03:29.900> here<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.470> can

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
just like a normal portal here you can

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.830 
just like a normal portal here you can
compare<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:31.190> actual<00:03:31.970> ender<00:03:32.390> eye<00:03:32.420> in<00:03:32.720> the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
compare the actual ender eye in the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.059 
compare the actual ender eye in the
socket

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
socket

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.509 
socket
you<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.090> tell<00:03:35.239> me<00:03:35.359> what<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.569> think<00:03:35.780> oh<00:03:36.519> it

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
you can tell me what you think oh it

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.220 
you can tell me what you think oh it
doesn't<00:03:37.670> look<00:03:37.880> perfect<00:03:38.060> but<00:03:38.480> but<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.049> pretty

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
doesn't look perfect but but it's pretty

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.509 
doesn't look perfect but but it's pretty
cool<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.470> works<00:03:39.650> like<00:03:39.829> that<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.400> can

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
cool it works like that and you can

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.220 
cool it works like that and you can
actually<00:03:40.640> spawn<00:03:41.030> in<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.420> portal<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.079> that

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
actually spawn in that portal and that

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.840 
actually spawn in that portal and that
portal<00:03:42.530> does<00:03:42.709> work<00:03:42.950> it<00:03:43.280> will<00:03:43.370> teleport<00:03:43.609> you<00:03:43.819> to

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
portal does work it will teleport you to

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.420 
portal does work it will teleport you to
the<00:03:44.000> end<00:03:44.139> so<00:03:45.139> it<00:03:45.350> counts<00:03:45.650> up<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.829> 12<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.280> then

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
the end so it counts up to 12 and then

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.360 
the end so it counts up to 12 and then
it<00:03:46.609> spawns<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.090> portal<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:48.470> that's<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.799> ender

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
it spawns the portal so that's the ender

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.309 
it spawns the portal so that's the ender

Pro frame the last the last block for
this<00:03:51.470> episode<00:03:51.829> is<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.340> comparator<00:03:52.910> oh<00:03:53.109> hold

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
this episode is the comparator oh hold

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.750 
this episode is the comparator oh hold
on<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.440> didn't<00:03:55.069> show<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.340> what's<00:03:55.519> going<00:03:55.579> on

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
on I didn't show you what's going on

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.599 
on I didn't show you what's going on
inside<00:03:55.940> here<00:03:56.299> actually<00:03:56.630> there's<00:03:56.799> I<00:03:57.799> kind<00:03:58.549> of

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
inside here actually there's I kind of

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.190 
inside here actually there's I kind of
cheated<00:03:58.790> with<00:03:59.060> space<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.299> little<00:03:59.450> bit<00:03:59.690> on<00:03:59.840> on

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
cheated with space a little bit on on

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.860 
cheated with space a little bit on on
these<00:04:00.380> last<00:04:00.650> couple<00:04:02.859> yeah<00:04:04.359> so<00:04:05.359> all<00:04:05.480> these<00:04:05.660> are

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
these last couple yeah so all these are

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.270 
these last couple yeah so all these are
the<00:04:06.019> different<00:04:06.319> structure<00:04:06.650> spawners<00:04:06.889> for<00:04:07.190> the

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
the different structure spawners for the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.220 
the different structure spawners for the
different<00:04:07.549> components<00:04:07.970> of<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.150> ender<00:04:08.930> eye<00:04:08.959> in

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
different components of the ender eye in

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.229 
different components of the ender eye in
the<00:04:09.319> socket<00:04:09.709> they're<00:04:10.280> all<00:04:10.430> controlled<00:04:11.120> by

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
the socket they're all controlled by

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.500 
the socket they're all controlled by
these<00:04:11.569> wireless<00:04:12.200> while<00:04:13.100> wireless<00:04:13.730> receivers

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
these wireless while wireless receivers

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.330 
these wireless while wireless receivers
using<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.170> scoreboard<00:04:15.650> for<00:04:15.950> wireless

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
using the scoreboard for wireless

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.129 
using the scoreboard for wireless
signals<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:17.450> that's<00:04:17.570> all<00:04:17.720> that's<00:04:17.780> going<00:04:17.989> on

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
signals so that's all that's going on

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.540 
signals so that's all that's going on
down<00:04:18.380> here<00:04:18.609> there's<00:04:19.609> also<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:21.099> sorter<00:04:22.099> in<00:04:22.250> here

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
down here there's also a sorter in here

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.750 
down here there's also a sorter in here
actually<00:04:22.760> so<00:04:23.110> there's<00:04:24.110> a<00:04:24.200> little<00:04:24.760> sorter

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
actually so there's a little sorter

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.040 
actually so there's a little sorter
which<00:04:25.909> means<00:04:26.120> that<00:04:26.539> you<00:04:26.720> can

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
which means that you can

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.749 
which means that you can
if<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.039> put<00:04:28.220> in<00:04:28.400> an<00:04:29.150> item<00:04:29.750> say<00:04:30.289> this<00:04:31.280> red<00:04:31.550> wool

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
if you put in an item say this red wool

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.210 
if you put in an item say this red wool
into<00:04:32.120> these<00:04:32.419> hoppers<00:04:32.840> it's<00:04:33.560> gonna<00:04:33.800> sort<00:04:34.099> it

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
into these hoppers it's gonna sort it

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.580 
into these hoppers it's gonna sort it
into<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.460> different<00:04:34.759> chest<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.470> red

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
into a different chest so that the red

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.589 
into a different chest so that the red
wool<00:04:36.770> goes<00:04:36.949> in<00:04:37.129> here<00:04:37.400> whereas<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:38.090> 12<00:04:38.360> and

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
wool goes in here whereas the 12 and

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.420 
wool goes in here whereas the 12 and
rise<00:04:38.840> that<00:04:39.289> I<00:04:39.319> put<00:04:39.530> in<00:04:39.620> ended<00:04:40.009> up<00:04:40.129> in<00:04:40.310> this

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
rise that I put in ended up in this

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.050 
rise that I put in ended up in this
chest<00:04:40.789> so<00:04:41.949> there's<00:04:42.949> this<00:04:43.009> redstone<00:04:43.340> signal<00:04:43.610> it

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
chest so there's this redstone signal it

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.909 
chest so there's this redstone signal it
only<00:04:44.180> gets<00:04:44.300> put<00:04:44.569> out<00:04:44.599> whenever<00:04:45.530> you<00:04:45.680> put<00:04:45.830> an

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
only gets put out whenever you put an

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.490 
only gets put out whenever you put an
ender<00:04:46.159> eye<00:04:46.190> in<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.909> that<00:04:47.720> increment<00:04:48.319> the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
ender eye in and that increment the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.249 
ender eye in and that increment the
scoreboard<00:04:49.009> which<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.430> what<00:04:50.050> affects<00:04:51.050> those

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
scoreboard which is what affects those

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.879 
scoreboard which is what affects those
wireless<00:04:51.830> receivers<00:04:52.720> so<00:04:53.720> that's<00:04:54.139> okay<00:04:54.710> that's

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
wireless receivers so that's okay that's

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.080 
wireless receivers so that's okay that's
how<00:04:55.069> that<00:04:55.460> works

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
how that works

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.869 
how that works
yeah<00:04:56.449> I<00:04:56.479> cheated<00:04:56.780> quite<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.169> bit<00:04:57.470> with<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.879> with

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
yeah I cheated quite a bit with the with

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.120 
yeah I cheated quite a bit with the with
the<00:04:59.000> amount<00:04:59.240> of<00:04:59.360> space<00:04:59.830> similarly<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.860> cheated

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
the amount of space similarly I cheated

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.469 
the amount of space similarly I cheated
a<00:05:01.250> lot<00:05:01.400> with<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.580> amount<00:05:01.759> of<00:05:01.819> space<00:05:01.970> on<00:05:02.120> the

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
a lot with the amount of space on the

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.779 
a lot with the amount of space on the
comparator<00:05:02.870> so<00:05:03.229> what<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:04.099> comparator<00:05:04.580> does

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
comparator so what the comparator does

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.480 
comparator so what the comparator does
in<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.389> mega<00:05:05.539> bloks<00:05:05.870> is<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:07.250> kind<00:05:07.460> of

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
in the mega bloks is it kind of

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.159 
in the mega bloks is it kind of
reimplemented<00:05:07.970> some<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.449> some<00:05:09.050> of<00:05:09.110> the

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
reimplemented some of the some of the

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.320 
reimplemented some of the some of the
features<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.740> actual<00:05:10.130> comparator<00:05:10.639> block

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
features of the actual comparator block

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.629 
features of the actual comparator block
but<00:05:12.289> without<00:05:12.500> using<00:05:12.680> any<00:05:12.919> comparators<00:05:13.430> on<00:05:13.550> the

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
but without using any comparators on the

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:14.830 
but without using any comparators on the
inside<00:05:13.909> and<00:05:14.120> I'll<00:05:14.180> show<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.360> in<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.630> bit

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
inside and I'll show you in a bit

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.020 
inside and I'll show you in a bit
what's<00:05:15.259> on<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.470> inside<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.979> it's<00:05:16.190> kind<00:05:16.909> of<00:05:16.940> a

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
what's on the inside and it's kind of a

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.559 
what's on the inside and it's kind of a
mess<00:05:17.240> but<00:05:17.930> so<00:05:18.440> for<00:05:18.620> instance<00:05:18.949> if<00:05:19.130> I<00:05:19.479> put<00:05:20.479> an

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
mess but so for instance if I put an

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.209 
mess but so for instance if I put an
input<00:05:20.990> signal<00:05:21.139> here<00:05:21.620> there's<00:05:21.860> going<00:05:21.949> to<00:05:22.009> be<00:05:22.099> an

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
input signal here there's going to be an

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:24.309 
input signal here there's going to be an
output<00:05:22.340> signal<00:05:22.849> and<00:05:23.030> we<00:05:23.330> can<00:05:23.479> see<00:05:23.659> the<00:05:23.900> pistons

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
output signal and we can see the pistons

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.040 
output signal and we can see the pistons
extended<00:05:24.969> this<00:05:25.969> let's<00:05:26.360> see<00:05:26.509> where<00:05:26.719> is<00:05:26.840> this

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
extended this let's see where is this

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.670 
extended this let's see where is this
this<00:05:27.770> is<00:05:28.039> one<00:05:28.580> two<00:05:28.940> three<00:05:29.449> four<00:05:29.840> five<00:05:30.319> blocks

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
this is one two three four five blocks

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.890 
this is one two three four five blocks
away<00:05:30.889> if<00:05:31.310> I<00:05:32.000> have<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:33.050> signal<00:05:34.389> two<00:05:35.389> blocks<00:05:35.659> away

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
away if I have a signal two blocks away

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.920 
away if I have a signal two blocks away
from<00:05:36.259> the<00:05:36.889> comparator<00:05:37.580> here<00:05:37.610> then<00:05:38.389> the

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
from the comparator here then the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.779 
from the comparator here then the
outputs<00:05:39.289> gonna<00:05:39.500> be<00:05:39.590> off<00:05:39.740> because<00:05:40.069> the<00:05:40.580> size

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
outputs gonna be off because the size

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.930 
outputs gonna be off because the size
signal<00:05:41.330> is<00:05:41.479> greater<00:05:41.810> than<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.669> then<00:05:43.669> the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
signal is greater than the then the

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.180 
signal is greater than the then the
input<00:05:44.569> signal<00:05:44.870> from<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.050> back<00:05:45.259> so<00:05:45.949> let's<00:05:45.979> say

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
input signal from the back so let's say

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.800 
input signal from the back so let's say
this<00:05:46.279> was<00:05:46.370> five<00:05:46.669> if<00:05:46.969> I<00:05:47.090> put<00:05:47.330> it<00:05:47.419> at<00:05:47.509> the<00:05:47.599> same

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
this was five if I put it at the same

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.570 
this was five if I put it at the same
distance<00:05:48.020> you'll<00:05:48.949> notice<00:05:49.159> if<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:49.310> take<00:05:49.490> this

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
distance you'll notice if I take this

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.269 
distance you'll notice if I take this
away<00:05:49.819> the<00:05:50.150> output<00:05:50.870> turns<00:05:50.990> back<00:05:51.199> on<00:05:51.319> one<00:05:52.039> two

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 
away the output turns back on one two

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.100 
away the output turns back on one two
three<00:05:52.729> four<00:05:53.029> five<00:05:53.389> who<00:05:53.569> put<00:05:53.779> at<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:53.960> same

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
three four five who put at the same

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.260 
three four five who put at the same
distance<00:05:54.460> it's<00:05:55.460> going<00:05:55.580> to<00:05:55.639> turn<00:05:55.789> that<00:05:55.969> signal

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
distance it's going to turn that signal

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.529 
distance it's going to turn that signal
back<00:05:56.300> off<00:05:56.599> if<00:05:57.169> I<00:05:57.289> put<00:05:57.500> it<00:05:57.590> one<00:05:57.800> more<00:05:58.009> away<00:05:58.539> then

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
back off if I put it one more away then

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.050 
back off if I put it one more away then
it's<00:05:59.750> gonna<00:05:59.960> be<00:06:00.050> ko<00:06:00.319> back<00:06:00.469> on<00:06:00.680> because<00:06:01.219> the

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
it's gonna be ko back on because the

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.610 
it's gonna be ko back on because the
signal<00:06:02.449> the<00:06:02.630> input<00:06:02.870> signal<00:06:03.139> from<00:06:03.229> the<00:06:03.319> back<00:06:03.469> of

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
signal the input signal from the back of

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.019 
signal the input signal from the back of
the<00:06:03.680> comparator<00:06:04.130> is<00:06:04.310> greater<00:06:04.610> than<00:06:04.729> the<00:06:04.819> input

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 
the comparator is greater than the input

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:06.730 
the comparator is greater than the input
signal<00:06:05.330> from<00:06:05.449> the<00:06:05.539> side<00:06:05.719> so<00:06:06.199> this<00:06:06.289> works<00:06:06.590> for

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
signal from the side so this works for

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.100 
signal from the side so this works for
any<00:06:06.949> signal<00:06:07.550> strength<00:06:07.819> and<00:06:08.180> whatever<00:06:08.719> and

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
any signal strength and whatever and

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.550 
any signal strength and whatever and
both<00:06:09.289> the<00:06:09.440> back<00:06:09.590> on<00:06:09.740> the<00:06:09.830> side<00:06:10.009> and<00:06:11.409> okay<00:06:12.409> well

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
both the back on the side and okay well

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.680 
both the back on the side and okay well
let<00:06:12.650> me<00:06:12.680> just<00:06:12.889> show<00:06:13.009> you<00:06:13.069> how<00:06:13.940> I<00:06:13.969> accomplished

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
let me just show you how I accomplished

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.709 
let me just show you how I accomplished
that<00:06:15.009> it's<00:06:16.009> a<00:06:16.699> lot<00:06:17.120> it's<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.330> little<00:06:17.479> bit<00:06:17.569> of<00:06:17.659> a

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
that it's a lot it's a little bit of a

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.140 
that it's a lot it's a little bit of a
mess<00:06:18.190> there's<00:06:19.190> kind<00:06:19.550> of<00:06:19.610> a<00:06:19.699> lot<00:06:19.819> of<00:06:19.849> redstone

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
mess there's kind of a lot of redstone

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.499 
mess there's kind of a lot of redstone
here<00:06:20.539> it<00:06:21.110> turns<00:06:21.349> out<00:06:21.529> to<00:06:22.090> compare<00:06:23.090> signal

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
here it turns out to compare signal

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.899 
here it turns out to compare signal
strengths<00:06:23.960> without<00:06:24.770> using<00:06:25.219> any<00:06:25.340> comparators

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
strengths without using any comparators

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:29.140 
strengths without using any comparators
is<00:06:27.039> well<00:06:28.039> this<00:06:28.400> is<00:06:28.580> probably<00:06:28.669> not<00:06:28.880> the<00:06:28.940> most

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
is well this is probably not the most

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.730 
is well this is probably not the most
efficient<00:06:29.509> way<00:06:29.569> to<00:06:29.659> possible<00:06:30.289> to<00:06:30.380> do<00:06:30.469> it<00:06:30.590> but

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
efficient way to possible to do it but

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.640 
efficient way to possible to do it but
it's<00:06:31.779> it's<00:06:32.779> it's<00:06:33.080> the<00:06:33.169> best<00:06:33.199> way<00:06:33.469> I<00:06:33.500> could

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
it's it's it's the best way I could

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.870 
it's it's it's the best way I could
think<00:06:33.770> of<00:06:33.979> to<00:06:34.099> do<00:06:34.190> it<00:06:34.340> with<00:06:34.759> this

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
think of to do it with this

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.689 
think of to do it with this
configuration<00:06:35.120> so<00:06:36.130> basically<00:06:37.130> that<00:06:37.399> you<00:06:37.550> have

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
configuration so basically that you have

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:39.579 
configuration so basically that you have
to<00:06:37.880> check<00:06:38.180> for<00:06:38.419> each<00:06:38.539> signal<00:06:39.080> strength<00:06:39.440> and

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:39.589 
to check for each signal strength and

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:40.820 
to check for each signal strength and
the<00:06:39.649> inputs<00:06:39.949> each<00:06:40.279> of<00:06:40.430> signal

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
the inputs each of signal

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.490 
the inputs each of signal
strengthen<00:06:41.130> the<00:06:41.190> output<00:06:41.550> and<00:06:42.290> there's<00:06:43.290> a<00:06:43.350> lot

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
strengthen the output and there's a lot

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.980 
strengthen the output and there's a lot
of<00:06:43.560> and<00:06:43.740> gates<00:06:43.980> and<00:06:44.250> and<00:06:44.670> wires<00:06:45.270> to<00:06:45.630> just<00:06:45.840> get

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
of and gates and and wires to just get

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.720 
of and gates and and wires to just get
all<00:06:46.200> the<00:06:46.290> signals<00:06:46.590> around<00:06:49.280> yeah<00:06:50.280> this<00:06:50.520> one<00:06:50.700> is

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
all the signals around yeah this one is

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.640 
all the signals around yeah this one is
I<00:06:51.180> treat<00:06:51.510> it<00:06:51.600> even<00:06:51.840> more<00:06:51.990> because<00:06:52.170> it's<00:06:52.500> even

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
I treat it even more because it's even

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.970 
I treat it even more because it's even
wider<00:06:52.920> than<00:06:53.160> 16<00:06:53.550> blocks<00:06:53.880> but<00:06:54.810> yeah<00:06:55.800> what<00:06:55.920> are

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
wider than 16 blocks but yeah what are

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.550 
wider than 16 blocks but yeah what are
you<00:06:56.010> gonna<00:06:56.130> do<00:06:56.780> so<00:06:57.780> that's<00:06:58.350> how<00:06:58.500> the

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
you gonna do so that's how the

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.780 
you gonna do so that's how the
comparator<00:06:59.010> works<00:07:00.680> it<00:07:01.680> doesn't<00:07:02.010> it<00:07:02.460> doesn't

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
comparator works it doesn't it doesn't

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.200 
comparator works it doesn't it doesn't
have<00:07:03.000> the<00:07:03.950> the<00:07:04.950> output<00:07:05.190> signal<00:07:05.790> strength<00:07:06.060> is

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
have the the output signal strength is

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.610 
have the the output signal strength is
always<00:07:06.360> going<00:07:06.510> to<00:07:06.570> be<00:07:06.660> 15<00:07:06.990> no<00:07:07.140> matter<00:07:07.290> what<00:07:07.470> the

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
always going to be 15 no matter what the

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.190 
always going to be 15 no matter what the
input<00:07:07.740> signal<00:07:08.280> inside<00:07:08.580> signal<00:07:08.940> are<00:07:09.200> it

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
input signal inside signal are it

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.420 
input signal inside signal are it
doesn't<00:07:10.500> have<00:07:10.590> subtraction<00:07:11.010> mode<00:07:11.310> or

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
doesn't have subtraction mode or

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.240 
doesn't have subtraction mode or
anything<00:07:11.610> it<00:07:11.850> just<00:07:11.880> has<00:07:12.180> that<00:07:12.420> one<00:07:13.250> compare

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
anything it just has that one compare

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
anything it just has that one compare
comparator<00:07:15.240> mode<00:07:15.560> compare<00:07:16.560> mode<00:07:16.710> I<00:07:16.740> guess<00:07:17.270> but

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
comparator mode compare mode I guess but

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.790 
comparator mode compare mode I guess but
that's<00:07:18.510> all<00:07:18.660> there<00:07:18.780> is<00:07:18.900> the<00:07:19.080> comparator<00:07:19.500> so

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
that's all there is the comparator so

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.800 
that's all there is the comparator so
there<00:07:19.920> you<00:07:19.980> go<00:07:20.130> episode<00:07:20.640> 4<00:07:20.880> of<00:07:20.910> Mega<00:07:21.270> Bloks<00:07:21.390> the
