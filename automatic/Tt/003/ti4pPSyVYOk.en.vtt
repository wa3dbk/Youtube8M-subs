because it's not it says it's volt on
here<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.159> more<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.400> us<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.670> yellow<00:01:14.939> it's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
here but it's more of us to yellow it's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.700 
here but it's more of us to yellow it's
not<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:15.990> cold<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:18.080> it's<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
not really cold so it's going to have a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.780 
not really cold so it's going to have a
black<00:01:20.070> constructor<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.909> whole<00:01:21.030> shoe<00:01:22.790> white

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
black constructor the whole shoe white

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.560 
black constructor the whole shoe white
bottom<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.229> blackout<00:01:25.650> salon<00:01:26.100> there

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
bottom and then a blackout salon there

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.840 
bottom and then a blackout salon there

so the swoosh is also is kind of
transparent<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.840> through<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.799> i

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.190 
yellow it says bolt so it seemed to have
that<00:02:02.479> it's<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> teal<00:02:03.990> blue<00:02:04.320> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> me

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
that it's like a teal blue going to me

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.779 
that it's like a teal blue going to me
then<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> kind<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.590> gets<00:02:07.920> into<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.340> green

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
then it kind of gets into the green

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.770 
then it kind of gets into the green
sorta<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.679> its<00:02:10.920> program

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
sorta and then its program

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.580 
sorta and then its program
so<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:14.000> 713<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.840> colorway<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.500> would

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
so the 713 is a colorway is you would

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.660 
so the 713 is a colorway is you would
have<00:02:15.709> be<00:02:15.770> looking<00:02:16.040> for<00:02:16.220> if<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.430> want<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670

I don't even know I've seen him there

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.490 
I don't even know I've seen him there
the<00:02:25.490> whole<00:02:25.580> time<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.300> then<00:02:27.170> they<00:02:27.260> have<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
the whole time so and then they have the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.620 
the whole time so and then they have the
all<00:02:27.620> black<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.310> like<00:02:28.400> black<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.819> gray<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.390> I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
all black it's like black and gray so I

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.750 
all black it's like black and gray so I
chose<00:02:30.620> these<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.160> because<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.430> got<00:02:31.580> him<00:02:31.700> under

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
chose these just because I got him under

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.990 
chose these just because I got him under
retail<00:02:32.030> they<00:02:32.420> were<00:02:32.780> sold<00:02:33.020> out<00:02:33.819> well<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:34.850> am<00:02:34.940> I

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
retail they were sold out well I am I

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.990 
retail they were sold out well I am I
going<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.209> pass<00:02:35.330> up<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.819> pretty<00:02:37.819> a

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
going to pass up on that so pretty a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.540 
going to pass up on that so pretty a
pretty<00:02:38.540> good<00:02:38.870> pickup<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.500> think<00:02:39.770> another

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
pretty good pickup I think another

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.910 
pretty good pickup I think another
bright<00:02:40.970> color<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.450> add<00:02:41.630> along<00:02:42.440> with<00:02:42.560> my<00:02:42.650> atomic

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
bright color to add along with my atomic

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.229 
bright color to add along with my atomic
reds<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:44.410> lemon<00:02:45.410> twist<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.850> these<00:02:46.970> are<00:02:47.030> just

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
reds and lemon twist so these are just

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.970 
reds and lemon twist so these are just
something<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.810> guess<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:48.350> are<00:02:48.440> every<00:02:48.650> once<00:02:48.830> in

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
something I guess you are every once in

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.479 
something I guess you are every once in
a<00:02:49.010> while<00:02:49.100> just<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.630> catch<00:02:50.630> people's<00:02:50.989> attention

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
a while just to catch people's attention

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.030 
a while just to catch people's attention
but<00:02:52.489> pretty<00:02:53.000> sick<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.480> was<00:02:53.630> expecting<00:02:53.959> not<00:02:54.830> that

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
but pretty sick I was expecting not that

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.059 
but pretty sick I was expecting not that
great<00:02:55.310> out<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.330> him<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:57.170> quality<00:02:57.530> on<00:02:57.560> it's<00:02:57.830> not

bad<00:02:59.500> it's<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.709> canvas<00:03:01.160> but<00:03:02.120> it's<00:03:02.300> kind<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:02.900> like

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
bad it's a canvas but it's kind of like

a softer canvas it's more cushion it's

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.340 
a softer canvas it's more cushion it's
not<00:03:04.970> like<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.269> other<00:03:05.390> hard<00:03:05.690> canvas<00:03:06.050> is<00:03:06.200> this

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
not like the other hard canvas is this

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
not like the other hard canvas is this
oh<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.530> not<00:03:07.370> too<00:03:07.430> bad<00:03:08.769> decent<00:03:09.769> quality<00:03:09.920> on<00:03:10.250> them
