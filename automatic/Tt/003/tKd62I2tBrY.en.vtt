hopefully Apple does add more of those
in<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.770> future<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.670> might<00:01:55.850> be<00:01:56.030> wondering<00:01:56.240> why

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
in the future you might be wondering why

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.440 
in the future you might be wondering why
it<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:57.320> tall<00:01:57.590> part<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:58.220> is<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.180> 3

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
it is so tall part of that is the 3

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.860 
it is so tall part of that is the 3
terabyte<00:02:00.020> hard<00:02:00.500> drive<00:02:00.770> inside<00:02:01.400> here<00:02:01.880> but<00:02:02.600> also

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
terabyte hard drive inside here but also

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.440 
terabyte hard drive inside here but also
by<00:02:03.409> giving<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:03.979> height<00:02:04.280> apple<00:02:05.060> says<00:02:05.270> that

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
by giving it this height apple says that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.660 
by giving it this height apple says that
the<00:02:05.540> antennas<00:02:06.080> have<00:02:06.260> much<00:02:06.560> more<00:02:06.979> room<00:02:07.370> and

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
the antennas have much more room and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.669 
the antennas have much more room and
they<00:02:08.030> can<00:02:08.179> send<00:02:08.570> out<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.840> signal<00:02:09.019> at<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> much

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
they can send out the signal at a much

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:18.130 
they can send out the signal at a much
better<00:02:10.130> rate

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.839 

so<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.260> was<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.590> quick<00:02:19.860> unboxing<00:02:20.069> we're

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
so that was just a quick unboxing we're

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.820 
so that was just a quick unboxing we're
going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> take<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.270> look<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.349> action

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
going to take a look of this in action

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.300 
going to take a look of this in action
in<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.700> future<00:02:24.060> review<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.770> Apple's
