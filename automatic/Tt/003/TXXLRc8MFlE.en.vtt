 Strengthens his power to do 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.180
 This must be a special person. 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.120

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:44.980

 It's those who will have to fill pitting know how to see it. 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.280
 So that I am not in ability 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:19.930
 You're the maker of this country right now . 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.470

 I'm a religious leader. 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.710
 uh 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:39.350
 But I did not go to these people . 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.830
 People who are now leaders 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:48.560
 I went to see these people now 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:53.570
 I can not do it in two areas, so these people do not have the power to do it. 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:58.880
 Well, that's what it is. It's not about blaming them. 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.950
 Uh, so haejuji such a thing at a time like this it should not you now, in the middle 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.370
 I did not 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:08.090
 When I find these people, they answer everything to God every month. 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:12.170
 It is evil to hang on to God as an excuse 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:17.620
 Buddha reminds him that some monthly air reminds me that every month the new 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.620
 What is it all to you? 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.810
 It will yeoseo kneeling people become leaders 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.810

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.130
 The people who have the leadership gotta be resolved from a knee kkulneun 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:38.960
 If the leader is knee, then the people should be dragged to the party . 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.190
 If the leader kneels at me, I will let the people kneel down 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.190
 It means dragging. 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.620
 That 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:54.129
 If these are the people who will lead the interrogators 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:57.309
 I 'm not kneeling at your opponent. You should not kneel down anywhere. 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:06:03.129
 Uh, be that big . 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:09.189
 Even though there was a time to lead these things, I did not lead them 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:10.620
 Uh That's why today's leaders parts Jack yoreotge doebeorin 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:15.710
 uh 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.710
 Malyijyo the leaders will force members to pray 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.110
 That little word things so little toad forward control factor in time a little late 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.250
 Even 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.170
 These intellectuals should be able to discern these things properly and how to 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.590
 Will we support 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:38.330
 Who Either way forward once the President 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:44.720
 It's not like this yesterday's military, but the military in this country has to get up. 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:49.910
 Ministers of countries which together control a Brahmin god unspoilt intellectuals 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:56.860
 Yireongeo have caused a military force me to do this right leaders Map 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.860
 You need to support the wall to lead this country. 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:04.129
 When these people support the power, the person who has opened the hand leads out. 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:12.720
 If you do not have this power 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:17.400
 No one can go 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:23.520
 Who is the president whether any power in prayer is this place's fry 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.300
 People who do not know what they want and what they want 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.080
 do 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:35.099
 This is to fill the malyijyo is not nobody 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:39.199
 When you come down, even the Ugg people can listen to the president yet hard to blame 

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:39.199
 This is where you have to come down 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.940
 This is a very important point. 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:53.490
 That's why I release it now. 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.490
 Be a child .
