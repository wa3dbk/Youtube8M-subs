through<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> rev<00:00:51.360> range<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.080> one<00:00:52.290> tends

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
through the rev range but this one tends

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.890 
through the rev range but this one tends
to<00:00:53.100> punch<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.030> back<00:00:54.330> because<00:00:54.750> of

to punch you more in the back because of

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.740 
to punch you more in the back because of
the<00:00:55.019> turbo<00:00:55.640> some<00:00:56.640> people<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the turbo some people like that but the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
purists might not but still it's a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.920 
purists might not but still it's a
fairly<00:01:02.010> flexible<00:01:02.340> engine<00:01:03.030> when<00:01:03.450> you're<00:01:03.629> not

putting too much pressure on the

manual gearbox option instead it gets a

a bit of a Maga RS sort of sound to it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.179 
a bit of a Maga RS sort of sound to it
and<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> fairly<00:01:21.840> rapid

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
and it's fairly rapid

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
the dual-clutch unit does a fairly good

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.789 
the dual-clutch unit does a fairly good
job<00:01:25.710> around<00:01:26.549> town<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.149> at<00:01:27.840> lower<00:01:28.079> speeds<00:01:28.560> or

with lower pressure on the throttle but

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.899 
with lower pressure on the throttle but
it<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> little<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:32.069> overzealous<00:01:32.369> in

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
it can be a little bit overzealous in

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.520 
it can be a little bit overzealous in
its<00:01:33.149> actions<00:01:33.630> when<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> put<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.259> foot<00:01:34.469> down

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.999 
its actions when you put your foot down
and<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.579> overrule<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.329> which<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:37.469> be<00:01:37.530> really

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and can overrule you which can be really

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.149 
and can overrule you which can be really
annoying<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:40.049> new<00:01:40.259> model<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.709> lighter<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
annoying the new model is lighter and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.919 
annoying the new model is lighter and
more<00:01:41.369> fuel<00:01:41.850> efficient<00:01:42.270> than<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.630> car<00:01:42.810> it

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
more fuel efficient than the car it

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.800 
more fuel efficient than the car it

driving is built on the sport chassis

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.429 
driving is built on the sport chassis
which<00:01:50.159> means<00:01:50.429> it's<00:01:51.209> a<00:01:51.329> lot<00:01:51.509> softer<00:01:51.810> than<00:01:52.289> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
which means it's a lot softer than the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.469 
which means it's a lot softer than the
cup<00:01:52.649> version<00:01:53.159> which<00:01:53.549> will<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.849> in<00:01:53.969> Australia

cup version which will get in Australia

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050

which<00:01:54.599> promises<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.379> a<00:01:55.590> fair<00:01:56.459> bit<00:01:56.640> sharper

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.399 
which promises to be a fair bit sharper
through<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> corners<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.200> good

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
through the corners which is good

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.850
