and<00:04:13.920> then<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.430> go<00:04:14.579> ahead<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.970> strain<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.950> now

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
and then you go ahead and strain it now

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.849 
and then you go ahead and strain it now
um<00:04:17.609> here's<00:04:18.479> an<00:04:18.600> optional<00:04:19.049> step<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.560> this<00:04:19.709> is

to<00:05:48.870> that<00:05:49.050> and<00:05:49.289> I<00:05:49.830> added<00:05:50.039> a<00:05:50.370> bit<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.580> coconut<00:05:50.909> oil

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
to that and I added a bit of coconut oil

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.969 
to that and I added a bit of coconut oil
because<00:05:51.690> my<00:05:51.810> hair<00:05:52.020> responds<00:05:52.349> really<00:05:52.560> well<00:05:52.680> to

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
because my hair responds really well to

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.339 
because my hair responds really well to
that<00:05:53.129> so<00:05:53.819> that's<00:05:54.029> why<00:05:54.300> this<00:05:54.360> looks<00:05:54.990> a<00:05:55.110> little

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
that so that's why this looks a little

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.100 
that so that's why this looks a little
bit<00:05:55.710> sort<00:05:56.129> of<00:05:56.219> cloudy<00:05:56.580> on<00:05:56.969> the<00:05:57.180> top<00:05:57.449> part<00:05:57.930> in<00:05:58.020> my

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
bit sort of cloudy on the top part in my

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.689 
bit sort of cloudy on the top part in my
nails<00:05:58.349> and<00:05:58.589> getting<00:05:58.770> my<00:05:58.860> manicure<00:05:59.279> down<00:05:59.460> today

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
nails and getting my manicure down today

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.610 
nails and getting my manicure down today
also<00:06:00.029> but<00:06:00.690> that's<00:06:00.839> why<00:06:00.990> it<00:06:01.110> looks<00:06:01.319> a<00:06:01.440> little

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
also but that's why it looks a little

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.010 
also but that's why it looks a little
bit<00:06:01.889> cloudy<00:06:02.310> on<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.759> top<00:06:03.000> here<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:03.479> that's

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
bit cloudy on the top here and that's

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.740 
bit cloudy on the top here and that's
because<00:06:04.289> um<00:06:05.240> with<00:06:07.159> coconut<00:06:08.159> oil<00:06:08.250> especially

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
because um with coconut oil especially

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.510 
because um with coconut oil especially
once<00:06:09.750> it<00:06:10.020> reaches<00:06:10.439> a<00:06:10.469> cool<00:06:10.740> temperature<00:06:10.979> it

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
once it reaches a cool temperature it

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.240 
once it reaches a cool temperature it
starts<00:06:11.819> to<00:06:11.939> solidify<00:06:12.300> a<00:06:12.629> little<00:06:12.990> bit<00:06:13.199> and<00:06:13.589> so

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
starts to solidify a little bit and so

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.399 
starts to solidify a little bit and so
that's<00:06:14.400> what<00:06:14.580> this<00:06:14.729> is<00:06:14.789> when<00:06:15.629> this<00:06:15.839> sits<00:06:16.169> out

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
that's what this is when this sits out

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.170 
that's what this is when this sits out
