00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
straight tool or demonstrating we're

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.079 
straight tool or demonstrating we're
using<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.320> bent<00:00:13.590> one<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:14.429> get<00:00:14.700> around<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
using a bent one to get around the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.090 
using a bent one to get around the
entrance<00:00:15.509> hole<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.410> we're<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:17.010> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
entrance hole and we're going to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.029 
entrance hole and we're going to
demonstrate<00:00:17.279> how<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:18.660> smoothly<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.770> tool

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
demonstrate how this smoothly this tool

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.609 
demonstrate how this smoothly this tool
takes<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.640> wood<00:00:21.570> out<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.109> hollow<00:00:22.320> form

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
takes the wood out of this hollow form

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.500 
takes the wood out of this hollow form
using<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.609> elbow<00:00:23.910> tool<00:00:26.000> this<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> wood

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
using the elbow tool this is the wood

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960 
using the elbow tool this is the wood
cut<00:00:27.750> tool<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.460> mounted<00:00:29.640> in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
cut tool and we now have it mounted in
