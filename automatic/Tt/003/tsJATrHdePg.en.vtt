yellow orange green red and blue so with

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.480 
yellow orange green red and blue so with
this<00:01:17.659> type<00:01:17.869> of<00:01:17.899> puzzle<00:01:18.139> sense<00:01:18.590> is<00:01:18.770> really<00:01:19.219> cut

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
this type of puzzle sense is really cut

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.129 
this type of puzzle sense is really cut
to<00:01:19.700> initially<00:01:19.969> on<00:01:20.210> two<00:01:20.359> different<00:01:20.569> angles<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
to initially on two different angles the

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:23.590 
to initially on two different angles the
windmill<00:01:21.530> cube<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:21.950> cut<00:01:22.189> on<00:01:22.429> an<00:01:23.209> angle<00:01:23.329> from

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
windmill cube is cut on an angle from

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.300 
windmill cube is cut on an angle from
the<00:01:23.689> corner<00:01:24.109> at<00:01:24.200> approximately<00:01:24.709> 60<00:01:25.009> degrees

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
the corner at approximately 60 degrees

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.120 
the corner at approximately 60 degrees
the<00:01:25.850> fisher<00:01:26.359> cube<00:01:26.600> is<00:01:26.749> cut<00:01:26.929> on<00:01:27.049> an<00:01:27.139> angle<00:01:27.229> at<00:01:27.530> 45

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
the fisher cube is cut on an angle at 45

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.109 
the fisher cube is cut on an angle at 45
so<00:01:28.999> from<00:01:29.719> this<00:01:29.840> point<00:01:29.959> when<00:01:30.380> it's<00:01:30.530> solved<00:01:31.310> you

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
so from this point when it's solved you

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.520 
so from this point when it's solved you
can't<00:01:32.329> really<00:01:32.479> turn<00:01:32.719> your<00:01:32.899> layers<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:33.350> what

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
can't really turn your layers so what

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.989 
can't really turn your layers so what
you<00:01:33.649> need<00:01:33.799> to<00:01:33.859> do<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:34.429> actually<00:01:34.759> need<00:01:34.880> to

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
you need to do is you actually need to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.059 
you need to do is you actually need to
change<00:01:35.270> one<00:01:35.659> of<00:01:35.749> the<00:01:35.840> layers<00:01:35.990> by<00:01:36.289> 15<00:01:36.740> degrees

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
change one of the layers by 15 degrees

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.859 
change one of the layers by 15 degrees
by<00:01:37.249> turning<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.639> slightly<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.179> then<00:01:38.270> that

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
by turning it slightly and then that

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.279 
by turning it slightly and then that
will<00:01:39.020> allow<00:01:39.289> you<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.740> rotate<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.490> layers

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
will allow you to rotate the layers

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.480 
will allow you to rotate the layers
here's<00:01:42.289> an<00:01:42.409> example<00:01:42.679> of<00:01:42.889> the<00:01:42.979> rotation<00:01:43.399> of<00:01:43.459> the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
here's an example of the rotation of the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:59.250 
here's an example of the rotation of the
puzzle

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.950 

there<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.470> checkerboard<00:02:01.370> pattern<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.810> as

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
there is a checkerboard pattern so as

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.540 
there is a checkerboard pattern so as
you<00:02:03.140> can<00:02:03.260> tell<00:02:03.440> since<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.070> top<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.400> bottom

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
you can tell since the top and bottom

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.700 
you can tell since the top and bottom
layers<00:02:04.880> are<00:02:05.330> different<00:02:05.870> it<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.410> also<00:02:06.590> a

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
layers are different it is also a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:27.680 
layers are different it is also a
shape-shifting<00:02:07.340> puzzle<00:02:07.700> as<00:02:07.880> well

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.210

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
so if you have any questions about the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.980 
so if you have any questions about the
puzzle<00:02:29.520> please<00:02:29.820> let<00:02:30.030> me<00:02:30.060> know<00:02:30.180> as<00:02:30.510> I'm<00:02:30.780> always
