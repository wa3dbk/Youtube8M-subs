00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.080
 ah 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.390
 do not 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.160
 that I christian on Friday whenever 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.270
 you come for me it's like I'm going to learn I know 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.430
 that I will learn when I am with you 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.840
 because I'm not the most informed 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.310
 in question of the cars but yes that 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.470
 this one we're going to talk about today is 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.779
 nice this pretty pretty municipality 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.720
 that's how it is a truck in some way 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.670
 is from these new urban vehicles of 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.500
 dimensions a little bit reduced with 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.030
 with respect to the big vans to the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.400
 that we are used to 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.830
 in the past a more urban car a lot 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.809
 more versatile and a more agile car much 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.250
 more youthful of course that is the proposal of 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.470
 this vehicle that now adorns the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.629
 cover of our attraction supplement 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.339
 of the day tomorrow everything will be able to see in the 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.650
 social journey will be from today I find 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.440
 that all the movement in the industry 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.030
 of vans and iu de picops and it has 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.830
 gone moving more to this wave more 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.950
 sporty I think that the is already 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.210
 that there was a lot in the USA 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.010
 truckloads no longer no longer it is not so 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.520
 popular we are looking for I believe that already 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.010
 cars a little more aerodynamic 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.260
 others to small is more economical not 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.270
 can you say that 's an expert 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.800
 in seeing I do not know why it's not so much 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.540
 willing to throw me on the floor so that 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.030
 lift somehow him 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.440
 is that you need for example with 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.500
 tones in the car with how many people 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.660
 you're currently one or two when a lot 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.850
 when much this type of vehicle is 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.100
 they faced that if you had a very car 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.590
 big maybe you have up to seven 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.510
 passengers three batteries and always went alone 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.400
 no minivans have been exploring them for 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.770
 a lot of time they were very tools 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.560
 large the suburban that before roe 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.450
 So they went by themselves, not from there that this 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.120
 kind of cars have gradually gone 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.160
 gaining strength they had afterwards a 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.050
 important redesign in terms of 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.540
 paradigm of how many people get on 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.310
 what time loads and most important 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.340
 how much fuel are you consuming 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.020
 to move from one place to another that type 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.759
 of vehicle is not the only car that 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.830
 has this category and yet it is 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.060
 a very new category that we can 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.220
 find there are other exponents like 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.870
 chevrolet tracks that little by little are going 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.280
 gaining ground and make it a great 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.220
 especially they have seen people because 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.780
 being cars a little bit higher than 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.209
 better that you get that feeling of 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.640
 sure that a bump of a cap of 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.140
 that this is not going to be clear to you and 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.150
 I know that people also look a lot 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.960
 the truck because it's people who travel 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.110
 much on reel 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.990
 he moves out of the city that neither 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.340
 talk about this is a mitsubishi like this 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.010
 a van is always going to give you more 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.290
 security that a sedan I handle a sea 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.210
 Chinese and I know it's not the car either 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.820
 ideal for road riding and ni 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.920
 let's talk about them is maximum good that you 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.930
 you see people that even in march like what 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.850
 you mention the smart that you get 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.280
 comment on your cars that focuses a lot 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.650
 in protecting the habitat and going to 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.600
 people who are in the passengers who 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.850
 are inside the car then what 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.250
 better security is not the word in 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.290
 about the systems that the car has 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.450
 or kmart for example is the most car 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.850
 accessible that you can buy in 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.550
 Mexico with air bags and with brakes 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.650
 abs almost all security systems 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.450
 it is fundamental is one to stop you without 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.610
 that gives rap is clear and the other in case 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.920
 that you have an accident when 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.690
 win like that is machine and on the other side 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.880
 What you say about the road is 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.010
 rather the feeling that the car gives you 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.840
 at the time of going you driving you feel 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.880
 a little bit higher the position of 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.170
 handling is a little bit higher and this 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.150
 Help you by Solomon to feel more 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.470
 comfortable clear but you have to say 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.740
 offer 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.420
 which is that of the s so it is for 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.160
 temper an urban theme to be in the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.080
 Mexico City Move you park 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.270
 avoid the bumps they offer you 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.370
 questioned was the configuration of 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.410
 auto is a vehicle a little bit more 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.420
 simple to accommodate in spaces in 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.970
 You actually lose between 15 and 18 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.450
 centimeters against another competitor for 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.930
 example a reform a headquarters of honda and 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.090
 toyota but that's 15 centimeters you 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.530
 They help you park the easier 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.190
 help maneuver if you are everything 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.310
 better by changing lanes good are you 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.160
 bottlenecks 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.470
 it is easier to control it is month is less 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.420
 heavy is a lighter kite is a 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.920
 car that is more efficient in terms of 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.049
 fuel consumption has an engine 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.660
 that only has 148 horsepower 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.430
 that does not have these big and thirsty 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.550
 engines that we are used to before 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.200
 of 200 250 horsepower if it is not 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.430
 more content and like all the time 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.400
 you're at an average speed here 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.560
 in the city of 35 40 kilometers by 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.320
 time the car really is very 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.900
 focused on this type of management 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.460
 tells you a little about the brand as such 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.830
 Mitsubishi how is it sold in Mexico 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.020
 Very well, look at what is right now 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.150
 a part of complete renovation of the 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.860
 product portfolio they spent a lot 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.010
 already with him with cars they had and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.110
 more than 3 4 up to 5 in your market 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.640
 with the same with the same generation and 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.140
 now they have completely renewed the 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.150
 product portfolio this we are 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.590
 seeing not exactly in the most recent 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.840
 generation and the previous generation of 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.760
 outlander this front that has the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.830
 truck is a shark front is 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.200
 very connected with what we knew in 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.570
 the lancer evo a lancer that was one of 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.490
 the most popular citizens of 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.560
 market segment is ohlander that 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.690
 it was also and now they are arriving 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.430
 the new products as asx they use 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.120
 the cover that are not I repeat that they are 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.270
 cars 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.710
 most innovative in terms of systems 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.600
 of infotainment screens 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.840
 touch all connectivity theme 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.790
 of bluetooth and this whole thing is 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.890
 does not have gps I think it should not take 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.540
 it is a first version which is 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.950
 presents in our country clear little to 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.530
 little as they are growing they are bringing us 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.000
 more more versions so I want to talk about 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.320
 others as we have in supplement 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.360
 quickly because 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.610
 the time presses the first one arrives the 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.800
 first plug- in hybrid in our 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.420
 country in case you bring it in your course as 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.070
 this gasoline you put it with 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.630
 any car that also has a motor 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.160
 electric that is recharged with the 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.530
 braking but that you can like your 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.190
 cell phone connect in your house 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.160
 and in a time with a good connection of 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.470
 230 volts of four and a half hours 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.750
 you have the load well and quite 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.490
 important because this car is not only 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.180
 a more efficient car but more powerful 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.770
 it's a sports car and it's a car that 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.090
 plug in if we are living in the future 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.530
 my dear Christian 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.150
 I thank you very much as always
