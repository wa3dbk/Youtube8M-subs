00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.590
 Hi girls 

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:11.810
 so today I find you for 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.860
 a little four and a half radios for my 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.380
 daily makeup 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.140
 so we start with the corrector 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.359
 super you are 24 hours of maybelline that 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.929
 I apply to my imperfections but 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:27.640
 redness and my dark circles and then I 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.640
 give up with my little blender 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.300
 we continue with the pure foundation 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.039
 light 2 at yves rock I apply 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.050
 with my blender doing small 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.719
 points is a little bit everywhere so that 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.980
 the stomp to I am easier this background 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.930
 complexion is not very high 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.250
 coverage and that's what I like 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.250
 when it starts to get hot 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.870
 then I take the same point of 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.879
 themes still from yves rock but 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.670
 a darker shade that I use a 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.899
 been to do my contouring which you 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.210
 see I make small dots at 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.519
 level of my bone I find that a lot 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.650
 easier with foundation and 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.689
 it's much more natural in my opinion 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.700
 than with powder and so then 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.619
 gelin stop with my blender then at 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.070
 finger for a more blurred effect and more 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.070
 natural 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.590
 then we continue with the miss pencil 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.950
 helen hunt ashen blond to do my 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.950
 eyebrows 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.610
 then we go to the eyes and I apply 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.610
 the base of urban decay 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.020
 in the year kid 2 with the lighthouse 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.620
 shop lobby that I apply on any 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.620
 my eyelid 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.800
 and then by snakebyte I'm applying a 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.540
 outer corner so very blurry and I 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.540
 goes up a little in the hollow 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.890
 can I fade 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.370
 then I take little title that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.130
 I apply in outer corner really in 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.540
 doing a little v going up 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.540
 slightly in the hollow 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.390
 and taken up the busted and I put a 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.770
 lower lashes 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.890
 annie adding a little bit of shops 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.840
 hall then we go swing so for this 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.410
 if I use the fossil facts of 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.330
 maybelline 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.910
 so I applied it by making little ones 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.900
 zigzag at the root and an insistent well 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.900
 on the outer corner 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.540
 and we continue with the vertigo volume of 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.959
 yves rock that I apply the same 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.959
 way 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.170
 so here is the result I also 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.030
 add a line of eye liner then 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.500
 I then applied kohl pencil 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.170
 at sephora of a manikin 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.560
 so it's a beige pencil to open 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.560
 the look 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.480
 and that's the result so it's a 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.680
 makeup in nude tones for all 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.760
 the days I find it really is 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.760
 very good and easy to achieve 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.049
 then we finish the theme with the powder 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.629
 from home make up for ever that I apply 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.030
 only on the zone t1 fades a little 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.650
 on the cheeks we see that it makes too much 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.799
 of color differences and for me 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.709
 give a little ny go and now 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:48.599
 we go to hair so I untie my 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:52.170
 mop I apply the protector of 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:57.239
 heat from franck provost so on 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:01.340
 all but game length mails next 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.340
 my hair with a comb to a big one 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.530
 then I'm going to buckle them with the iron to 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.209
 buckle the mark because theirs so it's 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.980
 very simple you just take a wick 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.780
 more or less fluffy fine I alternate 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.359
 gross his films for a more rendering 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.829
 natural and I also alter the side one 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.930
 times right once left to 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.440
 once again made a lot more 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.440
 natural 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.850
 I'm waiting for ten seconds 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.569
 and then I release and actually like that 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.569
 for the whole head 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.650
 m 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.320
 m 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.320
 1 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.860
 then to feed and give a little 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.560
 more shine to my hair 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.200
 I use a repair serum from the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.000
 brand and ndola that I apply on everything 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.110
 but length so there is really needed 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.970
 of a very small hazelnut and that's the 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.710
 result I also wanted to tell you that 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.720
 my shop and online I will put you 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.350
