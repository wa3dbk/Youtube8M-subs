00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.700
 hello to all my friends who are well again today 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.820
 thanks in stages 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.200
 we will prepare a very easy and soft one 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.310
 Orange cake 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.440
 first we will sink to 350 watts in 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.870
 microwave the butter in the jug 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.300
 micro plus and transfer it to one 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.750
 bowl mix ice at this point 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.770
 add two eggs 150 g of sugar 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.930
 caster and then we will also add 4 tablespoons 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.690
 of orange juice obtained 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.450
 naturally squeezing oranges with 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.220
 citrus tupper insignia and at the end 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.170
 we will also combine a couple of tablespoons of 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.600
 orange liqueur to give that touch 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.610
 alcohol to our sweet we mix well 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.710
 all with a technical whip and after 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.280
 having obtained a homogeneous compound but 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.830
 liquid we will combine the flour about 200 g of 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.600
 flour already mixed with a teaspoon 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.460
 of baking powder 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.890
 of course remember to sift it 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.619
 with size and spread tupper because vi 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.290
 will solve and eliminate all the lumps 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.929
 of the flour after obtaining a 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.210
 soft and homogeneous mixture and we take 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.759
 a round silicone mold and before 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.500
 to pour the mixture into the mold 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.850
 we pass our silicone under 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.670
 cold water is a passage 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.050
 fundamental because cold water 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.569
 will shrink the pores of the silicone not 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.080
 allowing the cake mixture to 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:50.440
 clinging we pour our cake 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.479
 raw in the silicone mold and then 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.270
 let's cook in a microwave oven 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.600
 and here is the magic 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.609
 for five minutes at 650 watts 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.399
 after five minutes we would have a cake 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.409
 very soft and perfectly cooked for 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.600
 accompany the cake we will unite 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.179
 we will use an orange frosting 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.190
 very simple and very transparent now 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.670
 I'll explain how to prepare it first 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.459
 we take about 5 or 6 tablespoons of juice 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.160
 of orange a couple of spoons here too 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.840
 of orange liqueur and then we combine 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.879
 of icing sugar 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.620
 by eye until you get a glaze 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.530
 quite dense 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.110
 but it's not over we cook it 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.560
 thanks to the micro plus pitcher for two 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.849
 minutes and a half also 350 watts in 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.709
 microwave oven 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.500
 after a few minutes we would have a frosting 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.510
 very dense transparent that will rise 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.200
 just as an accompaniment to ours 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.489
 cake we churn out the cake from the mold in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.019
 round silicone 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.000
 I recommend letting the air pass 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.750
 so that the cake comes off without it 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.450
 problems and put it on url on the base 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.540
 of the twister tupperware tray that serves 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.060
 also as a serving dish 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.549
 cut a nice slice of cake the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.799
 we implant and look at it with our own 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.799
 orange icing and good appetite
