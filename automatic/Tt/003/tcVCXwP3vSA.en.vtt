Josh treadmills offer some great
diversity<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.910> what<00:00:06.060> we<00:00:06.150> can<00:00:06.299> actually<00:00:06.450> do

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
diversity to what we can actually do

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.660 
diversity to what we can actually do
with<00:00:07.020> training<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.529> training<00:00:07.950> intensities

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
with training and training intensities

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.040 
with training and training intensities
and<00:00:08.849> kind<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.030> mixed<00:00:09.389> pace<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.809> different

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
and kind of mixed pace and different

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.640 
and kind of mixed pace and different
things<00:00:10.230> like<00:00:10.320> that

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
things like that

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.430 
things like that
you<00:00:11.099> know<00:00:11.190> treadmills<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.360> tool<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:13.320> can

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
you know treadmills as a tool we can

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.810 
you know treadmills as a tool we can
actually<00:00:13.590> get<00:00:13.860> things<00:00:14.040> done<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.309> them<00:00:14.700> that

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
actually get things done on them that

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.980 
actually get things done on them that
you<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.150> maybe<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.420> couldn't<00:00:15.719> get<00:00:15.809> done

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
you know maybe you couldn't get done

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.450 
you know maybe you couldn't get done
outside<00:00:16.320> specifically<00:00:16.980> if<00:00:17.039> you're<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.190> new

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
outside specifically if you're a new

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.120 
outside specifically if you're a new
runner<00:00:17.730> you're<00:00:18.300> not<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.720> accustomed<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.350> what

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
runner you're not so accustomed to what

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.710 
runner you're not so accustomed to what
the<00:00:20.220> right<00:00:20.369> effort<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:21.480> pace

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the right effort is with the right pace

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.230 
the right effort is with the right pace
treadmills<00:00:22.680> because<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.430> really<00:00:23.670> dial<00:00:24.000> in

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
treadmills because we can really dial in

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.900 
treadmills because we can really dial in
to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> speeds<00:00:24.960> we'll<00:00:25.590> lock<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.310> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
to the speeds we'll lock that in you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.980 
to the speeds we'll lock that in you
know<00:00:27.029> ahead<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.480> time

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
know ahead of time

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.179 
know ahead of time
so<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> don't<00:00:28.289> really<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:28.920> about

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
so you don't really have to think about

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.859 
so you don't really have to think about
it<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.580> got<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.939> catch<00:00:30.179> up<00:00:30.420> yeah

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it all you got to do is catch up yeah

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.120 
it all you got to do is catch up yeah
you're<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.230> taking<00:00:31.650> away<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you're really taking away all the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.889 
you're really taking away all the
guesswork<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.790> hey<00:00:33.030> am<00:00:33.270> i<00:00:33.450> running<00:00:33.780> my

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
guesswork with hey am i running my

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
guesswork with hey am i running my
marathon<00:00:34.320> pace<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:34.890> half<00:00:35.100> marathon<00:00:35.640> pace

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
marathon pace or my half marathon pace

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
marathon pace or my half marathon pace
here<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:36.780> type<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.469> away<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.800> go

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
here you just type it in and away you go

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.799 
here you just type it in and away you go
exactly<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.210> want<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.600> today

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
exactly and so what we want to do today

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.030 
exactly and so what we want to do today
is<00:00:39.930> basically<00:00:40.290> show<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.829> little

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
is basically show it just a little

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.650 
is basically show it just a little
sample<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.820> would<00:00:41.969> call<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> fartlek

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
sample of what we would call a fartlek

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
sample of what we would call a fartlek
run<00:00:42.930> down<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> treadmill<00:00:43.950> cool<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.489> once

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
run down on the treadmill cool so once

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.950 
run down on the treadmill cool so once
you<00:00:44.760> hop<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.440> excellent<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.690> what<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.809> actually

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you hop on excellent so what we actually

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.540 
you hop on excellent so what we actually
look<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> treadmill<00:00:50.309> is

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
look to do here with the treadmill is

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
look to do here with the treadmill is
like<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> said<00:00:50.969> controlling<00:00:51.570> speeds<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.260> so

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
like I said controlling speeds and so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
like I said controlling speeds and so
harlech<00:00:53.280> runs<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:53.670> actually<00:00:53.940> runs<00:00:54.180> where<00:00:54.480> we

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
harlech runs or actually runs where we

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
harlech runs or actually runs where we
kind<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> mix<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:55.980> all<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.399> intervals

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
kind of mix up and not all the intervals

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.760 
kind of mix up and not all the intervals
are<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.940> same<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> classic<00:00:58.620> ones

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
are the same so one of the classic ones

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.889 
are the same so one of the classic ones
will<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> actually<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.300> minute<00:01:00.780> on

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
will do is actually you know minute on

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
will do is actually you know minute on
minute<00:01:01.289> off<00:01:01.469> type<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.890> things<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.340> will

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
minute off type of things but will

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.090 
minute off type of things but will
actually<00:01:02.820> change<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.199> classic<00:01:04.530> workout

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
actually change it so a classic workout

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.570 
actually change it so a classic workout
would<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.820> doing<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> multi<00:01:07.110> pace<00:01:07.580> effort

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
would be doing a multi pace effort

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
would be doing a multi pace effort
throughout<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> whole<00:01:09.360> workout<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.080> would

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
throughout the whole workout so we would

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.370 
throughout the whole workout so we would
start<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.530> doing<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.250> minute<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.240> 5k<00:01:13.140> pace

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
start with doing a minute on at 5k pace

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.160 
start with doing a minute on at 5k pace
followed<00:01:14.340> by<00:01:14.490> an<00:01:14.850> equal<00:01:15.360> recovery<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
followed by an equal recovery so that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.010 
followed by an equal recovery so that
would<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> minute<00:01:16.799> off<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.490> 20%<00:01:18.270> slower<00:01:18.810> than

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
would be a minute off at 20% slower than

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.560 
would be a minute off at 20% slower than
5k<00:01:19.439> pace<00:01:19.710> yeah<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.250> great<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.000> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
5k pace yeah it's great in that way you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
5k pace yeah it's great in that way you
can<00:01:21.720> start<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> minutes<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
can start it on the minutes here or the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.800 
can start it on the minutes here or the
minute<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.759> hits<00:01:23.909> 60<00:01:24.240> seconds<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
minute here when it hits 60 seconds and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
minute here when it hits 60 seconds and
without<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> doubt<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.310> look

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
without a doubt you don't have to look

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.980 
without a doubt you don't have to look
at<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.670> WOD<00:01:26.880> yeah<00:01:27.180> people<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.720> nervous

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
at your WOD yeah people get nervous

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
at your WOD yeah people get nervous
sometimes<00:01:28.259> running<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.920> treadmills<00:01:29.340> if

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
sometimes running on treadmills if

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.440 
sometimes running on treadmills if
they've<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.820> look<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.180> too<00:01:30.329> many

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
they've got to look at too many

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.730 
they've got to look at too many
variables<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:31.229> they're<00:01:31.380> worried<00:01:31.590> about

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
variables because they're worried about

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
variables because they're worried about
falling<00:01:32.009> off<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.880> stare<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> clock<00:01:33.600> count

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
start working our way back down that's

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.430 
start working our way back down that's
what<00:01:58.610> we<00:01:58.700> call<00:01:58.910> a<00:01:59.210> fartlek<00:01:59.990> that's<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.410> a

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
what we call a fartlek that's in a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.250 
what we call a fartlek that's in a
ladder<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.370> I'm<00:02:01.430> moving<00:02:01.850> up<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.870> longer

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
ladder so I'm moving up to longer

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.590 
ladder so I'm moving up to longer
distances<00:02:03.920> with<00:02:04.190> slower<00:02:04.400> speeds<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:05.450> we

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
distances with slower speeds and then we

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.930 
distances with slower speeds and then we
come<00:02:05.870> back<00:02:06.080> down<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.560> ladder<00:02:06.680> three<00:02:07.610> minutes

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
or exact speeds the treadmill will

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.010 
or exact speeds the treadmill will
really<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.610> work<00:02:49.790> done<00:02:49.850> for<00:02:50.240> us<00:02:50.360> all<00:02:50.780> we

nice job Josh thanks yeah so so fartlek
runs<00:02:59.269> on<00:02:59.510> treadmills<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.320> really<00:03:01.100> great<00:03:01.340> tool

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
runs on treadmills a really great tool

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.370 
runs on treadmills a really great tool
because<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.480> something<00:03:02.780> like<00:03:02.900> we<00:03:03.050> said<00:03:03.200> we

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
because it's something like we said we

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.520 
because it's something like we said we
can't<00:03:03.650> do<00:03:03.860> outside<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:05.269> really<00:03:05.840> utilizes

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
can't do outside so it really utilizes

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.080 
can't do outside so it really utilizes
the<00:03:06.769> advances<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.430> what<00:03:07.550> we<00:03:07.670> have<00:03:07.880> in

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
the advances of what we have in

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.400 
the advances of what we have in

it's<00:03:10.500> great<00:03:10.710> and<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.980> treadmill<00:03:11.460> -<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.120> you

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
it's great and the treadmill - and you

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.910 
it's great and the treadmill - and you
get<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.660> hill<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.080> can<00:03:13.110> get<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> incline<00:03:13.740> you

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
get the hill you can get the incline you

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.340 
get the hill you can get the incline you
get<00:03:14.100> all<00:03:14.310> sorts<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.700> stuff<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.090> yes<00:03:15.330> right<00:03:16.200> here

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
get all sorts of stuff so yes right here

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.050 
get all sorts of stuff so yes right here
in<00:03:16.410> your<00:03:16.470> finger<00:03:16.710> yeah<00:03:16.980> an<00:03:17.070> example<00:03:17.670> but<00:03:17.850> we've

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
in your finger yeah an example but we've

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.880 
in your finger yeah an example but we've
talked<00:03:18.210> today<00:03:18.360> these<00:03:18.630> multi<00:03:19.140> paste<00:03:19.470> workouts

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
talked today these multi paste workouts

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.740 
talked today these multi paste workouts
they<00:03:20.340> really<00:03:20.640> teach<00:03:20.880> runners<00:03:21.630> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
they really teach runners and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.510 
they really teach runners and
specifically<00:03:22.140> numerators<00:03:22.650> they<00:03:23.070> get<00:03:23.220> kind<00:03:23.490> of

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
specifically numerators they get kind of

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.280 
specifically numerators they get kind of
stuck<00:03:23.820> in<00:03:23.970> running<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.450> same<00:03:24.660> taste<00:03:24.990> all<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
stuck in running the same taste all the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.050 
stuck in running the same taste all the
time<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:25.710> if<00:03:25.800> they<00:03:25.890> do<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> workout<00:03:26.430> they<00:03:26.880> run

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
time so if they do a workout they run

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.460 
time so if they do a workout they run
the<00:03:27.180> same<00:03:27.360> case<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.870> know<00:03:27.990> they<00:03:28.140> do<00:03:28.200> an<00:03:28.350> easy

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
the same case you know they do an easy

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.800 
the same case you know they do an easy
run<00:03:28.740> they<00:03:28.860> run<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.100> same<00:03:29.250> case<00:03:29.490> with<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.630> tool

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
run they run the same case with the tool

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.240 
run they run the same case with the tool
like<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.020> treadmill<00:03:31.320> being<00:03:31.740> able<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.040> change

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
like a treadmill being able to change

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.070 
like a treadmill being able to change
the<00:03:32.460> pace<00:03:32.640> fast<00:03:32.940> as<00:03:33.210> well<00:03:33.390> as<00:03:33.480> fast<00:03:33.690> as<00:03:33.870> well

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
the pace fast as well as fast as well

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.410 
the pace fast as well as fast as well
really<00:03:34.710> teaches<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> body<00:03:35.520> how<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.120> learn<00:03:36.360> to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
really teaches the body how to learn to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.880 
really teaches the body how to learn to
run<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> different<00:03:37.020> speeds<00:03:37.380> because<00:03:37.740> your

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
run a different speeds because your

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.340 
run a different speeds because your
stride<00:03:38.190> will<00:03:38.400> change<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.510> really<00:03:39.960> even<00:03:40.260> if

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
stride will change and really even if

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.720 
stride will change and really even if
you're<00:03:40.470> focusing<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.130> marathon<00:03:41.550> or<00:03:41.670> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
you're focusing on the marathon or the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.640 
you're focusing on the marathon or the
half<00:03:41.880> marathon<00:03:42.060> running<00:03:42.810> these<00:03:43.080> these

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
half marathon running these these

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.700 
half marathon running these these
intervals<00:03:44.640> at<00:03:44.910> 5k<00:03:45.840> pace<00:03:46.110> you're<00:03:46.410> teaching

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
intervals at 5k pace you're teaching

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.920 
intervals at 5k pace you're teaching
your<00:03:46.830> body<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.430> fishing<00:03:47.790> at<00:03:48.240> that<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.780> that

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
your body to be fishing at that at that

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.420 
your body to be fishing at that at that
shorter<00:03:49.230> distance<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:49.650> when<00:03:49.770> you<00:03:49.860> do<00:03:50.040> run<00:03:50.250> your

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
shorter distance so when you do run your

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.260 
shorter distance so when you do run your
marathon<00:03:50.700> pace<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.390> feels<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.750> much<00:03:51.900> easier
