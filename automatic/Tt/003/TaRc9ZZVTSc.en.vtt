00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello friends and guests of the channel, we 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.140
 Consider the new dlc that came out 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.469
 just the other day and appeared in the incentive 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.630
 It costs 7 dollars as you know and 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.269
 he makes just such a technique that's you 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.520
 just take a look at this handsome well and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.520
 of course to him several reapers 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.660
 this is for corn this is for grass 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.330
 and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.590
 it's for straw it's all going 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.720
 cut is done 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.090
 and further as you know already done 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.250
 syoss here but let's take a look at 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.790
 start on this technique fr 850 new 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 holland 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.440
 well at least tall 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.040
 serious technology 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.070
 Well, of course, look inside and 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.579
 as always, of course we are now with 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 by you and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.170
 and try it in is worth it a miracle 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.399
 equipment in the store 385 euros inside 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 game currency plus the headers 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.510
 3835 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.280
 and 14,000 well and I bought another trailer 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.369
 in order to test how is this 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.110
 equipment will work here 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.750
 I like what I can attach 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.890
 this recipe and not necessarily with us yet 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.430
 the worker must go and pick in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 generally let's try let's 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.960
 turn on moving into the cabin and look 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.190
 like this 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.650
 will be 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.650
 work and how it all looks 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.520
 In general, children mow the grass and this grass 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.970
 then we carried a pit in spring and got 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.970
 silage 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.610
 well, and what a review without this test 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.590
 technology we can phototechnics 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.630
 test with you only on the field 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.930
 let's try let's 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.409
 let's see what we get so well 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.409
 First turn the header 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.620
 and get to work turn it on 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.620
 omit naturally turn on 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.069
 also we have the same from 9 meter 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.970
 Reaper only red here 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.220
 for those of mine who love harmony 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.050
 colors see red trailer red 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.220
 heat 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.220
 Well, that's 2 new holland and 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.430
 well friends i will be on it 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.650
 to finish our little review we are with 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.510
 You looked at the combine and several 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.820
 reapers looked like this whole thing 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.220
 It works just as well that 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.790
 no complaints about modeling nick 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.890
 there is no physics of this combine 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.580
 I buy this delos 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.800
 whether or not you decide 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.240
 site say goodbye to everyone thank you for your attention 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.240
