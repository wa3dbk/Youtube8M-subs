let's just put this back in for now and

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.870 
let's just put this back in for now and
we<00:05:09.450> have<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:09.660> look<00:05:09.900> around<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:11.130> back<00:05:11.550> of<00:05:11.820> the

we have a look around the back of the

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.250 
we have a look around the back of the
device<00:05:12.360> so<00:05:13.320> on<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.800> back<00:05:14.010> gone<00:05:14.970> has<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.720> fake

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
device so on the back gone has the fake

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.110 
device so on the back gone has the fake
sort<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.770> stitching<00:05:17.190> around<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.610> edge<00:05:17.790> but<00:05:17.820> we

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
sort of stitching around the edge but we

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.730 
sort of stitching around the edge but we
still<00:05:18.330> want<00:05:18.480> this<00:05:18.600> really<00:05:18.960> nice<00:05:19.080> textured
