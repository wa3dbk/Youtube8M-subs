 subscribers and what makes me so much more 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.620
 pleasure is that you really have I

 will not be at all politically 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.820
 okay what am I going to say but you 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.739
 are used now I had the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.559
 feeling that with video especially about 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.780
 foie gras on the milk too I 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.149
 simply attract quality people 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.050
 and you know if you followed me since 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.180
 long me my goal is to have 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.860
 people on this chain who share 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.870
 my values here I was just holding 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.430
 thank you for being here and 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.800
 to be what you are mostly because 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.430
 that all your comments touch me 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.469
 Verry much 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.789
 so now when we will see 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:10.090
 enter the heart of the subject 1 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.959
 if you will, then today 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.549
 give you today you speak 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.909
 from a small plant color to 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.170
 which I have a recourse a few 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.490
 days now that's how much is it 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.599
 maybe a good week now 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.209
 little more to situate you 

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:27.009
 thing I made a vegetable coloring 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:30.579
 in the salons bio headdress in paris ago 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.529
 in june 2013 i was delighted i 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:37.149
 would you put a link if you are 

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:38.979
 interested so by here and there I had 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.599
 want to test a homemade color 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.869
 so I bought the homemade coloring 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:46.869
 in a bio coop simply it's 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.999
 of the art logo mark and I was 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.929
 also pleasantly surprised by this 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.340
 product I'm going to talk about 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.570
 interruption in detail I threw the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.380
 box so game 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.380
 shows what it looks like 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.270
 art already how does it look so 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.680
 in you have a powder 1 sachet 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.610
 filled with powder it looks a bit like 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.340
 clay fact 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.350
 and so it's the vegetable coloring and 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.810
 then you have a pair of gloves 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.430
 you have a little charlotte and that's 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.540
 everything and I say it's all because 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.860
 that in fact I was a little bit 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.480
 surprised not to find small 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.490
 brushes finally at the same time I'm not 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.930
 at all used to the colorations it is 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.010
 the first time I made one to 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.970
 the house and so suddenly that I wanted 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.010
 you specify anyway if they have 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.060
 procured this product is that I myself 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.890
 served a toothbrush to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.840
 the former an old toothbrush 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.230
 with a toothbrush I use 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.760
 currently if possible and it's not 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.350
 very practical so I recommend you 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.810
 still buy a little more 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.000
 brush then regarding the use 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.280
 of the product so in fact just 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.670
 pour the powder gold me I have hair 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.270
 long so I poured everything but 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.530
 frankly if you have hair 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.900
 short you do not have to use 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.920
 the whole package my mom did it at the same 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.489
 time that me she bought herself a 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.600
 also planting logona coloring and not 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.530
 of the same color by cons she had 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.920
 caught golden chain while I have 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.180
 taken chestnuts and so in fact she 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.890
 used a month ago of this package 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.330
 is more than enough for a little hair 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.350
 little squared so for me the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.239
 the entire pack and frankly 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.100
 it was perfect so about 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.950
 the use of the product so it is enough 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:27.049
 in fact to put the powder in a 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.510
 logical container to boil 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.720
 water 300 centilitres of water if I get 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.150
 remember well and then you pour 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.820
 in boiling water on the on the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.910
 powder that you actually get a 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.110
 pasty texture that stinks of misery but 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.290
 when I tell you that it stinks of misery 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.760
 it's an absolute horror what's the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.080
 although to tell you about it I'm 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.110
 remember this particular smell 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.310
 it's a delicate smoke not to be 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.400
 vulgar but frankly it smells very 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.000
 bad 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.640
 but here are our zigues and I 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.810
 spread manure on the hair so 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.959
 it does something good 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.610
 short small cpc it does not stay on 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.280
 hair after you do not smell 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.450
 I do not have well then 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.519
 so here you are you prepared this 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.570
 mixture and it actually gives you a 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:22.150
 mixture with pasty mixture must be well 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.550
 well mix well and not with two steps 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.410
 with a steel or iron spoon 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.370
 especially not mix with a 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.289
 wooden spoon to prevent 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.850
 oxidation of the product 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.110
 concerning the laying time of the product 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.639
 so me I have a rule I did not 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.260
 not too apprehensive given that 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.520
 this is still a color 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.710
 plant has not completely 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.300
 permanent it fades over 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.280
 good shampoos I left my hours and 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.830
 half and I did well I was delighted 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.539
 result of the coverage no concern by 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.699
 against normally there is a little bit scared of 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.440
 the final color left it an hour 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.520
 and I wanted to clarify so for the 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.889
 people who have hair 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.389
 whites like her that an hour has 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.710
 apparently not enough because that 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.060
 did not cover all of his 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.560
 white hair so I advise you 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.940
 still leave a minimum of one hour 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.229
 and a half if you have hair 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.900
 whites you really want a color 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.669
 more intense 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.630
 then so when you rinse none 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:16.449
 worry it will be very easily 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.310
 and then so really what I held 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.080
 to clarify is that there is really there 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.389
 I find that the hair is more 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.010
 bulky like that sheaths it's not 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.720
 at all the same principle as the 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.130
 chemical staining that changes you which 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.320
 will change the internal structure of the 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.870
 hair and it wins you the hair in 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.220
 done and so that makes it as and when 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.080
 measure in addition to applications this is the 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.370
 make it thicker and I 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.900
 see them and I really see it 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.340
 as they begin to 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.050
 really gain density 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.690
 they are not more numerous it is not necessary 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.240
 dream but they are they are still 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.300
 the more I do not know there is more mass in 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.139
 done there is more volume all 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.919
 simply and so shine level 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.840
 it's great 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.000
 frankly it makes them super bright 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.569
 I really have nothing to say I find that 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.089
 I think it's stop 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.559
 a great product so good logona any 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:06.360
 way for now I never disappointed 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:08.520
 their shampoo I love their care 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.939
 I love and there their vegetable coloring 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.619
 convinced me too after watching well 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.610
 the colors because it's always 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:16.529
 like that, it's like 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.639
 chemical staining frankly this 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:19.559
 that there is on the box it's not 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.909
 meaningful to me what I you 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:22.050
 advise to do it anyway if you 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.369
 are afraid of color that's all 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.809
 simply to do a test on a 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:26.550
 wick you take a little bit of 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:28.439
 hair and then you do a test 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.439
 on top like that you're sure at the moment 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:33.959
 of rendering that's going to be and you're not going 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:35.789
 not be disappointed tearing your hair 

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:38.430
 that would be to teach me about it 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:41.279
 coloring i'm going to show you a before 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.839
 after right now so you'll see 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.659
 that they have just won already 

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:47.789
 volume in shine too and they are 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:48.839
 darker just it darkened them 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.099
 but what is it really what I 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:52.520
 looking and I wanted to fuck 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.520
 a little bit 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.310
 so here for this video I hope 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.720
 I liked you, I kiss you all 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.590
 very strong he I tell you very soon 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.950
 see you next time 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.950
 ciao
