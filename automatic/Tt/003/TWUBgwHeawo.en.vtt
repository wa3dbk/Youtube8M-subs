00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.160 

alright<00:01:17.190> we<00:01:17.400> got<00:01:17.430> both<00:01:17.760> of<00:01:17.940> our<00:01:18.170> little

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
alright we got both of our little

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.290 
alright we got both of our little
brackets<00:01:19.590> made<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:20.660> for<00:01:21.660> both<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.560> gauges<00:01:23.300> and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
brackets made up for both the gauges and

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.000 
brackets made up for both the gauges and
if<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.510> watch<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.440> think<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> was<00:01:25.800> the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
if you watch the I think it was the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.480 
if you watch the I think it was the
third<00:01:26.190> video<00:01:27.680> this<00:01:28.680> water<00:01:28.950> temp<00:01:29.190> gauge<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
third video this water temp gauge is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.490 
third video this water temp gauge is
gonna<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:29.760> replaced<00:01:30.120> this<00:01:30.300> gunner<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:31.320> was

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
gonna get replaced this gunner this was

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
gonna get replaced this gunner this was
my<00:01:31.620> practice<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.250> cutting<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.670> rings<00:01:32.880> off

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
my practice one cutting the rings off

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.290 
my practice one cutting the rings off
and<00:01:34.070> I'll<00:01:35.070> replace<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:35.910> for<00:01:36.060> now<00:01:36.150> I'm

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
and I'll replace that but for now I'm

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.960 
and I'll replace that but for now I'm
using<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:37.070> just<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> next<00:01:38.640> gauge<00:01:38.820> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
using it just because the next gauge is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.280 
using it just because the next gauge is
going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.270> exactly<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> same<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
going to be exactly the same so it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.140 
going to be exactly the same so it
should<00:01:40.470> bolt<00:01:40.710> right<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.790> we've<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:42.930> these

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
should bolt right in so we've got these

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.340 
should bolt right in so we've got these
figured<00:01:45.150> out<00:01:47.300> got<00:01:48.300> them<00:01:48.390> bolted<00:01:48.540> up<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.230> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
figured out got them bolted up so that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.730 
figured out got them bolted up so that
they<00:01:49.500> won't<00:01:50.180> separate<00:01:51.180> crosswise<00:01:51.690> now<00:01:52.680> we

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
they won't separate crosswise now we

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.260 
they won't separate crosswise now we
need<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.010> focus<00:01:53.160> on<00:01:53.460> how<00:01:54.000> we're<00:01:54.180> gonna

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
need to focus on how we're gonna

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.720 
need to focus on how we're gonna
actually<00:01:54.900> mount<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:56.280> gauge<00:01:56.430> bezel

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
actually mount them to the gauge bezel

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.860 
actually mount them to the gauge bezel
and<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.140> said<00:01:58.200> before<00:01:58.410> that's<00:01:59.190> where<00:01:59.460> this

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
and like I said before that's where this

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.490 
and like I said before that's where this
piece<00:02:00.870> of<00:02:01.050> 3/4<00:02:01.500> inch<00:02:01.560> wide<00:02:02.030> eighth<00:02:03.030> inch<00:02:03.270> thick

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
piece of 3/4 inch wide eighth inch thick

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.250 
piece of 3/4 inch wide eighth inch thick
aluminum<00:02:04.500> comes<00:02:04.680> into<00:02:04.920> place<00:02:05.130> it'll<00:02:05.370> be<00:02:06.260> will

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
aluminum comes into place it'll be will

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.050 
aluminum comes into place it'll be will
have<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.500> bend<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.100> they'll<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.760> bolted

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
have to bend this up they'll be bolted

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.350 
have to bend this up they'll be bolted
here<00:02:09.600> kind<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.500> some<00:02:10.649> bends<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.130> here<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.760> then

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
here kind of some bends in here and then

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.500 
here kind of some bends in here and then
bolt<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.720> down<00:02:12.900> here<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:14.090> we'll<00:02:15.090> get<00:02:15.210> going<00:02:15.420> on

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
bolt it down here so we'll get going on

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.570 
bolt it down here so we'll get going on
that
