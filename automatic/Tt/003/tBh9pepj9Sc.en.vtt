 tears but of emotion and happiness 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.300

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.119
 and everything very calm 7 kilos 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.840
 being the braves 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:03.160
 regretful with desire to recover by 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:05.410

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.470

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.390
 from my 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.500
 we are in this a gesture of 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.860
 to heal wounds 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.390
 we are in the process of discussing the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.890

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:40.700
 and he has asked me for forgiveness very much 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.080
 a lot a lot and that's the main thing 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 they want to be able to send many salvador 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.490
 being with my mother with people 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.360
 because they do that were affected the 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.910
 environment friendships the truth because the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.870
 message that by much anger that 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.100

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.709
 they founded that he has asked for forgiveness and 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.760
 totally repentant who knows that the 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:12.250

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.250
 and letting things go 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.720
 because we communicate 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.030

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.000

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:48.310
