00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.320 
Boston now in this tutorial we've
already<00:00:08.130> looked<00:00:08.460> at<00:00:08.730> or<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> past

already looked at or in the past

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.490 
already looked at or in the past
tutorial<00:00:09.780> we've<00:00:09.960> already<00:00:10.110> looked<00:00:10.320> at

tutorial we've already looked at
connecting<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.250> our<00:00:11.370> database<00:00:11.969> now<00:00:14.179> to<00:00:15.179> make

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
connecting to our database now to make

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.689 
connecting to our database now to make
this<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.379> lot<00:00:16.650> more<00:00:16.800> efficient<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:17.580> can

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
this a lot more efficient so we can

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.480 
this a lot more efficient so we can
include<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.330> where<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.720> require<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.529> I'm<00:00:20.189> just

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
include it where we require it I'm just

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.160 
include it where we require it I'm just
going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> get<00:00:20.939> rid<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.210> everything<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.930> our

index dot PHP file and I'm going to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.410 
index dot PHP file and I'm going to
create<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.260> new<00:00:25.560> file<00:00:25.939> make<00:00:26.939> sure<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.240> is

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
create a new file make sure this is

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.650 
create a new file make sure this is
enclosed<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.410> PHP<00:00:29.099> tags<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.119> reason<00:00:30.539> I'm

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
enclosed in PHP tags and the reason I'm

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
enclosed in PHP tags and the reason I'm
doing<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.410> I'm<00:00:31.679> now<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.489> save<00:00:32.759> it

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
doing this is I'm now going to save it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.900 
doing this is I'm now going to save it
as<00:00:33.829> connecting<00:00:34.880> PHP<00:00:36.079> now<00:00:37.370> what<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.760> with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
as connecting PHP now what I can do with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.850 
as connecting PHP now what I can do with
this<00:00:39.030> now<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.329> whenever<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.050> open<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.710> new

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this now is whenever I open up a new

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.959 
this now is whenever I open up a new
page<00:00:41.070> let's<00:00:41.520> say<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.850> might<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.059> index.php<00:00:42.800> or

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
page let's say it might be index.php or

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.299 
page let's say it might be index.php or
something<00:00:44.969> else<00:00:45.120> dot<00:00:45.360> PHP<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.070> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
something else dot PHP all I can do is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.819 
something else dot PHP all I can do is
at<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> top<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.930> require<00:00:49.730> connect<00:00:50.730> dot<00:00:50.910> PHP

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
at the top I can require connect dot PHP

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.010 
at the top I can require connect dot PHP
and<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.190> way<00:00:53.370> we've<00:00:53.640> required<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.449> file<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and this way we've required this file to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.130 
and this way we've required this file to
be<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.640> first<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:57.059> exist<00:00:57.390> because<00:00:57.570> require

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
be the first will exist because require

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.869 
be the first will exist because require
will<00:00:58.680> kill<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> rest<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.370> page<00:00:59.520> if<00:00:59.699> this

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
will kill the rest of the page if this

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:00.709 
will kill the rest of the page if this
can't<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.210> found

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
can't be found

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
can't be found
second<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.530> connect<00:01:01.949> connects<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> our

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
second of all connect connects to our

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
second of all connect connects to our
database<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.660> now<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.409> under

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
database so now what we can do is under

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.679 
database so now what we can do is under
here<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.519> start<00:01:05.700> doing<00:01:05.939> things<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.570> allow

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
here we can start doing things to allow

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.899 
here we can start doing things to allow
us<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.200> grab<00:01:08.189> some<00:01:08.400> data<00:01:08.640> from<00:01:08.970> our<00:01:09.060> database

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
us to grab some data from our database

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.950 
us to grab some data from our database
okay<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:11.970> let's<00:01:12.270> assume<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.720> we've

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
okay so let's assume that we've

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.140 
okay so let's assume that we've
connected<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.439> our<00:01:13.619> database<00:01:13.770> properly<00:01:14.610> let's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
connected to our database properly let's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
connected to our database properly let's
come<00:01:15.360> into<00:01:15.479> database<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.409> refresh<00:01:16.950> from<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
come into database and refresh from the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.450 
come into database and refresh from the
last<00:01:17.549> tutorial<00:01:17.869> oK<00:01:18.869> we've<00:01:18.990> got<00:01:19.140> nothing<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.770> so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
last tutorial oK we've got nothing up so

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.340 
last tutorial oK we've got nothing up so
under<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.090> let's<00:01:21.360> echo<00:01:22.490> maybe<00:01:23.490> okay<00:01:24.060> out

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
under here let's echo maybe okay out

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.810 
under here let's echo maybe okay out
just<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:26.130> working<00:01:26.700> let's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
just so we know that it's working let's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.690 
just so we know that it's working let's
refresh<00:01:27.299> okay<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.259> we've<00:01:28.380> got<00:01:28.409> okay<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
refresh okay so we've got okay so the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.890 
refresh okay so we've got okay so the
first<00:01:29.970> thing<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.780> we've

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
first thing we know is that we've

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.929 
first thing we know is that we've
required<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.530> file<00:01:31.740> correctly<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.729> file

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
required the file correctly the file

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.499 
required the file correctly the file
exists

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
exists

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.580 
exists
second<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.409> we've

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
second of all we know that we've

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.840 
second of all we know that we've
connected<00:01:34.890> properly<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.670> haven't

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
connected properly because we haven't

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.819 
connected properly because we haven't
killed<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:39.290> this<00:01:40.290> should<00:01:40.470> always<00:01:40.590> come

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
killed here so this should always come

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.700 
killed here so this should always come
at<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:40.979> top<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> your<00:01:41.430> page<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> let's<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
at the top of your page so let's go to a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
I'm going to say let's say we need an ID

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.950 
I'm going to say let's say we need an ID
field<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.500> need<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.790> name<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> food<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
field we need a the name of the food and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.880 
field we need a the name of the food and
I'm<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> say<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:10.110> calories<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I'm going to say the calories and

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.970 
I'm going to say the calories and
whether<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.310> unhealthy<00:02:11.700> or<00:02:11.910> healthy

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
whether it's unhealthy or healthy

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.580 
whether it's unhealthy or healthy
so<00:02:13.129> I'm<00:02:13.190> going<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.520> four<00:02:13.849> fields<00:02:14.590> so

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
so I'm going to have four fields so

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.470 
so I'm going to have four fields so
let's<00:02:15.770> create<00:02:16.010> these<00:02:16.220> fields<00:02:16.730> we're<00:02:17.300> going<00:02:17.420> to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
let's create these fields we're going to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.449 
let's create these fields we're going to
ID<00:02:17.720> with<00:02:18.349> is<00:02:18.530> going<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.890> be<00:02:18.980> int<00:02:21.280> we're<00:02:22.280> going

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
ID with is going to be int we're going

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.280 
ID with is going to be int we're going
to<00:02:22.550> have<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.000> indexes<00:02:23.510> primary<00:02:24.050> because<00:02:24.140> this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
to have the indexes primary because this

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.020 
to have the indexes primary because this
is<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.470> unique<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:24.980> AI<00:02:25.250> which<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.760> auto

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
is a unique and AI which is auto

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.270 
is a unique and AI which is auto
increment<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:26.750> going<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.959> be<00:02:27.080> yes<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.010> we

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
increment it's going to be yes so we

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.190 
increment it's going to be yes so we
want<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.519> Auto<00:02:28.700> increment<00:02:29.030> next<00:02:29.989> is<00:02:30.080> going

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
want this Auto increment next is going

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.020 
want this Auto increment next is going
to<00:02:30.260> be<00:02:30.349> food<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.069> then<00:02:31.580> we're<00:02:31.670> going<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.849> say

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
to be food and then we're going to say

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.140 
to be food and then we're going to say
calories<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.349> then<00:02:33.530> we're<00:02:33.620> going<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.769> say<00:02:34.150> I'm

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
calories and then we're going to say I'm

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.670 
calories and then we're going to say I'm
going<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.450> call<00:02:35.630> this<00:02:35.780> healthy<00:02:36.410> or<00:02:36.560> unhealthy

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
going to call this healthy or unhealthy

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.170 
going to call this healthy or unhealthy
I'm<00:02:37.310> going<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.519> call<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.760> hu<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:40.700> fact<00:02:41.000> let's

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
I'm going to call it hu in fact let's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.890 
I'm going to call it hu in fact let's
make<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.569> bit<00:02:41.599> easier<00:02:42.019> to<00:02:42.080> stay<00:02:42.379> healthy<00:02:42.709> and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
make it a bit easier to stay healthy and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.460 
make it a bit easier to stay healthy and
healthy<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:46.040> going<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.250> be<00:02:46.340> equal<00:02:46.760> to

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
healthy and this is going to be equal to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.420 
healthy and this is going to be equal to
I'm<00:02:48.470> going<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.769> say<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.420> varchar'<00:02:50.890> length<00:02:51.890> one

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
I'm going to say a varchar' length one

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.020 
I'm going to say a varchar' length one
so<00:02:53.090> if<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.360> foods<00:02:53.630> healthy<00:02:54.319> this<00:02:55.190> value<00:02:55.880> is

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
so if the foods healthy this value is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.030 
so if the foods healthy this value is
going<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.180> equal<00:02:56.360> H<00:02:56.690> if<00:02:57.110> it's<00:02:57.260> unhealthy<00:02:57.920> it's

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
going to equal H if it's unhealthy it's

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.610 
going to equal H if it's unhealthy it's
going<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.250> equal<00:02:58.579> you<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.959> food<00:03:00.230> I'm<00:03:00.410> going<00:03:00.530> to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
going to equal you the food I'm going to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.690 
going to equal you the food I'm going to
save<00:03:00.769> our<00:03:01.040> chart<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.579> let's<00:03:02.030> say<00:03:03.250> 25<00:03:04.250> and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
save our chart of let's say 25 and

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.330 
save our chart of let's say 25 and
calories<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.810> going<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.049> stay<00:03:06.260> an<00:03:06.380> int<00:03:06.769> because

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
calories is going to stay an int because

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.830 
calories is going to stay an int because
we're<00:03:07.790> always<00:03:07.880> going<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.120> have<00:03:08.180> an<00:03:08.299> integer

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
we're always going to have an integer

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.420 
we're always going to have an integer
number<00:03:09.110> for<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.470> amount<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.769> calories<00:03:10.220> in<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
number for the amount of calories in the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.400 
number for the amount of calories in the
food<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:11.630> let's<00:03:11.840> go<00:03:12.170> along<00:03:12.579> down<00:03:13.579> here<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:15.260> I'm

the query so query I'm going to say run

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.050 
the query so query I'm going to say run
equals<00:06:03.420> now<00:06:04.200> we're<00:06:04.350> using<00:06:04.530> this<00:06:04.710> MySQL<00:06:05.670> query

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
equals now we're using this MySQL query

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.750 
equals now we're using this MySQL query
function<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.810> actually<00:06:06.960> run<00:06:07.380> the<00:06:07.440> query<00:06:07.860> so

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
function to actually run the query so

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.460 
function to actually run the query so
you<00:06:08.850> can<00:06:09.000> either<00:06:09.120> use<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.720> MySQL<00:06:09.900> query

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
you can either use the MySQL query

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.030 
you can either use the MySQL query
function<00:06:10.920> on<00:06:11.010> its<00:06:11.160> own<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.580> insert<00:06:12.060> your

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
function on its own and insert your

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.560 
function on its own and insert your
structured<00:06:14.040> query<00:06:14.220> language<00:06:14.400> in<00:06:14.880> there<00:06:15.150> or

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
structured query language in there or

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.130 
structured query language in there or
what<00:06:15.960> you<00:06:16.050> can<00:06:16.200> do<00:06:16.350> is<00:06:16.560> just<00:06:16.890> then<00:06:17.130> pop<00:06:17.430> that

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
what you can do is just then pop that

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.110 
what you can do is just then pop that
inside<00:06:19.140> of<00:06:19.170> it<00:06:19.410> so<00:06:20.040> we're<00:06:20.340> popping<00:06:20.520> this<00:06:20.730> query

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
inside of it so we're popping this query

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.660 
inside of it so we're popping this query
in<00:06:21.420> here<00:06:22.320> and<00:06:22.500> then<00:06:22.980> this<00:06:23.070> is<00:06:23.250> running<00:06:23.550> the

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
in here and then this is running the

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.840 
in here and then this is running the
query<00:06:23.910> ok

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
query ok

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.400 
query ok
what<00:06:26.850> we<00:06:26.940> can<00:06:27.060> also<00:06:27.180> do<00:06:27.480> is<00:06:27.690> we<00:06:27.870> can<00:06:28.020> use<00:06:28.290> this

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
what we can also do is we can use this

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.220 
what we can also do is we can use this
or<00:06:28.590> Die

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
or Die

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.960 
or Die
but<00:06:31.230> what<00:06:31.680> I'm<00:06:31.830> going<00:06:32.070> to<00:06:32.100> do<00:06:32.310> is<00:06:32.550> I'm<00:06:32.700> going<00:06:32.730> to

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.210 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say<00:06:33.150> and<00:06:33.480> so<00:06:34.260> I've<00:06:34.410> just<00:06:34.620> deleted<00:06:34.950> that<00:06:35.070> I

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
say and so I've just deleted that I

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.740 
say and so I've just deleted that I
didn't<00:06:35.490> mean<00:06:35.610> to<00:06:35.790> comment<00:06:36.360> that

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
didn't mean to comment that

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.820 
didn't mean to comment that
I'm<00:06:37.170> going<00:06:37.380> to<00:06:37.440> say<00:06:37.590> if<00:06:39.890> query<00:06:40.890> run<00:06:41.690> equals

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
I'm going to say if query run equals

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.080 
I'm going to say if query run equals
MySQL<00:06:43.880> query<00:06:45.500> query<00:06:46.500> then<00:06:47.460> run<00:06:47.700> this<00:06:47.850> block

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
MySQL query query then run this block

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.830 
MySQL query query then run this block
the<00:06:49.050> reason<00:06:49.470> I'm<00:06:49.560> doing<00:06:49.800> this<00:06:49.950> is<00:06:50.730> because<00:06:51.030> if

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
the reason I'm doing this is because if

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.260 
the reason I'm doing this is because if
the<00:06:52.710> query<00:06:53.070> is<00:06:53.250> successful<00:06:53.940> this<00:06:54.060> will

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
the query is successful this will

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.820 
the query is successful this will
evaluate<00:06:54.480> to<00:06:54.720> true<00:06:54.870> and<00:06:55.440> then<00:06:55.560> we<00:06:55.650> can

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
evaluate to true and then we can

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.950 
evaluate to true and then we can
continue<00:06:56.340> with<00:06:56.400> our<00:06:56.520> code<00:06:56.850> but<00:06:57.510> I'm<00:06:57.690> going<00:06:57.870> to

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
continue with our code but I'm going to

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.020 
continue with our code but I'm going to
say<00:06:58.140> otherwise<00:07:01.250> query<00:07:02.250> failed

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
say otherwise query failed

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:10.220 
say otherwise query failed
okay<00:07:03.510> so<00:07:04.940> echo<00:07:06.620> query<00:07:07.970> success<00:07:09.020> now<00:07:10.020> what

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
okay so echo query success now what

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.650 
okay so echo query success now what
we're<00:07:10.380> not<00:07:10.560> doing<00:07:10.620> is<00:07:11.160> we're<00:07:11.640> not<00:07:11.850> displaying

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
we're not doing is we're not displaying

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.140 
we're not doing is we're not displaying
the<00:07:12.960> result<00:07:13.440> of<00:07:13.590> this<00:07:13.740> query<00:07:14.100> just<00:07:14.640> yet<00:07:14.940> we're

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
the result of this query just yet we're

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.840 
the result of this query just yet we're
just<00:07:15.180> performing<00:07:15.450> the<00:07:16.080> query<00:07:16.440> we<00:07:17.430> can<00:07:17.610> use

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850 
just performing the query we can use

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.930 
just performing the query we can use
some<00:07:18.150> functions<00:07:18.690> later<00:07:19.260> on<00:07:19.680> to<00:07:20.010> display<00:07:20.550> the

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
some functions later on to display the

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.120 
some functions later on to display the
results<00:07:21.090> but<00:07:21.900> for<00:07:22.110> now<00:07:22.290> what<00:07:22.530> we're<00:07:22.680> doing<00:07:22.950> is

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.130 
results but for now what we're doing is

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.490 
results but for now what we're doing is
we're<00:07:23.340> just<00:07:23.580> saying<00:07:23.760> query<00:07:24.150> success<00:07:24.720> if<00:07:24.960> this

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 
we're just saying query success if this

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.440 
we're just saying query success if this
query<00:07:25.830> makes<00:07:26.160> sense<00:07:26.520> and<00:07:26.730> and<00:07:26.910> return

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.450 
query makes sense and and return

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.450 
query makes sense and and return
something<00:07:28.020> and<00:07:28.200> is<00:07:28.620> structured<00:07:29.130> properly

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
something and is structured properly

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.890 
something and is structured properly
otherwise<00:07:29.870> we're<00:07:30.870> saying<00:07:31.080> query<00:07:31.470> failed
