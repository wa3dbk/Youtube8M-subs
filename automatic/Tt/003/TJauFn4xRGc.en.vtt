00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.710
 provided her name means translated 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.109
 pink rabbit 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.780
 currently she is a Vice Admiral Fact 3 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.370
 in German , pizarro is led in a row 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.470
 once as the most powerful man of the marine 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 This is true as we all say 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.070
 but do not know yet he belongs to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.790
 the strongest and most powerful men

 jump editors will explain that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.970
 that was not planned at all 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.790

 occur on the sahalee archipelago or 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.540
 and his supervising editor thought 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 The separation of the gang on the archipelago 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.920
 would not generate enough tension so 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.750
 that, or in just about three 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.110
 hours the designs of supernova 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.970
 designed fact 5 in all popularity 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.710
 Votings was zorro in second place

 except for the last voting 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.409
 but the second place went with lures 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.130
 8,700 94 votes or third place 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.320
 zorro with seven 1997 votes first is 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.170
 and what remains with 9000 138 votes 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.580
 fact 6 where we just at 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.860
 popularity values are in the previous one 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.070
 voting goes there went the 31 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.800
 place Anna or 174 votes 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.200
 In the current he only landed on place 50 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.660
 even though he does not perform one 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.430
 Fact 7 had a lot in the whole series 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.400
 a lot of white has many similarities 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.290
 with whiteboard on both come from jr 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.840
 they both had about the same thing 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.420
 age both here and wild beard 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.670
 gave up their lives for their mates 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.890
 both were from a former 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.630
 subordinates killed outside the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.820
 Both were often medical 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.030
 instructed equipment and serve their weapons 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.459
 as gravestones fact 8 in the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.950
 American version it was in trays 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.610
 renamed and the americans here 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.920
 thinking again is a mystery to me 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.600
 Fact 9 bandai published in 2010 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.370
 model of the simple daun 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.840
 It consists of five blocks 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.530
 put that together in the play down 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.209
 represent 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.250
 each of these five blocks exists 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.140
 turn from several small parts and 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.489
 figures with whom he put together 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.690
 becomes 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.850
 the total height of the model is 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.400
 about 35 cm 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.640
 while one side is out of sight 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.200
 shows impel duration shows the other the 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.680
 most important and best known places of the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.750
 individual floors and facts originally 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.730
 pauli should not get red until or 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.799

 There will be another one next week 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.090
 I really wanted one piece of theory 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.030
 But today I am doing something 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.380
 ill ill ill and mine 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.430
