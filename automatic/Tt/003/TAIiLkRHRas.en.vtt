00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 what happened in that 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.370
 let's choose and here are the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.540
 Polynesians 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.720
 what are they doing we are painting 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.720
 why are we going 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:36.770
 and we're going to put these minecraft things 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.780
 the painting is coming back 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.200
 Well, I do not know what I can tell the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.200
 paints 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.800
 a painter 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.130
 here it is 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.550
 the truth is that but today we are 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.860
 Cleanie says that today he looks for a 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.860
 puppy that makes her his 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:48.630
 tendency to school today because 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.230
 we are all all videos with 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.230
 you for beginnings 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.759
 with this citation they give percent 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.620
 Many have asked us how 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.690
 paint my room and it's with blue ribbon 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.880
 this is the tape is special to paint 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.730
 search in paint shops or in 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.709
 the stores as decoration and home 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.420
 this spice to paint because if 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.760
 they use the normal tape that is the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.620
 white the paint will filter 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.840
 then I will teach this but strong 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.630
 we can do it again so they can see what it is 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.310
 what happens youtube driver breaking 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.810
 here to activate when that happens 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.420
 known in tapes the client is left 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.040
 super right there I passed peter and 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.370
 down but hey well he's super 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.950
 right on the line and thus protect your 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.849
 walls 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.610
 and this is so have their walls 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.500
 well that the paint is not filtered and so 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.519
 it was like I painted my room then it 's 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.519
 how to put like this 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.810
 in front of the wall text 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.310
 if you keep the lines to follow all 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.620
 and he paints it yes but another color of blue 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.239
 other colors also and other ge 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.500
 white and it was with the help of these 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.660
 I recommend them to tapes if they want 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.830
 painting is very good and also do not have 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.830
 your floor because I did not 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.739
 and now he is teaching application of these 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.480
 of us that I am painting see 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.040
 unleash the lack of many layers of 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.040
 done here is the thing is for 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.410
 teach the technique I tell them in case you 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.440
 he understands cutting his parents stage of the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.730
 technique to this one for there well is of 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.440
 look for a sponge with more back is already 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.269
 So simple, it 's a hundred sponge 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.890
 good bathroom than Francoist analysts 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.110
 Well it will not give any effect but 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.450
 when they start I search marine sponges 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.549
 they work to do this the pain that 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.900
 have to do is with his painting now 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.519
 which is an example of that I have to 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.440
 paint it with a few drops of paint 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.870
 black for hexagrams dark enciso 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.489
 there is a darker color that they have 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.450
 then if you add black paint 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.400
 it could work 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.690
 what they do is put this thing like this 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.519
 little bit not much 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:20.910
 remove from the paintings as well as that 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.930
 grabbed little paint and then what 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.650
 they have to do let's do what 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.650
 is clear 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.780
 Maybe you do not see it right now because 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.180
 paintings are fresh and if you look if you 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.650
 see well it will be like a 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.530
 appearance will make us a wall 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.750
 black list of red lisa is going to have a 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.360
 wall with textures a little bit more more 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.100
 dark and it looks more father and one with 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.510
 these studies that afterwards is to go through 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.700
 If you want to take some times 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.010
 walls for textures if these are 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.720
 good brightness that's why we've 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.570
 been a little behind in the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.010
 videos we saw a little bit late and in 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.620
 justice I could not raise your teeth 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:08.810
 because I've been painting what we 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.360
 I was painting all this well and 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.550
 we want to decorate here we are going to do 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.650
 other decorations also very parents and 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.250
 well at the end we will teach by laser 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.950
 the result for our videos and a 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.440
 love is uploading many videos of 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.740
 done is the same as he decided to record a 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.740
 bit 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.690
 because I have seen the beginning of colors 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:41.110
 as rafa increasingly bigger because then 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:43.770
 I like it, he did not tell me that if he smears my 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.770
 hair 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:52.139
 to my page 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.139
 although the moment 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.830
 serious 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.320
 because I do not know what 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.990
 because he was already in the hair because no 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:17.580
 has the hair is a little scared 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.580
 to fresh paint 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:26.480
 and I do not know 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.480
 [Music] 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:45.160
 since this paella is down here 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.260
 it's practically caused I do not know what 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.570
 was what it was for the sponge not 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:57.240
 I have an idea what happens to you if I give you what 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.240
 pass is not red includes red 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.320
 to record this video so that you 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.300
 they saw each other because it was not taking 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.040
 a little this week in uploading the videos 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.990
 and have gone out to see better some days 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.670
 late or very late night this is the reason 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.890
 demonstrated his worried because in addition 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.320
 when you do things like that and paint 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.570
 decorate and all that because it's not only 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.880
 that acquires the pieces to look for 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.890
 everything you are going to use you have to go 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.020
 to look for names because we want 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.630
 use armchairs to make this look 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.160
 much better and we have been delayed because 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.780
 the truth is not so easy as well as that 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.190
 there is if the first armchair that I see is that 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.569
 that I like now, they are already the 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.029
 decoration for the wall no 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:38.319
 it's not so fast to do this but good 

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:39.789
 by immense we are in the next 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.330
 video to see if this is already finished 

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:42.330
 goodbye
