how<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.550> works<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:13.549> first<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:15.360> know<00:00:15.480> of

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
how this works is first you know of

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.820 
how this works is first you know of
course<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.900> show<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> deck<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> regular

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
course I show the deck to be a regular

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.429 
course I show the deck to be a regular
deck<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.190> cards<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.359> get<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> spectator<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
deck of cards and I get the spectator to

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.980 
deck of cards and I get the spectator to
cut<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> deck<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:20.760> many<00:00:20.939> times<00:00:21.210> they<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
cut the deck as many times they like and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.920 
cut the deck as many times they like and
then<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:24.019> lead<00:00:25.019> off<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.439> ace<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.769> spades<00:00:26.070> here

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
then I lead off the ace of spades here

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.259 
then I lead off the ace of spades here
by<00:00:27.930> putting<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.949> bottom<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.029> deck

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
by putting it on the bottom of the deck

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.450 
by putting it on the bottom of the deck
now<00:00:30.929> what<00:00:31.199> has<00:00:31.320> happened<00:00:31.800> here<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.130> actually

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
now what has happened here it's actually

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.970 
now what has happened here it's actually
the<00:00:32.550> deck<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.940> set<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.630> they<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.739> cut<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the deck is set up so they can cut the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.670 
the deck is set up so they can cut the
deck<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.340> many<00:00:35.520> times<00:00:35.790> as<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.690> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
deck as many times as they like and it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.910 
deck as many times as they like and it
just<00:00:37.860> shifts<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.160> cards<00:00:38.550> around<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.920> when

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
just shifts the cards around and when

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.220 
just shifts the cards around and when
you<00:00:41.010> look<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.340> ace<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.670> spades<00:00:41.989> that<00:00:42.989> just

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you look for the ace of spades that just

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.869 
you look for the ace of spades that just
simply<00:00:43.350> resets<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> deck<00:00:44.219> back<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.700> its

simply resets the deck back to its

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.560 
simply resets the deck back to its
original<00:00:45.000> setup<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.739> setup<00:00:47.039> goes<00:00:47.570> this

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
original setup and the setup goes this

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.470 
original setup and the setup goes this
way<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.710> other<00:00:50.010> following<00:00:50.700> aces<00:00:51.180> are

way the other following aces are
actually<00:00:52.350> sitting<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.760> first<00:00:54.230> it<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.469> any

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
actually sitting the first it can be any

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.369 
actually sitting the first it can be any
of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> other<00:00:56.010> three<00:00:56.250> aces<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.670> course<00:00:57.379> the

the setup and you can leave the deck

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.160 
the setup and you can leave the deck
aside<00:01:28.770> after<00:01:29.070> you've<00:01:29.600> moved<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> ace<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.140> the

aside after you've moved the ace to the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
bottom and then it's time to do the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.630 
bottom and then it's time to do the
mathematical<00:01:35.520> part<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> trick<00:01:36.060> now<00:01:37.640> how

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
mathematical part of the trick now how

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.899 
mathematical part of the trick now how
this<00:01:38.939> works<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.650> if<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.770> follow<00:01:41.070> exactly<00:01:41.340> how

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
this works is if you follow exactly how

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.420 
this works is if you follow exactly how
I<00:01:42.180> showed<00:01:42.659> him<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> effect<00:01:43.229> when<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.250> ask

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
I showed him the effect when you ask

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.530 
I showed him the effect when you ask
them<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.149> ask<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.570> first<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.930> write<00:01:46.200> their

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
them you ask them first to write their

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.330 
them you ask them first to write their
year<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.570> birth<00:01:48.899> night<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
year of birth night and you know the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.569 
year of birth night and you know the
four<00:01:50.520> digit<00:01:50.549> year<00:01:51.619> nineteen<00:01:52.619> whatever<00:01:52.979> or

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
four digit year nineteen whatever or

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.249 
four digit year nineteen whatever or
2000<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.360> whatever<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:57.840> course<00:01:58.079> they

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
2000 and whatever of course they

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.550 
2000 and whatever of course they
wouldn't<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.710> very<00:01:58.860> old<00:01:59.930> after<00:02:00.930> 2000<00:02:01.439> but

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
wouldn't be very old after 2000 but

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
wouldn't be very old after 2000 but
anyways<00:02:02.119> regardless<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.630> could<00:02:03.750> still

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
anyways regardless you could still

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.960 
anyways regardless you could still
probably<00:02:04.200> perform<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.710 

so<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:10.440> write<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.800> year<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.130> birth<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.720> you

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
so you write the year of birth and you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.230 
so you write the year of birth and you
write<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.650> get<00:02:13.800> them<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.100> write<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.610> memorable

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
write you get them to write a memorable

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.740 
write you get them to write a memorable
year<00:02:15.300> can<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:16.700> any<00:02:17.700> year<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.180> doesn't<00:02:18.270> matter

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.390 

the<00:02:21.750> important<00:02:22.170> thing<00:02:22.350> happens<00:02:22.950> next<00:02:23.160> when

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the important thing happens next when

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.780 
the important thing happens next when
you<00:02:23.490> go<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:23.970> two-digit<00:02:24.900> numbers<00:02:25.790> that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
you go for the two-digit numbers that

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.920 
you go for the two-digit numbers that
seem<00:02:27.120> quite<00:02:27.360> random<00:02:27.780> really<00:02:28.350> what<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.040> is

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
seem quite random really what it is is

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.120 
seem quite random really what it is is
let<00:02:30.930> me<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.170> I'll<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:31.560> write<00:02:31.710> my<00:02:31.860> years

let me just I'll just write my years

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.530 
let me just I'll just write my years
again<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.490> i<00:02:32.580> use<00:02:32.750> 1971<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:35.240> 1989<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.450> my

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
again that i use 1971 and 1989 in my

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.670 
again that i use 1971 and 1989 in my
case<00:02:36.920> now<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.280> wrote<00:02:38.670> my<00:02:38.850> age<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.480> had<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.260> add<00:02:40.410> one

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
case now I wrote my age I had to add one

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.260 
case now I wrote my age I had to add one
because<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.070> haven't<00:02:41.400> had<00:02:41.459> my<00:02:41.640> birthday<00:02:42.060> yet

because I haven't had my birthday yet

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.490 
because I haven't had my birthday yet
this<00:02:42.420> year<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:42.959> important<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.470> you

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
this year it's important that you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.390 
this year it's important that you
mentioned<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.780> had<00:02:46.410> one<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.800> my<00:02:46.920> age<00:02:47.070> to

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
mentioned that so I had one to my age to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.680 
mentioned that so I had one to my age to
make<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.670> 39<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.590> important<00:02:50.070> because

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
make it 39 this is important because

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.930 
make it 39 this is important because
when<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.110> add<00:02:52.290> their<00:02:52.560> age<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:53.459> their<00:02:53.610> year<00:02:53.910> of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
when you add their age to their year of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.760 
when you add their age to their year of
birth<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.570> will<00:02:54.690> see<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.260> actually<00:02:55.290> adds

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
birth you will see that it actually adds

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.820 
birth you will see that it actually adds
up<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.630> 2010<00:02:57.680> present<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.220> present<00:02:59.550> year<00:02:59.760> and

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
up to 2010 present the present year and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.340 
up to 2010 present the present year and
the<00:03:01.830> same<00:03:02.010> goes<00:03:02.070> for<00:03:02.780> their<00:03:03.780> memorable<00:03:04.290> year

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
the same goes for their memorable year

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.880 
the same goes for their memorable year
when<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.430> add<00:03:05.670> when<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.239> ask<00:03:06.510> them<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.140> jot

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
when you add when you ask them to jot

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.060 
when you add when you ask them to jot
down<00:03:08.420> how<00:03:09.420> many<00:03:09.600> years<00:03:09.930> ago<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.530> this

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
down how many years ago that this

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.199 
down how many years ago that this
particular<00:03:11.520> date<00:03:12.239> happened<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.970> know<00:03:15.090> it

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
particular date happened you know it

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.670 
particular date happened you know it
just<00:03:15.360> seems<00:03:15.600> like<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.780> random<00:03:16.110> two-digit

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
just seems like a random two-digit

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.110 
just seems like a random two-digit
number<00:03:16.920> at<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.130> time<00:03:17.370> when<00:03:17.610> they<00:03:17.730> write<00:03:17.910> down

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
number at the time when they write down

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.300 
number at the time when they write down
that<00:03:18.330> this<00:03:18.540> happened<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.170> my<00:03:19.350> case<00:03:19.560> 21<00:03:20.100> years

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
that this happened in my case 21 years

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.949 
that this happened in my case 21 years
ago<00:03:20.870> when<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.959> add<00:03:22.080> 21<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.280> year<00:03:24.030> that

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
ago when you add 21 to that year that

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.050 
ago when you add 21 to that year that
will<00:03:25.080> also<00:03:25.440> add<00:03:25.680> up<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.549> present<00:03:26.880> year

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
will also add up to the present year

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.350 
will also add up to the present year
2010<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.400> see<00:03:29.640> now<00:03:29.850> when<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.209> add<00:03:30.330> all

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
2010 so you can see now when you add all

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.620 
2010 so you can see now when you add all
these<00:03:30.660> all<00:03:31.080> these<00:03:31.580> numbers<00:03:32.580> together<00:03:33.150> you're

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
these all these numbers together you're

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.830 
these all these numbers together you're
actually<00:03:33.780> adding<00:03:34.080> 2010<00:03:34.860> 2<00:03:34.980> 2010<00:03:35.730> which<00:03:36.090> brings

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
actually adding 2010 2 2010 which brings

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.080 
actually adding 2010 2 2010 which brings
you<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.110> course<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:39.320> 4020<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.799> needless<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.760> say

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
you of course to 4020 so needless to say

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.699 
you of course to 4020 so needless to say
no<00:03:42.900> matter<00:03:43.340> what<00:03:44.340> years<00:03:44.580> they<00:03:44.760> choose<00:03:45.709> they

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
no matter what years they choose they

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.430 
no matter what years they choose they
will<00:03:46.860> always<00:03:47.160> arrive<00:03:47.489> at<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.090> 4020<00:03:49.080> answer

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
will always arrive at this 4020 answer

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.320 
will always arrive at this 4020 answer
and<00:03:49.940> of<00:03:50.940> course<00:03:51.410> this<00:03:52.410> trick<00:03:52.830> this<00:03:53.670> version<00:03:54.180> of

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
and of course this trick this version of

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.390 
and of course this trick this version of
the<00:03:54.390> trick<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:55.320> will<00:03:55.440> only<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:56.010> only<00:03:56.040> have

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
the trick you will only you only have

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.050 
the trick you will only you only have
basically<00:03:56.760> six<00:03:57.090> months<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.600> perform<00:03:58.260> it

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
basically six months to perform it

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.810 
basically six months to perform it
because<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.299> course<00:04:00.540> it's<00:04:00.720> based<00:04:00.930> on<00:04:01.110> 2010<00:04:01.920> but

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
because of course it's based on 2010 but

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.060 
because of course it's based on 2010 but
of<00:04:03.390> course<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:04.079> could<00:04:04.230> think<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.920> can

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
of course you could think of you can

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.789 
of course you could think of you can
figure<00:04:05.250> out<00:04:05.400> how<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.260> 2011<00:04:07.260> version<00:04:07.620> would

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
figure out how the 2011 version would

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.819 
figure out how the 2011 version would
work<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.820> 2012<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.739> know

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
work and the 2012 and so on you know

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.949 
work and the 2012 and so on you know
based<00:04:11.100> on<00:04:11.250> these<00:04:11.430> principles<00:04:11.840> you're<00:04:12.840> going

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
based on these principles you're going

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.330 
based on these principles you're going
to<00:04:13.019> have<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.470> know<00:04:13.560> slightly<00:04:14.010> different

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
to have you know slightly different

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.430 
to have you know slightly different
answer<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:15.390> know<00:04:15.480> if<00:04:15.570> it's<00:04:15.690> 2011<00:04:16.349> you're

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
answer you know if it's 2011 you're

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.449 
answer you know if it's 2011 you're
going<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.620> have<00:04:17.630> 4022<00:04:18.630> instead<00:04:19.200> of

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
going to have 4022 instead of

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.980 
going to have 4022 instead of
1020<00:04:20.269> but<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.919> know<00:04:22.039> again<00:04:22.580> when<00:04:23.509> you<00:04:23.600> proceed

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
1020 but you know again when you proceed

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.969 
1020 but you know again when you proceed
to<00:04:24.139> do<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.470> list<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.919> two<00:04:25.759> digit<00:04:26.180> numbers

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
to do the list of two digit numbers

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.570 
to do the list of two digit numbers
you're<00:04:27.979> going<00:04:28.099> to<00:04:28.160> have<00:04:28.220> slightly<00:04:28.460> different

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
you're going to have slightly different

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.890 
you're going to have slightly different
two<00:04:28.910> digit<00:04:29.150> numbers<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:29.539> you'll<00:04:29.630> just<00:04:29.780> have

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
two digit numbers and you'll just have

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.740 
two digit numbers and you'll just have
to<00:04:30.020> figure<00:04:30.349> out<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:31.729> new<00:04:32.060> positions<00:04:32.539> in<00:04:32.660> the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
to figure out the new positions in the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.059 
to figure out the new positions in the
deck<00:04:32.900> for<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.169> aces<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:36.220> and<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:37.430> forth<00:04:37.699> so<00:04:39.069> so

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
deck for the aces and and so forth so so

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.490 
deck for the aces and and so forth so so
anyways<00:04:40.729> based<00:04:41.690> on<00:04:41.900> let's<00:04:42.139> go<00:04:42.259> back<00:04:42.470> to

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
anyways based on let's go back to

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.140 
anyways based on let's go back to
hearsay<00:04:43.930> 4020<00:04:44.930> was<00:04:45.139> the<00:04:45.289> original<00:04:45.650> answer<00:04:46.150> you

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
hearsay 4020 was the original answer you

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.240 
hearsay 4020 was the original answer you
can<00:04:47.300> see<00:04:47.509> that<00:04:47.539> you<00:04:48.199> can<00:04:48.319> only<00:04:48.500> get<00:04:48.770> four

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
can see that you can only get four

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.879 
can see that you can only get four
two-digit<00:04:50.150> numbers<00:04:50.419> out<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.560> you<00:04:51.650> got

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
two-digit numbers out of that so you got

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.120 
two-digit numbers out of that so you got
you<00:04:52.160> know<00:04:52.419> 2440<00:04:55.180> 2042<00:04:56.180> and<00:04:57.169> that's<00:04:57.770> all<00:04:57.979> you

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
you know 2440 2042 and that's all you

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.740 
you know 2440 2042 and that's all you
can<00:04:58.220> get<00:04:58.430> so<00:05:00.039> and<00:05:01.039> then<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.729> ask<00:05:01.970> them<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.419> list

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
can get so and then you ask them to list

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.110 
can get so and then you ask them to list
them<00:05:02.960> from<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.800> least<00:05:04.039> two<00:05:04.460> digit<00:05:04.759> number<00:05:05.000> to

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
them from the least two digit number to

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.409 
them from the least two digit number to
the<00:05:05.210> greatest<00:05:05.449> two-digit<00:05:06.020> number<00:05:06.289> and<00:05:07.419> you

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
the greatest two-digit number and you

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.909 
the greatest two-digit number and you
know<00:05:09.400> in<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:11.030> effect<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.479> course<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.919> mentioned

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
know in the effect of course I mentioned

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.120 
know in the effect of course I mentioned
about<00:05:13.330> you<00:05:14.330> may<00:05:14.479> have<00:05:14.659> more<00:05:14.900> numbers<00:05:15.320> and<00:05:15.800> you

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
about you may have more numbers and you

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.809 
about you may have more numbers and you
know<00:05:16.960> you<00:05:17.960> know<00:05:18.050> I<00:05:18.080> just<00:05:18.289> made<00:05:18.440> up<00:05:18.699> you<00:05:19.699> know

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
know you know I just made up you know

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.270 
know you know I just made up you know
just<00:05:20.060> i<00:05:20.690> just<00:05:21.080> added<00:05:21.470> that<00:05:21.710> to<00:05:21.860> just<00:05:22.039> kind<00:05:22.220> of

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
just i just added that to just kind of

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.580 
just i just added that to just kind of
throw<00:05:22.639> throw<00:05:23.419> you<00:05:23.479> off<00:05:23.780> a<00:05:23.810> bit<00:05:24.139> so<00:05:24.320> that<00:05:24.349> it

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
throw throw you off a bit so that it

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.950 
throw throw you off a bit so that it
wasn't<00:05:24.860> too<00:05:24.949> obvious<00:05:25.400> for<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.789> effect<00:05:26.150> but

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
wasn't too obvious for the effect but

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.420 
wasn't too obvious for the effect but
really<00:05:27.289> of<00:05:27.409> course<00:05:27.680> you're<00:05:28.039> going<00:05:28.159> to<00:05:28.250> have

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
really of course you're going to have

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.260 
really of course you're going to have
these<00:05:28.580> numbers<00:05:29.000> in<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:30.500> final<00:05:31.060> part<00:05:32.060> of<00:05:32.180> this

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
these numbers in the final part of this

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.240 
these numbers in the final part of this
trick<00:05:32.509> anyways<00:05:32.870> so<00:05:33.940> then<00:05:35.110> at<00:05:36.110> having<00:05:37.009> the<00:05:37.099> deck

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
trick anyways so then at having the deck

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.770 
trick anyways so then at having the deck
set<00:05:37.460> up<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.699> way<00:05:37.820> I<00:05:37.849> showed<00:05:38.120> you<00:05:38.330> it<00:05:38.479> will<00:05:38.570> work

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
set up the way I showed you it will work

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.920 
set up the way I showed you it will work
out<00:05:38.930> always<00:05:39.380> that<00:05:39.949> when<00:05:40.099> you<00:05:40.690> start<00:05:41.690> with<00:05:41.840> the

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
out always that when you start with the

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.860 
out always that when you start with the
least<00:05:42.110> number<00:05:42.229> 20<00:05:42.860> and<00:05:43.180> then<00:05:44.180> work<00:05:44.570> up<00:05:44.750> to<00:05:45.080> 24

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
least number 20 and then work up to 24

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.010 
least number 20 and then work up to 24
40<00:05:47.870> and<00:05:48.110> 42<00:05:49.150> when<00:05:50.150> you<00:05:50.240> deal<00:05:50.449> just<00:05:50.719> the<00:05:50.840> way<00:05:50.960> you

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
40 and 42 when you deal just the way you

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.649 
40 and 42 when you deal just the way you
saw<00:05:51.259> in<00:05:51.409> the<00:05:51.440> effect<00:05:51.860> you<00:05:52.159> will<00:05:52.940> arrive<00:05:53.240> at<00:05:53.479> all
