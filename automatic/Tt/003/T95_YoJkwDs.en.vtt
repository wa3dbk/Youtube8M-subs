00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.480
 this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:22.680
 and so the first videos we will have 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.620
 joint i mean i will talk about 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.580
 tom what buttons have your sneakers what 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.820
 buttons have an iphone then we 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.400
 decided to divide the training specifically 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.540
 separately done by iPhone and separately 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.970
 make the field so further 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.370
 naturally touch and magician means 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.000
 why so because bitter experience 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.800
 faced with some difficulties 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.590
 different well programs are the same yes only 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.380
 some here no some no here 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.090
 they are here that is but about like that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.950
 and again they look a little bit 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 differently means and so we decided 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.040
 divide here and of course the very beginning 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.770
 we will tell you on both devices 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.149
 so the first thing I wanted to say is what 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.060
 there are buttons in general 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.060
 what could be needed to work with ipad 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.430
 and each of the buttons separately we will 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.900
 consider in those programs that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.410
 will need 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.489
 then the first most important thing is yes 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.280
 the home key that is this button means and 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.459
 which goes to the main desktop 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.970
 but here we will not tell further and 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.519
 just as she is at the iPhone here 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.930
 we have a video call camera 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.650
 either self portraits means iphone too 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.540
 there is this camera is to the left of 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.790
 dynamics on iphone there 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.709
 additionally means the dynamics where you 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.160
 hear your interlocutor 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.280
 But you say when you apply to 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.299
 here's the ear 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.310
 for conversation and note here 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.290
 there is such. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.739
 that's where 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.719
 well this is noise cancellation that is 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.329
 you can stand the world in the evil column on 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:20.939
 some concert and your interlocutor 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:23.459
 hears further here will be mean speaker 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.109
 which but microphone yes I confused 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.260
 what about the speaker here which 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.459
 reproduces the sound and here at the iPad 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.200
 there is only 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.640
 well, something like this 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.439
 is here here here below 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.239
 further they both have room for 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:46.470
 You will insert the wires of the date of your holes 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:49.169
 here and to the iPhone here further so but our 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.900

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.799
 I have this layout is so old 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.870
 aypada means at the rear there's a camera so that 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.579
 there is which you shoot at iphone 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.239

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.970

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.639
 next the key to turn them on and a and then the poet 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.560

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.690
 either on the contrary it also turns off 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.260
 keys exist to lock the screen 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.970
 and the iPhone just as it keys 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:28.349
