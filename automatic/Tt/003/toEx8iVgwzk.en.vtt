instead<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.140> seventeen<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.649> one<00:01:54.679> and<00:01:55.460> I've

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
instead of seventeen to one and I've

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.160 
instead of seventeen to one and I've
been<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.090> road<00:01:56.300> diet<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.660> is<00:01:56.840> fantastic

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
been on a road diet this is fantastic

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.020 
been on a road diet this is fantastic
fun<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.830> connection<00:01:58.220> feel<00:01:58.429> to<00:01:58.880> what's

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
fun and the connection feel to what's

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.080 
fun and the connection feel to what's
going<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.509> you<00:02:00.140> really<00:02:00.560> feel<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.920> difference

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
going on you really feel the difference

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.840 
going on you really feel the difference
there's<00:02:02.090> three<00:02:02.360> settings<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:02.990> dampers<00:02:03.440> now

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
there's three settings in dampers now

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.400 
there's three settings in dampers now
which<00:02:04.850> allow<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.149> to<00:02:05.509> choose<00:02:06.080> your<00:02:06.259> mood

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
which allow you to choose your mood

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.400 
which allow you to choose your mood
effectively<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.810> there's<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.899> sport<00:02:09.229> map

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
effectively and there's a sport map

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.230 
effectively and there's a sport map
which<00:02:09.619> affects<00:02:09.950> throttle<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.610> transmission

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
which affects throttle and transmission

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.350 
which affects throttle and transmission
calibration<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.740> all<00:02:13.069> these<00:02:13.370> options<00:02:13.640> allow

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
calibration so all these options allow

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.199 
calibration so all these options allow
you<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.870> really<00:02:15.709> make<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.340> car<00:02:16.550> come<00:02:16.760> lively

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
you to really make the car come lively

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.740 
you to really make the car come lively
feel<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.709> which<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.860> much<00:02:19.730> versus<00:02:20.209> completely

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
feel it which is much versus completely

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.490 
feel it which is much versus completely
a<00:02:20.780> step<00:02:21.020> forward<00:02:21.440> for<00:02:21.650> where<00:02:22.250> we<00:02:22.370> are<00:02:22.490> with<00:02:22.640> DBS

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
a step forward for where we are with DBS

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.270 
a step forward for where we are with DBS
the<00:02:24.500> same<00:02:24.680> way<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.130> pretty

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
the same way this is a pretty

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.010 
the same way this is a pretty
spectacular<00:02:25.610> rarity<00:02:26.390> because<00:02:26.569> to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
spectacular rarity because to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.130 
spectacular rarity because to
demonstrate<00:02:27.709> its<00:02:27.980> Italian<00:02:28.270> 7<00:02:29.270> yeah<00:02:29.930> it's

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
demonstrate its Italian 7 yeah it's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140 
demonstrate its Italian 7 yeah it's
something<00:02:30.319> else<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.740> mean<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.370> come<00:02:31.640> here<00:02:31.910> to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
something else I mean you come here to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.750 
something else I mean you come here to
Sierra<00:02:32.750> Nevada<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:33.410> guess<00:02:33.800> for<00:02:34.160> these<00:02:34.310> sorts<00:02:34.700> of

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
Sierra Nevada I guess for these sorts of

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.339 
Sierra Nevada I guess for these sorts of
roads<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.330> what<00:02:35.510> are<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.690> other<00:02:35.900> challenges

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
roads but what are the other challenges

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.420 
roads but what are the other challenges
you<00:02:36.470> know<00:02:36.560> one<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.950> other<00:02:36.980> things<00:02:37.340> that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
you know one of the other things that

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.190 
you know one of the other things that
you<00:02:37.610> can<00:02:37.760> demonstrate<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.510> mean<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:38.840> come<00:02:38.990> here

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
you can demonstrate I mean we come here

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.449 
you can demonstrate I mean we come here
for<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.349> number<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.620> things<00:02:39.680> what<00:02:40.099> we're<00:02:40.220> doing

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
for a number of things what we're doing

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.860 
for a number of things what we're doing
now<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.760> we're<00:02:40.910> climbing<00:02:41.090> up<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.480> mountain

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
now is we're climbing up the mountain

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.199 
now is we're climbing up the mountain
Sierra<00:02:42.200> Nevada<00:02:42.440> range<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.610> we're<00:02:43.880> going<00:02:44.060> from

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
Sierra Nevada range and we're going from

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.640 
Sierra Nevada range and we're going from
sea<00:02:44.450> level<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.780> two<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.140> half<00:02:45.260> thousand

meters<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.250> mean<00:02:46.880> for<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> number<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.930> reasons

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
meters I mean for a number of reasons

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.900 
meters I mean for a number of reasons
that's<00:02:48.470> challenging<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.160> car<00:02:49.370> for<00:02:49.849> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
that's challenging for a car for the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.089 
that's challenging for a car for the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
we're looking at now is is the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.559 
we're looking at now is is the
fine-tuning<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.069> systems<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.819> make<00:03:18.390> sure

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
fine-tuning of the systems to make sure

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.570 
fine-tuning of the systems to make sure
that<00:03:18.870> everything<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.560> refined<00:03:20.160> as<00:03:20.310> we<00:03:20.430> can

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
that everything is refined as we can

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.430 
that everything is refined as we can
make<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.910> at<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> time<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:22.050> we're<00:03:22.319> getting

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
make it at the time and we're getting

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.119 
make it at the time and we're getting
ready<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:22.860> job<00:03:23.040> 1<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.970> when<00:03:24.360> will<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.720> be

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
ready for job 1 and when will you be

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.259 
ready for job 1 and when will you be
happy

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.369 

typical<00:03:30.269> engineering<00:03:30.690> there's<00:03:31.110> always

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
typical engineering there's always

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.960 
typical engineering there's always
something<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:31.980> can<00:03:32.220> fix<00:03:32.370> there's<00:03:32.819> always

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
something you can fix there's always

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.369 
something you can fix there's always
something<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:33.660> make<00:03:33.780> better<00:03:33.989> and

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
something you can make better and

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.500 
something you can make better and
generally<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.670> have<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.879> be<00:03:35.970> told<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.390> we're

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
generally we have to be told that we're

never really be sure about the car until

never really be sure about the car until
