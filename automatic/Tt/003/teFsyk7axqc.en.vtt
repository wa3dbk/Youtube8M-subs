00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:08.070
 this is the top 100 of video games 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.070
 inspector favorites 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 number 62 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.830
 serves canvas cars 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.110
 I do not know why but I've never been 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.570
 kirby fan I played both his 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.880
 nintendo games and super nintendo but 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.550
 I do not see anything special outside of being 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.310
 a good platform game but what 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.200
 yes it took me totally by surprise is 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.050
 that the game that I most enjoyed 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.239
 Kirby's was totally different from his 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.190
 style although if you think about it well it's something 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.559
 obvious because it was one thing you do not like 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.950
 us but good which was kill 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.220
 bill 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.470
 canvas corts for nintendo and is the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.020
 I really just thought about playing this game 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.690
 a few minutes to try it but at 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.899
 doing it was impossible for me to stop 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.989
 play it given how addictive this is 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.450
 I did not see better game in the 10 that I did 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.580
 such use of the stylus the truth that the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 draw the path that kirby has 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.160
 that going is a unique experience 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.979
 incredibly addictive the design of 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.890
 Game characters is bright and 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.500
 will always have your brain active for 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.720
 react quickly and solve 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.850
 the situations that are presented to you 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.670
 in fact I have nothing more to say 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.220
 of this game it's as simple as that but it's 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.259
 exactly what I like about the game to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.690
 Sometimes simple things are the most 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.540
 difficult to achieve and this game does it 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.820
 with mastery I certainly agree 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.360
 with what the game commercial said 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.030
 playing is good and kirk and canvas corts is 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.030
 my favorite game kirby certainly
