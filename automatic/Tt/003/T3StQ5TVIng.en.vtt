00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
trademark the bat shape alone so they

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.670 
trademark the bat shape alone so they
had<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.330> add<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.629> yellow<00:02:33.780> oval<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.260> yes<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
know none of that had anything to do

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.250 
know none of that had anything to do
with<00:02:35.970> superheroes<00:02:36.450> having<00:02:36.690> white<00:02:36.810> eyes<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.230> I
