drive which is sort of but not so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.350 
drive which is sort of but not so
obvious<00:01:51.210> thing<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:52.250> hair<00:01:53.250> vitamins<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:54.000> you've

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
obvious thing is hair vitamins if you've

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.440 
obvious thing is hair vitamins if you've
ever<00:01:54.479> heard<00:01:54.750> someone<00:01:55.610> say<00:01:56.610> something<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:57.119> my

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
ever heard someone say something like my

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.569 
ever heard someone say something like my
hair<00:01:57.689> grew<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.380> much<00:01:58.409> well<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.009> pregnant<00:01:59.399> it's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
hair grew so much well as pregnant it's

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.170 
hair grew so much well as pregnant it's
probably<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.030> prenatal<00:02:00.630> vitamins<00:02:01.049> they<00:02:01.200> take

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
probably the prenatal vitamins they take

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.940 
probably the prenatal vitamins they take
so<00:02:03.180> those<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.750> lot<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.899> biotin<00:02:04.619> into<00:02:04.829> my

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
so those have a lot of biotin into my

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.319 
so those have a lot of biotin into my
belief<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.670> take<00:02:05.820> biotin

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
grow longer faster so that's definitely

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690 
grow longer faster so that's definitely
something<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.200> look<00:02:28.230> into<00:02:28.530> if<00:02:29.430> you're<00:02:29.549> having

strand you will be able to see it on
here<00:04:14.699> so<00:04:14.849> i<00:04:14.910> will<00:04:15.060> find<00:04:15.239> on<00:04:15.389> but<00:04:15.720> it's<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.900> single

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
here so i will find on but it's a single

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.229 
here so i will find on but it's a single
na<00:04:16.320> nice<00:04:16.530> trend<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.859> think<00:04:17.280> it's<00:04:17.430> up<00:04:17.609> for<00:04:18.000> a

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
na nice trend I think it's up for a

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.900 
na nice trend I think it's up for a
type-4<00:04:18.750> curl<00:04:19.289> trait<00:04:20.250> sort<00:04:20.699> of<00:04:20.789> thing<00:04:20.880> that

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
type-4 curl trait sort of thing that

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.029 
type-4 curl trait sort of thing that
usually<00:04:21.150> happens<00:04:21.659> but<00:04:21.930> if<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.680> have<00:04:22.890> them

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
usually happens but if you have them

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.250 
usually happens but if you have them
post<00:04:23.340> below<00:04:23.550> because<00:04:23.640> I'm<00:04:23.789> just<00:04:23.969> curious<00:04:24.260> but

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
post below because I'm just curious but

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.960 
post below because I'm just curious but
anyways<00:04:25.560> discussing<00:04:26.219> you<00:04:26.700> go

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
anyways discussing you go

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.100 
anyways discussing you go
through<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.390> find<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:27.690> strand<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.930> hair

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
through and you find a strand of hair

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.080 
through and you find a strand of hair
and<00:04:28.320> then<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.650> cut<00:04:28.890> off<00:04:29.040> section<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
and then you cut off section of the

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.430 
and then you cut off section of the
split<00:04:30.390> end<00:04:30.540> or<00:04:30.780> maybe<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.020> single<00:04:31.290> shin<00:04:31.410> or

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
split end or maybe the single shin or

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.550 
split end or maybe the single shin or
not<00:04:33.140> and<00:04:34.140> then<00:04:34.980> you<00:04:35.990> just<00:04:36.990> go<00:04:37.230> through<00:04:37.440> your

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
not and then you just go through your

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.170 
not and then you just go through your
whole<00:04:37.710> here<00:04:37.950> um<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.520> helps<00:04:38.670> to<00:04:38.850> do<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.060> over

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
whole here um it helps to do it over

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.120 
whole here um it helps to do it over
like<00:04:39.420> a<00:04:39.480> plain<00:04:40.080> background<00:04:40.320> like<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.830> wall<00:04:41.100> or

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
like a plain background like a wall or

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.150 
like a plain background like a wall or
blend<00:04:41.970> carpet<00:04:42.390> by<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.170> way<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.500> lots<00:04:44.040> of

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
blend carpet by the way and lots of

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.710 
blend carpet by the way and lots of
light<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.970> go<00:04:45.120> through<00:04:45.300> your<00:04:45.330> whole<00:04:45.510> hair

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
light and you go through your whole hair

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.460 
light and you go through your whole hair
so<00:04:46.410> it's<00:04:46.770> rather<00:04:47.190> tedious<00:04:47.540> but<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:49.320> don't

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
so it's rather tedious but you don't

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.150 
so it's rather tedious but you don't
have<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.620> kind<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:49.920> as<00:04:50.160> much<00:04:51.740> remember<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:53.040> get

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
have to kind of as much remember to get

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.310 
have to kind of as much remember to get
frequent<00:04:53.550> but<00:04:53.970> not<00:04:54.240> too<00:04:54.600> frequent<00:04:55.050> trims

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
frequent but not too frequent trims

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.980 
frequent but not too frequent trims
because<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.370> submit<00:04:56.700> that<00:04:57.300> hair<00:04:57.510> goes<00:04:57.720> longer

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
because it submit that hair goes longer

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.220 
because it submit that hair goes longer
if<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.170> trim<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.440> more<00:04:58.620> often<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.150> um<00:05:00.230> it's

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
if you trim it more often and um it's

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.950 
if you trim it more often and um it's
better<00:05:01.470> to<00:05:02.130> go<00:05:02.280> try<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.210> stretch<00:05:03.600> your<00:05:03.630> time

just be patient growing here is a

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.370 
just be patient growing here is a
gradual<00:05:45.150> process<00:05:45.210> some<00:05:45.750> people's<00:05:46.050> hair<00:05:46.169> grows

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
gradual process some people's hair grows

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.200 
gradual process some people's hair grows
longer<00:05:46.590> than<00:05:46.800> others<00:05:46.860> earlier<00:05:47.580> takes<00:05:47.970> longer

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
longer than others earlier takes longer

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.780 
longer than others earlier takes longer
because<00:05:48.330> it<00:05:48.600> coils<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:49.200> it<00:05:49.860> shrinks<00:05:50.160> from<00:05:50.430> its

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
because it coils and it shrinks from its

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.870 
because it coils and it shrinks from its
actual<00:05:51.150> length<00:05:51.710> when<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:52.800> dries<00:05:53.010> so<00:05:53.669> it's

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
actual length when it dries so it's

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.850 
actual length when it dries so it's
obviously<00:05:54.240> going<00:05:54.450> to<00:05:54.540> be<00:05:54.690> harder<00:05:54.990> for<00:05:55.200> curly

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860
