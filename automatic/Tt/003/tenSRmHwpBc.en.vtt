00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.030 
move on to now is some decision making
for<00:00:15.540> netball<00:00:15.930> and<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.350> all<00:00:16.619> around

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040

decisions<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:18.350> moving<00:00:19.350> into<00:00:19.680> space<00:00:20.040> we're

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
decisions of moving into space we're

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.980 
decisions of moving into space we're
going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> little<00:00:21.090> exercise<00:00:21.480> called

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
going to do a little exercise called

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.679 
going to do a little exercise called
spaces<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.520> you<00:00:23.610> just<00:00:23.790> look<00:00:24.090> at<00:00:24.300> where<00:00:24.540> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
spaces so can you just look at where the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.400 
spaces so can you just look at where the
spot<00:00:24.990> markers<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.980> here<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.410> that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
spot markers are here and that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.089 
spot markers are here and that
represents<00:00:29.330> four<00:00:30.330> different<00:00:31.230> spaces<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
represents four different spaces and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.520 
represents four different spaces and
we've<00:00:32.309> also<00:00:32.489> got<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> fifth<00:00:33.239> space<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:34.110> which

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
we've also got a fifth space here which

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.299 
we've also got a fifth space here which
is<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> black<00:00:35.129> circle<00:00:35.699> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.780> middle<00:00:37.309> really

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
is the black circle in the middle really

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.700 
is the black circle in the middle really
simple<00:00:38.520> exercise<00:00:39.210> all<00:00:39.989> you're<00:00:40.199> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.470> do

simple exercise all you're going to do

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.430 
simple exercise all you're going to do
is<00:00:40.980> there<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.309> four<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.360> five<00:00:42.930> spaces

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is there are four of you and five spaces

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.580 
is there are four of you and five spaces
you're<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> start<00:00:44.880> off<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:46.380> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
you're all going to start off in one of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.540 
you're all going to start off in one of
the<00:00:46.739> spaces<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:48.719> idea<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:50.250> only

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the spaces and the idea is you can only

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.170 
the spaces and the idea is you can only
throw<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> ball<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:52.070> somebody<00:00:53.070> who<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.610> moving

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
throw the ball to somebody who is moving

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.350 
throw the ball to somebody who is moving
to<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.890> spaces<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.329> only

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to one of the spaces and there will only

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.029 
to one of the spaces and there will only
be<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:58.200> free<00:00:59.129> space<00:01:01.489> ok<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:04.379> we're<00:01:04.619> walk<00:01:04.800> this

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
be one free space ok so we're walk this

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.760 
be one free space ok so we're walk this
through<00:01:05.119> now<00:01:06.119> where's<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.289> space<00:01:08.090> okay<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:10.530> he

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
through now where's the space okay is he

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.719 
through now where's the space okay is he
would<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> take<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> space<00:01:11.910> then

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
would you like to take the space then

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.430 
would you like to take the space then
she's<00:01:14.729> driving<00:01:15.300> in<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.600> she<00:01:15.720> takes<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.229> ball

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
she's driving in and she takes the ball

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.380 
she's driving in and she takes the ball
so<00:01:17.399> where's<00:01:17.789> now<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.119> space<00:01:19.220> ok<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:21.030> she<00:01:21.090> needs

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
so where's now the space ok so she needs

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.529 
so where's now the space ok so she needs
to<00:01:21.569> pivot<00:01:22.160> somebody<00:01:23.160> needs<00:01:23.459> to<00:01:23.700> drive<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.300> and

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
to pivot somebody needs to drive on and

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.809 
to pivot somebody needs to drive on and
be<00:01:25.289> there<00:01:25.649> good<00:01:26.429> girl<00:01:26.869> where's<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> space<00:01:28.819> who

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
be there good girl where's the space who

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:42.410 
be there good girl where's the space who
could<00:01:30.030> take<00:01:30.209> that<00:01:30.420> space<00:01:32.959> great<00:01:34.190> ok

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.479
