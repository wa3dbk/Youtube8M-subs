00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
show you the silverstone Sugo SG o 2f

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.850 
show you the silverstone Sugo SG o 2f
this<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.760> successor<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.510> SG<00:00:10.110> o<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.260> as

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
this is the successor to the SG o to as

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.829 
this is the successor to the SG o to as
the<00:00:11.040> SG<00:00:11.460> o<00:00:11.490> 2f<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.230> micro<00:00:14.070> ATX

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
the SG o 2f this is the micro ATX

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.620 
the SG o 2f this is the micro ATX
version<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.070> go<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.609> think<00:00:18.449> I'm

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
version of the so go I think I'm

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.150 
version of the so go I think I'm
pronouncing<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.140> right<00:00:19.350> sugar

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
pronouncing that right sugar

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.700 
pronouncing that right sugar
so<00:00:20.340> go<00:00:20.490> s<00:00:20.699> yugioh<00:00:21.270> from<00:00:21.810> solar<00:00:22.050> cell<00:00:22.350> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
so go s yugioh from solar cell and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.490 
so go s yugioh from solar cell and
really<00:00:23.580> why<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:23.880> filming<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.350> show

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
really why I'm filming this is to show

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.130 
really why I'm filming this is to show
you<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.769> how<00:00:25.859> difficult<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.109> fit<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
you just how difficult it is to fit a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.669 
you just how difficult it is to fit a
standard<00:00:28.500> micro<00:00:29.310> ATX<00:00:29.580> board<00:00:30.510> into<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> end<00:00:31.560> of

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
standard micro ATX board into the end of

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.650 
standard micro ATX board into the end of
this<00:00:31.769> case<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.610> possible<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.510> it's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
this case it's possible but it's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.130 
this case it's possible but it's
difficult

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
difficult

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.900 
difficult
so<00:00:35.870> obviously<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.110> possible<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.670> being

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
so obviously it's possible with it being

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.790 
so obviously it's possible with it being
a<00:00:38.969> silverstone<00:00:39.450> case<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> good<00:00:40.140> brand<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
a silverstone case it's a good brand a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
a silverstone case it's a good brand a
lot<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.190> people<00:00:41.399> are<00:00:41.489> buying<00:00:41.700> them<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.390> boy<00:00:42.629> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
lot of people are buying them but boy is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.979 
lot of people are buying them but boy is
it<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.960> tight<00:00:43.170> fit<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:44.390> immediately<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.809> might

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it a tight fit now immediately you might

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.360 
it a tight fit now immediately you might
be<00:00:46.110> saying<00:00:46.320> well<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.860> should<00:00:47.039> start<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
be saying well you should start with a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.220 
be saying well you should start with a
blank<00:00:47.610> case<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.329> make<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> lot<00:00:48.719> easier<00:00:48.960> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
blank case and make it a lot easier to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.970 
blank case and make it a lot easier to
fit<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.219> trust<00:00:51.030> me<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.899> did<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> first<00:00:52.680> time

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
fit in but trust me I did the first time

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
fit in but trust me I did the first time
and<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.480> an<00:00:54.690> easier<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.289> have

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and it's it's not an easier I have

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.970 
and it's it's not an easier I have
enough<00:00:55.649> clearance<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:57.739> attempt<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> get

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
enough clearance here to attempt to get

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.729 
enough clearance here to attempt to get
that<00:00:59.010> case<00:00:59.309> or<00:01:00.120> excuse<00:01:00.420> me<00:01:00.449> get<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.050> board<00:01:01.590> in

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that case or excuse me get that board in

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
that case or excuse me get that board in
the<00:01:01.800> case<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.820> there<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.719> stand

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the case right there here are my stand

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.510 
the case right there here are my stand
off<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> need<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.270> install<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.600> screws

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
off so I need to install the screws

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
off so I need to install the screws
right<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:11.210> there<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.170> there

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
right there there there there and there

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:23.080 
right there there there there and there
so<00:01:14.840> here<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.930> go

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.520 

here's<00:01:23.659> my<00:01:23.900> book<00:01:24.080> my<00:01:24.460> board<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:29.229> this<00:01:30.229> needs

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
here's my book my board and this needs

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.420 
here's my book my board and this needs
to<00:01:30.799> somehow<00:01:32.979> fit<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:35.240> manual<00:01:35.600> shows<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:36.049> just

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
to somehow fit the manual shows it just

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.760 
to somehow fit the manual shows it just
sliding<00:01:37.630> right<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.960> side<00:01:40.000> but<00:01:41.560> you'll<00:01:42.560> see

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
sliding right in the side but you'll see

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.359 
sliding right in the side but you'll see
what<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.130> really<00:01:43.909> takes<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.390> get<00:01:44.540> in<00:01:44.720> here<00:01:45.369> and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
what it really takes to get in here and

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.730 
what it really takes to get in here and
I<00:01:46.940> don't<00:01:47.240> know<00:01:47.390> if<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:47.930> my<00:01:48.170> board<00:01:48.470> that's

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
I don't know if it's my board that's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.430 
I don't know if it's my board that's
just<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.610> little<00:01:50.030> bit<00:01:50.180> bigger<00:01:50.479> than<00:01:50.810> most<00:01:51.080> or

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
just a little bit bigger than most or

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.660 
just a little bit bigger than most or
what<00:01:51.729> but<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.299> difficult

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
what but it is difficult

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.550 
what but it is difficult
well<00:01:55.670> let<00:01:55.789> me<00:01:55.850> plug<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.210> my<00:01:56.300> brass<00:01:56.539> my<00:01:56.899> CPU<00:01:57.320> fan

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
well let me plug in my brass my CPU fan

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.749 
well let me plug in my brass my CPU fan
first

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.609 

guess<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.689> efforts<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> gym

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
guess I can do that efforts in the gym

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.059 
guess I can do that efforts in the gym
okay<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:11.599> this<00:02:12.599> needs<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.050> come<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.800> at<00:02:14.040> a

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
okay so this needs to come in at a

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.089 
okay so this needs to come in at a
pretty<00:02:14.970> extreme<00:02:16.670> angle<00:02:18.560> there's<00:02:19.560> no<00:02:19.860> way<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
pretty extreme angle there's no way to

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.610 
pretty extreme angle there's no way to
remove<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.670> hard<00:02:20.849> drive<00:02:20.910> cage<00:02:21.480> there's<00:02:22.440> just

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
remove the hard drive cage there's just

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.590 
remove the hard drive cage there's just
a<00:02:22.680> way<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.830> slide<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.520> side<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.790> side<00:02:23.970> which

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
a way to slide it side to side which

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:35.059 
a way to slide it side to side which
doesn't<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.080> help<00:02:25.260> us<00:02:26.840> I've<00:02:27.840> tried<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:35.040> I

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
doesn't really help us I've tried so I

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.800 
doesn't really help us I've tried so I
need<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.760> at<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.000> very<00:02:36.239> steep<00:02:36.569> angle

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
need to get it in at a very steep angle

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:45.670 
need to get it in at a very steep angle
here<00:02:37.230> as<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.739> see<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:42.090> see<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:44.090> and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
here as you can see you see that and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.750 
here as you can see you see that and
then<00:02:49.100> get<00:02:50.100> my<00:02:50.250> back<00:02:50.519> plain<00:02:52.190> thing<00:02:53.190> lined<00:02:53.519> up

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
then get my back plain thing lined up
