00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.889
 to the conversation friends we are going to a small revision to the improvements that 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.300
 we have in the camera 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.690
 with symbian anna as you can see we have some figures in the background 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:10.879
 the ego 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.139
 that will not serve as an example to see essentially how they are like 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.769
 the changes come 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.429
 the main improvement that we have the camera is referred to the interface of 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.099
 user 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.130
 that yes we have now out with this crisis for 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 take pictures 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.059
 today even there touch buttons that do not work in the camera mold that 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.230
 they attack we travel 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.860
 to video mode 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.780
 i percent we also have then a button in which we can proceed 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.490
 with the recording 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.790
 we are going to see very badly to continue with our decision tremp what 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.210
 percent and then masters this button that is here that are like 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.470
 asked to follow seems a bit like what in the case of screens 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.040
 December 3 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.120
 allows us to access it 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.650
 At the minute 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.480
 alternative configuration 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.810
 I have a scene here 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.530
 and I can change between them 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.500
 a carrió then it is reflected 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.340
 already when I hit august I'll touch 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 proceed to pass is a one-touch propagation 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.410
 it cleared a little bit then that's the sum option 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.820
 katherine referred can move 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.470
 then nice is that we apart the morse nothing we can do 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.750
 change in configuration for example does not mean that we would like to work as 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.840
 White 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.450
 Intentionally decent 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.920
 and that I would like to work with an exhibition down to the discussion that 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.780
 all this is summoned in the camera 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.570
 a traditional way of doing it accepts the configurations with this 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.700
 button that touches 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.970
 and we see it for example reach of the sensitivity of light 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.250
 and accept for this are highlights 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.490
 however other alternatives 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.600
 that presents this update 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.110
 is that I can change this was punctured these configurations 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.290
 simply and much faster by pressing the shutter button 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.499
 and then local that I have done 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:12.979
 automatically that anita lesion returned to the main kiss that is that 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.269
 it allows me to take pictures 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.749
 so in this way I do not have to be 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.599
 and instead proceeding through this menu to accept their production to put the face 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.899
 elmo 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.299
 percent bloom consolidated 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.379
 simply pressing riva 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.999
 and that the sunny mode is set then so I can take the 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:36.669
 photography photo moments but as 'the tudors' physical 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.809
 or how is a troll others that we have here virtual 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:45.329
 aside this menu where they come percent and square had the 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.829
 main configurations 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.109
 which are important when detailing photographs 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.149
 percent e 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:58.519
 I can follow some other toys options for the tribute we have here 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.519
 then here he entered to almodóvar to give the image 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.719
 esiquio save the information on the can left by shoot the photograph 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.369
 if he lacked he captured the picture I want him to be cast presents in highly pop 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.449
 hacienda did not do it for taking another picture 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:19.789
 like that or save it the pictures and fortyish capture that I want to have and 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.559
 everything that refers to more museum all this could do for this menu 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.979
 I can also make this menu 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.879
 by this button doksone that we have here below 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.289
 think that entered 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:33.799
 to carmona fair and I fear then 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.229
 the same menu there are two ways to access this menu then 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.449
 but mainly as ana chant the adjustments are concerned 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.649
 per cent the arrangement of the elements for 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:46.599
 change between bed and video 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.109
 for the important flash always have local first hand 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.110
 for this one 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.789
 make the decision to 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.129
 eva martin lime 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.129
 the grid 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.629
 to have the decision of whether we want to keep the automatic deadline to that 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:01.609
 definition 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.890
 we can have the face first hand and of course caacupé button 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.799
 makes that attempt that this 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.409
 what we want way 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.540
 This is a simple presentation, quite quick, of the user interface of 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.859
 the civil chamber included with symbian anna 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.230
 greetings friends blocking conversations will be up to a next opportunity
