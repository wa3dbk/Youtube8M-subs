the past I think most likely to

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.080 
the past I think most likely to
compensate<00:05:08.170> for<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.410> wait<00:05:08.650> ps3<00:05:09.580> owners<00:05:09.880> will

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
compensate for the wait ps3 owners will

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.850 
compensate for the wait ps3 owners will
be<00:05:10.210> getting<00:05:10.450> an<00:05:10.570> updated<00:05:11.080> version<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:11.620> guess

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
be getting an updated version I guess

PC<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.990> game<00:05:20.140> looks<00:05:20.380> good<00:05:20.770> but<00:05:21.700> you<00:05:22.390> know<00:05:22.480> by

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
PC the game looks good but you know by

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.090 
PC the game looks good but you know by
console<00:05:23.110> standards<00:05:23.440> it's<00:05:23.590> not<00:05:23.800> going<00:05:23.920> to<00:05:24.040> look

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
console standards it's not going to look

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.330 
console standards it's not going to look
that<00:05:24.280> great<00:05:24.460> in<00:05:24.700> 2012<00:05:25.860> so<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:26.890> guess<00:05:27.010> they're

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
that great in 2012 so I guess they're
