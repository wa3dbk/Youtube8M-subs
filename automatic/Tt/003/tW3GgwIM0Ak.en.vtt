at and then his ankles are hinged and
they<00:05:25.760> can<00:05:25.940> I<00:05:26.420> guess<00:05:26.990> quote-unquote<00:05:27.560> boot<00:05:27.860> cut

above<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.520> hinge<00:05:28.850> they<00:05:29.480> can<00:05:29.690> tilt<00:05:30.140> below<00:05:30.620> the

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
above the hinge they can tilt below the

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.070 
above the hinge they can tilt below the
hinge<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:32.060> they<00:05:32.210> they<00:05:32.450> aren't<00:05:32.600> tilting<00:05:32.930> just

that's<00:05:34.820> letting<00:05:35.150> them<00:05:35.330> tilt<00:05:35.570> so<00:05:35.690> you<00:05:35.750> do<00:05:35.840> have

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
that's letting them tilt so you do have

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.320 
that's letting them tilt so you do have
to<00:05:36.020> turn<00:05:36.710> them<00:05:36.920> around<00:05:37.100> now<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.520> then<00:05:37.640> catch

to turn them around now and then catch

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.590 
to turn them around now and then catch
up<00:05:38.360> and<00:05:38.840> finally<00:05:39.770> you<00:05:40.190> can<00:05:40.400> toe<00:05:43.420> I'm<00:05:44.420> sure
