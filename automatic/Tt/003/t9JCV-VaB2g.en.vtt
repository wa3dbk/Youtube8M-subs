can see there's three required

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.220 
can see there's three required
components<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> an<00:00:53.969> application<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.899> we'll

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
components of an application and we'll

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.889 
components of an application and we'll
be<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.559> over<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> other<00:00:55.920> two<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.460> well<00:00:57.120> but

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
be going over the other two as well but

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.049 
be going over the other two as well but
the<00:00:58.170> first<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> lump<00:00:59.550> launch

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the first one here is the lump launch

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.810 
the first one here is the lump launch
image<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:01.370> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.730> have

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
image which you can see they have

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
image which you can see they have
different<00:01:03.000> sizes<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.719> iphone<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.379> ipod

different sizes for the iphone the ipod
touch<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.479> even<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.260> newest<00:01:08.159> Retina

give you some tips on the best kind of
launch<00:02:51.360> image<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:53.040> what<00:02:53.220> we're<00:02:53.310> going<00:02:53.400> to

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
launch image is so what we're going to

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.180 
launch image is so what we're going to
do<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.940> off<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.260> right<00:02:55.590> I've<00:02:55.800> already<00:02:55.950> got

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
do is off to the right I've already got

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.570 
do is off to the right I've already got
some<00:02:56.400> launch<00:02:56.760> images<00:02:57.200> designed<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.370> as<00:02:59.430> you

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
some launch images designed so as you

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.240 
some launch images designed so as you
can<00:02:59.640> see<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.910> first<00:03:00.239> launch<00:03:00.540> image<00:03:01.040> is<00:03:02.040> going

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
can see this first launch image is going

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.040 
can see this first launch image is going
to<00:03:02.310> be<00:03:02.400> for<00:03:02.610> our<00:03:02.640> I've<00:03:03.330> labeled<00:03:03.720> at<00:03:03.900> high

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
to be for our I've labeled at high

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.020 
to be for our I've labeled at high
resolution<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:05.190> that's<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.670> be<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:06.000> a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
resolution so that's going to be for a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.940 
resolution so that's going to be for a
Retina<00:03:06.450> display<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.470> we're<00:03:07.620> going<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.800> take

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
Retina display so we're going to take

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.790 
Retina display so we're going to take
that<00:03:08.220> image<00:03:08.700> there<00:03:08.970> drag<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.720> drop<00:03:10.140> onto<00:03:10.470> our

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
that image there drag and drop onto our

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.479 
that image there drag and drop onto our
retina<00:03:11.160> display<00:03:11.760> launch<00:03:12.569> image<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.260> then<00:03:13.860> the

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
retina display launch image and then the

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.009 
retina display launch image and then the
second<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:15.000> I've<00:03:15.120> got<00:03:15.300> here<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.569> just

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
second one that I've got here is just

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.449 
second one that I've got here is just
the<00:03:16.530> regular<00:03:16.950> iphone<00:03:18.019> /<00:03:19.019> ipod<00:03:19.739> launched<00:03:20.100> image

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
the regular iphone / ipod launched image

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.670 
the regular iphone / ipod launched image
so<00:03:20.910> we're<00:03:21.000> going<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.180> take<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.630> one<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.110> also

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
so we're going to take that one and also

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.780 
so we're going to take that one and also
drop<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.209> launch<00:03:24.450> image<00:03:24.780> place<00:03:25.790> so

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
drop it in the launch image place so

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.289 
drop it in the launch image place so
that<00:03:27.000> will<00:03:27.209> do<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.510> for<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.750> iphone<00:03:28.110> /<00:03:28.470> ipod

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
that will do it for the iphone / ipod

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.699 
that will do it for the iphone / ipod
launch<00:03:30.299> images<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.230> we're<00:03:31.320> going<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.500> go<00:03:31.560> and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
launch images so we're going to go and

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.900 
launch images so we're going to go and
close<00:03:31.890> that<00:03:31.950> up<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.459> we're<00:03:32.579> going<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.760> go<00:03:32.880> into

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
close that up and we're going to go into

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.680 
close that up and we're going to go into

be one for the portrait view witching c
is<00:03:45.630> 768<00:03:46.410> by<00:03:47.420> 1004<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:49.440> size<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.160> then<00:03:50.370> we've

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
is 768 by 1004 in size and then we've

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.920 
is 768 by 1004 in size and then we've
got<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.670> landscape<00:03:51.299> which<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.690> going<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.870> be

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
got a landscape which is going to be

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.550 
got a landscape which is going to be
1024<00:03:52.620> x<00:03:53.010> 7<00:03:53.430> 48<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.329> so<00:03:55.019> that's<00:03:55.200> what<00:03:55.440> i've

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
1024 x 7 48 and so that's what i've

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.979 
1024 x 7 48 and so that's what i've
designed<00:03:55.739> these<00:03:56.130> two<00:03:56.489> launch<00:03:56.760> images<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.870> the

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
designed these two launch images so the

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.199 
designed these two launch images so the
first<00:03:58.170> one<00:03:58.320> we've<00:03:58.560> got<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.370> portrait<00:03:59.910> and

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
first one we've got is the portrait and

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.940 
first one we've got is the portrait and
we'll<00:04:00.690> just<00:04:00.870> drag<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.230> drop<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.739> in<00:04:01.890> the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
we'll just drag and drop that in the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.310 
we'll just drag and drop that in the
launch<00:04:02.160> area<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.700> then<00:04:03.209> finally<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.870> second

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
launch area and then finally the second

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.080 
launch area and then finally the second
one<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.440> going<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.769> be<00:04:04.890> our<00:04:05.250> landscape<00:04:05.850> and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
one is going to be our landscape and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.270 
one is going to be our landscape and
should<00:04:06.840> i<00:04:06.870> can<00:04:07.019> drop<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.260> so<00:04:07.709> we<00:04:07.829> should<00:04:08.100> be

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
should i can drop that so we should be

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.400 
should i can drop that so we should be
good<00:04:08.510> now<00:04:09.510> we're<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.690> going<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.930> run<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.290> and

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
good now we're just going to run it and

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.370 
good now we're just going to run it and
see<00:04:10.470> how<00:04:10.980> our<00:04:11.430> launch<00:04:11.700> looks<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.480> we're<00:04:13.109> doing

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
see how our launch looks and we're doing

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.410 
see how our launch looks and we're doing
the<00:04:13.470> iPad<00:04:13.980> 1<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:14.489> we<00:04:14.609> can<00:04:14.760> see<00:04:15.000> what<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.239> looks

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
the iPad 1 so we can see what it looks

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.370 
the iPad 1 so we can see what it looks
like<00:04:15.630> from<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.229> ipad<00:04:17.269> launching<00:04:18.269> we<00:04:19.109> should

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
like from the ipad launching we should

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.469 
like from the ipad launching we should
see<00:04:19.590> here<00:04:19.829> for<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.160> very<00:04:20.820> first<00:04:21.239> thing<00:04:21.450> that

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
see here for the very first thing that

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.670 
see here for the very first thing that
we'll<00:04:21.720> see<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.229> long

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
we'll see is that long

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.270 
we'll see is that long
image<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.669> we've<00:04:23.789> integrated<00:04:24.949> so<00:04:25.949> there<00:04:26.130> you

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
image that we've integrated so there you

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.540 
image that we've integrated so there you
go<00:04:27.050> now<00:04:28.050> once<00:04:28.259> the<00:04:28.500> launch<00:04:28.710> image<00:04:29.009> disappears

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
go now once the launch image disappears

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.040 
go now once the launch image disappears
obviously<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.150> launches<00:04:30.479> straight<00:04:30.750> into<00:04:30.990> your

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
obviously it launches straight into your

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.920 
obviously it launches straight into your
first<00:04:31.430> view<00:04:32.430> controller<00:04:32.789> or<00:04:33.210> whatever<00:04:33.780> the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
first view controller or whatever the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.320 
first view controller or whatever the
app<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:34.289> specified<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.460> hopefully<00:04:36.240> that

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
app is specified to so hopefully that

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.909 
app is specified to so hopefully that
helps<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.660> get<00:04:36.780> your<00:04:36.960> launch<00:04:37.169> images<00:04:37.380> ready

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
helps you get your launch images ready

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.540 
helps you get your launch images ready
