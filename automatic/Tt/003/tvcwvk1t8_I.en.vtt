00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.899 
I know I've got a great group of players
who<00:01:29.409> are<00:01:29.530> giving<00:01:29.650> his<00:01:29.830> everything<00:01:30.070> she's<00:01:30.880> a

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
who are giving his everything she's a

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.700 
who are giving his everything she's a
perhaps<00:01:31.240> at<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.420> penalty<00:01:31.659> it's<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:32.049> 1<00:01:32.229> i've

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
perhaps at the penalty it's a 1 i've

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.730 
perhaps at the penalty it's a 1 i've
seen<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.010> again<00:01:33.100> for<00:01:33.549> me<00:01:33.610> it<00:01:33.850> is<00:01:34.000> paul's<00:01:34.810> well

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
seen it again for me it is paul's well

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.080 
seen it again for me it is paul's well
why<00:01:35.979> would<00:01:36.190> Paul<00:01:36.340> go<00:01:36.549> down<00:01:36.790> he's<00:01:36.940> in<00:01:37.030> a

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
why would Paul go down he's in a

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.240 
why would Paul go down he's in a
shooting<00:01:37.299> position<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.860> wouldn't<00:01:39.130> be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
shooting position so it wouldn't be

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.070 
shooting position so it wouldn't be
realistic<00:01:40.030> for<00:01:40.060> him<00:01:40.270> back<00:01:40.420> or<00:01:40.540> down<00:01:40.780> and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
realistic for him back or down and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.660 
realistic for him back or down and
obviously<00:01:41.440> he's<00:01:41.590> very<00:01:41.799> ruthless<00:01:42.159> from<00:01:42.549> the

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
obviously he's very ruthless from the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.039 
obviously he's very ruthless from the
penalty<00:01:42.909> spot<00:01:43.030> maybe<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.750> would<00:01:43.869> have<00:01:43.960> took

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
penalty spot maybe that would have took

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.830 
penalty spot maybe that would have took
it<00:01:44.200> away<00:01:44.290> from<00:01:44.409> Ipswich<00:01:45.340> put<00:01:45.580> all<00:01:46.030> its<00:01:46.420> inputs

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
it away from Ipswich put all its inputs

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.770 
it away from Ipswich put all its inputs
and<00:01:47.880> disappointing<00:01:48.880> ages<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.360> have<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.600> one

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
and disappointing ages to have the one

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.780 
and disappointing ages to have the one
put<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:50.140> when<00:01:50.830> in<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.159> real<00:01:51.369> world<00:01:51.640> and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
put in when in the real world and

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.880 
put in when in the real world and
realism<00:01:52.180> look<00:01:52.689> at<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:52.960> my<00:01:53.140> thing<00:01:53.290> right<00:01:53.350> that's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
realism look at it my thing right that's

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.800 
realism look at it my thing right that's
not<00:01:54.130> too<00:01:54.310> bad<00:01:54.340> let's<00:01:54.790> go<00:01:54.970> again<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.390> Saturday

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
give me that again and SAT there will

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.039 
give me that again and SAT there will
have<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.549> chance<00:01:57.790> of<00:01:58.000> with<00:01:58.180> certainly<00:01:58.930> when

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
have a chance of with certainly when

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.090 
have a chance of with certainly when
they're<00:01:59.229> sort<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.530> just<00:01:59.740> set<00:01:59.890> was<00:02:00.009> on
