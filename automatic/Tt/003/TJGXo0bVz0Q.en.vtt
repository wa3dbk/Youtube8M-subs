Darwin's time it was believed that each

Darwin's time it was believed that each

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
species have been created by God and

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.020 
species have been created by God and
that<00:01:48.810> man<00:01:49.020> was<00:01:49.230> a<00:01:49.290> creation<00:01:49.820> separate<00:01:50.820> from

fall<00:01:55.410> naturally<00:01:55.920> into<00:01:56.640> what<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.940> would<00:01:57.090> now

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
fall naturally into what we would now

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.990 
fall naturally into what we would now
think<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.690> as<00:01:57.890> evolutionary<00:01:58.890> families<00:01:59.460> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
think of as evolutionary families and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.500 
think of as evolutionary families and
they<00:02:00.270> thought<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.690> them<00:02:00.870> as<00:02:02.300> trains<00:02:03.300> of

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
they thought of them as trains of

they thought of them as trains of
thought<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> creator's<00:02:04.560> mind<00:02:04.830> that<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
thought in the creator's mind that the

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.000 
thought in the creator's mind that the
creator's<00:02:06.330> mind<00:02:06.510> ran<00:02:06.780> along<00:02:07.020> certain<00:02:07.320> lines

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
creator's mind ran along certain lines

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.230 
creator's mind ran along certain lines
and<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.429> why<00:02:08.700> he<00:02:09.360> produced<00:02:10.970> mammals<00:02:11.970> and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
and that's why he produced mammals and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.180 
and that's why he produced mammals and
then<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:13.020> having<00:02:13.320> had<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.500> basic<00:02:13.800> idea<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.100> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
then then having had the basic idea of a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.380 
then then having had the basic idea of a
mammal<00:02:14.550> he<00:02:14.700> would<00:02:14.820> then<00:02:14.910> produce<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
mammal he would then produce the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.510 
mammal he would then produce the
different<00:02:15.750> kinds<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.200> mammal<00:02:16.920> primates<00:02:17.370> and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
different kinds of mammal primates and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.880 
different kinds of mammal primates and
rodents<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.120> carnivores<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.900> things<00:02:19.200> they

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
rodents and carnivores and things they

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.160 
rodents and carnivores and things they
were<00:02:19.980> all<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> kind<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.760> ladders<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.050> has

were all on a kind of ladders but it has

in his revolutionary theory Darwin

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.480 
in his revolutionary theory Darwin
proposed<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.080> all<00:02:41.200> species<00:02:41.500> changed<00:02:42.280> and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
proposed that all species changed and

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.980 
proposed that all species changed and
evolved<00:02:42.970> through<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.240> process<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.690> took

during this long evolution species would

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.770 
during this long evolution species would

vary from generation to generation some
of<00:02:56.930> these<00:02:57.049> variations<00:02:57.409> would<00:02:57.920> continue<00:02:58.370> to

of these variations would continue to
