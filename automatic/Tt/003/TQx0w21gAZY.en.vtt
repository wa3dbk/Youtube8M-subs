to going for my stealth rocks I would be

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.330 
to going for my stealth rocks I would be
more<00:00:24.779> aggressive<00:00:25.230> from<00:00:25.439> turn<00:00:25.619> 1<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.099> go<00:00:26.189> right

want to go out to his Giratina as I do

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.609

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
end up catching that Giratina so I can

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.709

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.959 
force him out bringing in his T tar
which<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.079> honestly<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:35.010> best<00:00:35.250> possible

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
which is honestly the best possible

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.450 
which is honestly the best possible
switch<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.510> me<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:37.559> he<00:00:38.010> can't<00:00:38.280> do

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
switch for me because he can't do

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.340 
switch for me because he can't do
anything<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.120> me<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.809> get<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.110> stealth

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
anything to me I can get up my stealth

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.900 
anything to me I can get up my stealth
rocks<00:00:40.620> scare<00:00:41.250> him<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.579> possible

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
rocks scare him out with the possible

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.729 
rocks scare him out with the possible
earthquake<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.540> he<00:00:43.200> ends<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.379> going<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.620> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
earthquake and he ends I'm going out to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.619 
earthquake and he ends I'm going out to
his<00:00:43.829> fortress<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.489> because<00:00:44.940> I'm<00:00:45.300> thinking

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
his fortress so because I'm thinking

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
his fortress so because I'm thinking
that<00:00:45.930> he<00:00:46.050> knows<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.530> RCC<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> ghost

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that he knows that my RCC is a ghost

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.440 
that he knows that my RCC is a ghost
type<00:00:47.489> he's<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.910> gonna<00:00:48.030> go<00:00:48.180> right<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
type he's not gonna go right for the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.060 
type he's not gonna go right for the
rabbit<00:00:48.750> spin<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.140> figured<00:00:49.620> he<00:00:49.710> would<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.920> go

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
rabbit spin I figured he would just go

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.920 
rabbit spin I figured he would just go
for<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> his<00:00:51.059> hazards<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
forcing amount once again with the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.310 
forcing amount once again with the
dragon<00:00:53.399> tail<00:00:53.550> into<00:00:54.300> his<00:00:54.420> Arceus<00:00:54.930> grass

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
attacked

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.730 
attacked
it's<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> customary<00:01:09.780> fortress<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> I'm<00:01:10.619> not

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it's a customary fortress and I'm not

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.289 
it's a customary fortress and I'm not
really<00:01:10.890> gonna<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.189> into<00:01:11.460> more<00:01:11.850> detail<00:01:12.180> than

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
really gonna go into more detail than

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
really gonna go into more detail than
that<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> case<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.530> thinking<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.950> he

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that so in the case I'm thinking that he

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.560 
that so in the case I'm thinking that he
doesn't<00:01:14.250> pack<00:01:14.369> fire<00:01:14.640> blasts<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.150> flamethrower

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
doesn't pack fire blasts or flamethrower

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.539 
doesn't pack fire blasts or flamethrower
because<00:01:15.810> he's<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> Sun<00:01:16.590> team<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
because he's not on a Sun team so I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
because he's not on a Sun team so I
would<00:01:18.119> go<00:01:18.450> for<00:01:18.600> my<00:01:18.659> first<00:01:18.869> layer<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> spikes<00:01:19.320> as

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
would go for my first layer of spikes as

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.870 
would go for my first layer of spikes as
he<00:01:19.619> ends<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.070> into<00:01:20.310> his<00:01:20.369> Giratina

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
he ends up going out into his Giratina

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.580 
he ends up going out into his Giratina
and<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.299> don't<00:01:21.630> want<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.960> thing<00:01:22.020> getting<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and I don't want this thing getting a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.249 
and I don't want this thing getting a
free<00:01:23.009> sub<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.400> me<00:01:23.549> since<00:01:23.790> sub<00:01:24.119> Giratina<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
free sub on me since sub Giratina is the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.600 
free sub on me since sub Giratina is the
most<00:01:25.470> common<00:01:25.860> set<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.189> one<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> most

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
most common set or one of the most

most common set or one of the most
common<00:01:26.909> sets<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.110> he<00:01:28.170> ends<00:01:28.380> up

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
common sets right now but he ends up

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
common sets right now but he ends up
being<00:01:28.650> mixed<00:01:28.979> Giratina<00:01:29.490> something<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
being mixed Giratina something you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
being mixed Giratina something you
haven't<00:01:30.240> seen<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> haven't<00:01:31.530> seen<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.070> long

haven't seen or I haven't seen in a long

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.560 
haven't seen or I haven't seen in a long
time<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.000> able<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.210> knock<00:01:33.360> me<00:01:33.540> out

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
time but it's able to knock me out

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
time but it's able to knock me out
because<00:01:33.960> my<00:01:34.170> fortress<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.920> basically<00:01:35.579> weak<00:01:35.850> as

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
because my fortress is basically weak as

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.280 
because my fortress is basically weak as
hell<00:01:36.180> as

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
now I can go out to my Darkrai I figured

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.819 
now I can go out to my Darkrai I figured
because<00:01:39.540> he<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.780> low<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.409> try<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
because he is low I would just try and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.920 
because he is low I would just try and
pick<00:01:41.009> him<00:01:41.189> off<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.850> dark<00:01:42.180> post<00:01:42.329> no<00:01:42.630> need

nutritious justified boost it has been a
long<00:01:55.380> time<00:01:55.710> since<00:01:56.040> anyone<00:01:56.490> has<00:01:57.360> said<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.899> but

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110

me switch into my ground expecting that

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.679 
me switch into my ground expecting that
stone<00:02:14.790> edge<00:02:14.909> knowing<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.329> I<00:02:15.359> could<00:02:15.510> take<00:02:15.629> it

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
stone edge knowing that I could take it

stone edge knowing that I could take it
even<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.109> it<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.349> plus<00:02:16.620> one<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.219> get<00:02:17.489> up<00:02:17.579> my<00:02:17.700> son

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
even if it is plus one and get up my son

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.759 
even if it is plus one and get up my son
as<00:02:18.420> he<00:02:18.599> doesn't<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:19.079> right<00:02:19.290> for<00:02:19.409> that<00:02:19.530> stone

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
as he doesn't going right for that stone

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.800 
as he doesn't going right for that stone
edge<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.189> now<00:02:21.060> what<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.269> can<00:02:21.389> do<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.599> go<00:02:21.689> right

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
edge and now what I can do is go right

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.660 
edge and now what I can do is go right
for<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.989> dragon<00:02:22.349> tail<00:02:22.560> since<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.519> will

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
for the dragon tail since it will

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.949 
for the dragon tail since it will
basically<00:02:23.849> hurt<00:02:24.180> everything<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.659> his<00:02:24.780> team

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
basically hurt everything on his team

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.899 
basically hurt everything on his team
and<00:02:25.109> if<00:02:25.170> he<00:02:25.230> switches<00:02:25.469> out<00:02:25.799> I<00:02:26.189> can<00:02:26.549> just<00:02:26.579> phase

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
and if he switches out I can just phase

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.970 
and if he switches out I can just phase
it<00:02:27.120> more<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.480> do<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.719> a<00:02:27.780> spike<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.560> stop

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
it more and I do have a spike and stop

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.800 
it more and I do have a spike and stop
the<00:02:29.099> rocks<00:02:29.250> up<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.670> he<00:02:30.209> ends<00:02:30.359> up<00:02:30.420> staying<00:02:30.659> in

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the rocks up so he ends up staying in

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.470 
the rocks up so he ends up staying in
making<00:02:31.109> a<00:02:31.200> good<00:02:31.409> play<00:02:31.590> expecting<00:02:32.219> my<00:02:32.480> dragon

forcing him out into his Arceus grass
now<00:02:38.370> because<00:02:38.730> he<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:39.000> getting<00:02:39.150> rather<00:02:39.480> low<00:02:39.750> I

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
now because he is getting rather low I

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.869 
now because he is getting rather low I
thought<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.799> he<00:02:40.919> would<00:02:41.069> go<00:02:41.219> before<00:02:41.700> they

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
thought that he would go before they

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.159 
thought that he would go before they
recover<00:02:41.999> this<00:02:42.299> turn<00:02:42.510> which<00:02:42.629> is<00:02:42.749> why<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.870> stayed

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169 
recover this turn which is why I stayed

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.629 
recover this turn which is why I stayed
in<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.349> run<00:02:43.469> for<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.620> dragon<00:02:43.980> tail<00:02:44.129> but<00:02:44.579> he

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
in the run for the dragon tail but he

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:45.589 
in the run for the dragon tail but he
ends<00:02:44.730> was<00:02:44.849> going<00:02:45.000> round<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.299> ice<00:02:45.389> cream

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
ends was going round for the ice cream

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.670 
ends was going round for the ice cream
knowing<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.049> it<00:02:46.139> would<00:02:46.200> knock<00:02:46.439> on<00:02:46.560> my

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
knowing that it would knock on my

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.259 
knowing that it would knock on my
Groudon<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.129> if<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.430> did<00:02:47.579> switch<00:02:47.790> out<00:02:48.000> into<00:02:48.180> my

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
Groudon and if I did switch out into my

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.059 
Groudon and if I did switch out into my
latias<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:48.870> would<00:02:48.959> also<00:02:49.169> get<00:02:49.409> off<00:02:49.560> some<00:02:49.739> damage

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
latias it would also get off some damage

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.679 
latias it would also get off some damage
so<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.489> lose<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.000> weather<00:02:51.209> war<00:02:51.419> but<00:02:51.659> I

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
so I do lose the weather war but I

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.240 
so I do lose the weather war but I
really<00:02:52.109> wasn't<00:02:52.379> too<00:02:52.650> worried<00:02:52.949> since<00:02:53.129> he

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
really wasn't too worried since he

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.619 
really wasn't too worried since he
doesn't<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.519> like<00:02:53.699> an<00:02:53.849> extra<00:02:54.000> drill<00:02:54.419> or

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
doesn't have like an extra drill or

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.599 
doesn't have like an extra drill or
something<00:02:55.139> along<00:02:55.319> those<00:02:55.379> lines<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.040> now<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.430> go

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
something along those lines so now I go

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.830 
something along those lines so now I go
out<00:02:56.639> to<00:02:56.760> my<00:02:56.849> dark<00:02:57.060> for<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.269> am<00:02:57.449> gonna<00:02:57.599> go<00:02:57.689> right
