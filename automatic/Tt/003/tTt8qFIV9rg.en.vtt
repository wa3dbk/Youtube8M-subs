00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.230 
would still not work well
only<00:04:25.710> because<00:04:25.889> it's<00:04:26.280> running<00:04:26.699> on<00:04:26.789> a<00:04:26.849> proxy

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
only because it's running on a proxy

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.830 
only because it's running on a proxy
server<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.870> crappy<00:04:28.860> one<00:04:29.129> at<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.909> so<00:04:30.689> it's

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
server a crappy one at that and so it's

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.760 
server a crappy one at that and so it's
overloading<00:04:31.550> any<00:04:32.550> every<00:04:33.180> chance<00:04:33.449> it<00:04:33.599> gets<00:04:33.770> and

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
overloading any every chance it gets and

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.249 
overloading any every chance it gets and
it's<00:04:35.069> practically<00:04:35.490> unusable<00:04:35.990> now<00:04:36.990> there's<00:04:37.199> a

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
it's practically unusable now there's a

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.809 
it's practically unusable now there's a
couple<00:04:37.469> videos<00:04:37.620> on<00:04:38.099> YouTube<00:04:38.430> from<00:04:38.699> the

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
couple videos on YouTube from the

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.730 
couple videos on YouTube from the
developer<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.319> know<00:04:40.439> kind<00:04:40.680> of

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
developer that you know kind of

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.740 
developer that you know kind of
demonstrated<00:04:41.250> working<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.759> you<00:04:42.449> know<00:04:42.569> that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
demonstrated working and you know that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.200 
demonstrated working and you know that
looks<00:04:42.960> good<00:04:43.530> there<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.340> once<00:04:44.550> it's<00:04:44.759> published

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
looks good there but once it's published

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.429 
looks good there but once it's published
to<00:04:46.050> cydia<00:04:46.379> for<00:04:46.740> everyone<00:04:47.069> to<00:04:47.219> get<00:04:47.870> who<00:04:48.870> goes

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
to cydia for everyone to get who goes

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.510 
to cydia for everyone to get who goes
way<00:04:50.219> down<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.669> basically<00:04:51.949> unable<00:04:52.949> to<00:04:53.219> be<00:04:53.310> used

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
way down and basically unable to be used

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.399 
way down and basically unable to be used
so<00:04:54.419> hopefully<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:54.990> makes<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.229> feel<00:04:55.259> a
