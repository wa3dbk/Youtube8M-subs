00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:06.130
 how are you welcome to this video of 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.410
 youtube today there were a lot less videos 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.110
 so let's see a little trick of the 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.030
 mortal kombat a trick what happens is 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.040
 who does not know it's going to bleed a lot 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.260
 not only do we have the character of 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.340
 reptile hidden in the game but that is 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.870
 a character called reptile and sonia 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.420
 in the next trick we're going to 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.580
 perform in the sega console what 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.110
 let's do first is put the code 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.990
 of the blood to put a little wave 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.090
 to the game designed in blood in ourense 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.400
 in case you do not know it was 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.840
 bird makes a drink 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.480
 then on the home screen 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.750
 grant guys if they do not leave screen 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.880
 we will access the guys here what 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.590
 we have to do is put the base 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:54.430
 three activate the flag is 2 and 3 and 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.290
 then put the level of GDP that we are going 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.820
 to start which normally that 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.010
 we made the character that we liked the most 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.449
 my case and choose sub zero after 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.199
 it was usually up to the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.199
 second set 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.650
 A) Yes 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.259
 at the level of the gdp 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.820
 we are in levels let's make ourselves 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.820
 lose until eventually 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.159
 when all the conditions are met 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.880
 what we have to do now is to try 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.130
 of doing twice perfect to both 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.830
 characters and in the end finish with the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.180
 paralysis when we are going to appear a 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.490
 little sign above that we're going to 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.500
 face against the straight and now at 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.330
 face rep like those in 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.729
 Durán, there should be reptiles 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.460
 but as the second people who are already 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.050
 when we defeated the first reptile that 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.050
 it's going to appear after it's a species and 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.030
 reptile video izaña has the powers 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.920
 suddenly nor its star like the previous one 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.250
 reptile but has the appearance of sonia 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.350
 spiral the shock wave but that 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.880
 we have that is much more fucked 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.709
 because the character is with greater or 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.080
 distorted and you do not know have nowhere 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.320
 folding for that reason we have been able to 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.910
 Now I'm going to show you how to defeat me 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.280
 it's costing a little bit obviously it's 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.440
 quite complicated good finally what 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.950
 we defeat same fatality we take care of all 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.629
 the shit 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.370
 I hope you enjoyed this little 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.250
