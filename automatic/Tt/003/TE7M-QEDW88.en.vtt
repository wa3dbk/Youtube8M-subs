00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.960

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.180

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.280

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:27.810
 games online games and a client 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.440
 License key has bought the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.160
 resold but that is unfortunately 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 Among other things, a system went awry 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 license key and you could get it 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.310
 resold for half the price 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 maybe you can briefly tell what 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.579
 was it there and where is the problematic 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.620
 the case so he has in he has in 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.410
 Russia found an online shop of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.829
 This team key is extremely cheap 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.540
 sale but legally illegally sold because 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.390
 these 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.170
 the games in russia just a lot 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.870
 are cheaper 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.750
 the computer games manufacturers scatter 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.520
 that depending on the region and be in russia 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.410
 there will be so much pirated there we have to 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.020
 offer our games cheaper around 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.570
 our games, so to speak 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.560
 learn to sell and then has 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.600
 This shop has found this shop there 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.220
 bought a key and then got up 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.350
 his own onlineshop this 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:30.320
 keys offered for sale and it 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.830
 the first buy the test purchase in fact 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.840
 by the german licensee of the 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.100
 holiday of which of the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 rights holder for germany 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.280
 so to speak, this game had the right 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.430
 to distribute in Germany 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.509
 and he says you're so cheap 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.610
 can not the Russian 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.350
 sell license key in german 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.259
 a bit of online game actually are 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.140
 the borders are flowing or yes it is there 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.630
 the borders are fluent but still 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.930
 is that the distribution right of the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.590
 right owner if you are 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.200
 you play from abroad and buy 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.660
 which continues to be sold domestically because of it 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.459
 is there any possibility of games 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.019
 Continue to sell this is allowed 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.269
 The rights owner can not say 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.100
 but only if the game is too 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.260
 originally once owned by the rightsholder 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.580
 this economic space and in this 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.890
 case in the economic area of ​​the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.900
 European Union sold one time 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.080
 he was put into traffic 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.060
 and that was not so here he has 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.739
 this cheap the team ki after 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.030
 Russia was put on the market and 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.970
 not to germany or not 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.519
 but in the eu he only becomes in russia 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.750
 sold offline or online I mean 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.960
 that may be so maybe 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.670
 trouble 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.710
 such a case is likely 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.480
 there if he is sold there online 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.490
 Well, if the restriction is only on 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.530
 sell russians yes that would be synonymous again 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.050
 a restriction, the time-out yes, then 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.630
 that will be sold online 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.770
 an online shop 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.360
 but you can see it 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.710
 Onlineshop is also only in Cyrillic 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.300
 So characters held so far 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.310
 you can see that in itself only 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.500
 So it's up to russians now 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.240
 not the possibility as German that 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.020
 so immediately to understand what is there 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.330
 on sale is 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.590
 thus , but could understand and has 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.440
 thought that is also a possibility 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.180
 to make a deal here now 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.070
 there is however in the copyright the 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.720
 principle of exhaustion that is if I am 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.460
 in copyright something a picture 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.770
 bought for example the shield 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.920
 in the background then I can too 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.380
 resell 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.150
 then nobody can forbid me that too 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.520
 not the real author anyway 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.350
 for so long that I put in 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.300
 that seems to be no application here 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.710
 find that this is just here 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.260
 No application here and that 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.970
 also correct because I just what 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.550
 has declared if the game is not 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.200
 originally once in the eu on the 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.850
 market was brought and that was here 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.860
 not so that he was raised in russia 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.260
 that does not bring the market 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.380
 be sold in the eu because that would 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.940
 then the distribution right in the injured 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.060
 ultimately, we had no choice 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.340
 as a modified optimally for the 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.630
 client designed 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.370
 to release him 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.830
 to clarify accordingly as the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.960
 legal situation is expensive and provisional 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.060
 to prevent the 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.360
 means what does that mean maybe 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.980
 finally for the end user year for 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.630
 the end user does not mean that much 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.259
 because he has endlessly now only 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.270
 buy the game is fine out 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.969
 Affects the distribution of the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.830
 users can also play foreigners 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:28.240
 he just can not continue to use them 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.650
 sold when the Cyrillic 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.610
 You can read characters a bit 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.199
 then you can play Russian 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.449
 then cheap in the Russian online shop 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.000
 Shop directly for shopping though 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.439
 please do not resell that 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.050
 It's supposed to be the essence of this 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:42.759
 videos are here is that 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.280
 You are then in this business model 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.080
 Form unfortunately ended only once but if 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.830
 your business model then asks us 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.409
 rather before 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.210
 we check that is possible if not 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.120
 say where the legal pitfalls 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.409
 are there and help you on the way the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.819
 he still has thousands of interesting ones 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.610
 business models on the internet 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.430
 and it would be a pity if you did 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.610
 directly a warning would be stopped 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.169
 At 22 we thank you for watching me 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.039
 Hope or we hope you have this video 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.469
 like 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.020
 every Tuesday there is this current one 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.550
 cases from practice and at the same time 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.050
 again next time 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.050
 shot and bye bye
