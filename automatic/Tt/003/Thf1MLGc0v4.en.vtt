as<00:03:23.730> well<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:25.019> I'm<00:03:25.560> going<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.829> demonstrate<00:03:26.010> how

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
as well so I'm going to demonstrate how

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.879 
as well so I'm going to demonstrate how
to<00:03:26.549> make<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.120> milkshake<00:03:27.959> that's<00:03:28.500> on<00:03:28.799> the

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
to make a milkshake that's on the

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.729 
to make a milkshake that's on the
chocolate<00:03:29.280> milkshake<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.720> higher<00:03:31.709> in

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
chocolate milkshake and it is higher in

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.580 
chocolate milkshake and it is higher in

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
calories than a typical milkshake so

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.339 
calories than a typical milkshake so
what<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:34.919> do<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.879> add<00:03:36.120> half<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.870> cup<00:03:36.900> of

this<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.829> 2%<00:03:38.310> milk<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:38.849> it<00:03:39.000> has<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.449> little

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
this is 2% milk because it has a little

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.050 
this is 2% milk because it has a little
bit<00:03:39.810> more<00:03:39.959> calories<00:03:40.530> than<00:03:40.709> skim<00:03:41.549> milk<00:03:42.859> and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
bit more calories than skim milk and

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.140 
bit more calories than skim milk and
then<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.239> want<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.629> add<00:03:46.169> about<00:03:46.530> 1<00:03:47.220> cup<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.549> ice
