00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.039 
now I have and I do it's but it's absurd
like<00:01:58.770> why<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.820> mouse<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.420> move<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
like why it's a mouse you move it and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.950 
like why it's a mouse you move it and
shit<00:02:01.560> moves<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.250> works<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.240> when<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.600> use<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
shit moves that works but when you use a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.690 
shit moves that works but when you use a
gaming<00:02:04.530> mouse<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.920> has<00:02:05.100> all<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:05.460> other

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
mine I can't find I was doing a web

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.099 
mine I can't find I was doing a web
search<00:04:17.700> for<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.299> kind<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.599> looks<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
search for it it kind of looks like the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.409 
search for it it kind of looks like the
MX<00:04:19.549> 500<00:04:20.549> or<00:04:20.669> something<00:04:20.760> like<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.150> but<00:04:21.359> uh

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
MX 500 or something like that but uh

MX 500 or something like that but uh
it's<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.470> little<00:04:22.620> bit<00:04:22.830> different<00:04:23.010> if<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.580> mouse

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
it's a little bit different if a mouse

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.730 
it's a little bit different if a mouse
has<00:04:24.060> more<00:04:24.750> lights<00:04:25.050> on<00:04:25.289> it<00:04:25.470> then

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
has more lights on it then

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.770 
has more lights on it then
just<00:04:25.949> the<00:04:26.250> one<00:04:26.550> on<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:27.000> bottom<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.569> makes

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
just the one on the bottom that makes

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.360 
just the one on the bottom that makes
the<00:04:28.020> mouse<00:04:28.259> work<00:04:28.620> they<00:04:28.830> don't<00:04:28.979> even<00:04:29.069> do<00:04:29.250> they

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
the mouse work they don't even do they

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.320 
the mouse work they don't even do they
don't<00:04:29.699> need<00:04:29.940> it

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
don't need it

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.659 
don't need it
they're<00:04:30.509> laser<00:04:30.919> no<00:04:31.919> I<00:04:32.250> mean<00:04:32.400> though<00:04:32.490> there's<00:04:32.639> a

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
don't I feel like now that mine does

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.020 
don't I feel like now that mine does
yeah<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:37.889> let<00:04:37.979> me<00:04:38.069> tell<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.430> if<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.639> live<00:04:38.880> in

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
light so I know when it's actually worth
