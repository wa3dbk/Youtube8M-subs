00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:08.229
 Song for a Princess 

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:28.808
 Destiny was cruel and rude order 

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:34.354
 How could I have sent you away? 

00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:39.997
 It was only my fault; The punishment, your 

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:45.132
 Harmony is silent today 

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:50.634
 But by the stillness, I bring you a song 

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:55.700
 And I'll keep you company. 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.524
 Even your tired eyes and my songs 

00:01:01.524 --> 00:01:09.364
 Gently carry you to sleep. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.836
 Once upon a time a pony shone like the sun 

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:28.636
 Caring for his kingdom and sighing 

00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:33.733
 She smiled and said, "Of course, there is no other pony. 

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:41.041
 As kind and well-loved as I am " 

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:47.288
 So great was his reign and so brilliant his glory 

00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:51.780
 How long was the shadow she cast 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.915
 That the darkness fell on his young sister who loved 

00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:03.945
 And it grew only darker with the passing of days and nights 

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:10.423
 Soon that pony noticed that the others 

00:02:10.423 --> 00:02:14.577
 They did not give their sister their due 

00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:19.896
 And he had not loved her as much as she deserved. 

00:02:19.896 --> 00:02:26.580
 She watched as her sister's unhappiness grew. 

00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:33.299
 But such is the path of protagonism, sweetly 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.038
 Takes care of the mind of its host 

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:42.998
 And that silly pony did nothing to stop 

00:02:42.998 --> 00:02:50.921
 The destruction of the one he needed most 

00:02:51.877 --> 00:02:56.550
 Little princess of the moon, good night, my sister. 

00:02:56.686 --> 00:03:01.304
 And now rest in the embrace of the moonlight 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.174
 Protect my song, earthy winds 

00:03:06.174 --> 00:03:11.387
 Through the clouds, and through the sky, and through space 

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:15.782
 Lead the peace and coolness of the night 

00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:20.947
 And bear my affliction alike 

00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:25.514
 Luna, you're loved much more than you know 

00:03:25.514 --> 00:03:32.537
 Let the problems be far from your mind. 

00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:40.176
 And forgive me for being so blind. 

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:08.643
 The years now before us 

00:04:08.643 --> 00:04:13.875
 Fearful and unknown 

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:19.619
 I've never imagined 

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:24.583
 Who would have to face them alone 

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:30.611
 May these thousand winters 

00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:35.412
 Quickly pass; I pray 

00:04:35.412 --> 00:04:41.818
 I love you; I miss you 

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:50.145
 All those miles away 

00:04:51.216 --> 00:05:00.360
 May all your dreams be sweet tonight 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:10.036
 Safe on your moon bed 

00:05:10.036 --> 00:05:19.280
 And do not know the sadness, pain and worry 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:28.522
 And when I dream, I'll fly away and meet you there 

00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:38.360
 Sleep sleep 

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:48.279
 Sleep ...
