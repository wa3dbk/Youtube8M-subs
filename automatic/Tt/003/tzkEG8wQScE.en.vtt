00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hello Juan Carlos will speak to you moncada de 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.820
 moncada magic limited for 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.460
 interested in the elimination of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.400
 graffiti on different surfaces this 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.680
 video will serve as our orientation 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.240
 experience over the past years we 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.060
 has allowed finding solutions 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.260
 adapted to your needs before 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.970
 enter matter 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.560
 I want to give some recommendations about 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.410
 what should be done when acquired 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.680
 an effective antigraffiti solution 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.500
 first advisors are experts in the 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.210
 matter search companies trajectories 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.790
 of the market that can demonstrate that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.190
 they have done similar jobs this 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.720
 will avoid headaches and expenses 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.019
 money in solutions that are not 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.400
 appropriate second the market offers 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.949
 free anti -type products 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.290
 polyurethane queretany lacquers varnishes 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.390
 which constitute films 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.460
 that can be effective but in the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.860
 short term will fade they will feel 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.930
 they stain leaving surfaces 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.140
 affected in their appearance because 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.570
 require solvent has gasoline 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 for sun and other products that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.490
 deteriorate the film of 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.380
 treated surfaces third must 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.259
 keep in mind that the porosity and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 Surface texture are factors 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.570
 determinants in the effectiveness of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 treatment and as four make sure 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.039
 define the proper procedure not 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.020
 All treatments are functional 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.509
 for all surfaces 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 the expert should inspect 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.450
 diagnose and define the procedure 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.740
 to use based on the type of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.439
 surface 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.350
 the state of it some methods 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.180
 for the removal of graffiti there are 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.250
 several methods in our medium for the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.020
 removal of graffiti that depend on the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.509
 material of which the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.930
 facade or surface between which 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.860
 They are painting using removers 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.409
 chemicals or use abrasive media in 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.229
 all of them must be washed resanar 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.270
 change defective parts before 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.600
 proceed to perform a restoration of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.970
 its facade important to know what kind of 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.420
 graffiti products offer you there are 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.459
 of medium and long duration those of 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.239
 medium lengths can be waxes that at 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.600
 be scratched graphics with paint and 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.620
 remove graffiti, graffiti and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.260
 the movie 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.620
 which must be reapplied this 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.870
 it implies to return again to apply anti 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.550
 graffiti over and over again with spending 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.590
 time and money 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.200
 others have a little more duration 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.510
 like polymer polyurethanes 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.390
 polyester is acrylic are resins 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.950
 epoxies are resistant but being 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.250
 scratched products should be used 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.630
 chemicals for the reagent causing 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.250
 wear to the film leaving the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.130
 discovered the original support of the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.020
 surface permanent anti graffiti 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.540
 they have very low proportions in 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.970
 solder solvents greater 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.830
 durability high resistance to 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.500
 abrasion and low organic components 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.760
 volatile contributing to the protection 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.110
 of the environment with each media 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.940
 recommends movie technology 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.950
 permanent with optimal results a 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.560
 long term and of great satisfaction for 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.420
 our customers the behavior of 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.480
 a facade should work like the skin 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.340
 human it is necessary that the film that 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.100
 apply anti anti graffiti 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.960
 sticker and waterproofing and 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.670
 simultaneously allow the
