00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.060
 the former Greeks my voice a little different 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.170
 because I'm a little cool but it doesn't 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.509
 nothing like you always know I am 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.910
 It cooled during the winter anyway 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.800
 since many think that I want 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.220
 abandon cod I will show you that it is not 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.840
 so 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.000
 I'm not playing the mode anymore 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.460
 competitive now that you know that it is certain 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.960
 mg but now I will decide what to do but anyway 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.760
 as you see was always trying to 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.410
 make serious video to help you me 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.120
 look I don't want to try to expire 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.339
 in the banality of going live 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.339
 throttle gameplay for 365 days 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.120
 per year on classic cod crap that 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.039
 they're funny 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.559
 etcetera etc. I always want to search 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.570
 of if I cannot make tournaments or things of the 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.309
 kinda good I'm here to help you 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.249
 I will try to do what I can before 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.600
 titan fall anyway let's start right away 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.890
 this miniseries I want to do is 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.539
 select the ones that are 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.370
 best accessories or at least the 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.540
 accessories that I usually use when I do 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.810
 game at cod 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.300
 the best weapons in my opinion and perks 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.850
 better explaining the mechanics well 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.530
 of each of these then first 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.780
 what we start with the accessories this 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.500
 first episode is all about 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.480
 accessories 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.660
 the first wii accessory speaks of his 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.610
 people of flame that as you have seen 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.830
 I used in several videos if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.420
 because it also seems to me that it was one of the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.680
 my over power classes where I used it 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.510
 because the suppression of flame 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.770
 apparently in flame suppression 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.930
 does not reduce to nothing does not reduce 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.750
 statistics and does not increase statistics 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.600
 of the weapon so apparently it seems 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.890
 have no say of the pros nor of the gods 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.700
 account that would be just an accessory 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.350
 useless but this because then instead 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.430
 it is not a useless accessory because the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.380
 flame suppression reducing it 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.810
 let's say the flame that comes out of the mouth 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.750
 of your rifle of your weapon vi 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.160
 allows you to aim better and to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.660
 better check recoil then than 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.420
 understand where the shots go because many 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.100
 sometimes it is not easy to aim the vehicle at 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.019
 blazes of blows and so this 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.569
 allows for extra precision 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.310
 the silencer is another 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.989
 accessory caused in some of mine 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.450
 video that I think is very useful to 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.579
 end in public this especially if 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.859
 you play alone because this is why the 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.410
 silencer ok ga of the negative parts 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:26.970
 no positive parts like 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.040
 We do not say is seen on the radar 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.920
 weapon noise has decreased so it is 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.540
 more difficult than they become and second 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.010
 what is easier to follow the target 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.810
 as in the case of flame suppression but 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.850
 what are the backs of the silencer 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.490
 well it reduces the flow rate by 25 percent 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.890
 what is the flow rate and the distance to which one is 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.670
 can kill an opponent we do a 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.550
 example 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.120
 then your weapon kills with four 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.370
 shots at 10 meters right 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.010
 you have to take into account that you have one 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.980
 25% reduction of 25% of the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.310
 scope means that then you will kill 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.560
 at 7.5 meters with four shots above 7.5 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.970
 meters it will take 567 strokes depends 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.230
 obviously also from the weapon 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.720
 so this is not the scope 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.520
 they reduce the damage but the extent that 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.890
 is another thing is the distance to which one is 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.870
 kills who gets the damage because 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.070
 superseded by some distance decreases the damage 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.480
 weapon 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.040
 now let's move on to the muzzle brake 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.110
 practically only concerns the 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.080
 reach the muzzle brake is a 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.290
 accessory that does not increase the damage but 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.220
 increases the range by as much as 20 per 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.680
 one hundred 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.200
 so the scope of 20 percent if 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.780
 it's not a big big change 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.430
 because it is one fifth of the distance per 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.020
 example on smg is very valid because 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.510
 the medium distance and from the clashes 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.780
 long distance it takes one two strokes in 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.340
 less sometimes because obviously maybe 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.280
 managed to stay in that range in that one 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.080
 let's say in that maximum distance for 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.450
 make a villa that maybe those four 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.130
 5 meters meters save life because 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.360
 give a shot less then you know the smg 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.970
 they have another fire radio then 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.650
 better then the mouth brake 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.420
 it does not increase damage but increases 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.010
 only the 20 percent range 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.800
 Another very useful accessory on 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.940
 front kick that on this game is 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.410
 very useful is not like that of black 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.180
 ops the two that had some sort of effect 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.070
 placebo and I don't know if you've ever tried it 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.200
 it seemed he would have glued less 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.030
 weapons but it was a decrease so much 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.830
 minimal that it was more a placebo effect 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.239
 that is, that you thought the weapon 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.440
 it lessened more than an effect 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.970
 true visual so in this case the 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.710
 recoil through the front kick has 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.419
 decreased by 25 percent which is one 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.250
 really high for example if 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.720
 I tried to put it on a hood 12 or 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.940
 a remington 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.640
 you really notice the change that 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.610
 the weapon becomes very precise therefore also 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.990
 this is a very valid accessory 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.050
 another valid accessory is the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.490
 large loader increased loaders 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.470
 as it is called here on a way that 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.450
 increases ammunition by 50 percent 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.760
 so for example the remington to a 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.440
 24 shots magazine through i 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.010
 loaders increased the charger 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.930
 becomes 36 strokes is very valid between 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.300
 the other has no penalties, that is, does not increase 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.280
 recharge speed as on black 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.830
 ops two I don't know if you knew but 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.810
 that is, the charging speed increased 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.960
 excuse the charging time 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.430
 so he'd say his cons in 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.930
 this case does not know them so if it is not a 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.430
 very valid accessory especially on 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.590
 weapons like raja chin also have 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.300
 on the k in the end very valid 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.640
 the boys I hope this series there 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.900
 the next episode is helpful 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.610
 I will decide what to do indeed I do not want 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.440
 decide what to do I want you to be a 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.330
 tell me what to do 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.790
 you want me to talk about perks in my opinion 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.530
 explaining how they work 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.090
 you want me to talk to you about second weapons 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.000
 me fundamental explaining how 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.710
 they work so let me know 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.360
 I 'm here to read the nice comments 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.360
 becera the next video
