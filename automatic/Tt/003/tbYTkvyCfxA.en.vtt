00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
is a video response to my package unbox

is a video response to my package unbox
all<00:00:14.509> all<00:00:15.509> right<00:00:15.750> uh<00:00:16.369> ruins<00:00:17.369> are<00:00:17.609> used<00:00:18.029> for

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
all all right uh ruins are used for

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.509 
all all right uh ruins are used for
blocking<00:00:20.520> line<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.910> sight<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.830> if<00:00:22.830> you're

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
blocking line of sight and if you're

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.310 
blocking line of sight and if you're
doing<00:00:23.820> map<00:00:24.000> making<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.750> makes<00:00:24.990> them<00:00:25.140> look

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
doing map making it makes them look

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.890 
doing map making it makes them look
really<00:00:25.710> good<00:00:25.890> um<00:00:27.170> also<00:00:29.539> there's<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.630> certain

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
really good um also there's a certain

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.620 
really good um also there's a certain
way<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.590> put<00:00:31.800> them<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.420> see

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
way you have to put them on like you see

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.590 
way you have to put them on like you see
the<00:00:34.260> corner<00:00:34.829> piece<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.420> edge

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the corner piece and then the edge

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.690 
the corner piece and then the edge
groove<00:00:37.079> right<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.790> just<00:00:40.489> flip<00:00:41.489> that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
groove right here so you just flip that

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.470 
groove right here so you just flip that
on<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.940> that's<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.149> put<00:00:45.329> them

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
on like that and that's how you put them

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
on like that and that's how you put them
on<00:00:45.600> both<00:00:46.050> sides<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.559> small<00:00:49.680> map

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
on both sides this is just a small map

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
on both sides this is just a small map
showing<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> map<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.989> just

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
showing it's not really a map it's just

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.610 
showing it's not really a map it's just
a<00:00:52.230> thing<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.730> shows<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.960> good<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
a thing it shows you what is good and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.750 
a thing it shows you what is good and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
bad about them all right the one they're

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.209 
bad about them all right the one they're
really<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.480> helpful<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.170> small<00:01:01.710> figures

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
really really helpful for small figures

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.770 
really really helpful for small figures
like<00:01:04.159> wolves<00:01:05.450> compared<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.810> big<00:01:07.049> figures<00:01:08.780> like

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
like wolves compared to big figures like

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.280 
like wolves compared to big figures like
him<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> difference<00:01:11.750> now<00:01:12.750> look<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.020> thing

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
him see the difference now look up thing

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.649 
him see the difference now look up thing
about<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.729> they're<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> same<00:01:15.119> height<00:01:15.390> these

right there you can definitely see him

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.460 
right there you can definitely see him
no<00:01:38.229> doubt<00:01:38.409> about<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:40.479> really<00:01:40.840> doesn't

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
no doubt about it so it really doesn't

no doubt about it so it really doesn't
help<00:01:41.800> for<00:01:42.220> big<00:01:42.400> figures<00:01:42.820> but<00:01:43.120> small<00:01:43.450> figures

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
help for big figures but small figures

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.790 
help for big figures but small figures
it<00:01:44.050> really<00:01:44.350> helps<00:01:44.680> um<00:01:47.130> another<00:01:48.130> thing<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.960> our

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
it really helps um another thing all our

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.320 
it really helps um another thing all our
wings<00:01:51.220> are<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.479> have<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.660> watch<00:01:52.780> out<00:01:52.990> for

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
wings are that you have to watch out for

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.950 
wings are that you have to watch out for
like<00:01:55.330> this<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.490> can't<00:01:57.729> see<00:01:58.030> but<00:01:58.300> if<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:58.780> come

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
like this you can't see but if you come

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.080 
like this you can't see but if you come
around<00:01:59.110> like<00:01:59.470> here<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.130> can<00:02:00.310> see<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.850> wings

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
around like here you can see the wings

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.700 
around like here you can see the wings
but<00:02:01.450> they're<00:02:01.600> not<00:02:01.720> hittable<00:02:02.020> zones<00:02:02.320> on<00:02:02.530> this

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
but they're not hittable zones on this

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.440 
but they're not hittable zones on this
so<00:02:03.040> it<00:02:03.220> doesn't<00:02:03.460> matter<00:02:03.550> but<00:02:03.820> some<00:02:04.090> figures

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
so it doesn't matter but some figures

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:15.000 
so it doesn't matter but some figures
are<00:02:04.630> um<00:02:07.140> Krug<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:09.759> dude<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:13.260> he<00:02:14.260> can't<00:02:14.530> fit<00:02:14.830> on

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
get down to the range normally they're

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.860 
get down to the range normally they're
about<00:02:29.080> I'll<00:02:29.860> say<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.790> fourth<00:02:31.060> Massachusetts

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
about I'll say the fourth Massachusetts

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.800 
about I'll say the fourth Massachusetts
line<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.440> right<00:02:32.680> here<00:02:33.060> there's<00:02:34.060> his<00:02:34.330> head<00:02:34.540> you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
line is right here there's his head you

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.500 
line is right here there's his head you
can't<00:02:35.080> see<00:02:35.350> him<00:02:35.470> but<00:02:36.280> say<00:02:36.550> if<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:37.000> was<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.150> little

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
can't see him but say if it was a little

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.960 
can't see him but say if it was a little
higher<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.350> they<00:02:38.860> could<00:02:39.070> see<00:02:39.310> him<00:02:39.610> so

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
higher like this they could see him so

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.509 
higher like this they could see him so
he's<00:02:40.360> hittable<00:02:40.630> zones<00:02:40.989> so<00:02:41.799> it<00:02:41.980> just<00:02:42.010> really

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
he's hittable zones so it just really

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.289 
he's hittable zones so it just really
