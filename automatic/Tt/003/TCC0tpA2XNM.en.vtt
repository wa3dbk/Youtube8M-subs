00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
multiple layers here just like in

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.960 
multiple layers here just like in
illustration<00:06:17.810> programs<00:06:18.320> on<00:06:18.470> the<00:06:18.560> PC<00:06:18.979> we<00:06:19.849> can

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
illustration programs on the PC we can

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.540 
illustration programs on the PC we can
go<00:06:20.120> in<00:06:20.330> we<00:06:20.479> can<00:06:20.660> even<00:06:20.900> group<00:06:21.620> these<00:06:21.830> layers<00:06:22.160> so

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
go in we can even group these layers so

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.020 
go in we can even group these layers so
I<00:06:23.300> can<00:06:23.740> make<00:06:24.740> both<00:06:24.950> of<00:06:25.010> these<00:06:25.310> the<00:06:25.550> same<00:06:25.760> shape

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
I can make both of these the same shape

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
can just go in I can resize it I can

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.110 
can just go in I can resize it I can
rotate<00:06:32.300> it<00:06:32.830> and<00:06:33.830> I<00:06:34.070> can<00:06:34.250> reposition<00:06:34.669> it<00:06:34.910> so<00:06:34.940> I

him and then that's just a simple

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.980 
him and then that's just a simple
example<00:06:40.760> of<00:06:41.060> how<00:06:41.120> you<00:06:41.240> can<00:06:41.479> use<00:06:41.690> layers

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
example of how you can use layers

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.350
