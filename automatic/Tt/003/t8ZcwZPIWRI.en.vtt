00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.740
 but not 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.129
 and I had some tea leaves 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.550
 We are trying on premium suitcases 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.420
 mastec series are the suitcases of 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.820
 aluminum 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.789
 37 liters the sides are a type of 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.980
 suitcases I would use for a trip through 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.309
 out of colombia or for a trip of more 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.710
 of 3 or 4 days because of the capacity of 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.409
 charge and for the security that they give me 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.409
 are indicated are some suitcases that 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.680
 they are very easy for anchoring 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.080
 in the support of the suitcases on the motorcycle 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.080
 that we are using keep a very low 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.240
 profile are very close to the bike 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.050
 then they allow very good 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.100
 maneuverability I like the ease of 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.530
 insert the suitcases in the supports 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.860
 they bring a tab that is a system 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.110
 only of attack by them that no 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.369
 you need two plates inside the suitcase 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.619
 to secure it to the supports but 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.979
 it's a tab that you lower and the same lid 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.590
 coin the tab then it allows you very 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.570
 good security and reduces the amount of 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.670
 plates that take you off in the suitcase 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.039
 We are using some in erba that marry 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.009
 perfectly inside the suitcase come 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.960
 against the wood marked with mastec very 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.050
 comfortable because you do not have to remove the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.240
 suitcases of the motorcycle but simply 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.220
 open the suitcase the jail inner max 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.370
 serra if you go to the hotel with your 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.700
 luggage and additional to this the suitcases 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:21.260
 they bring 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.260
 grip point to forgive me the things 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.459
 waterproof each tent my 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.370
 favorite combination for long trips 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.380
 of the bike is side suitcases and a 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.410
 soft suitcase in the back I 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.290
 gives more cargo volume 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.170
 and it's much lighter anyway 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.450
 mastec has available the touch is that 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.180
 is much more useful already as for the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.580
 person who uses the day to day motorcycle in 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.310
 the city to keep the helmet its 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.440
 jacket gloves and waterproof any 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.310
 thing that needs to be protected 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.310
 inside the motorbike
