which<00:01:02.730> act<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.120> multitasking<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:04.019> going

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
which act as multitasking and going

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
key and that just seems to be a trait

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.760 
key and that just seems to be a trait
we'll<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.200> devices

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
we'll see on all devices

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.190 
we'll see on all devices

now with the LG g3 they kind of took a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080 
now with the LG g3 they kind of took a
different<00:01:13.439> approach<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.880> do

Nexus 4 just for that now LG also took a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.020 
Nexus 4 just for that now LG also took a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
didn't stop there and they also came out

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.310 
didn't stop there and they also came out
with<00:02:05.909> knock<00:02:06.210> code<00:02:06.479> which<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> pretty<00:02:07.110> cool

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
with knock code which is a pretty cool

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.139 
with knock code which is a pretty cool
thing<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.250> knock<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.789> your<00:02:08.970> phone

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
thing so you just knock on your phone

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.910 
thing so you just knock on your phone
not<00:02:09.300> not<00:02:09.780> literally<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.319> your<00:02:10.470> fists<00:02:10.679> but

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
not not literally with your fists but

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.380 
not not literally with your fists but
with<00:02:11.129> your<00:02:11.280> fingers<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:12.270> do<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
with your fingers and you just do a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.470 
with your fingers and you just do a
different<00:02:12.540> type<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> pattern

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
different type of pattern

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600 
different type of pattern
in<00:02:13.959> different<00:02:14.500> quadrants<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.280> we'll<00:02:15.520> go

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
in different quadrants and we'll go

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.880 
in different quadrants and we'll go
ahead<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.849> lock<00:02:16.000> your<00:02:16.209> phone<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:17.020> HTC<00:02:17.560> took<00:02:17.769> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
ahead and lock your phone so HTC took a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.920 
ahead and lock your phone so HTC took a
similar<00:02:18.160> approach<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.849> what<00:02:18.970> LG<00:02:19.390> did<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.840> with

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
similar approach to what LG did and with

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.259 
similar approach to what LG did and with
their<00:02:20.080> HTC<00:02:20.680> One<00:02:20.890> m8<00:02:21.220> basically<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.879> just<00:02:22.060> lift

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
their HTC One m8 basically you just lift

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.030 
their HTC One m8 basically you just lift
the<00:02:22.360> device<00:02:22.629> and<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.260> swipe<00:02:23.500> your<00:02:23.530> finger<00:02:23.769> in

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
the device and you swipe your finger in

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.589 
the device and you swipe your finger in
a<00:02:24.099> certain<00:02:24.400> direction<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.180> actually

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
a certain direction and it actually

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.540 
a certain direction and it actually
launches<00:02:25.989> an<00:02:26.110> application<00:02:26.769> from<00:02:27.250> your<00:02:27.400> phone

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
launches an application from your phone

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.520 
launches an application from your phone
just<00:02:27.730> being<00:02:27.970> asleep<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.900> that's<00:02:29.080> pretty<00:02:29.260> cool

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
just being asleep so that's pretty cool

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.080 
just being asleep so that's pretty cool
in<00:02:29.650> itself<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.250> we've<00:02:30.400> seen<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> similar

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
in itself and we've seen a similar

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.210 
in itself and we've seen a similar
approach<00:02:31.269> with<00:02:31.630> oneplus<00:02:32.170> basically<00:02:32.980> when<00:02:33.130> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
approach with oneplus basically when the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.670 
approach with oneplus basically when the
phone<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.670> on<00:02:34.000> sleep<00:02:34.390> mode<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:35.050> just<00:02:35.260> draw<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
phone is on sleep mode you just draw a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.410 
phone is on sleep mode you just draw a
circle<00:02:36.190> or<00:02:36.400> whatever<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.849> want<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.090> do<00:02:37.239> and

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
circle or whatever you want to do and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.729 
circle or whatever you want to do and
this<00:02:37.540> really<00:02:37.870> does<00:02:38.110> tie<00:02:38.349> into<00:02:38.530> with

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
this really does tie into with

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.130 
this really does tie into with
CyanogenMod<00:02:39.430> did<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.269> phone<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.780> will

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
CyanogenMod did on that phone and will

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.869 
CyanogenMod did on that phone and will
also<00:02:41.500> launch<00:02:41.650> an<00:02:41.830> application<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.700> that's

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
also launch an application so that's

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.640 
also launch an application so that's
pretty<00:02:43.060> cool<00:02:43.330> in<00:02:43.480> itself<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.110> how<00:02:44.379> they're

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
pretty cool in itself and how they're

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.020 
pretty cool in itself and how they're
just<00:02:44.799> removing<00:02:45.099> physical<00:02:45.580> buttons<00:02:45.849> as<00:02:45.970> a

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
just removing physical buttons as a

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.150 
just removing physical buttons as a
whole<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.810> I'm<00:02:46.900> all<00:02:47.080> for<00:02:47.110> having<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.680> device<00:02:47.890> be

whole so I'm all for having a device be

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.920 
whole so I'm all for having a device be
buttonless<00:02:48.519> but<00:02:49.090> think<00:02:49.269> about<00:02:49.390> those<00:02:49.660> tough

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
buttonless but think about those tough

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.839 
buttonless but think about those tough
times<00:02:49.959> where<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.709> need<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> home<00:02:51.280> button<00:02:51.640> or

reset that device and just have it

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.300

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
thinking to what it normally would out

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.280 
thinking to what it normally would out

like power on for five seconds it goes

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.610 
like power on for five seconds it goes
off<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.180> need<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.599> do<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.870> home<00:03:11.110> button<00:03:11.470> and

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
off you need to do the home button and

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.530 
off you need to do the home button and
lock<00:03:11.829> just<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.549> get<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.760> back<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.090> its<00:03:13.120> normal

sometimes<00:03:16.090> you're<00:03:16.269> going<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.450> need<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.720> power

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
sometimes you're going to need to power

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.809 
sometimes you're going to need to power

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
hit the power on button it hit the up

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.449 
hit the power on button it hit the up
volume<00:03:19.150> rocker<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.750> then<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.319> done<00:03:20.459> wonders

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
volume rocker and then it's done wonders

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.949 
volume rocker and then it's done wonders
for<00:03:21.489> me<00:03:21.850> in<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.030> past<00:03:22.239> when<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.569> actually

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
for me in the past when I actually

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.990 
for me in the past when I actually
wanted<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.500> explore<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.160> realm<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.579> routing

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
wanted to explore the realm of routing

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.940 
wanted to explore the realm of routing
so<00:03:25.630> if<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:25.959> didn't<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.230> home<00:03:26.440> buttons<00:03:26.739> what

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
so if we didn't have home buttons what

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.770 
so if we didn't have home buttons what
would<00:03:27.069> be<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.370> way<00:03:27.519> we<00:03:27.700> could<00:03:27.940> route<00:03:28.180> or<00:03:28.389> just

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
would be the way we could route or just

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.990 
would be the way we could route or just
hard<00:03:29.079> reset<00:03:29.500> our<00:03:29.590> phones<00:03:29.829> I<00:03:30.160> personally<00:03:30.850> don't

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
hard reset our phones I personally don't

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.340 
hard reset our phones I personally don't
know<00:03:31.060> right<00:03:31.299> now<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.750> think<00:03:31.959> that's<00:03:32.139> why

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
know right now and I think that's why

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.140 
know right now and I think that's why
home<00:03:32.590> buttons<00:03:32.920> are<00:03:33.069> going<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.459> stay<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:34.000> just

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
home buttons are going to stay and just

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.849 
home buttons are going to stay and just
touching<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.780> point<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.170> just<00:03:35.200> made<00:03:35.500> I

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
touching on the point I just made I

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.500 
touching on the point I just made I
think<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.280> software's<00:03:36.760> going<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.090> need<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.389> be

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
think the software's going to need to be

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.539 
think the software's going to need to be
near<00:03:37.810> perfect<00:03:38.139> to<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.859> point<00:03:39.130> where<00:03:39.280> phones

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
near perfect to the point where phones

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.400 
near perfect to the point where phones
really<00:03:39.940> never<00:03:40.150> glitch<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.690> that's<00:03:41.139> when<00:03:41.380> I

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
really never glitch and that's when I

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.930 
really never glitch and that's when I
see<00:03:41.650> buttons<00:03:41.889> kind<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.310> becoming<00:03:42.670> obsolete

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
see buttons kind of becoming obsolete

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.660 
see buttons kind of becoming obsolete
but<00:03:43.780> for<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.019> time<00:03:44.290> being<00:03:44.530> right<00:03:44.769> now<00:03:44.980> devices

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
but for the time being right now devices

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.160 
but for the time being right now devices
are<00:03:45.819> obviously<00:03:46.269> going<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.569> have<00:03:46.720> buttons<00:03:47.019> on

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
are obviously going to have buttons on

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.930 
are obviously going to have buttons on
them<00:03:47.410> because<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.459> event<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.790> your
