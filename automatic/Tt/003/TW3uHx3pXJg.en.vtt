hello everybody will come back to

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.350 
hello everybody will come back to
another<00:00:15.020> redstone<00:00:15.320> tutorial<00:00:16.070> me<00:00:16.370> Axl<00:00:16.760> so

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
another redstone tutorial me Axl so

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.150 
another redstone tutorial me Axl so
today<00:00:17.720> I<00:00:17.750> have<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:17.990> four<00:00:18.680> double<00:00:18.950> vertical

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
today I have the four double vertical

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.910 
today I have the four double vertical
piston<00:00:19.910> extender<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:20.510> it's<00:00:21.200> only<00:00:21.470> two<00:00:21.680> wide

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
piston extender and it's only two wide

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.890 
piston extender and it's only two wide
just<00:00:22.279> as<00:00:22.430> the<00:00:22.580> version<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:23.000> made<00:00:23.180> before<00:00:23.510> their

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
just as the version I made before their

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.769 
just as the version I made before their
the<00:00:24.170> triple<00:00:24.500> piston<00:00:24.770> extender<00:00:24.860> so<00:00:25.630> this<00:00:26.630> is

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
the triple piston extender so this is

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.990 
the triple piston extender so this is
quite<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.220> quadruple<00:00:28.220> piston<00:00:28.550> extender<00:00:28.640> I

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
quite a quadruple piston extender I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.720 
quite a quadruple piston extender I
think<00:00:29.240> it's<00:00:29.360> called<00:00:29.710> but<00:00:30.710> let<00:00:31.250> me<00:00:31.279> just<00:00:31.369> show

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
think it's called but let me just show

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.440 
think it's called but let me just show
you<00:00:31.759> that<00:00:32.630> it<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:32.960> working<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.970> extending

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
you that it is working so the extending

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.500 
you that it is working so the extending
as<00:00:35.600> fast<00:00:35.960> as<00:00:36.290> fast<00:00:36.650> as<00:00:36.920> always<00:00:37.220> and<00:00:37.510> the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
as fast as fast as always and the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.870 
as fast as fast as always and the
extracting<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:39.200> a<00:00:39.410> little<00:00:39.829> bit<00:00:39.980> slower<00:00:40.250> but<00:00:40.670> it

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
extracting is a little bit slower but it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.360 
extracting is a little bit slower but it
has<00:00:41.060> to<00:00:41.090> be<00:00:41.300> that<00:00:41.630> slow<00:00:41.900> because<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.950> Pistons

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
has to be that slow because the Pistons

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.610 
has to be that slow because the Pistons
need<00:00:43.580> to<00:00:43.760> pull<00:00:44.180> each<00:00:44.390> other<00:00:44.630> down<00:00:44.720> to<00:00:45.230> get<00:00:45.410> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
need to pull each other down to get the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.000 
need to pull each other down to get the
final<00:00:46.520> block<00:00:46.790> down<00:00:47.060> so<00:00:47.810> it<00:00:48.200> is<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.380> quite<00:00:48.710> long

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
final block down so it is a quite long

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.070 
final block down so it is a quite long
design<00:00:49.490> because<00:00:50.060> I<00:00:50.150> had<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.390> make<00:00:50.510> it<00:00:50.570> too<00:00:50.840> wide

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
design because I had to make it too wide

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.310 
design because I had to make it too wide
but<00:00:51.920> it's<00:00:52.730> not<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:53.150> extremely<00:00:53.900> long<00:00:54.080> it's

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
but it's not that extremely long it's

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.610 
but it's not that extremely long it's
it's<00:00:54.560> just<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:55.100> just<00:00:55.520> long<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.540> these<00:00:57.470> are

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
it's just it's just long so these are

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.470 
it's just it's just long so these are
the<00:00:57.650> materials<00:00:57.800> you're<00:00:58.160> going<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.370> need<00:00:58.520> 16

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
the materials you're going to need 16

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.530 
the materials you're going to need 16
redstone<00:00:59.960> 16<00:01:00.410> repeaters<00:01:00.820> 14<00:01:01.820> torches<00:01:02.360> and

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
redstone 16 repeaters 14 torches and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.280 
redstone 16 repeaters 14 torches and
five<00:01:02.930> sticky<00:01:03.410> pistons<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:04.449> 48<00:01:05.449> red<00:01:06.049> stone

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
five sticky pistons and 48 red stone

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.200 
five sticky pistons and 48 red stone
building<00:01:06.619> blocks<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.070> one<00:01:07.430> extending<00:01:08.000> block

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
building blocks and one extending block

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.460 
building blocks and one extending block
and<00:01:08.420> maybe<00:01:09.259> a<00:01:09.350> lever<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.799> test<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:10.520> out<00:01:11.470> so

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
and maybe a lever to test it out so

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.560 
and maybe a lever to test it out so
let's<00:01:12.680> go<00:01:12.830> over<00:01:12.979> here<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.189> build<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:13.789> so<00:01:14.420> we

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
let's go over here and build it so we

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.999 
let's go over here and build it so we
need<00:01:14.749> some<00:01:15.259> redstone<00:01:16.249> and<00:01:16.869> repeaters<00:01:17.869> and

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
need some redstone and repeaters and

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.469 
need some redstone and repeaters and
torches<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:19.219> registered<00:01:19.880> building<00:01:20.240> block

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
torches and registered building block

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.440 
torches and registered building block
and<00:01:21.909> ste<00:01:22.909> pistons<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.320> extending<00:01:24.920> block

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
and ste pistons and the extending block

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.370 
and ste pistons and the extending block
so<00:01:27.609> let's<00:01:28.609> start<00:01:28.880> building<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:29.539> we<00:01:29.780> put<00:01:30.049> full

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
so let's start building so we put full

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.279 
so let's start building so we put full
pistons<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.390> you're<00:01:32.390> extending<00:01:32.630> lock<00:01:33.079> up

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
pistons and you're extending lock up

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.800 
pistons and you're extending lock up
here<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:33.679> then<00:01:34.340> go<00:01:34.369> down<00:01:34.579> here<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.240> put<00:01:35.780> up

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
here and then go down here and put up

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.300 
here and then go down here and put up
like<00:01:36.109> this<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:36.439> it's<00:01:37.359> yeah<00:01:38.359> this<00:01:38.630> shape<00:01:38.899> so<00:01:39.770> and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
like this so it's yeah this shape so and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.480 
like this so it's yeah this shape so and
then<00:01:41.090> continue<00:01:41.780> torched<00:01:42.289> our<00:01:42.499> up<00:01:42.859> like<00:01:43.100> this

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
then continue torched our up like this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.480 
then continue torched our up like this
and<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:44.719> is<00:01:44.780> just<00:01:45.020> like<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.289> video<00:01:45.649> before<00:01:46.310> I

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
and this is just like the video before I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.770 
and this is just like the video before I
made<00:01:46.759> with<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.119> triple<00:01:47.479> piston<00:01:47.689> extender

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
made with the triple piston extender

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.279 
made with the triple piston extender
just<00:01:48.319> like<00:01:48.469> the<00:01:48.619> same<00:01:48.939> concept<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.749> here<00:01:51.170> you

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
just like the same concept so here you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.429 
just like the same concept so here you
put<00:01:51.499> a<00:01:52.039> block<00:01:52.579> with<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.789> repeater<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.439> asking

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
put a block with a repeater and asking

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.169 
put a block with a repeater and asking
piston<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:54.889> a<00:01:54.950> blog<00:01:55.159> above<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.579> a<00:01:55.850> block

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
piston with a blog above and a block

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.669 
piston with a blog above and a block
with<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.569> tree<00:01:56.840> take<00:01:57.079> repeater<00:01:58.149> so<00:01:59.530> block<00:02:00.530> up

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
with a tree take repeater so block up

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.029 
with a tree take repeater so block up
like<00:02:00.859> this<00:02:01.069> and<00:02:01.249> put<00:02:01.759> blocks<00:02:01.999> out<00:02:02.420> like<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:03.770> and

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
like this and put blocks out like so and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.529 
like this and put blocks out like so and
put<00:02:04.700> some<00:02:04.819> extra<00:02:04.969> blocks<00:02:05.359> in<00:02:05.600> here<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:08.030> let's

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
put some extra blocks in here so let's

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.400 
put some extra blocks in here so let's
see<00:02:08.750> we<00:02:08.929> have<00:02:09.140> 12<00:02:09.800> we<00:02:10.399> need<00:02:10.550> one<00:02:10.880> more<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:12.230> it's

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
see we have 12 we need one more so it's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.460 
see we have 12 we need one more so it's
like<00:02:12.470> 1<00:02:12.860> 2<00:02:13.069> 3<00:02:13.100> 4<00:02:13.430> 5<00:02:14.680> counted<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.890> them<00:02:16.250> so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
like 1 2 3 4 5 counted all of them so

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.929 
like 1 2 3 4 5 counted all of them so
answer<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:18.950> need<00:02:19.189> to<00:02:19.340> put<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.730> redstone

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
answer here you need to put a redstone

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.430 
answer here you need to put a redstone
dust<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.750> full<00:02:20.989> check<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.319> repeater

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
dust and a full check the repeater

you<00:02:36.330> just<00:02:36.480> need<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.750> put<00:02:36.930> two<00:02:37.440> more<00:02:37.620> repeaters

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
you just need to put two more repeaters

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.510 
you just need to put two more repeaters
10<00:02:38.310> full<00:02:38.610> tick<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.030> one<00:02:39.960> off<00:02:40.140> one<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.280> take

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
the lead to take delay not the lead so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.750 
the lead to take delay not the lead so
after<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.680> sticky<00:02:46.920> piston<00:02:47.220> here<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.580> need<00:02:47.730> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
after the sticky piston here you need to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.750 
after the sticky piston here you need to
put<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> redstone<00:02:48.390> dust<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.280> good<00:02:50.280> luck<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.580> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
put a redstone dust and good luck you to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.700 
put a redstone dust and good luck you to
stop<00:02:50.970> them<00:02:51.120> from<00:02:51.180> connecting<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.020> put<00:02:52.680> a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
above and put a block with the redstone

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.910 
above and put a block with the redstone
torch<00:02:56.580> above<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.390> put<00:02:58.170> two<00:02:58.380> blocks<00:02:58.710> out

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
torch above that and put two blocks out

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.150 
torch above that and put two blocks out
like<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.520> and<00:03:00.380> out<00:03:01.380> here<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.740> need<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.980> put

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
like this and out here you need to put

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.620 
like this and out here you need to put
blocks<00:03:02.340> up<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:02.970> there's<00:03:03.390> still

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
blocks up like this so there's still

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.140 
blocks up like this so there's still
space<00:03:04.350> for<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.620> pistol<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.100> extend<00:03:05.460> then<00:03:06.090> you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
space for the pistol to extend then you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.270 
space for the pistol to extend then you
should<00:03:06.270> put<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> redstone<00:03:06.720> dust<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.710> torch

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.640 
should put a redstone dust and a torch
right<00:03:08.670> here<00:03:08.970> then<00:03:09.600> put<00:03:09.840> two<00:03:10.020> redstone<00:03:10.230> out

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
right here then put two redstone out

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.760 
right here then put two redstone out

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
to take the repeater and redstone dust

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.420 
to take the repeater and redstone dust
and<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:21.390> torch<00:03:21.810> right<00:03:22.020> here<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.980> need<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.220> put<00:03:23.400> a

a to take delay repeater and a dust so

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.610 
a to take delay repeater and a dust so
that<00:03:33.300> was<00:03:33.450> quite<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.780> lot<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:33.959> stuff<00:03:34.410> right

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
that was quite a lot of stuff right

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.790 
that was quite a lot of stuff right
there<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.760> block<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.480> torch<00:03:37.320> with<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.620> blood

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
there so I block a torch with the blood

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.850 
there so I block a torch with the blood
above<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.220> another<00:03:38.520> torch<00:03:38.850> here<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:40.110> now<00:03:40.650> with

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
above and another torch here so now with

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.670 
above and another torch here so now with
the<00:03:41.100> third<00:03:41.340> layer<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:42.690> put<00:03:42.870> blocks<00:03:43.140> up<00:03:43.410> like

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
the third layer to put blocks up like

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.940 
the third layer to put blocks up like
out<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.520> and<00:03:44.730> put<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:46.410> treat<00:03:46.770> a<00:03:46.920> lady

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
out like this and put to treat a lady

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
out like this and put to treat a lady
Peters<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.620> then<00:03:49.620> three<00:03:49.980> redstone<00:03:50.430> dust<00:03:50.640> and

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
Peters and then three redstone dust and

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.810 
Peters and then three redstone dust and
then<00:03:52.640> two<00:03:53.660> one<00:03:54.660> take<00:03:54.870> delivery<00:03:55.200> Peters<00:03:55.820> one

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
then two one take delivery Peters one

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.300 
then two one take delivery Peters one
take<00:03:57.060> delay<00:03:57.300> on<00:03:57.420> each<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.010> redstone<00:03:59.010> dust

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
take delay on each and redstone dust

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.350 
take delay on each and redstone dust
here<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:01.769> on<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.489> side<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:02.970> block<00:04:03.209> you

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
here so on the side of this block you

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.030 
here so on the side of this block you
need<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.660> put<00:04:03.840> air<00:04:04.019> its<00:04:04.410> own<00:04:04.590> touch<00:04:04.769> with<00:04:05.010> a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
need to put air its own touch with a

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.740 
need to put air its own touch with a
block<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.610> redstone<00:04:05.850> torch<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.570> side

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
block and a redstone torch on the side

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.890 
block and a redstone torch on the side
of<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.320> redstone<00:04:07.620> torch<00:04:07.980> above<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.900> so

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
of that and redstone torch above that so

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.890 
of that and redstone torch above that so
I<00:04:12.920> guess<00:04:13.920> oh<00:04:14.580> yeah<00:04:14.850> we<00:04:15.030> need<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.300> call<00:04:15.630> off<00:04:15.750> this

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
I guess oh yeah we need to call off this

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.699 
I guess oh yeah we need to call off this
redstone<00:04:16.260> right<00:04:16.530> here<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:18.530> think<00:04:19.530> we're

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
redstone right here and I think we're

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.190 
redstone right here and I think we're
done<00:04:19.739> we<00:04:20.130> are<00:04:20.160> we<00:04:20.730> probably<00:04:21.060> aren't<00:04:21.390> but<00:04:21.750> i'm

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
done we are we probably aren't but i'm

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.730 
done we are we probably aren't but i'm
just<00:04:22.380> going<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.830> test<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.960> see<00:04:24.960> if<00:04:25.200> it<00:04:25.560> will

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
just going to test it see if it will

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.420 
just going to test it see if it will
extract<00:04:26.550> yes<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.570> will<00:04:27.840> i<00:04:28.140> tried<00:04:28.980> so<00:04:29.280> many

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
extract yes it will i tried so many
