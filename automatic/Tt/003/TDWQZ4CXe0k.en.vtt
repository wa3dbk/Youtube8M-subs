00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.089
 Eulalia guys from Serna discovered him the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.790
 hospital that she had more than 5 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.330
 years I had pulmonary fibrosis but 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.969
 It was mild according to the doctor but after 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.099
 has been advancing after time not 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.260
 we realized that he had advanced 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.420
 too much and 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.610
 well the whistles told me that I do not 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.680
 I had nothing to do, you just have to 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.540
 wait for the time because they died 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.390
 for chronic looking that affects people 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.010
 20 50 and 70 years old and that is characterized by 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.370
 the presence of scars in the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.230
 lungs idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.290
 and the truth medicine 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.810
 chemistry could not be read anything about 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.800
 put in 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.620
 cough syrup medicine 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.440
 the others were chemicals too but 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.020
 just to soothe the pain of both the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.269
 back and to avoid a little cough 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.440
 nothing else I had nothing to do 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.210
 according to the doctor the chemist this condition 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.949
 gradually replaces the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.509
 pulmonary alveoli by fibrous witness 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.790
 so the membrane of the lungs 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.250
 they become thick and increasingly stiff 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.560
 This condition makes it difficult to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.119
 breathing action and consequently it 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.130
 It is losing the activity of tissue 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.979
 to transport oxygen to the torrent 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.979
 very bad blood very badly 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.710
 or with the treatment that is 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.980
 I was giving little by little it has gone 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.330
 recovering 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.850
 and of course the cough is very demanding for her 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.120
 he was drowning constant also coughing 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.070
 even with the drooling saliva we had 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.840
 have to be constantly running to 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.500
 emergency hospital so that you 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.900
 they can perform constant and they were things 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.430
 direct and every day this problem 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.560
 pulmonary manifests through 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.710
 respiratory difficulties cough dry and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.200
 Chronic weakness fatigue discomfort in the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.250
 chest loss of appetite and consequence 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.730
 of entesa 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.149
 but already with the treatment you will 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.200
 has been giving and we are there at the foot of 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.650
 she 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.680
 it has improved a lot but recovering 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.629
 little by little to date they are unknown 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.300
 the causes that triggers the 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.310
 pulmonary tribulation however there are 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.690
 risk factors that apparently 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.550
 favor the manifestation of 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.260
 disease such as exposure to 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.209
 inorganic particles like silica 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.459
 of asbestos or organic compounds as 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.110
 bird proteins diseases like 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.480
 rheumatoid or light arthritis 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.720
 hernia that can affect the lungs or 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.970
 genetic predisposition and good each in 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.099
 every emergency I recount that in each 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.730
 emergency that I take away the 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:50.480
 x-ray plates and doctors says 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.239
 no lady is very advanced her future is 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.849
 pulmonary she can not do anything no 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.489
 you can do nothing for her but doctor 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.349
 I tell him there must be possibilities not 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.180
 lady tells me about you wait for the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.090
 time nothing else there is nothing to do 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.060
 for her very well doctor law and that's why 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.500
 we still have continued with the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.990
 natural medicine

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.610
 exceeded enough 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.220
 I would like to suggest to people that 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.040

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.730
