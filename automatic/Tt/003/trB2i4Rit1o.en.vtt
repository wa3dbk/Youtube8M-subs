00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
mouth hopefully now rigged like that the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.750 
mouth hopefully now rigged like that the
bait<00:03:56.260> is<00:03:56.440> straight<00:03:56.860> it's<00:03:57.100> not<00:03:57.280> gonna<00:03:57.490> roll

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
through the water to make it spin to get

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.490 
through the water to make it spin to get
the<00:04:00.340> roll<00:04:00.550> we<00:04:00.790> want<00:04:01.030> put<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.750> little<00:04:01.930> curve<00:04:02.350> in

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
two hooks to create that curve in the

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.720 
two hooks to create that curve in the
bait<00:04:11.680> now<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:14.200> can<00:04:14.380> see<00:04:14.650> see<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.460> I've

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
pulled a curve in that bait the more

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.310 
pulled a curve in that bait the more
curve<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.609> pull<00:04:18.820> in<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.540> bigger<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.080> role

more<00:04:30.970> think<00:04:31.240> of<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.390> drill<00:04:31.840> bit<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.890> that's<00:04:33.070> kind

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
more think of a drill bit so that's kind

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.590 
more think of a drill bit so that's kind
of<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> two<00:04:33.669> differences

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
of the two differences

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.090 
of the two differences
and<00:04:34.690> we'll<00:04:35.050> show<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.290> this<00:04:35.410> in<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.620> water<00:04:35.890> in

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
and we'll show you this in the water in

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.940 
and we'll show you this in the water in
a<00:04:36.190> second<00:04:36.690> but<00:04:37.690> that's<00:04:37.990> got<00:04:38.200> a<00:04:38.230> good<00:04:38.380> curve<00:04:38.710> in

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
a second but that's got a good curve in

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.220 
a second but that's got a good curve in
it<00:04:38.980> so<00:04:39.220> that<00:04:39.370> one's<00:04:39.610> ready<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.940> go<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.330> couple

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
it so that one's ready to go a couple

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.170 
it so that one's ready to go a couple
final<00:04:41.650> notes<00:04:41.890> on<00:04:42.160> this<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:42.520> if<00:04:42.760> you're<00:04:42.910> using

final notes on this so if you're using
Internet<00:04:43.420> downrigger<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:44.200> have<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.530> put<00:04:44.710> this

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
Internet downrigger I have to put this

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.280 
Internet downrigger I have to put this
about<00:04:45.130> 60<00:04:45.640> feet<00:04:45.850> behind<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.360> boat<00:04:46.540> drop<00:04:46.990> it<00:04:47.140> down

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
about 60 feet behind a boat drop it down

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.930 
about 60 feet behind a boat drop it down
to<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.560> depth<00:04:47.800> where<00:04:47.920> I<00:04:48.010> think<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.400> fish<00:04:48.670> are

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
to the depth where I think the fish are

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.700 
to the depth where I think the fish are
you<00:04:49.570> get<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.780> couple<00:04:50.080> different<00:04:50.380> kinds<00:04:50.620> of

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
you get a couple different kinds of

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.980 
you get a couple different kinds of
