00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
here you should not do like in such a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.930 
here you should not do like in such a
way<00:02:37.570> where<00:02:37.870> you're<00:02:38.110> actually<00:02:38.320> doing<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.580> and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
way where you're actually doing this and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.170 
way where you're actually doing this and
hoping<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.960> drop<00:02:41.200> down<00:02:41.380> because<00:02:41.920> one<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.090> you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
hoping to drop down because one and you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.900 
hoping to drop down because one and you
see<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.870> can't<00:02:44.170> regenerate<00:02:44.320> health<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.550> this

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
see you can't regenerate health so this

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.760 
see you can't regenerate health so this
would<00:02:46.600> suck<00:02:46.870> them<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.200> have<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.560> first

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
would suck them to have in the first

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.280 
would suck them to have in the first
place<00:02:47.890> I'll<00:02:48.190> me<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:49.150> that's<00:02:49.360> nobody<00:02:49.960> that

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
place I'll me that that's nobody that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.800

that<00:02:50.710> would<00:02:51.160> never<00:02:51.370> happened<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.420> let's<00:02:52.630> put

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
that would never happened but let's put

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.540 
that would never happened but let's put
it<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:52.900> way<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.170> step<00:02:53.590> on<00:02:53.740> this<00:02:53.860> plate<00:02:54.160> that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
it this way you step on this plate that

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.970 
it this way you step on this plate that
