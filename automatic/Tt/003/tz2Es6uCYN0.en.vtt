ASCO<00:05:02.180> one<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.360> worst<00:05:03.540> parts<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.050> game

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
ASCO one of the worst parts of the game

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.110 
ASCO one of the worst parts of the game
is<00:05:04.470> how<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.680> pitch<00:05:04.980> is<00:05:05.190> divided<00:05:05.640> into<00:05:05.850> three

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
is how the pitch is divided into three

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.840 
is how the pitch is divided into three
sections<00:05:07.250> transferring<00:05:08.250> from<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.490> penalty

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
sections transferring from the penalty

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.240 
sections transferring from the penalty
area<00:05:08.970> so<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.360> halfway<00:05:09.570> line<00:05:09.780> involves<00:05:10.530> slow

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
area so the halfway line involves slow

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.630 
area so the halfway line involves slow
scrolling<00:05:12.000> which<00:05:12.390> breaks<00:05:12.720> up<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.050> action

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
scrolling which breaks up the action

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.100 
scrolling which breaks up the action
you're<00:05:14.640> also<00:05:14.940> only<00:05:15.060> allowed<00:05:15.360> to<00:05:15.540> control<00:05:15.840> one

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
you're also only allowed to control one

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.930 
you're also only allowed to control one
outfield<00:05:16.650> player<00:05:16.980> per<00:05:17.190> section<00:05:17.550> of<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.760> pitch

outfield player per section of the pitch

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.900
