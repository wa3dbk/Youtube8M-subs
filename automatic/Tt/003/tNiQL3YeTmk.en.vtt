00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello to you all to give and today we 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.799
 Consider a mod that will add us 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.780
 pedestals for swords as I remember 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.769
 there is such a mod that adds come 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.799
 tables for armor 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.850
 but it has not been for the pedestals and swords 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.660
 see how it is crafting now 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.460
 will be shown in the corner of the screen and so here 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.289
 so it looks and you can put it 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.090
 any sword which is basically logical 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.720
 give attention now to go to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.390
 its functions need to press shift and then 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.390
 right mouse button here he has on 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.980
 several functions the first is possible 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.969
 change its appearance 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.360
 Here we take the second skill from me 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.879
 such triforce appears further 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.719
 that we can still change, we can 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.960
 to establish 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.390
 a ray that will rise into the sky as 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.710
 at the beacon and we can customize the color of this 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.270
 the beam and the color density of this beam 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:06.510
 like that yellow red 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:10.920
 everything is clear of this type turn off further 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.280
 turning now we are not 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.360
 turn the guy here we turn and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.640
 our sword soars further we turn on 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.880
 ness and he spins counterclockwise 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.860
 arrows we press over here and he 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.630
 spinning clockwise is also possible 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.630
 adjust rotation speed 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.149
 let him come back 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.130
 fast slowly if we turn this off 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.680
 function then we will be able to turn the month 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.610
 independently what 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.770
 any angle like but she and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.369
 any depression 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.869
 Further Redstone tab is not yet available and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.250
 there are still any effects 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.310
 here's how he is here too 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.409
 would be spinning but in principle it's all 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 you can put on any sword in this 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.700
 The very Candy became here itself turns 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.440
 pedestal but in principle all 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.910
 all while swami was given if you 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.099
