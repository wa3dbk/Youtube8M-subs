00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.630 
only the ladies after all it's the
female<00:00:15.960> mosquito<00:00:16.500> alone<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.010> stings<00:00:17.340> and

who lays the eggs that hatch more

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:31.339 
who lays the eggs that hatch more
mosquitoes<00:00:24.830> so<00:00:25.830> how<00:00:26.010> does<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.279> work<00:00:30.289> for<00:00:31.289> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
mosquitoes so how does it work for a

up if the trap can lure them in close
enough<00:00:46.559> by<00:00:47.070> making<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> mosquitoes<00:00:48.090> believe

enough by making the mosquitoes believe
it's<00:00:48.750> their<00:00:48.930> next<00:00:49.230> meal<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:50.730> find<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.120> how<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it's their next meal to find out how it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:29.780 
it's their next meal to find out how it
works<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.039> apart

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.050

the move

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.350 
the move
that's<00:01:34.140> right<00:01:34.490> here's<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.760> trap<00:01:36.090> fakes

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
that's right here's how the trap fakes

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.530 
that's right here's how the trap fakes
it<00:01:38.240> first

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it first

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.740 
it first
it's<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.170> sweaty<00:01:41.060> inside<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.540> upper

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
it's got to be sweaty inside that upper

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.930 
it's got to be sweaty inside that upper
compartment<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.500> another<00:01:44.100> cap<00:01:44.400> there's<00:01:44.850> a

that<00:01:52.410> attracts<00:01:52.860> mosquitoes<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:55.800> gel<00:01:56.070> slowly

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that attracts mosquitoes the gel slowly

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.480 
that attracts mosquitoes the gel slowly
releases<00:01:57.030> octenol<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.080> air<00:01:58.230> even<00:01:59.070> from

the<00:02:08.700> mosquitoes<00:02:09.270> come<00:02:09.540> closer<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.470> check<00:02:10.679> out

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the mosquitoes come closer to check out

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.890 
the mosquitoes come closer to check out
where<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.130> sweats<00:02:11.520> coming<00:02:11.730> from<00:02:12.090> they<00:02:12.690> want

to find that living breathing animal

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.950 
to find that living breathing animal
that's<00:02:16.020> why<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.350> propane<00:02:16.860> comes<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:18.570> flows

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
that's why the propane comes in it flows
