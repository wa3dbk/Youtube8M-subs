00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.680
 hello together as we this hochbeet 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.590
 You probably already have built in 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.300
 Seen our videos and now it is 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.300
 time to plant 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.970
 now comes group distributed urrocks 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:39.079
 mail on the raised bed and then we will 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.890
 Planting surface temperature 13 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.110
 one and a half degrees 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.110
 and what looks a bit deeper 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.250
 20 degrees 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.250
 also 19 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.590
 At the announcement we have now 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.110
 broccoli plant green but also red 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.300
 They have a planting distance of 40 cm 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.300
 and I'm sunk in the earth now 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:56.780
 now come in the middle row so 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:59.090
 speaks cauliflower and purple white 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.890
 and the first time doing a green 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.869
 but only one under 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.310
 romanesco is the difference 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.619
 you could not have really 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.000
 see the back is one of the one is 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.350
 a bit bigger the stop still from the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.690
 greenhouse maybe we can do that 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.209
 Here I hope sooner the distance 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:23.360
 is at the cabbages 40 centimeters 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:31.160
 So 40 away from each other in the square 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:33.290
 We are now planting the middle rooms 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.480
 the left side with kohlrabi and up 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.220
 the right side with salad are the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.510
 long ago finished when the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.510
 Cabbages are larger 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.740
 We are now aware of the cabbages 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.690
 they have set something lower 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.860
 more stood and can grow better 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.860
 Now comes the salad 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.380
 our plants are too far in here 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.330
 The next thing is to pour it on and it 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.800
 is a safety net over it otherwise 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.010
 the chickens are faster than that 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.010
 but the safety net is only up 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.600
 here in front because of the whole 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.040
 outside so there comes out later 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.410
 ne mail anyway on the other side 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.420
 outside also and in the middle 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.100
 used cucumbers we have that nice 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.150
 warm and sunny and they can do it 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.400
 down the line 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.690
 but we'll see that later, now 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.690
 it says first march water 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.640
 now the network will be built on it 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.860
 So have 50 centimeters iron bars on 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.720
 three meters come five pieces of rain and 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.730
 they are the first ones to be used 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.750
 the same for the net at it 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.750
 can be attached 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.560
 the net what we have now is three 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.660
 meter 60 x 5 meters 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.550
 we have several of them and ours 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.250
 aspiring to go the beets 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.960
 system moderately raise so that they 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.840
 if possible all have the same size 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.470
 So that all components to every picture 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.170
 fit 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.240
 we have the net in agriculture 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.170
 need bought that are something 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.090
 expensive 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.980
 that's true but they are very 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.050
 Sturdy and lasting many years 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.050
 so once the purchase with us 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.460
 we have the four outsides 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.580
 zusammengeknotet that is very convenient 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.249
 and then just to the net so to the 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.590
 stuck firmly and now to 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.479
 complaining come on the outside 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.499
 iron bars in it to open it up 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.389
 any case not to whom 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:08.930
 By the way, the nets are washable without 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.930
 problems 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.780
 We had a rest sala we 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.760
 have held back to possibly 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.190
 to put down if one is received 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.160
 but should not be allowed salad anymore 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.670
 come in because marcel has him now 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.670
 eaten 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.690
 our raised bed is now fully stocked 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.930
 with romanesco with cauliflower with 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.390
 broccoli with kohlrabi and salads 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.340
 we hope that so june / july the 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.720
 cool stuff and the salads 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.280
 of course, hopefully a bit of it 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.840
 finished we hope you have the video 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.030
 a little bit fun maybe you are 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.920
 you are inspired to try it yourself 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.300
 maybe you do it to vary 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.160
 Maybe you do it differently 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.690
 similarly, we just tell each other 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.300
 We would be pleased in the comments 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.750
 a nice april to you all still up 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.750
 soon
