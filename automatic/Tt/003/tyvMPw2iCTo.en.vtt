read this research I came with an idea
if<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.460> take<00:01:14.970> regular<00:01:15.240> pectin<00:01:15.899> modify<00:01:16.649> to<00:01:16.710> a

if I can take regular pectin modify to a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.190 
if I can take regular pectin modify to a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
smaller size and the right structure so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.010 
smaller size and the right structure so
it<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.590> absorbed<00:01:20.159> into<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> bloodstream

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
it can get absorbed into the bloodstream

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.050 
it can get absorbed into the bloodstream
it<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.079> serve<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.829> a<00:01:22.890> gentle<00:01:23.430> cue<00:01:23.610> later<00:01:23.820> of

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.649 
citrus pectin as a key later of heavy
metals<00:01:37.200> we've<00:01:37.890> also<00:01:38.280> shown<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.479> we

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659

combine modified citrus pectin with

combine modified citrus pectin with

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
modified alginates

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.880 
modified alginates
which<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.700> similar<00:01:45.119> structure<00:01:45.860> they<00:01:46.860> have

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
which have a similar structure they have

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
which have a similar structure they have
a<00:01:47.070> synergistic<00:01:47.820> effect<00:01:48.180> both<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
a synergistic effect both in the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.760 
a synergistic effect both in the
bloodstream<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.829> valid<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> gut<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
bloodstream is valid in the gut and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.200 
bloodstream is valid in the gut and
therefore<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.219> prevent<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
therefore they can prevent the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.630 
therefore they can prevent the
reabsorption<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.140> heavy<00:01:55.320> metals<00:01:55.770> which<00:01:56.609> can

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
reabsorption of heavy metals which can

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
reabsorption of heavy metals which can
be<00:01:56.969> excreted<00:01:57.390> into<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.990> gut<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.740> get

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
be excreted into the gut but then get

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.340 
be excreted into the gut but then get
reabsorbed<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.909> therefore<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.899> need<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> much

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
reabsorbed and therefore we need a much

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.670 
reabsorbed and therefore we need a much
lower<00:02:01.649> dosage<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.780> chelating<00:02:04.200> affect

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
lower dosage to have a chelating affect

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.279 
lower dosage to have a chelating affect
