all right folks this video is intended
for<00:00:27.130> those<00:00:27.429> who<00:00:27.669> file<00:00:27.970> press<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.169> concern

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
for those who file press and concern

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.840 
for those who file press and concern
about<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:30.099> ace<00:00:30.460> 250<00:00:31.119> and<00:00:31.809> it's<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.290> loose<00:00:33.250> coil

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
about the ace 250 and it's a loose coil

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.389 
about the ace 250 and it's a loose coil
well<00:00:34.780> obviously<00:00:35.170> you<00:00:35.590> can<00:00:35.769> see<00:00:35.800> that<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.280> is

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
well obviously you can see that this is

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.200 
well obviously you can see that this is
rather<00:00:36.579> loose<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.699> reason<00:00:40.000> why<00:00:40.150> is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
rather loose and the reason why is

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.470 
rather loose and the reason why is
because<00:00:40.589> the<00:00:41.589> rubber<00:00:41.980> grommets<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:43.239> came

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
because the rubber grommets that came

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.380 
because the rubber grommets that came
with<00:00:43.659> it<00:00:43.690> I<00:00:44.559> did<00:00:45.399> this<00:00:45.519> myself<00:00:45.699> when<00:00:46.269> I<00:00:46.300> first

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
with it I did this myself when I first

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.710 
with it I did this myself when I first
installed<00:00:46.839> the<00:00:47.379> coil<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.430> one<00:00:48.640> I'll<00:00:49.600> put

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
installed the coil to the one I'll put

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.479 
installed the coil to the one I'll put
the<00:00:49.839> krumitz<00:00:50.140> on<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.379> outside<00:00:50.769> and<00:00:51.309> they

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
the krumitz on the outside and they

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.040 
the krumitz on the outside and they
actually<00:00:51.610> intended<00:00:52.149> to<00:00:52.269> go<00:00:52.390> on<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.659> inside

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
actually intended to go on the inside

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.889 
actually intended to go on the inside
where<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.100> one<00:00:54.789> shaft<00:00:55.210> next<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.079> coil<00:00:57.899> let

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
where the one shaft next to the coil let

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:59.939 
where the one shaft next to the coil let
me<00:00:58.960> show<00:00:59.109> you<00:00:59.170> how<00:00:59.379> it<00:00:59.440> should<00:00:59.679> be<00:00:59.800> done

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
me show you how it should be done

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.939 
me show you how it should be done
correctly<00:01:00.870> you'll<00:01:01.870> notice<00:01:02.199> here<00:01:02.469> that<00:01:02.500> the

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
correctly you'll notice here that the

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.189 
correctly you'll notice here that the
grommets<00:01:03.609> you'll<00:01:04.089> see<00:01:04.300> are<00:01:04.449> on<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.600> outside

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
grommets you'll see are on the outside

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.210 
grommets you'll see are on the outside
of<00:01:05.560> where<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:06.270> connector<00:01:07.270> assembly<00:01:07.960> is<00:01:08.220> where

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
of where the connector assembly is where

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.260 
of where the connector assembly is where
your<00:01:09.899> one<00:01:10.899> attach<00:01:11.410> it<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.710> your<00:01:11.740> coil<00:01:12.270> actually

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
your one attach it to your coil actually

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.910 
your one attach it to your coil actually
these<00:01:13.450> grommets<00:01:13.720> these<00:01:14.170> rubber<00:01:14.500> grommets

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
these grommets these rubber grommets

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.029 
these grommets these rubber grommets
should<00:01:15.130> be<00:01:15.250> inside<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:15.909> inside<00:01:16.270> this<00:01:16.539> one

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
should be inside and inside this one

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.730 
should be inside and inside this one
there's<00:01:18.039> a<00:01:18.130> recession<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:19.210> these<00:01:20.110> grommets

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
there's a recession that these grommets

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.540 
there's a recession that these grommets
fit<00:01:21.130> into<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.740> notice<00:01:24.039> on<00:01:24.190> these<00:01:24.310> grommets

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
fit into if you notice on these grommets

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.780 
fit into if you notice on these grommets
you'll<00:01:24.940> see<00:01:25.119> these<00:01:25.300> recessions<00:01:26.310> these<00:01:27.310> were

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
you'll see these recessions these were

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.490 
you'll see these recessions these were
going<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.060> go<00:01:28.210> right<00:01:28.450> into<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.869> wand<00:01:29.200> where

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
going to go right into that wand where

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.350 
going to go right into that wand where
the<00:01:29.619> recession<00:01:30.100> is<00:01:30.220> there's<00:01:30.670> little<00:01:30.909> pegs<00:01:31.149> on

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
the recession is there's little pegs on

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.399 
the recession is there's little pegs on
there<00:01:31.509> that<00:01:31.659> you'll<00:01:31.810> see<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.200> you'll

retaining washer on there you'll notice
a<00:02:31.150> big<00:02:31.180> difference<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:32.020> how<00:02:32.920> well<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.510> works

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
a big difference in how well is it works

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.540 
a big difference in how well is it works
compared<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.440> installing<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.190> incorrect

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
compared to installing it the incorrect

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.660 
compared to installing it the incorrect
way<00:02:36.989> I'm<00:02:37.989> guilty<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.650> too<00:02:38.890> when<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.640> first

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
way I'm guilty of this too when I first

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.540 
way I'm guilty of this too when I first
installed<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.540> wasn't<00:02:40.750> such<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.930> rush<00:02:41.550> I'll

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
installed it I wasn't such a rush I'll

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.250 
installed it I wasn't such a rush I'll
put<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.820> together<00:02:42.940> incorrectly<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.050> you're

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
put it together incorrectly and you're

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.259 
put it together incorrectly and you're
wondering<00:02:44.620> what<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:45.400> heck's<00:02:45.730> going<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.209> with

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
wondering what the heck's going on with

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.420 
wondering what the heck's going on with
this<00:02:46.570> so<00:02:47.320> really<00:02:47.500> all<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.650> need<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.950> smoke<00:02:48.310> it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
this so really all you need to smoke it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.280 
this so really all you need to smoke it
up<00:02:48.489> by<00:02:48.640> hand<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:50.580> you'll<00:02:51.580> see<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:53.500> by

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
up by hand and you'll see that by

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.750 
up by hand and you'll see that by
installing<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.650> properly<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.519> will<00:02:57.640> hold

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
installing it properly that it will hold

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.380 
installing it properly that it will hold
whatever<00:02:58.150> position<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:59.230> put<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.209> put<00:03:01.209> on

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
whatever position you put it to put on

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.990 
whatever position you put it to put on
the<00:03:01.510> ground<00:03:01.660> if<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.200> tilt<00:03:02.470> your<00:03:03.000> one

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
the ground if you just tilt your one

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.410 
the ground if you just tilt your one
it'll<00:03:04.750> retain<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.260> position<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:07.209> if<00:03:07.269> you're

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
it'll retain that position so if you're

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.360 
it'll retain that position so if you're
sweeping<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.750> little<00:03:08.019> closer<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.769> maybe<00:03:08.980> less

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
sweeping a little closer and maybe less

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.690 
sweeping a little closer and maybe less
of<00:03:09.549> an<00:03:09.640> angle<00:03:10.320> swing<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.470> little<00:03:11.560> further<00:03:12.340> you

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
of an angle swing a little further you

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.420 
of an angle swing a little further you
ain't<00:03:12.940> may<00:03:13.120> want<00:03:13.360> more<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.630> an<00:03:13.750> angle<00:03:13.900> but

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
ain't may want more of an angle but

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.789 
ain't may want more of an angle but
that's<00:03:15.430> how<00:03:15.549> you'll<00:03:15.760> take<00:03:15.910> care<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.150> that
