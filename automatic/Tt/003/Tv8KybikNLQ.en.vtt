00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
find the center stem right away I'm

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.399 
find the center stem right away I'm
always<00:00:49.379> concerned<00:00:49.800> about<00:00:50.190> light<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.760> shadow

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
always concerned about light and shadow

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.299 
always concerned about light and shadow
so<00:00:52.409> I'm<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> shade<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.339> just<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.670> bit<00:00:55.309> this

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so I'm going to shade it just a bit this

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.860 
so I'm going to shade it just a bit this
is<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> yellow<00:00:57.150> feather<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.750> I've

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
texture in there and then I'm going to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.240 
texture in there and then I'm going to
start<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:08.940> this

sunburst yellow to fill out that shadow
just<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.549> you're<00:01:17.670> working<00:01:17.969> on

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
just a bit and when you're working on

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.380 
just a bit and when you're working on
tone<00:01:18.360> paper<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.789> if<00:01:20.789> you<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.119> want

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
to get a highlight you have to go very

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.569 
to get a highlight you have to go very
light<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.649> to<00:01:25.710> use<00:01:25.859> this<00:01:26.070> cream

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
light so I'm going to use this cream

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.499 
light so I'm going to use this cream
pencil<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.100> get<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.280> highlight<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.390> now

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
pencil and get the highlight going now

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.080 
pencil and get the highlight going now
what<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.770> half<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
what I like to do is have half the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.289 
what I like to do is have half the
feather<00:01:33.710> lit<00:01:34.710> toward<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.579> center<00:01:36.859> and<00:01:38.149> on<00:01:39.149> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
feather lit toward the center and on the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.969 
feather lit toward the center and on the
other<00:01:39.450> side<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:40.289> it<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> edge<00:01:40.859> actually

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
other side have it on the edge actually

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.880 
other side have it on the edge actually
gives<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> some<00:01:44.250> dimension<00:01:44.399> yeah<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:46.619> then

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
gives it some dimension yeah and then

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.050 
gives it some dimension yeah and then
the<00:01:47.729> last<00:01:47.939> step<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.689> actually<00:01:48.990> add<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
the last step is to actually add the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.020 
the last step is to actually add the
yellow<00:01:51.060> color<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.829> build<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.820> light

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
yellow color so you build up the light

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.700 
yellow color so you build up the light
and<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> shadow<00:01:54.450> first<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.439> add

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and the shadow first and then you add

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.179 
and the shadow first and then you add
the<00:01:59.189> yellow<00:01:59.549> color<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.770> now<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.859> reason

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the yellow color to it now the reason

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.649 
the yellow color to it now the reason
I'm<00:02:02.310> showing<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.509> know

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
I'm showing that is because you know

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.359 
I'm showing that is because you know
when<00:02:03.869> we<00:02:04.109> think<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.409> yellow<00:02:04.799> sometimes<00:02:05.219> we

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
when we think about yellow sometimes we

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.950 
when we think about yellow sometimes we
just<00:02:05.549> want<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.939> straight<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:06.450> yellow<00:02:06.689> but

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
just want to go straight with yellow but

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.300 
just want to go straight with yellow but
by<00:02:07.079> doing<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.740> actually<00:02:08.130> get<00:02:08.280> more

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
by doing this you actually get more

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.410 
by doing this you actually get more
dimension<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.210> it<00:02:09.360> quicker<00:02:11.150> now<00:02:12.150> would<00:02:12.330> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
dimension with it quicker now would you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.140 
dimension with it quicker now would you
like<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.260> darker<00:02:13.890> feather<00:02:14.160> yeah<00:02:14.700> let's

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
like to see a darker feather yeah let's

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.360 
like to see a darker feather yeah let's
see<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.540> what<00:02:16.410> about<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> crow<00:02:16.860> feather<00:02:17.130> or

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
see one what about a crow feather or

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.880 
see one what about a crow feather or
Raven<00:02:17.760> Raven<00:02:18.450> well<00:02:19.140> they're<00:02:19.470> going<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.830> be

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
Raven Raven well they're going to be

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.980 
Raven Raven well they're going to be
dark<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.550> course

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
dark of course

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.280 
dark of course
and<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:22.190> your<00:02:22.400> contrast<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.360> reduced<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:24.020> little

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and so your contrast is reduced a little

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.470 
and so your contrast is reduced a little
bit<00:02:27.400> pretty<00:02:28.400> much<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.820> same<00:02:29.000> way<00:02:29.240> you're

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
bit pretty much the same way you're

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.730 
bit pretty much the same way you're
going<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.660> start<00:02:29.900> with<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> shadow<00:02:30.470> and

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
going to start with the shadow and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.780 
going to start with the shadow and
you're<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:30.980> get<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.280> little<00:02:31.520> bit<00:02:31.670> of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
you're going to get a little bit of

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.930 
you're going to get a little bit of
texture<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.300> there<00:02:32.600> like<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:33.790> seems<00:02:34.790> like

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
texture in there like this seems like

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.570 
texture in there like this seems like
colored<00:02:35.210> pencils<00:02:35.600> perfect<00:02:36.050> for<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> feather<00:02:36.580> it

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
colored pencils perfect for a feather it

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.490 
colored pencils perfect for a feather it
is<00:02:37.760> because<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.300> can<00:02:38.480> get<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.690> fine<00:02:39.230> detail

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
is because you can get that fine detail

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.670 
is because you can get that fine detail
in<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.690> mean<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.840> can<00:02:42.020> do<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.350> with<00:02:42.560> other

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
in it I mean you can do this with other

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.800 
in it I mean you can do this with other
media<00:02:43.100> too<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:43.580> it's<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:43.940> very<00:02:44.090> easy<00:02:44.570> with

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
media too but it's just very easy with

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.200 
media too but it's just very easy with
color<00:02:45.050> pencil<00:02:45.560> that's<00:02:45.830> why<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.040> think<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:47.150> many

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
color pencil that's why I think so many

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.490 
color pencil that's why I think so many
beginners<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:48.020> do<00:02:48.200> well<00:02:48.410> with<00:02:48.440> color<00:02:48.890> pencil

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
beginners can do well with color pencil

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.380 
beginners can do well with color pencil
so<00:02:51.500> as<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.830> start<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.280> build<00:02:52.970> up<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.360> layers

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
so as you start to build up the layers

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.450 
so as you start to build up the layers
it's<00:02:53.960> going<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> get<00:02:54.350> darker<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:54.920> darker<00:02:55.070> but

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
it's going to get darker and darker but

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.400 
it's going to get darker and darker but
one<00:02:55.610> thing<00:02:55.850> about<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.180> Crow's<00:02:56.750> feather<00:02:56.780> or<00:02:57.380> a

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
one thing about a Crow's feather or a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.320 
one thing about a Crow's feather or a
Ravens<00:02:57.920> feather<00:02:58.220> is<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:59.300> it's<00:02:59.510> almost

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
Ravens feather is that it's almost

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.490 
Ravens feather is that it's almost
reflective<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.480> different<00:03:02.960> colors<00:03:05.020> luminous

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.860 

iridescent<00:03:09.500> that's<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:10.160> word<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.510> what<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.720> do

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
iridescent that's the word so what I do

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.210 
iridescent that's the word so what I do
is<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:12.500> go<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:12.800> my<00:03:13.640> other<00:03:14.300> colors<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.800> greens

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
is I go to my other colors like greens

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.360 
is I go to my other colors like greens
and<00:03:18.100> blues<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:20.200> when<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.320> add<00:03:21.530> those<00:03:21.860> colors

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
and blues and when you add those colors

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.260 
and blues and when you add those colors
to<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.910> you're<00:03:23.540> going<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.780> get<00:03:23.990> more<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:25.730> an

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
to it you're going to get more of an

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.850 
to it you're going to get more of an
iridescent<00:03:26.980> appearance<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.460> even<00:03:29.210> pink<00:03:29.860> so

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
iridescent appearance to it even pink so

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.970 
iridescent appearance to it even pink so
that's<00:03:31.130> not<00:03:31.340> really<00:03:31.520> black<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.360> never<00:03:32.600> is

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
that's not really black it never is

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.000 
that's not really black it never is
black<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.340> white<00:03:34.850> are<00:03:35.150> both<00:03:35.560> among<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.740> most

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
black and white are both among the most

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.000 
black and white are both among the most
reflective<00:03:38.410> we<00:03:39.410> would<00:03:39.560> call<00:03:39.770> colors<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:42.860> you

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
reflective we would call colors that you

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.620 
reflective we would call colors that you
deal<00:03:43.250> with<00:03:43.490> when<00:03:43.730> you're<00:03:43.760> drawing<00:03:44.150> and
