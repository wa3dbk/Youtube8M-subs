so<00:00:22.429> in<00:00:22.490> this<00:00:22.580> video<00:00:22.759> we're<00:00:23.150> going<00:00:23.330> to<00:00:23.449> be

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
so in this video we're going to be

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.920 
so in this video we're going to be
comparing<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.769> eleven<00:00:25.130> rack<00:00:25.329> to<00:00:26.329> the<00:00:26.570> eleven

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
comparing the eleven rack to the eleven

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.400 
comparing the eleven rack to the eleven
our<00:00:27.349> tez<00:00:27.740> plug-in<00:00:28.609> will<00:00:29.480> be<00:00:29.630> comparing<00:00:30.230> the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
our tez plug-in will be comparing the

out<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.420> process<00:01:02.960> in<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.230> video<00:01:04.100> I

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
out the process in that video I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.570 
out the process in that video I
described<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.179> exact<00:01:05.509> process<00:01:06.350> I'm<00:01:06.920> using<00:01:07.369> to

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
described the exact process I'm using to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.130 
described the exact process I'm using to
record<00:01:07.880> these<00:01:08.060> samples<00:01:08.539> to<00:01:08.660> make<00:01:08.780> sure<00:01:08.990> that

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
record these samples to make sure that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.050 
record these samples to make sure that
they<00:01:09.229> are<00:01:09.380> exact<00:01:09.860> now<00:01:10.369> let's<00:01:10.550> listen<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:10.880> some

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
they are exact now let's listen to some

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:25.810 
they are exact now let's listen to some
samples

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:02:42.830 

you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.270 

you

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.610 

so<00:02:49.280> both<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.460> those<00:02:49.610> were<00:02:49.790> pretty<00:02:50.510> similar<00:02:50.840> in

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
so both of those were pretty similar in

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.980 
so both of those were pretty similar in
my<00:02:51.770> opinion<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.340> settings<00:02:52.730> were<00:02:53.510> all<00:02:53.660> set<00:02:53.960> to

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
my opinion the settings were all set to

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.970 
my opinion the settings were all set to
pretty<00:02:54.500> much<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.860> same<00:02:55.840> level<00:02:56.840> one<00:02:57.680> thing<00:02:57.860> to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
pretty much the same level one thing to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.580 
pretty much the same level one thing to
note<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:59.270> algorithm<00:03:00.020> for<00:03:00.230> speaker

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
note is that the algorithm for speaker

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.490 
note is that the algorithm for speaker
breakup<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.190> different<00:03:01.670> than<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.090> algorithm

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
breakup is different than the algorithm

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.160 
breakup is different than the algorithm
for<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.560> speaker<00:03:03.890> breakup<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:05.330> eleven<00:03:06.050> are

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
for a speaker breakup in the eleven are

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.310 
for a speaker breakup in the eleven are
test<00:03:06.470> version<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.310> eleven<00:03:07.670> rack<00:03:08.320> speaker

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
test version so the eleven rack speaker

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.040 
test version so the eleven rack speaker
breakup<00:03:09.770> algorithm<00:03:10.460> is<00:03:10.610> different<00:03:11.210> than<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
breakup algorithm is different than the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.590 
breakup algorithm is different than the
original<00:03:12.800> algorithm<00:03:13.340> used<00:03:13.940> in<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.270> eleven

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
original algorithm used in the eleven
