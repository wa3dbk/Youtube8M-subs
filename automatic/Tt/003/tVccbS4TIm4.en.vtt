00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:06.260
 good as mike mccready explainable by six as they are subject the pompoms 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.149
 from tillikum 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.239
 when we finish the process 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.719
 They will stay this way. 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.539
 in a place to fit the hand 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.970
 very comfortably 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 it has a place where jean figure they will 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.909
 king milk 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.909
 It's called red bull. 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.060
 bosingwa call here 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.060
 hand is fully covered 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.340
 you can 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850
 eike that in front too 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.430
 all around 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.010
 already the first step to do 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.240
 these components of igp-m 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.640
 is to get a bottle of two-liter soda from the man's mark 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.680
 she is not advertising 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.540
 is that it is actually the only one that during it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.770
 it is best that along the whole length 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.799
 they will present with some brass it is complete 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.640
 So what are we going to do? 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 if we observe here in the base of the bottle 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.520
 there is a natural line probably joÃ£o will be between two layers 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.440
 plastic or something similar 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.160
 What are we going to do 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
 is to make a small bore 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.770
 I'll try to make a loose spring. 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.430
 ae 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.690
 This afternoon I made the body. 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.130
 From there we'll cut the whole length of it by turning around in the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.420
 bottle 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.890
 so that it becomes a kind of funnel 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410
 posteriorly 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.330
 We come to the stage where in the bottle 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.110
 and we cut 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.590
 Only the Pope said that I 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.660
 given that the part where the classic gets darker groups 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.909
 a third step 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.439
 and put 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.909
 equinox funnel exams brazil 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.359
 in two parts 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.359
 longitude and thus increase tian tian tian tian 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.999
 after removing the other side 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.999
 and color also on Tuesday then 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.789
 it's good 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:29.659
 Why not 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.900
 15 a joining line of guaias the body that bottle itself pm if you 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.569
 to look closely may not look there 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.899
 but here there is a line naturally 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:45.569
 which probably indicates the deduction of two plastic layers or two 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.569
 halves of the artist when the bottle was built 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.809
 well then this is the first step I'm going to take a break here 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:55.979
 do the process, we'll be back soon
