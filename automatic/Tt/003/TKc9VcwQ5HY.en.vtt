00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.070
 with this game analysis ww of 13 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.070
 for wii 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.700
 as you already know from videos of years 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.460
 I do not dislike above all the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 wwf games and I had a lot 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.900
 curiosity in trying this new version 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.260
 who sell one more year as the best and the 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.000
 definitive in a first impression as 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.010
 you are watching the game it looks like a copy 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.059
 of last year's edition but with 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.230
 a great incorporation the attitude will be 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.410
 Seeming the same game as the year 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.570
 last but with this new option 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.330
 heir of the future is in men already 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.570
 it will be worth getting the game 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.570
 we'll see 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.040
 and I know that you want 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.510
 news 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.770
 wow 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.770
 test 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.480
 we must remember that we are facing a 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.850
 game for lovers of this sport 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.650
 american and therefore in a way 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.750
 continuist with respect to last year 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.340
 does not offer great news and gives 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.070
 concretely what is expected from a 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.840
 annual title graphically as you see there 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.600
 few changes in the graphic engine of the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.330
 wii game yes it is true that in other 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.770
 platforms if you notice a little the jump 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.900
 graphic with respect to other games of 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.820
 the franchise but here in wii have 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.530
 reused the title graphic engine 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.580
 previous with small improvements that 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.650
 we will notice very slightly 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.000
 as for the game modes the great 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.860
 incentive of this game is the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.750
 incorporation of the wax attitude that we 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.990
 will make us feel in the skin of the best 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.820
 fighters of this universe of the wwf in 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.560
 this option is collected wrestlers 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.390
 characteristic of this universe between 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.460
 the years 1995 to 2001 moving away from the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.470
 something has endowed ruptures in the middle of 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.770
 Previous deliveries in this new option 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.260
 a more rhythmic game is printed more 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.060
 thrilling more exciting than in games 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.550
 previous 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.620
 separate this game mode on its own 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.060
 I offer 20 hours of play and that 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.510
 will love the fans more 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.220
 Nostalgic but the thing is not there already 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.050
 that once this option of 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.430
 game we will have the typical options that 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.810
 we usually offer the games of this 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.510
 franchise so we will have 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.130
 guaranteed many more hours of play in 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.200
 Regarding the gameplay we will not notice 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.540
 many differences with respect to 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.550
 title of last year although possible 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.170
 playing with the traditional command of wii is 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.610
 much more comfortable to use a remote 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.610
 classic or classic but 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 h 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.879
 pons kalex 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.810
 as for the list of wrestlers that 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.450
 we will find in ww 13 it will be a total 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.180
 of 86 fighters of which 51 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.670
 belong to the modern era and 35 to the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.590
 it was attitude although in principle they can 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.150
 seem many fighters gives the 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.849
 impression missing some that 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.890
 they should be can blame the lack 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.439
 of current fighters as they can be 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.470
 of a fifth the faceless black tyson 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.909
 kidd among others this detail in other 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.939
 platforms is easy to solve 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.090
 through a dlc although very much this is not 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.580
 possible 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.769
 In summary this game for Wii is 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.900
 basically the same game that comes to us 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.000
 getting used to selling every year with 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.489
 small changes but that these little ones 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.720
 changes will not justify the purchase to no 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.120
 be that you have not played a game 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.919
 previous be a fan of the franchise or

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:38.039
