00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
all it's a very like it could be really

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.299

happening<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.379> Hell's<00:00:52.500> Kitchen<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.980> think<00:00:53.280> that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
happening in Hell's Kitchen I think that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.130 
happening in Hell's Kitchen I think that
was<00:00:53.430> evident<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.180> scripts<00:00:54.420> yeah<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.840> think

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
was evident in the scripts yeah I think

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
was evident in the scripts yeah I think
the<00:00:55.500> thing<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.890> me<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.190> sold<00:00:56.760> me<00:00:56.820> on

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the thing for me that really sold me on

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
the thing for me that really sold me on
the<00:00:57.000> show<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> sky<00:00:57.750> was<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.260> given<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the show is the sky was I was given the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.869 
the show is the sky was I was given the
opportunity<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.340> read<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> first<00:00:59.760> two

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
opportunity to read the first two

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.060 
opportunity to read the first two
scripts<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.300> drew<00:01:00.780> goddard<00:01:00.930> row<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
scripts that drew goddard row and and I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.260

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
character that is about making it very

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
character that is about making it very
realistic<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.729> also<00:01:23.850> has<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> nostalgia<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
realistic but it also has a nostalgia to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
realistic but it also has a nostalgia to

I<00:01:45.360> jump<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> world<00:01:46.619> where<00:01:47.100> people

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
I jump in this is a world where people

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.730 
I jump in this is a world where people
with<00:01:47.850> exceptional<00:01:48.420> powers<00:01:48.659> or<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:48.990> step<00:01:49.500> in

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
with exceptional powers or not step in

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
with exceptional powers or not step in
and<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.189> something<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:51.000> put<00:01:51.210> they

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and they do something they put they

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
and they do something they put they
participate<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.520> puts<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
participate so I think that puts the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.490 
participate so I think that puts the
onus<00:01:53.880> than<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.329> actual<00:01:54.780> normal<00:01:55.110> regular

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
onus than on actual normal regular

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.289 
onus than on actual normal regular
humans<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.310> exact<00:01:56.579> same<00:01:56.759> thing<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
humans to do that exact same thing and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.639 
humans to do that exact same thing and
and<00:01:57.509> i<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.290> know<00:01:58.320> when<00:01:58.530> those

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and i think you know when those

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.679 
and i think you know when those
opportunities<00:01:59.310> arise<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.969> really<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.479> our

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
