00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
straight through the eye and you have to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
straight through the eye and you have to
break<00:01:12.090> bone<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.509> get<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.470> part<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
let's try getting through the temple on

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.030 
let's try getting through the temple on
the<00:01:18.659> other<00:01:18.810> side

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:35.630 

and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.850 

okay<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:36.700> what<00:01:37.030> we<00:01:37.150> saw<00:01:37.360> is<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.050> PVC<00:01:38.590> bow

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
okay so what we saw is that the PVC bow

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.460 
okay so what we saw is that the PVC bow
doesn't<00:01:39.340> have<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.090> strength<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.900> get<00:01:41.170> through

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
doesn't have the strength to get through

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.620 
doesn't have the strength to get through
the<00:01:41.710> skull<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:42.550> does<00:01:42.880> if<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.120> hit<00:01:43.300> it<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.510> the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
the skull it does if you hit it in the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.360 
the skull it does if you hit it in the
eye<00:01:43.660> it<00:01:43.810> did<00:01:44.229> break<00:01:44.500> through<00:01:44.770> bone<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.280> got

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
eye it did break through bone and got

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.490 
eye it did break through bone and got
into<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.000> brain<00:01:46.270> but<00:01:46.510> for<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.780> most<00:01:46.960> part<00:01:47.110> the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
into the brain but for the most part the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.340 
into the brain but for the most part the
PVC<00:01:48.280> bow<00:01:48.520> won't<00:01:48.880> save<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.630> we'll<00:01:49.900> try<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.170> make
