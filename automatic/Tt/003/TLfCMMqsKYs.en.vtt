00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
look a little bit bubbly and that means

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.940 
look a little bit bubbly and that means
the<00:01:08.580> yeast<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.030> alive<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.620> bread<00:01:10.830> is

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the yeast is alive and your bread is

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.400 
the yeast is alive and your bread is
going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.370> successful<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.300> at<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.170> point

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
going to be successful so at this point

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.810 
going to be successful so at this point
we<00:01:13.590> want<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.800> add<00:01:13.920> our<00:01:13.950> salt<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:14.640> salt

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
we want to add our salt because salt

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.870 
we want to add our salt because salt
retards<00:01:15.690> yeast<00:01:16.170> activation<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.190> we<00:01:17.700> don't

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
retards yeast activation and we don't

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.070 
retards yeast activation and we don't
want<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> put<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.390> till<00:01:18.540> after<00:01:18.870> we're<00:01:19.050> sure

there because that's going to give it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.110 
there because that's going to give it
moisture<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.570> let<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> last<00:01:46.380> longer<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:47.250> many

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
unbleached bread flour that's going to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.170 
unbleached bread flour that's going to
be<00:01:54.660> 5<00:01:54.840> cups<00:01:55.140> total<00:01:55.670> then<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:57.060> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
not to the side of the bowl so we're

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.930 
not to the side of the bowl so we're
going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.330> try<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:07.340> scrape<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.550> bowl<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> little

bit<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:09.570> add<00:02:09.840> flour<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:11.280> keep<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.670> bread

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
bit and then add flour to keep the bread

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.790 
bit and then add flour to keep the bread
from<00:02:12.060> sticking<00:02:12.390> against<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.380> side<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.710> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
from sticking against the side of the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.300 
from sticking against the side of the
bowl<00:02:13.950> again

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
bowl again

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.900 
bowl again
and<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.630> develops<00:02:16.140> gluten<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.190> stretches

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
and as it develops gluten and stretches

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.800 
and as it develops gluten and stretches
the<00:02:18.780> flour<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:20.160> gluten<00:02:20.520> will<00:02:20.760> structure<00:02:21.209> lies

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the flour the gluten will structure lies

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
the flour the gluten will structure lies
the<00:02:22.800> dough<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.610> allow<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.690> hold<00:02:25.290> up<00:02:25.590> when

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the dough and allow it to hold up when

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.680 
the dough and allow it to hold up when
it<00:02:25.950> rises<00:02:26.130> instead<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.819> collapsing<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.569> on

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
it rises instead of collapsing in on

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.900 
it rises instead of collapsing in on
itself<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.470> that's<00:02:28.740> why<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.069> have<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.459> knead<00:02:29.670> it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
itself so that's why we have to knead it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.240 
itself so that's why we have to knead it
you<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.660> knead<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.020> for<00:02:31.080> about<00:02:31.560> 10

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
you want to knead this for about 10

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.070 
you want to knead this for about 10
minutes<00:02:32.580> at<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.870> point<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:34.700> get<00:02:35.700> that

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
minutes at this point to really get that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.960 
minutes at this point to really get that
gluten<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.200> elasticized<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.640> that's<00:02:38.819> what

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
gluten and elasticized and that's what

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.040 
gluten and elasticized and that's what
causes<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.330> dough<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.600> stick<00:02:39.900> together

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
causes the dough to stick together

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.630 
causes the dough to stick together
eventually<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.830> cleans<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.250> side<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
eventually it cleans the side of the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.790 
eventually it cleans the side of the
bowl<00:02:41.760> all<00:02:41.940> by<00:02:42.090> itself<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:43.260> don't<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.680> add

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
bowl all by itself you don't have to add

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.550 
bowl all by itself you don't have to add
much<00:02:44.100> flour<00:02:44.489> or<00:02:44.730> any<00:02:44.760> flour<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.450> all<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.380> we

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
much flour or any flour at all so we

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.710 
much flour or any flour at all so we
take<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:46.890> out<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.220> bowl<00:02:47.400> after<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.420> and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
take it out of the bowl after that and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.560 
take it out of the bowl after that and
we're<00:02:48.810> going<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.260> knead<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.500> by<00:02:49.890> hand

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
we're going to have to knead it by hand

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.070 
we're going to have to knead it by hand
so<00:02:51.570> this<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.200> part<00:02:52.440> that's<00:02:52.620> fun<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.930> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
so this is the part that's fun I like to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.900 
so this is the part that's fun I like to
knead<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.290> another<00:02:55.620> five<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.220> seven<00:02:56.580> minutes

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
knead it another five to seven minutes

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.520 
knead it another five to seven minutes
and<00:02:57.120> develop<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> glutens<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.170> little<00:02:58.380> bit

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
and develop the glutens a little bit

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.170 
and develop the glutens a little bit
more<00:02:58.739> give<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.280> more<00:02:59.430> structure<00:02:59.910> that'll

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
more give it more structure that'll

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.460 
more give it more structure that'll
cause<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.540> bread<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.840> bake<00:03:00.930> higher<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
cause the bread to bake higher and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.070 
cause the bread to bake higher and
fluffier<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.819> recipe<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.269> developed<00:03:03.840> by

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
fluffier this is a recipe I developed by

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.690 
fluffier this is a recipe I developed by
crossing<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.680> Jewish<00:03:05.040> Halle

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
crossing a Jewish Halle

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.970 
crossing a Jewish Halle
with<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> Hawaiian<00:03:06.269> bread<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.590> really

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
with a Hawaiian bread it's really

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.380 
with a Hawaiian bread it's really
wonderful<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.610> love<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.090> one<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.300> my

favorites<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.170> once<00:03:11.130> we<00:03:11.310> knead<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.640> for

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
favorites so once we knead it for

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.580 
favorites so once we knead it for
another<00:03:12.000> 5<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.390> 7<00:03:12.660> minutes<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:13.170> want<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.440> to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
another 5 to 7 minutes you want it to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.670 
another 5 to 7 minutes you want it to
look<00:03:14.130> kind<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.790> blistered<00:03:15.239> yet<00:03:15.780> smooth<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.530> the

bulk then I'm going to punch all the air

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.210 
bulk then I'm going to punch all the air
out<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.390> squeeze<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.560> pop<00:03:28.799> all<00:03:29.040> those

out of it squeeze it and pop all those
bubbles<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.299> fun<00:03:30.600> part<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.650> that's

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
bubbles this is a fun part and that's

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.520 
bubbles this is a fun part and that's
going<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.640> redistribute<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.690> yeast<00:03:34.019> bubbles

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
going to redistribute the yeast bubbles

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.009 
going to redistribute the yeast bubbles
and<00:03:34.799> make<00:03:34.950> them<00:03:35.130> not<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.549> large<00:03:35.940> make<00:03:36.840> your

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
and make them not so large make your

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.400 
and make them not so large make your
bread<00:03:37.200> more<00:03:37.380> finer<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.070> grain<00:03:39.260> instead<00:03:40.260> of

bread more finer of a grain instead of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.080 
bread more finer of a grain instead of
flour<00:03:40.650> on<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.070> table<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.579> can<00:03:41.730> use<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.910> little

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
flour on the table you can use a little

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.620 
flour on the table you can use a little
bit<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.390> oil<00:03:42.660> this<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.829> recipe<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.340> I

with<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.940> Hawaiian<00:03:48.840> bread<00:03:49.380> it's<00:03:50.190> one<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.430> my

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
with a Hawaiian bread it's one of my

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.120 
with a Hawaiian bread it's one of my
favorite<00:03:51.000> recipes<00:03:51.350> look<00:03:52.350> at<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> saffron

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
delicious bread but I like the

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.279 
delicious bread but I like the
presentation<00:05:13.680> of<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.759> braid<00:05:15.060> because<00:05:15.990> it

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
presentation of the braid because it

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.390 
presentation of the braid because it
looks<00:05:16.440> more<00:05:16.590> traditional<00:05:17.190> more<00:05:17.400> rustic<00:05:19.400> we're

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
looks more traditional more rustic we're

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.740 
looks more traditional more rustic we're
gonna<00:05:20.490> stick<00:05:20.819> the<00:05:20.969> ends<00:05:21.210> together<00:05:21.389> with<00:05:21.719> a

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
gonna stick the ends together with a

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.399 
gonna stick the ends together with a
little<00:05:22.020> bit<00:05:22.139> more<00:05:22.469> egg<00:05:23.400> yolk<00:05:23.759> and<00:05:23.909> water

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
little bit more egg yolk and water

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.950 
little bit more egg yolk and water
that'll<00:05:25.409> keep<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.949> nice<00:05:26.909> and<00:05:26.939> smooth<00:05:27.659> in<00:05:27.900> the

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
that'll keep it nice and smooth in the

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.290 
that'll keep it nice and smooth in the
baking<00:05:28.439> and<00:05:28.680> not<00:05:28.860> come<00:05:29.069> apart<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:30.439> then<00:05:31.439> we

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
baking and not come apart and then we

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.839 
baking and not come apart and then we
refine<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.659> other<00:05:33.990> end<00:05:34.259> because<00:05:35.099> while

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
refine the other end because while

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.879 
refine the other end because while
you're<00:05:36.029> working<00:05:36.150> with<00:05:36.389> it<00:05:36.509> always<00:05:36.930> comes

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
you're working with it always comes

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.469 
you're working with it always comes
apart<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.340> little<00:05:38.430> bit<00:05:38.669> so<00:05:38.940> we<00:05:39.060> want<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.300> stick

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
apart a little bit so we want to stick

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.399 
apart a little bit so we want to stick
that<00:05:39.539> really<00:05:40.169> well<00:05:40.379> and<00:05:41.900> then<00:05:42.900> we're<00:05:43.139> going<00:05:43.289> to

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
that really well and then we're going to

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.649 
that really well and then we're going to
make<00:05:43.830> our<00:05:44.009> garnish<00:05:44.400> out<00:05:44.610> of<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:44.789> scraps<00:05:45.089> this

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
make our garnish out of the scraps this

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.740 
make our garnish out of the scraps this
will<00:05:45.839> be<00:05:45.960> a<00:05:45.990> three<00:05:46.379> braid<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:47.419> that's<00:05:48.419> going

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
will be a three braid and that's going

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.240 
will be a three braid and that's going
to<00:05:48.870> be<00:05:49.830> braided<00:05:50.339> and<00:05:50.520> then<00:05:50.639> put<00:05:51.449> on<00:05:51.569> the<00:05:51.719> top

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
to be braided and then put on the top

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.499 
to be braided and then put on the top
after<00:05:53.250> we<00:05:53.370> brushed<00:05:53.669> it<00:05:53.879> with<00:05:53.909> a<00:05:54.029> little<00:05:54.330> bit<00:05:54.479> of

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
after we brushed it with a little bit of

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.709 
after we brushed it with a little bit of
egg<00:05:54.870> yolk<00:05:55.169> and<00:05:55.440> water<00:05:56.190> to<00:05:56.789> make<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.150> stick<00:05:57.389> so

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
egg yolk and water to make it stick so

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:02.709 
egg yolk and water to make it stick so
it<00:05:57.839> doesn't<00:05:58.139> fall<00:05:58.349> off<00:05:59.389> so<00:06:00.389> the<00:06:00.539> same<00:06:00.949> process

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
it doesn't fall off so the same process

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:05.899 
it doesn't fall off so the same process
applies<00:06:03.719> for<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.110> to<00:06:04.349> put<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:05.069> bread<00:06:05.580> on<00:06:05.879> a

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909
