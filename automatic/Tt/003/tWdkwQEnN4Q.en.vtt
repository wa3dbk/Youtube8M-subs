00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.340 

so<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.760> got<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.330> experience<00:02:56.690> for<00:02:57.050> that<00:02:57.140> wolf

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
so I got the experience for that wolf

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.930 
so I got the experience for that wolf
that's<00:02:57.620> why<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:57.800> coiled<00:02:58.250> up<00:02:58.370> before<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.820> got

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
that's why I coiled up before it got

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.800 
that's why I coiled up before it got
away<00:02:59.060> or<00:02:59.450> before<00:03:00.020> that<00:03:01.360> finish<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:02.690> he's

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
away or before that finish so he's

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.750 
away or before that finish so he's
running<00:03:03.050> around<00:03:03.110> with<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.440> forest<00:03:03.860> here<00:03:04.070> there

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.460 

now<00:03:07.760> I've<00:03:07.910> got<00:03:08.090> time<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.690> actually<00:03:08.810> kill<00:03:09.230> as

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
now I've got time to actually kill as

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.000 
now I've got time to actually kill as
nulls<00:03:09.740> before<00:03:10.190> he<00:03:10.280> gets<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.820> my<00:03:11.860> men<00:03:12.860> a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
nulls before he gets to my men a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.840 
nulls before he gets to my men a
thinking<00:03:13.580> starts<00:03:14.030> killing<00:03:15.430> or<00:03:16.430> maybe<00:03:16.610> only

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
thinking starts killing or maybe only

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.670 
thinking starts killing or maybe only
just<00:03:17.240> maybe<00:03:17.630> I've<00:03:17.750> only<00:03:17.960> got<00:03:18.170> time<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.530> kill

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
just maybe I've only got time to kill

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.920 
just maybe I've only got time to kill
that<00:03:18.830> in<00:03:18.950> orbit<00:03:19.310> yeah<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.180> think<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:20.720> I'm

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
that in orbit yeah I think of this I'm

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.800 
that in orbit yeah I think of this I'm
gonna<00:03:21.020> head<00:03:21.230> back<00:03:21.260> now<00:03:22.270> he's<00:03:23.270> obviously<00:03:23.510> going

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
gonna head back now he's obviously going

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.230 
gonna head back now he's obviously going
to<00:03:23.900> use<00:03:24.140> walls<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:26.470> harass<00:03:27.610> i'm<00:03:28.610> going<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.030> try

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
to use walls to harass i'm going to try

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:40.900 
to use walls to harass i'm going to try
and<00:03:29.360> get<00:03:29.570> experience<00:03:29.960> from<00:03:30.320> these<00:03:30.470> rules

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.300 

coil<00:03:41.910> heal<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:44.780> I'm<00:03:45.780> get<00:03:46.140> an<00:03:46.380> experience<00:03:47.069> from

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
coil heal the I'm get an experience from

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.880 
coil heal the I'm get an experience from
that<00:03:50.870> trying<00:03:51.870> not<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.380> let<00:03:52.500> them<00:03:52.650> get<00:03:52.770> in

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
that trying not to let them get in

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:05.120 
that trying not to let them get in
amongst<00:03:53.220> those<00:03:53.580> skills<00:03:53.970> easily

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.700 

so<00:04:05.730> I've<00:04:05.790> actually<00:04:05.940> got<00:04:06.240> halfway<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.260> label<00:04:07.560> to

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
so I've actually got halfway to label to

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.650 
so I've actually got halfway to label to
just<00:04:08.130> from<00:04:08.280> those<00:04:08.400> rules<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:11.510> they<00:04:12.510> actually

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
just from those rules and they actually

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.990 
just from those rules and they actually
snuck<00:04:13.230> in<00:04:13.470> there<00:04:13.650> which<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:13.890> quite<00:04:14.220> annoying

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.860 

so<00:04:18.000> it's<00:04:18.360> not<00:04:18.420> gonna<00:04:18.570> kill<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:18.959> quite<00:04:19.230> now<00:04:19.380> I

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
so it's not gonna kill in a quite now I

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:33.050 
so it's not gonna kill in a quite now I
don't<00:04:21.870> think

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.400 

ok<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.120> we<00:04:34.270> killed<00:04:34.510> one<00:04:39.900> I'm<00:04:40.900> going<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.140> cancel

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
ok so we killed one I'm going to cancel

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.060 
ok so we killed one I'm going to cancel
that<00:04:42.990> accolade<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.650> can<00:04:46.710> bowl<00:04:47.710> my<00:04:47.860> heel

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
that accolade so that I can bowl my heel

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.100 
that accolade so that I can bowl my heel
because<00:04:48.310> I'm<00:04:48.520> exactly<00:04:48.790> 40<00:04:49.360> 30<00:04:49.600> so<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:49.930> would

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
because I'm exactly 40 30 so that would

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.870 
because I'm exactly 40 30 so that would
force<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:50.740> could<00:04:50.890> I<00:04:51.100> thirds<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.550> grow<00:04:51.700> its<00:04:51.850> just

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
force I could I thirds I grow its just

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.650 
force I could I thirds I grow its just
funny<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:52.270> I<00:04:52.390> can<00:04:52.570> build<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:52.990> fourth<00:04:53.890> acolyte

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
funny so I can build that fourth acolyte

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.490 
funny so I can build that fourth acolyte
at<00:04:55.660> this<00:04:55.870> point<00:04:56.170> I'm<00:04:56.380> safe<00:04:56.680> because<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:02.230> holes

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
at this point I'm safe because the holes

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.130 
at this point I'm safe because the holes
of<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.680> Dead<00:05:02.890> is<00:05:02.920> protecting<00:05:03.640> my<00:05:03.960> appealing

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.980 

I'm<00:05:08.140> not<00:05:08.290> sure<00:05:08.350> I<00:05:08.560> actually<00:05:08.770> really<00:05:09.160> starting

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
I'm not sure I actually really starting

they're<00:06:04.199> going<00:06:04.319> to<00:06:04.409> get<00:06:04.500> a<00:06:04.560> graveyard<00:06:09.740> so<00:06:10.740> I'm

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
they're going to get a graveyard so I'm

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.920 
they're going to get a graveyard so I'm
kind<00:06:11.039> of<00:06:11.129> creeping<00:06:11.969> pretty<00:06:12.240> hard<00:06:12.479> here

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.020 

and<00:06:17.919> then<00:06:18.039> I'm<00:06:18.100> going<00:06:18.280> to<00:06:18.340> get<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.610> second

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
and then I'm going to get the second

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:28.320 
and then I'm going to get the second
safe<00:06:19.180> place<00:06:26.190> that<00:06:27.190> sleep<00:06:27.520> actually<00:06:27.940> worked<00:06:28.180> a

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
safe place that sleep actually worked a

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.689 
safe place that sleep actually worked a
lot<00:06:28.479> wasn't<00:06:28.930> that<00:06:29.560> wise<00:06:29.800> because<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.430> priests

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
lot wasn't that wise because the priests

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.020 
lot wasn't that wise because the priests
usually<00:06:31.180> the<00:06:31.300> spells<00:06:31.600> of<00:06:32.580> some<00:06:33.580> things<00:06:33.759> work

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
usually the spells of some things work

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:57.010 
usually the spells of some things work
so<00:06:34.350> and<00:06:35.350> it<00:06:35.470> has<00:06:35.650> in<00:06:35.830> this<00:06:35.979> case

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.750 

now<00:06:58.020> I'm<00:06:58.820> cannibalizing<00:07:00.680> manually<00:07:01.680> so<00:07:02.610> the

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
now I'm cannibalizing manually so the

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.060 
now I'm cannibalizing manually so the
right<00:07:02.910> ones<00:07:03.120> get<00:07:03.930> cannibalize<00:07:06.560> and<00:07:07.560> then<00:07:07.860> when

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 
right ones get cannibalize and then when

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.740 
right ones get cannibalize and then when
Adam<00:07:08.400> back<00:07:08.550> to<00:07:08.670> the<00:07:08.760> grip<00:07:08.940> now<00:07:09.120> I'm<00:07:09.480> going<00:07:09.690> to

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.750 
Adam back to the grip now I'm going to

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.990 
Adam back to the grip now I'm going to
always<00:07:10.140> actually<00:07:10.710> clip<00:07:10.920> those<00:07:11.100> already<00:07:11.310> got<00:07:11.790> a
