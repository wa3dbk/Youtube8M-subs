00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
half hitches I use polythene here there

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.509 
half hitches I use polythene here there
is<00:02:15.950> proper<00:02:16.250> tape<00:02:16.760> that's<00:02:17.120> available<00:02:18.400> if<00:02:19.400> you

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
is proper tape that's available if you

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:20.020 
is proper tape that's available if you
can<00:02:19.640> get<00:02:19.760> it

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
can get it

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.640 
can get it
okay<00:02:20.480> I'll<00:02:20.569> tie<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:20.840> half<00:02:21.200> hitch<00:02:21.379> and<00:02:21.530> I'll

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
okay I'll tie one half hitch and I'll

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.420 
okay I'll tie one half hitch and I'll
probably<00:02:21.799> tie<00:02:22.099> another<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:23.920> now<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:24.950> tend<00:02:25.250> to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
probably tie another one now I tend to

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
ordinary half inch and remove this

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.740 
ordinary half inch and remove this
carefully<00:02:31.310> your<00:02:31.819> close-up<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.390> see<00:02:32.629> what

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
carefully your close-up you see what

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.270 
carefully your close-up you see what
I've<00:02:32.840> done<00:02:32.870> there<00:02:35.110> right<00:02:36.110> now<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.129> going<00:02:37.220> to

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280

show you the whole operation again right
now<00:02:43.879> you<00:02:44.060> run<00:02:44.150> practice<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.739> wood<00:02:46.489> that

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
now you run practice this on wood that

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.430 
now you run practice this on wood that
you're<00:02:46.790> not<00:02:46.940> going<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.239> use<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:48.079> what<00:02:48.200> you're

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
you're not going to use and what you're

you're not going to use and what you're
not<00:02:48.530> actually<00:02:48.799> going<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:48.980> graph<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.459> it

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
not actually going to graph to it

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.150 
not actually going to graph to it
practice<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.359> lot<00:02:51.019> of<00:02:51.109> times<00:02:51.379> until<00:02:51.920> you've<00:02:52.040> got

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
practice a lot of times until you've got

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.479 
practice a lot of times until you've got
it<00:02:52.190> right<00:02:52.519> it's<00:02:53.329> not<00:02:53.629> that<00:02:53.989> difficult<00:02:54.489> but

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
it right it's not that difficult but

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.449 
it right it's not that difficult but
like<00:02:55.849> all<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.299> these<00:02:56.420> things<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:57.739> joints<00:02:58.190> must

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
like all of these things the joints must

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.400 
like all of these things the joints must
be<00:02:58.639> exactly<00:02:59.060> correct<00:03:01.480> I've<00:03:02.480> done<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.810> maybe

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
be exactly correct I've done that maybe

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.460 
be exactly correct I've done that maybe
that's<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.859> slightly<00:03:04.280> oversize<00:03:05.260> Minister<00:03:06.260> this

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
that's a slightly oversize Minister this

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.949 
that's a slightly oversize Minister this
bit<00:03:06.680> here<00:03:06.799> is<00:03:06.859> slightly<00:03:07.630> oversize<00:03:08.630> now<00:03:08.810> that

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
bit here is slightly oversize now that

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.199 
bit here is slightly oversize now that
the<00:03:09.230> ligh<00:03:09.530> border<00:03:09.799> is<00:03:09.919> in<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.220> Lillian<00:03:10.940> link

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
the ligh border is in the Lillian link

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.539 
the ligh border is in the Lillian link
isn't<00:03:11.419> isn't<00:03:11.930> going<00:03:12.139> to<00:03:12.250> grow<00:03:13.250> into<00:03:13.519> that

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
isn't isn't going to grow into that

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.759 
isn't isn't going to grow into that
graphs<00:03:13.880> I'm<00:03:14.030> just<00:03:14.209> slicing<00:03:14.389> about<00:03:14.720> 100<00:03:15.049> Eve<00:03:15.200> so

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
graphs I'm just slicing about 100 Eve so

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.610 
graphs I'm just slicing about 100 Eve so
I<00:03:15.859> mean<00:03:16.480> okay<00:03:17.650> so<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.859> is<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.290> the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
I mean okay so that is the that is the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.640 
I mean okay so that is the that is the
chip<00:03:21.919> bud<00:03:22.540> it's<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.690> quickest<00:03:24.139> method<00:03:24.319> it's

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
chip bud it's the quickest method it's

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.860 
chip bud it's the quickest method it's
what<00:03:24.769> they<00:03:24.859> do<00:03:24.919> commercially<00:03:25.849> and<00:03:26.540> obviously

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
what they do commercially and obviously

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.069 
what they do commercially and obviously
what<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.169> do<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:29.000> tie<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.269> in<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.870> should

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
what you do you tie that in it should

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.849 
what you do you tie that in it should
grow<00:03:30.169> away<00:03:30.410> nicely<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:32.720> next<00:03:32.900> yeah<00:03:33.500> what

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
grow away nicely and so next yeah what

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.039 
grow away nicely and so next yeah what
you'll<00:03:34.069> do<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.430> remove<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.910> springtime<00:03:35.329> remove

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
you'll do is remove in springtime remove

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.550 
you'll do is remove in springtime remove
the<00:03:37.660> what<00:03:38.660> you're<00:03:38.780> doing<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.079> spring<00:03:39.290> is

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
the what you're doing the spring is

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.589 
the what you're doing the spring is
remove<00:03:39.919> the<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.819> might<00:03:40.940> remove<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.329> in<00:03:41.389> late

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
remove the you might remove it in late

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.819 
remove the you might remove it in late
autumn<00:03:41.750> are<00:03:42.049> removing<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.470> spring<00:03:42.709> usually

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
autumn are removing the spring usually

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.809 
autumn are removing the spring usually
remove<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:44.260> at<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.380> tape<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.859> then<00:03:46.220> cut<00:03:46.549> there

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
remove it at the tape and then cut there

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.990 
remove it at the tape and then cut there
and<00:03:47.500> then<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:48.680> will<00:03:48.919> grow<00:03:49.099> away<00:03:49.340> strongly

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
and then this will grow away strongly

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.119 
and then this will grow away strongly
from<00:03:50.269> there<00:03:50.569> that<00:03:51.049> if<00:03:51.169> it's<00:03:51.349> taken<00:03:51.739> okay

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
from there that if it's taken okay

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.440 
from there that if it's taken okay
that's<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.959> chip<00:03:54.200> bud
