00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.149
 good in the hope that they have 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.640
 seen what is the first of the four 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:14.040
 videos I made about galaxy s2 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.920
 I bring you a little review of what 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.120
 it's beta 2 and it's a gift was 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.180
 climbing 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.180
 and I think it 's him 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.369
 starting then 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.770
 the final version has many failures by 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.740
 Ahem 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.050
 it can be neither receive nor send the 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.590
 message can not use the 3g connection or 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.880
 be the data transfer 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.020
 you can not go see video 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.940
 it's more than anything 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 speed because it really is not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.300
 completely adapted to what 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.730
 we crossed in esados but 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.390
 we wait with time for 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.390
 developers finish 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.440
 starting with the fold 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.250
 of the blockade 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:15.610
 Well what we have seen in the two 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.030
 points to unlock it this scale 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.330
 in the editor 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.630
 the shortcuts quite 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.159
 playful is a pretty interface 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.810
 Well, how nice? 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.260
 in the last button to take us to 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.260
 home 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.190
 one of them 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.580
 five main screens that are 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.580
 Applications 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.220
 this with people music 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.560
 and good a little something interesting bar 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.340
 what I was seeing is that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.260
 your touch was handled headquarters 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.060
 gestures 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.369
 does not recognize what the crazy button is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.790
 and the back buttons here of 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.430
 neither the volume options 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.800
 everything we are going to do is based on 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.840
 gestures 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.020
 for example here if I want to access 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.670
 what is the sound of sound and 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.090
 or in this case profession image of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.090
 message 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.290
 Well, you can move sound networks 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.239
 drums 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.239
 already wanting is how they are going to see 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.020
 and I have what networks are configured me 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.020
 my case hurts 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.880
 entering let's say in an application like 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.640
 what is this 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.380
 in the gallery 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.300
 how good with these images as they 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.390
 I comment they are not mine they have preinstalled 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.000
 well now we will pass something as I say 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.320
 this is based on gestures let's say this 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.320
 menu up here is not going 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.860
 you raise them doing this gesture and then 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.700
 passed application 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.700
 with this 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.170
 I must say that the camera nothing without 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.170
 take into account 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.410
 recorded video is pretty good no 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.500
 record in the quality of 8 megapixels that 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.290
 has the s2 but they all work if the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.270
 camera takes pictures both the camera 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.150
 front as the back 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.170
 and functional phrase as he commented them then 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.530
 we are going between 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.130
 applications with pure gestures the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.240
 we close in the same way 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.240
 to make an application 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.430
 we talk this way and socially and 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.080
 having applications running that 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.080
 they come to show 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.800
 in the most frequently used a 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.770
 adding only that style using 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.860
 something a detail is that they do not work 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.170
 these installs are applications that still 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.630
 they do not end up being adapted to a 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.260
 function very well 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.260
 but
