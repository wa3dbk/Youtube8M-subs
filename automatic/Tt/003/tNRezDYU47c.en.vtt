things which a lot of the stuff that I

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.700 
things which a lot of the stuff that I
do<00:06:22.910> in<00:06:23.120> the<00:06:23.210> B<00:06:23.390> part<00:06:23.660> is<00:06:26.050> stuff<00:06:27.050> that<00:06:27.080> I<00:06:27.320> threw

do in the B part is stuff that I threw

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.630 
do in the B part is stuff that I threw
together<00:06:28.480> to<00:06:29.560> try<00:06:30.560> to<00:06:30.590> make<00:06:30.800> it<00:06:31.010> all<00:06:31.190> fit

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
together to try to make it all fit

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.850 
together to try to make it all fit
together<00:06:31.820> because<00:06:32.390> i<00:06:32.510> couldn't<00:06:32.810> i<00:06:33.170> never<00:06:33.650> did

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
together because i couldn't i never did

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.210 
together because i couldn't i never did
learning<00:06:34.190> the<00:06:34.280> stuff<00:06:34.520> that<00:06:34.700> he<00:06:34.850> played<00:06:36.220> but

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
learning the stuff that he played but

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.410 
learning the stuff that he played but
the<00:06:37.610> f<00:06:37.820> part<00:06:38.240> for<00:06:38.600> me<00:06:38.750> is<00:06:39.020> always<00:06:39.380> the<00:06:39.590> hardest

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
the f part for me is always the hardest

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.600 
the f part for me is always the hardest
because<00:06:41.440> i've<00:06:42.440> just<00:06:42.710> never<00:06:42.950> really<00:06:43.310> learned<00:06:43.550> a

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
because i've just never really learned a

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:54.650 
because i've just never really learned a
lot<00:06:43.730> of<00:06:43.880> efflux

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.110 

and<00:06:55.080> the<00:06:55.170> second<00:06:55.590> one<00:06:55.740> comes<00:06:56.010> up<00:06:56.220> which<00:06:56.760> I<00:06:56.910> know

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
and the second one comes up which I know

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:14.480 
and the second one comes up which I know
if<00:06:57.180> you're<00:06:57.300> familiar<00:07:02.600> down<00:07:03.600> to<00:07:03.810> fresh

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.310 

and

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.560 

so<00:07:20.320> uh<00:07:20.490> that's<00:07:21.490> always<00:07:22.060> giving<00:07:22.210> me<00:07:22.450> a<00:07:22.480> hard

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.570 
so uh that's always giving me a hard

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.370 
so uh that's always giving me a hard
time<00:07:22.810> those<00:07:23.740> f<00:07:23.980> chords<00:07:24.870> being<00:07:25.870> a<00:07:25.960> bluegrass
