almost

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.700 

yes<00:01:36.410> okay<00:01:37.410> this<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.520> how<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.730> catapult<00:01:39.270> works

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
yes okay this is how the catapult works

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.890 
yes okay this is how the catapult works
the<00:01:40.710> resistance<00:01:41.040> force<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.450> rubber<00:01:42.630> band

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
the resistance force is the rubber band

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
pulling down on this back peg the effort

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.590 
pulling down on this back peg the effort
force<00:01:45.900> is<00:01:46.170> us<00:01:46.410> pulling<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.950> down<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:48.210> load<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
force is us pulling it down to load the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
force is us pulling it down to load the
BB<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.590> shoot<00:01:50.600> as<00:01:52.220> we<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.370> see<00:01:53.640> here
