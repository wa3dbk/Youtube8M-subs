higher<00:00:41.960> Shimano<00:00:42.960> did<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> feels

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
higher Shimano did that so that it feels

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.299 
higher Shimano did that so that it feels
more<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.360> natural<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.989> comfortable<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.250> the
