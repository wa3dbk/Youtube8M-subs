00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
you're there trying to solve the crime

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.070 
you're there trying to solve the crime
with<00:05:16.370> him<00:05:16.640> and<00:05:16.820> speaking<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.510> movies<00:05:17.810> just

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
with him and speaking of the movies just

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.770 
with him and speaking of the movies just
it<00:05:18.320> relating<00:05:18.770> to<00:05:18.860> them<00:05:19.090> DC<00:05:20.090> is<00:05:20.240> real<00:05:20.480> good<00:05:20.660> with

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
it relating to them DC is real good with

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.570 
it relating to them DC is real good with
their<00:05:20.960> animation<00:05:21.590> I<00:05:21.740> think<00:05:22.100> this<00:05:22.310> would<00:05:22.490> be

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
their animation I think this would be

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.150 
their animation I think this would be
the<00:05:22.730> perfect<00:05:23.210> formula<00:05:23.960> for<00:05:24.260> one<00:05:24.920> of<00:05:25.040> their

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
the perfect formula for one of their

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.310 
the perfect formula for one of their
animated<00:05:25.550> films<00:05:26.060> I<00:05:26.270> mean<00:05:26.450> live<00:05:26.840> actually<00:05:27.230> be

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
animated films I mean live actually be

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.010 
animated films I mean live actually be
also<00:05:27.470> too<00:05:27.800> but<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.160> think<00:05:28.850> an<00:05:29.090> animated<00:05:29.990> film

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
also too but I think an animated film

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.860 
also too but I think an animated film
the<00:05:30.380> long<00:05:30.560> halloween<00:05:30.980> would<00:05:31.460> fit<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:32.510> just

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
the long halloween would fit and just

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.680 
the long halloween would fit and just
awesome<00:05:33.530> into<00:05:33.740> their<00:05:33.890> catalog<00:05:34.370> it<00:05:34.730> it<00:05:35.150> is<00:05:35.660> a

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
awesome into their catalog it it is a

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.320 
awesome into their catalog it it is a
good<00:05:35.960> halloween<00:05:36.560> book<00:05:36.890> i<00:05:37.130> really<00:05:37.580> like<00:05:37.820> that<00:05:37.850> I

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330
