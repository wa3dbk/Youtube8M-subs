00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.380
 what I like about pathology is 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 that it is also often just a step deeper 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.799
 that's going to be something that I personally whole 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 interesting that you next to the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:18.810
 patient and the clinical problem too 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:20.670
 look at how such an important issue arises 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.710
 disappear then they do it on receive 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.970
 of the large preparations, in particular of the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.400
 surgical too 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.199
 212 indent 115 which is very important 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.570
 is because I am not writing clearly now 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.369
 why this interest has been removed then 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 I cut it to slices and he takes it 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.270
 very specific a simple so a slice 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.070
 of tissue which are prepared for 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.989
 to be cut then first 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.820
 so you get embedded in polyphine 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.620
 a block with candle wax where that piece 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.390
 fabric is in every sample 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.640
 i've been taken and coope cut 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.930
 like the horse and very thin slice and that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.090
 We go under the microscope 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.559
 because then you can see what the makers 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.239
 copy of your team lite is one 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.239
 cannot make a team microscopically either 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.010
 then koh kood turtle and direction bottom 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.089
 I ended up here in the groups 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.680
 4 me just very well 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.809
 I also really had the idea that I was going to 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.400
 myself here also to develop the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.860
 possibility to do your own research 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.600
 to be pretty and ruined and I think 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.100
 also the training here is super 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.590
 accessible you can easily get there 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.030
 walk in if I have questions 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.899
 we can make an appointment tomorrow 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.700
 to make 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.670
 charging pad belgium fridge very nice 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.530
 and if you notice that I have other knife that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.590
 enthusiasm and so on 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.810
 Learning therefore is quite like what 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.340
 Logically very dynamic broad subject 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.950
 in the middle of the clinic it is one 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.020
 hospital with a very wide range with 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.670
 a cutter equipped laboratory 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.340
 develops at lightning speed 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.110
 we now see the integration of DNA knowledge 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.030
 more part what we do is clinical 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.679
 pathology has a direct effect on the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.390
 treatment of patients and that makes 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.280
 it's great how you and what I often hear 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.750
 about the pathologist that only with being 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.399
 deceased to the people 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.530
 steam pressure cissÃ© 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.390
 yes we learn here the imprint cissÃ© and yes 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.069
 we also execute it here but like me 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.509
 look at how much mine actually 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.220
 make it work is very small 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.439
 most part I am with anyway 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.880
 Clinically engaged and with people who are in 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.390
 life are needed in treatment 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.920
 to have 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.110
 yes i like that you do the whole 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.539
 body looks is the width of the box 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.549
 you mainly do those parts of the diagnostics 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.530
 so you learn a lot about it 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.269
 human body over all diagnostics 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.590
 that the possible is already a disease out there 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.109
 to be possible 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.250
 and you work on your own part and then with 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.540
 the nod together 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.540
 that is special in itself
