00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
this vision into reality and it's

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.000 
this vision into reality and it's
wonderful<00:00:15.389> really<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:16.170> see<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.680> that's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010

in<00:00:18.840> front<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.380> which<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.740> think<00:00:20.070> they<00:00:20.640> call

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
in front of you which I think they call

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the the third eye you know where you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.759 
the the third eye you know where you
visualize<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.619> reality

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
visualize what you want to be in reality

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.710 
visualize what you want to be in reality
and<00:00:26.279> then<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.670> closer<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> closer<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and then you get closer and closer to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.080 
and then you get closer and closer to
that<00:00:27.750> there's<00:00:28.230> an<00:00:28.710> unknown<00:00:28.949> thing<00:00:29.460> non-sports

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
that there's an unknown thing non-sports

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.350

the<00:00:30.269> Ennis<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.900> they<00:00:31.109> call<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:32.360> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the Ennis what they call it when I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.510 
the Ennis what they call it when I
trained<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:34.890> depends<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.370> what

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
trained it it really depends on what

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
trained it it really depends on what
body<00:00:35.790> part<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.210> training<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:36.870> does<00:00:36.989> think

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
body part of training or what does think

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.200 
body part of training or what does think
about<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.489> always<00:00:38.730> has<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.180> be

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
about but it is it always has to be

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.299 
about but it is it always has to be
something<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.809> has<00:00:39.960> involved<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:41.010> some<00:00:41.280> form

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
something that has involved in some form

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
something that has involved in some form
of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> other<00:00:41.940> itself<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.540> noses<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.050> know

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
of the other itself with noses you know

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.959 
of the other itself with noses you know
I'm<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.739> psyched<00:00:43.980> myself<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.879> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
I'm really psyched myself up for it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
I'm really psyched myself up for it
because<00:00:45.390> otherwise<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.079> impossible<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
because otherwise it's impossible to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.889 
because otherwise it's impossible to
squat<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.489> four<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:47.789> five<00:00:47.820> hundred<00:00:48.300> pounds<00:00:48.750> I

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
squat with four or five hundred pounds I

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.779 
squat with four or five hundred pounds I
mean<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.590> hard<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
mean it's really hard to do that and it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
mean it's really hard to do that and it
can<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:51.300> boring<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.100> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
can be boring and so what you do is you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
can be boring and so what you do is you
create<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.550> certain<00:00:53.969> excitement<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:54.780> what

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
create a certain excitement that's what

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.389 
create a certain excitement that's what
you<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.320> about<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:55.890> about<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> next

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
you think about you think about the next

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
you think about you think about the next
said<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.090> about<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.390> particular<00:00:57.719> muscle

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that you're training you try to isolate

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
that you're training you try to isolate
the<00:01:00.989> muscle<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> try<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.590> pump<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> let

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the muscle you try to pump it up you let

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
the muscle you try to pump it up you let
blood<00:01:02.789> go<00:01:03.059> into<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.449> area<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.899> stuff<00:01:04.199> like
