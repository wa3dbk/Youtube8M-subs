00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.950 
there I don't think out that before and
I'm<00:00:35.719> yeah<00:00:36.719> there's<00:00:37.050> some<00:00:37.260> bits<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.890> time

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
I'm yeah there's some bits in this time

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
I'm yeah there's some bits in this time
exactly<00:00:39.960> perfect<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.219> gonna<00:00:41.340> cut<00:00:41.610> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
exactly perfect I'm just gonna cut in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.209 
exactly perfect I'm just gonna cut in
and<00:00:41.879> out<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> gradually<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:44.010> on

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and out of it as I gradually going go on

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.670 
and out of it as I gradually going go on
and<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.110> might<00:00:46.170> take<00:00:46.620> some

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and because I think this might take some

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.000 
and because I think this might take some
time<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:48.140> yeah<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.350> gonna<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.649> quite<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> lot

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
time and yeah it's gonna be quite a lot

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760 
time and yeah it's gonna be quite a lot
of<00:00:50.100> time<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.579> get<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.180> done<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.289> think

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
of time to get all this done but I think

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.880 
of time to get all this done but I think
I'll<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.949> worth<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> end<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> without

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
I'll be worth it in the end so without

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.439 
I'll be worth it in the end so without
further<00:00:55.949> ado<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.030> go<00:00:57.149> ahead<00:00:57.270> and

properly<00:02:16.770> done<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.569> want<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.750> back<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.569> when

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
properly done I want it back and so when

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.240 
properly done I want it back and so when
i'm<00:02:21.810> done<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.200> i<00:02:22.470> think<00:02:22.739> i'm<00:02:22.890> going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.069> do<00:02:23.220> is

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
i'm done this i think i'm going to do is

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.440 
i'm done this i think i'm going to do is
do<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.300> really<00:02:25.080> far<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:26.430> little<00:02:26.880> islands

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
do like a I really far as little islands

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.270 
do like a I really far as little islands
out<00:02:27.540> there<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.680> think<00:02:28.739> I'll<00:02:29.010> do<00:02:29.130> this

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
out there so I think I'll do this

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.800 
out there so I think I'll do this
connecting<00:02:30.440> out<00:02:31.440> there<00:02:32.330> I'm<00:02:33.330> thinking<00:02:33.630> about

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
connecting out there I'm thinking about

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.460 
connecting out there I'm thinking about
them<00:02:34.019> like<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.260> skywalk<00:02:34.920> crops<00:02:35.489> there<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.470> that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
them like a skywalk crops there and that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.100 
them like a skywalk crops there and that
was<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.709> my<00:02:37.830> ideas<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.370> had<00:02:38.600> have<00:02:39.600> asphalt

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
was one of my ideas I had have asphalt

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.190 
was one of my ideas I had have asphalt
in<00:02:40.620> for<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.830> next<00:02:41.010> episode<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:42.030> i<00:02:42.900> think<00:02:43.080> i'll

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
in for the next episode and i think i'll

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.229 
in for the next episode and i think i'll
make<00:02:43.230> another<00:02:43.470> ah<00:02:44.180> fuck<00:02:46.489> hey<00:02:47.489> i<00:02:47.519> think<00:02:47.910> i'll

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
make another ah fuck hey i think i'll

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.440 
make another ah fuck hey i think i'll
make<00:02:48.450> another<00:02:49.220> layer<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.790> place<00:02:51.150> and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
make another layer to this place and

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.820 
make another layer to this place and
i'll<00:02:51.690> do<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.900> same<00:02:52.019> thing<00:02:52.440> i<00:02:52.530> did<00:02:52.560> up<00:02:52.800> there

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
i'll do the same thing i did up there

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.030 
i'll do the same thing i did up there
but<00:02:53.760> follada<00:02:54.350> think<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.470> would<00:02:55.620> look<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.950> it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
but follada think that would look for it

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.259 
but follada think that would look for it
will<00:02:56.280> be<00:02:56.400> more<00:02:56.580> risky<00:02:57.000> as<00:02:57.090> well<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> yeah

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
will be more risky as well and so yeah

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.350 
will be more risky as well and so yeah
um<00:03:02.330> I'm<00:03:04.160> gonna<00:03:05.160> start<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.790> I've<00:03:05.970> not<00:03:06.180> got<00:03:06.329> ah

average stuff so let's fill in this
final<00:04:22.049> day<00:04:22.199> cubed<00:04:22.680> squash<00:04:23.610> into<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:24.060> blog

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
final day cubed squash into this blog

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:34.100 
final day cubed squash into this blog
there<00:04:27.530> they'll<00:04:28.530> probably<00:04:28.560> quite<00:04:29.130> uneven<00:04:33.110> yeah

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
there they'll probably quite uneven yeah

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:43.029 
there they'll probably quite uneven yeah
and<00:04:38.240> I'll<00:04:39.240> shit<00:04:39.570> where's<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.110> squiggle<00:04:41.210> no

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
and I'll shit where's the squiggle no

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.040 
and I'll shit where's the squiggle no
let's<00:04:44.039> count<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.490> box<00:04:44.759> and<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.810> don't<00:04:45.990> know<00:04:46.169> I

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
let's count the box and I don't know I

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.150 
let's count the box and I don't know I
think<00:04:49.050> that's<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.320> middle<00:04:49.560> block<00:04:49.770> there<00:04:52.160> is

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
think that's the middle block there is

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:01.670 
think that's the middle block there is
it<00:04:56.030> faster<00:04:57.030> there<00:04:57.470> let's<00:04:58.470> go<00:04:58.650> for<00:04:58.889> it<00:05:00.680> don't

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
it faster there let's go for it don't

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.900 
it faster there let's go for it don't
know<00:05:01.740> why<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:01.889> didn't<00:05:02.160> do<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.430> for<00:05:02.639> all<00:05:02.759> of
