00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.120
 and playing with a lot of surf and good 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.890
 first of all I wanted to remember that 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.690
 you have my twitter in the description by 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.240
 if you want to play with me there is only 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
 tell when I play and invite everyone 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.509
 those who are connected then 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.500
 Follow me to not miss any video 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.450
 when I'm playing with you 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.910
 and one that a lot of people are 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.820
 We are going to see if this one went away 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.710
 with me we are going to trust in Lyon like this 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.710
 this is open not for all 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.250
 do that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.570
 I'm going to put all of them so that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.430
 mount all those who want will see 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.000
 if you ride this 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.200
 it does not let him ride 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.010
 two 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.010
 turn 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.820
 it does not leave flower that weird does not 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.730
 to support your perfect car is worth 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.110
 all right 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.270
 to the store putting a little bit this last 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.510
 list then I'm going to put on a little 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.010
 well hipster and let's see if they 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.260
 it also gets and we can be the 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 logistas of the city vale pim pam by 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.400
 here hello 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.130
 and there we were perfect I have not put 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.539
 the mic the other times he was playing 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.250
 with them and they always put me the micro 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.710
 it happens that today I have no battery 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 just when I was going to start and the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.360
 really does not give me realize that there 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.789
 had a battery so let's see if more 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.460
 or less intuit what we are going to 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.590
 do why 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.270
 the other time it was easier because more or 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.049
 least I was talking to them 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.469
 the here of glasses are you this this is 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.159
 too 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.969
 this bracelet last time 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.969
 this cool 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.450
 we have to do 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.649
 let's put the teaching that we see 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.950
 I think this is quite not if this 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.250
 it's pretty good it also gets in 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.250
 gestha 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.560
 it's too much like that they are having fun 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.090
 more or less we all go 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.410
 I need a mask like they already see 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.700
 if they are getting here that is 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.629
 perfect perfect 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.370
 Extractive and now was how we left your 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:34.190
 variable you can be watching care 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.650
 who are affiliating the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.630
 oysters said it seems to me like I was 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.440
 throwing salt in the car shot 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:46.069
 ok to see if it is mounted and I want to go 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.109
 to the east that I want to catch an airplane 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.700
 this is going to be pretty far, it will be because 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.110
 there are many people around here to see how much 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.680
 we're 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.500
 we are quite listening 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.310
 come pillaging everywhere it 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.350
 let's go there and I'll take a 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.330
 helicopter I will try to catch the one 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.130
 more capacity to see if we 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.080
 can ride all 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.690
 You have to give here a plane usually 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.060
 appear here look at this no no I 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.010
 say you have disappeared uncle you know here 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.010
 as it says here on your face I'm going 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.090
 but there has to be more to the bottom 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.160
 I guess it's not going here surely 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.700
 that each one 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.970
 unless we have such bad luck 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.450
 that none appear 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.130
 and so if there is a fast we go to appetizer 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.080
 this is very small this only catch 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.240
 two I think so if you can not call me a 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.260
 one 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.459
 pegasus 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.459
 here pegasus 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.720
 already prized family it seemed you say 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:03.560
 Negative uncle 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.150

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.650

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.220

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.520
 look at that pile of that voucher is worth everything 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.669
 we're not going to fuck in this one because it's not 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.669
 wrong 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.350
 if it comes and it does 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:47.990
 if you say that you say oysters kid 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.990
 you see we're all already worth going 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.990
 we go 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.220
 upload all 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.630
 be careful with that 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:07.350
 there are these 2 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.590

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.590

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.880
 and put it up there in the east 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.880
 in the tower 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.639
 I 've never tried this one 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.000
 tried with other smaller ones but 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.919

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.139
 let's see if we get it is going to be 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.360
 it's going to be epic that with everything with everything 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.850
 south 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.710
 They are praying yes yes yes but not me 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.800
 let's get there 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.960
 let's go back 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.889
 or almost 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.650
 you have to try again you have to 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:58.250
 try it we go there and there we are 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.250
 we go 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.660
 no way 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.560
 again we go 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.560
 come on let's go here 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.510
 ok I've been reading on twitter that 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.850
 some of you have been telling me not to 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.520
 you could join us and all this because it was a 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.110
 little late and that you could not 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.240
 universal so far then the 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.890
 next I'll try to do a little before 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.990
 because this is fighting a little late 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.630
 but I have not been able to do it all day 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.400
 and I've had a rat there and I say well 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.890
 I will record with your I know that you like 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.880
 pretty and I also like it a lot and 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.550
 I have a great time with you 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.780
 so I say let's play now and 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.470
 so next time I'll try to do it 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:49.010
 sooner for those who do not 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.520
 you can be together so late, not the league so 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.290
 late you can look a little earlier 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.780
 and as I say and go by posting on twitter 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.030
 anyway and there I will go saying 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.700
 when when I'm going to record and all this 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:04.430
 with surfing and we go through here that has to 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.639
 be around for a this a parachute 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.490
 let's catch what 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.990
 and let's go 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.860
 see if it says that enough people 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.870
 there's a party here 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.050
 this I think if I look at the inventory 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.300
 I can have some 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.350
 and accessories for those if badly 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.200
 I have 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:26.800
 perfect then let's say if they go 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.300
 putting and coming here and this 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.610
 careful this study that is going to get 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.430
 and he is going to kill 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.689
 up there 1 which are going up 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.419
 more so I'm going to wait around here for a 

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:40.120
 little to see if they rise more and we can 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:41.889
 say goodbye to everyone here, so I'm going to 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.349
 to leave here the video you know 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:46.569
 if you liked leaving them for more and what 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:47.949
 I said I'm going to put on twitter every 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:48.939
 Once I'm going to record, the 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:52.000
 advertising is seen that some have 

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:54.250
 stars and nothing are going to throw us by 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.409
 here to go saying goodbye we're going to go with 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.300
 be careful let's see if nobody comes 

00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:02.699
 from behind and pushes us I'm fine that 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.699
 they are going to push us and see you later
