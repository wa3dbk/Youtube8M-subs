little bit cheaper than this and I found
something<00:02:31.800> quite<00:02:32.070> similar<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.850> not<00:02:32.970> exactly

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
something quite similar it's not exactly

the<00:02:33.450> same<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.160> face<00:02:35.850> scrub<00:02:36.180> by
