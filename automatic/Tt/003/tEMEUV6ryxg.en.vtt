then with my fingers I'm just going to

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.210 
then with my fingers I'm just going to
pull<00:02:13.939> those<00:02:14.780> angel<00:02:15.380> wings

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
wires and just wrap very tight and very

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.300 
wires and just wrap very tight and very
closely<00:02:35.020> against<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.350> other<00:02:36.560> wire<00:02:36.830> about

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
closely against the other wire about

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.760 
closely against the other wire about
four<00:02:37.610> times<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.360> what<00:02:38.840> that's<00:02:39.050> gonna<00:02:39.230> do<00:02:39.530> is

we're going to take one of our four

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.950 
we're going to take one of our four
millimeter<00:03:00.400> glass<00:03:01.400> beads<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.060> that's<00:03:02.690> gonna

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
millimeter glass beads and that's gonna

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.080 
millimeter glass beads and that's gonna
form<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.290> head<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.830> then<00:03:04.400> finally<00:03:04.850> for<00:03:05.030> the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
form the head and then finally for the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.630 
form the head and then finally for the
halo<00:03:05.510> we're<00:03:06.020> gonna<00:03:06.200> do<00:03:06.440> one<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.340> little

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
halo we're gonna do one of the little

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.300 
halo we're gonna do one of the little
three<00:03:08.000> millimeter<00:03:09.460> Daisy<00:03:10.460> spacers

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
three millimeter Daisy spacers

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.220 
three millimeter Daisy spacers
no<00:03:13.310> what<00:03:14.120> you're<00:03:14.210> gonna<00:03:14.360> do<00:03:14.570> once<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.200> have

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
no what you're gonna do once you have

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.620 
no what you're gonna do once you have
your<00:03:15.530> angel<00:03:15.950> almost<00:03:16.190> complete<00:03:16.910> as<00:03:17.090> we're

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
your angel almost complete as we're

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.260 
your angel almost complete as we're
going<00:03:17.960> to<00:03:18.200> go<00:03:18.470> ahead<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.400> make<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.970> wrapped

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
going to go ahead and make a wrapped

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.130 
going to go ahead and make a wrapped
loop<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.590> very<00:03:22.550> close<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.300> top<00:03:23.570> of<00:03:23.840> our

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
loop so very close to the top of our

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.470 
loop so very close to the top of our
angel<00:03:24.650> we're<00:03:25.220> going<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.640> take<00:03:25.850> our<00:03:26.090> flat

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
angel we're going to take our flat

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
pliers our chain nose pliers and we're

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.580 
pliers our chain nose pliers and we're
going<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.900> make<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.200> 90<00:03:30.560> degree<00:03:30.860> Bend<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:32.590> from

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
going to make a 90 degree Bend and from

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.580 
going to make a 90 degree Bend and from
there<00:03:33.800> we<00:03:33.980> pick<00:03:34.160> up<00:03:34.280> our<00:03:34.459> round<00:03:34.670> nose<00:03:34.850> pliers

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
there we pick up our round nose pliers

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.960 
there we pick up our round nose pliers
towards<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.800> tip<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.340> don't<00:03:37.580> want<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.790> very

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
towards the tip you don't want a very

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.620 
towards the tip you don't want a very
very<00:03:38.239> big<00:03:38.510> loop<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:39.430> we're<00:03:40.430> going<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.760> go<00:03:41.450> in

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
very big loop and we're going to go in

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.800 
very big loop and we're going to go in
and<00:03:41.870> add<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.110> little<00:03:42.430> we're<00:03:43.430> gonna<00:03:43.550> roll<00:03:44.330> the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
and add a little we're gonna roll the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.900 
and add a little we're gonna roll the
wire<00:03:45.019> over<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.620> top<00:03:45.950> we're<00:03:46.430> gonna<00:03:46.519> flatten

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
wire over the top we're gonna flatten

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.500 
wire over the top we're gonna flatten
out<00:03:47.090> our<00:03:47.209> pliers<00:03:47.480> push<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.650> away<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:50.360> can

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
out our pliers push it away and you can

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.440 
out our pliers push it away and you can
see<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:50.930> we<00:03:51.080> have<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.620> pretty<00:03:52.190> quick<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.330> easy

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
see that we have a pretty quick and easy

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.810 
see that we have a pretty quick and easy
loop<00:03:53.720> right<00:03:53.959> there<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.350> like<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.190> hold<00:03:55.400> my<00:03:55.580> loops

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
loop right there I like to hold my loops

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.180 
loop right there I like to hold my loops
while<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.090> wrap<00:03:56.360> them<00:03:56.570> so<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.380> hold<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.830> with<00:03:58.010> my

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
while I wrap them so I hold that with my

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.220 
while I wrap them so I hold that with my
pliers<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.940> then<00:03:59.390> we<00:04:00.080> wrap<00:04:00.230> very<00:04:00.440> tightly

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
pliers and then we wrap very tightly

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.320 
pliers and then we wrap very tightly
three<00:04:03.230> or<00:04:03.410> four<00:04:03.620> times<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:04.310> keep<00:04:04.970> everything

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
three or four times to keep everything

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.949 
three or four times to keep everything
in<00:04:05.600> place<00:04:07.060> with<00:04:08.060> my<00:04:08.209> cutters<00:04:08.540> I'm<00:04:08.660> going<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:08.870> go

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
in place with my cutters I'm going to go

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.000 
in place with my cutters I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.290> trim<00:04:09.500> off<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.739> tail

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.470 

and<00:04:16.150> we're<00:04:17.150> gonna<00:04:17.470> secure<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.950> there<00:04:19.480> and

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
and we're gonna secure that in there and

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.270 
and we're gonna secure that in there and
there<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.840> go<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.260> can<00:04:21.290> see<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:21.769> your<00:04:21.920> angel

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
there you go you can see that your angel

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.820 
there you go you can see that your angel
is<00:04:22.340> almost<00:04:22.850> done<00:04:23.240> we're<00:04:24.050> gonna<00:04:24.200> pick<00:04:24.500> up<00:04:24.680> our

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
is almost done we're gonna pick up our

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.410 
is almost done we're gonna pick up our
ear<00:04:25.070> wires<00:04:26.020> I'm<00:04:27.020> gonna<00:04:27.260> bend<00:04:27.590> open<00:04:28.420> remember

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
ear wires I'm gonna bend open remember

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.060 
ear wires I'm gonna bend open remember
when<00:04:29.600> we're<00:04:29.750> working<00:04:30.080> with<00:04:30.200> our<00:04:30.230> ear<00:04:30.500> wires<00:04:30.740> we

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
when we're working with our ear wires we
