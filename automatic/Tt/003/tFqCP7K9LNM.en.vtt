00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.410
 today we will make mini big 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.090
 boats and this bread baked in the pan that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.190
 I already had the opportunity to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.210
 present today we will see a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.830
 version we can stuff them as 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.320
 little ones do not care they are very 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.680
 appreciated by their little bites and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.890
 the variants that this can offer 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.320
 so I start by mixing a 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.079
 old disinterest than in the carpet of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.770
 my robot I put the week very 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.230
 fine with flour on Thursday the yeast 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.379
 in lukewarm water let it be a 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.820
 fresh and dry yeast it's the same 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.309
 little advice when you prepare your 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.160
 bread or brioche or anything 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.230
 avoided any yeast contact with the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.420
 simple direct contact because that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.160
 risk of killing yeast 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.949
 so I put frozen salt put on the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.489
 side I add the yeast deducted and in 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.570
 water and then I'll start added 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.549
 2,1 warm gradually to house 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 use in all 300 milliliters 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.530
 but you can be brought on the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.700
 quality of flour and semolina 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.290
 used to put more or less water 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.490
 so I never had water in a thousand 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 this time want to add 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.020
 gradually as you pick up you 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.369
 work the dough 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.380
 it would be good to work either at the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.310
 hand to the robot until we have had or 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.110
 no more homogeneous that is not too hard 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.210
 do not hesitate that I told you to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.189
 add a little back you need you 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.229
 can see in pictures the texture of the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.579
 dough 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.250
 if what will give us a loaf 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.350
 soft at the end 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.329
 this dough we're going to divide it into two go 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.000
 to make of road that we will spread using 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.840
 of a rolling pin on the plane of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.110
 floured work 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.159
 it will be necessary to spread on a thickness of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.159
 4 mm 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.040
 cut circles with a word 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.480
 short piece or a small glass have 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.730
 afterwards on a clean cloth 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.650
 slightly floured since the dough a 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.780
 once lifted and nash of moisture and so 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.460
 it may therefore we will stick the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.460
 cover and let rise during a 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.980
 hour at 1:30 pines a doubled of 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.330
 volume or once lifted you warm 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.130
 an anti-adhesive frying pan and you 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.120
 start cooking them directly 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.910
 on medium heat 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.710
 without adding any fat 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.620
 will not have to clear the pins will want is 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.310
 arranged on the pan and slippery and 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.550
 so you count 3 4 minutes of cooking 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.450
 on each side with the ingredients 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:55.110
 that I was able to get 50 min not like 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.900
 so that you can use them from 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.120
 continuation or leave and go out 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.800
 at the right time for the last ones for 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.380
 the pad you put this over you 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.650
 love me for this time I put a 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.600
 cold salad with tuna karl draper 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.270
 corn with a little mayonnaise 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.209
 you can also put cold cuts 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.739
 elbow and sport violence 2 I 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.930
 will you put some ideas of 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.090
 pad on the blog that you can 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.150
 see them by clicking on the link that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.400
 will be up and down this video 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.690
 here is our recipe coming to an end I 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.690
 you say good appetite and see you next time
