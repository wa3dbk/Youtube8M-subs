hey<00:00:06.490> there<00:00:06.669> it's<00:00:06.849> Chris<00:00:07.540> from<00:00:07.809> 16<00:00:08.440> oakarina

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
hey there it's Chris from 16 oakarina

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.310 
hey there it's Chris from 16 oakarina
I'm<00:00:09.820> going<00:00:10.000> to<00:00:10.059> show<00:00:10.209> you<00:00:10.269> a<00:00:10.360> couple<00:00:10.690> of<00:00:10.719> basic

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
I'm going to show you a couple of basic

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.089 
I'm going to show you a couple of basic
arenas<00:00:12.039> here<00:00:13.139> these<00:00:14.139> two<00:00:14.440> are<00:00:14.589> both<00:00:14.740> in<00:00:15.009> the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
arenas here these two are both in the

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.450 
arenas here these two are both in the
key<00:00:15.309> of<00:00:15.490> E<00:00:16.680> which<00:00:17.680> is<00:00:18.900> let's<00:00:19.900> see<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.590> e3<00:00:21.189> steps

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
key of E which is let's see the e3 steps

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.730 
key of E which is let's see the e3 steps
higher<00:00:21.699> than<00:00:22.119> two<00:00:22.810> steps<00:00:23.019> higher<00:00:23.260> than<00:00:23.560> what

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
higher than two steps higher than what

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.169 
higher than two steps higher than what
would<00:00:23.890> be<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:25.590> blue<00:00:26.590> drill<00:00:26.830> number<00:00:27.070> seven<00:00:27.730> I

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
would be a blue drill number seven I

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.310 
would be a blue drill number seven I
guess<00:00:28.660> they<00:00:28.779> call<00:00:28.900> this<00:00:29.050> double<00:00:29.349> base<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:31.320> will

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
guess they call this double base I will

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.490 
guess they call this double base I will
throw<00:00:33.040> these<00:00:33.629> so<00:00:34.629> that's<00:00:34.750> why<00:00:34.960> they<00:00:35.110> end<00:00:35.260> up<00:00:35.350> in

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
throw these so that's why they end up in

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.380 
throw these so that's why they end up in
kind<00:00:35.680> of<00:00:35.739> odd<00:00:35.949> keys<00:00:36.370> I<00:00:36.400> will<00:00:36.820> throw<00:00:37.089> it<00:00:37.180> up<00:00:37.269> this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
kind of odd keys I will throw it up this

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.420 
kind of odd keys I will throw it up this
way<00:00:37.570> first<00:00:37.839> let<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.379> stiff<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.860> flip<00:00:39.159> it<00:00:39.280> over

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
way first let it stiff and flip it over

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.180 
way first let it stiff and flip it over
repin<00:00:40.030> it<00:00:40.089> on<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.330> potter's<00:00:40.780> wheel<00:00:41.190> recenter

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
repin it on the potter's wheel recenter

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.979 
repin it on the potter's wheel recenter
the<00:00:42.220> whole<00:00:42.489> thing<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.059> throw<00:00:43.330> it<00:00:43.449> up<00:00:43.540> this<00:00:43.750> way

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
the whole thing and throw it up this way

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.180 
the whole thing and throw it up this way
take<00:00:44.979> it<00:00:45.159> off<00:00:45.330> you<00:00:46.330> know<00:00:46.360> later<00:00:46.690> on<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.890> build

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
take it off you know later on and build

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.000 
take it off you know later on and build
on<00:00:48.369> the<00:00:48.489> mouthpiece<00:00:48.699> and<00:00:49.030> then<00:00:49.589> of<00:00:50.589> course<00:00:50.680> cut

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
on the mouthpiece and then of course cut

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
on the mouthpiece and then of course cut
the<00:00:51.129> fit<00:00:51.280> ball<00:00:51.400> and<00:00:51.549> tune<00:00:51.699> them<00:00:51.879> and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
the fit ball and tune them and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.060 
the fit ball and tune them and
everything<00:00:52.330> we<00:00:53.260> played<00:00:53.470> this<00:00:53.589> one<00:00:53.799> a<00:00:53.830> little

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
everything we played this one a little

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:05.460 
everything we played this one a little
bit<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.119> would<00:01:04.239> just<00:01:04.269> place<00:01:04.570> one<00:01:04.600> octave

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
bit so that would just place one octave

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.020 
bit so that would just place one octave
there's<00:01:05.920> no<00:01:06.040> thumb<00:01:06.460> holes<00:01:06.610> on<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.880> bottom

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
there's no thumb holes on the bottom

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.410 
there's no thumb holes on the bottom
just<00:01:08.020> one<00:01:08.229> chromatic<00:01:08.740> octave<00:01:09.159> so<00:01:10.060> this<00:01:10.179> is<00:01:10.329> the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
just one chromatic octave so this is the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:21.779 
just one chromatic octave so this is the
same<00:01:10.659> here<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:18.009> this<00:01:18.340> one<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.329> G<00:01:20.140> sharp<00:01:20.789> which

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
same here so this one is a G sharp which

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.969 
same here so this one is a G sharp which
is<00:01:21.820> if<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.420> was<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:22.780> G<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.380> would<00:01:23.469> be<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.740> same

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
is if this was in G it would be the same

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:48.719 
is if this was in G it would be the same
as<00:01:24.189> a<00:01:24.219> number<00:01:25.499> six<00:01:30.780> six<00:01:31.780> six<00:01:32.710> blue<00:01:32.979> Rio<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.549> that

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
as a number six six six blue Rio so that

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.429 
as a number six six six blue Rio so that
one<00:01:48.909> has<00:01:50.249> two<00:01:51.249> thumb<00:01:51.460> balls<00:01:51.670> on<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.909> bottom

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
one has two thumb balls on the bottom

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.609 
one has two thumb balls on the bottom
which<00:01:53.439> give<00:01:53.679> you<00:01:54.149> one<00:01:55.149> octave<00:01:55.569> plus<00:01:56.049> just<00:01:56.380> one

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
which give you one octave plus just one

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.289 
which give you one octave plus just one
whole<00:01:56.889> step<00:01:57.219> so<00:01:57.429> two<00:01:57.490> half<00:01:57.789> steps<00:01:57.909> on<00:01:58.210> the

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
whole step so two half steps on the

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.550 
whole step so two half steps on the
bottom<00:01:59.310> this<00:02:00.310> one's<00:02:00.639> in<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.880> key<00:02:01.149> of<00:02:01.179> C<00:02:01.719> which

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
bottom this one's in the key of C which

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.069 
bottom this one's in the key of C which
would<00:02:02.709> be<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:02.950> same<00:02:03.159> as<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.479> Abood<00:02:04.479> real<00:02:04.719> number

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
would be the same as a Abood real number

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:38.030 
would be the same as a Abood real number
five

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.330 

seven<00:02:39.040> plays<00:02:39.480> octave<00:02:40.480> plus<00:02:40.570> one<00:02:40.870> note<00:02:41.250> let<00:02:42.250> me

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
seven plays octave plus one note let me

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.620 
seven plays octave plus one note let me
swing<00:02:42.580> around<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.850> other<00:02:42.940> side<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.390> I'll<00:02:43.450> let

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
swing around the other side and I'll let

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:54.980 
swing around the other side and I'll let
you<00:02:43.720> get<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.870> little<00:02:44.020> closer<00:02:44.230> look<00:02:44.560> at<00:02:44.710> these

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.510 

that<00:02:55.990> one<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.470> whole<00:02:56.650> size<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.310> one

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
that one the whole size on this one

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.780 
that one the whole size on this one
isn't<00:02:57.820> too<00:02:57.970> bad<00:02:58.830> but<00:02:59.830> definitely<00:03:00.310> needed<00:03:00.640> some

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
isn't too bad but definitely needed some

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.230 
isn't too bad but definitely needed some
pretty<00:03:01.180> good<00:03:01.300> size<00:03:01.480> fingers<00:03:01.930> for<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:03.240> that's

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
pretty good size fingers for it that's

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.440 
pretty good size fingers for it that's
also<00:03:04.450> true<00:03:05.110> with<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.620> one<00:03:05.920> all<00:03:06.850> size<00:03:07.150> similar

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
also true with this one all size similar

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.830 
also true with this one all size similar
to<00:03:07.780> like<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.770> bluegray<00:03:09.190> o<00:03:09.270> number<00:03:10.270> city<00:03:10.600> or

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
to like a bluegray o number city or

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.670 
to like a bluegray o number city or
number<00:03:11.170> five<00:03:11.620> see<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.870> use<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.110> kind<00:03:14.620> of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
number five see I use the kind of

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:29.220 
number five see I use the kind of
oval-shaped<00:03:16.260> pippilotta<00:03:17.260> nose<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.930> one

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
oval-shaped pippilotta nose so that one

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.320 
oval-shaped pippilotta nose so that one
you<00:03:30.100> do<00:03:30.280> start<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.760> get<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.000> little<00:03:31.210> bit

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
you do start to get a little bit

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:51.480 
you do start to get a little bit
concerned<00:03:32.290> about<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.070> size<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.700> holes<00:03:50.490> a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
concerned about the size of the holes a

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.720 
concerned about the size of the holes a
little<00:03:51.760> bit<00:03:52.060> more<00:03:52.270> of<00:03:52.390> an<00:03:52.480> oval<00:03:53.310> hole<00:03:54.310> shape

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
little bit more of an oval hole shape

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.400 
little bit more of an oval hole shape
which<00:03:55.240> makes<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.660> little<00:03:55.840> bit<00:03:56.050> easier<00:03:56.380> to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
which makes it a little bit easier to

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:10.710 
which makes it a little bit easier to
get<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.709> all<00:03:56.830> covered<00:04:09.090> okay<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.120> guess<00:04:10.510> that's
