00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 Hello my name is Pasha in this video 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.520
 we will analyze the max song of the selfish cake 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.690
 clean coconut what happened why are you not 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.790
 want to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.450
 this song uses two bundles 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:25.270
 chord first is g minor 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.580
 the second is adios 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.530
 3 is f 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.530
 and 4 is B minor 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.060
 preppy leads another bunch of chords 1 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.290
 cards is adios 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.050
 2 f 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.210
 the third is g minor 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.210
 and 4 it adds 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.920
 to simplify the game i use capo 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.570
 on the first fret this way becomes 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.650
 much easier to take chords 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.600
 adios 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.520
 f 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.200
 and d d s 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.880
 now let 's break the fight the first part of the verse 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.880
 and i just play with strokes down 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770
 and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.380
 there are some more touches added but 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.200
 it makes no sense to explain them because 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.909
 you can tell the elements of the law then 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.909
 in the verse begins here is a fight 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.170
 quickly it looks like this 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.270
 and 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.570
 chorus i play six fight with 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.670
 glushko 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.230
 with glushko when playing a mediator nothing 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.780
 different from mute when playing 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.240
 fingers you also do at the same time 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.690
 movement down the strings and silence them 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.690
 palm 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.770
 the battle looks like this 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.330
 now i will play faster 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.349
