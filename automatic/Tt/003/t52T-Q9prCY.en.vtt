00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.230 

with<00:00:13.230> short<00:00:13.500> hair<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.340> nice<00:00:14.580> thing<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.969> do<00:00:15.120> is

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
with short hair the nice thing to do is

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.029 
with short hair the nice thing to do is
to<00:00:15.360> find<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> natural<00:00:15.870> movement<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> hair

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
to find the natural movement in the hair

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.550 
to find the natural movement in the hair
often<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.330> haircut<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.199> will<00:00:19.350> have

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
often the haircut that you will have

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.320 
often the haircut that you will have
will<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.890> much<00:00:20.100> more<00:00:20.310> distinct<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.150> very

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
will be much more distinct so it's very

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.450 
will be much more distinct so it's very
very<00:00:21.630> easy<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.260> follow<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.980> there's<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.250> couple

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
very easy to follow and there's a couple

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.640 
very easy to follow and there's a couple
of<00:00:23.640> good<00:00:23.850> rules<00:00:24.119> first<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
of good rules first of all have the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.700 
of good rules first of all have the
right<00:00:25.830> equipment<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.699> tend<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> favor<00:00:28.019> using<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
right equipment I tend to favor using a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.529 
right equipment I tend to favor using a
vent<00:00:29.010> brush<00:00:29.220> when<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.699> doing<00:00:29.910> short<00:00:30.269> hair

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
vent brush when I'm doing short hair

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.450 
vent brush when I'm doing short hair
because<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.019> doesn't<00:00:31.380> disguise<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.980> movement

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
because it doesn't disguise the movement

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.610 
because it doesn't disguise the movement
too<00:00:32.640> much<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.180> allows<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.930> air<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.410> pass

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
too much and allows the air to pass

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.209 
too much and allows the air to pass
quickly<00:00:35.160> through<00:00:36.320> Max<00:00:37.320> Gousse<00:00:37.590> head's<00:00:37.920> just

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
quickly through Max Gousse head's just

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.340 
quickly through Max Gousse head's just
been<00:00:38.340> shampooed<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.329> absolutely<00:00:39.960> full

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380 
been shampooed so it's absolutely full
of<00:00:40.379> water<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.610> thing<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.149> is

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
of water so the first thing we do is

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.229 
of water so the first thing we do is
just<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:43.079> blast<00:00:43.770> through<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> hair<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.760> get

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
just a blast through the hair and get

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.830 
just a blast through the hair and get
rid<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.600> all<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> excess<00:00:46.410> water<00:00:50.420> now<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> hair

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.500 
rid of all the excess water now the hair
is<00:00:51.930> 80%<00:00:52.289> dry<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> best<00:00:53.969> time<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.329> put

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
is 80% dry this is the best time to put

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.619
