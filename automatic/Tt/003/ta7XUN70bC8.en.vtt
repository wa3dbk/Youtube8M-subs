going to be looking at concrete mixing
now<00:00:22.650> behind<00:00:22.980> me<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.340> see<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.880> Mahon

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
now behind me you can see the Mahon

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.000 
now behind me you can see the Mahon
accordin<00:00:24.570> structure<00:00:24.990> rising<00:00:25.500> already<00:00:25.830> well

accordin structure rising already well

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.950 
accordin structure rising already well
above<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> 30th<00:00:26.760> floor<00:00:26.789> now<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.869> an

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
above the 30th floor now it's an

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960 
above the 30th floor now it's an
interesting<00:00:28.260> challenge<00:00:28.769> how<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> get<00:00:29.760> all<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
interesting challenge how to get all the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.389 
interesting challenge how to get all the
concrete<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.470> each<00:00:31.650> floor<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.219> we're

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
concrete up to each floor that we're

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.950 
concrete up to each floor that we're
building<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.940> top<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.450> 30th<00:00:33.750> floor

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
building on top of the 30th floor

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
building on top of the 30th floor
because<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> has<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> go<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
because it has to go all the way up to

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.660 
because it has to go all the way up to
77<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.380> location<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.610> down

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
77 so this location which is just down

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.840 
77 so this location which is just down
in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> same<00:00:39.329> soja<00:00:39.629> bout<00:00:39.930> 50<00:00:40.350> meters<00:00:40.710> away<00:00:40.850> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
in the same soja bout 50 meters away is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.220 
in the same soja bout 50 meters away is
where<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.210> bring<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.690> sand<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
where we bring in the sand and the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
where we bring in the sand and the
aggregate<00:00:43.640> we<00:00:44.640> then<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> concrete

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
aggregate we then have the concrete

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
aggregate we then have the concrete
mixed<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.350> ready<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.739> use<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> goes<00:00:47.579> into

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
mixed and ready to use and it goes into

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
mixed and ready to use and it goes into
these<00:00:48.000> silos<00:00:48.539> each<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.379> which<00:00:49.590> contains

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
these silos each one of which contains

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.790 
these silos each one of which contains
around<00:00:50.430> about<00:00:50.610> 70<00:00:51.120> tons<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.600> concrete<00:00:51.809> now

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
around about 70 tons of concrete now

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
around about 70 tons of concrete now
what's<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> concrete's<00:00:53.610> ready<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.000> pour<00:00:54.239> we

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
what's the concrete's ready to pour we

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.930 
what's the concrete's ready to pour we
then<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.960> move<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.440> from<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.890> side<00:00:56.160> back

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
then have to move it from this side back

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.670 
then have to move it from this side back
to<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> main<00:00:57.420> mahanakhon<00:00:57.809> site<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.500> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to the main mahanakhon site and so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
to the main mahanakhon site and so
that's<00:00:58.859> where<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> trucks<00:00:59.489> come<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.820> each

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that's where the trucks come in each

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.810 
that's where the trucks come in each
truck<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.140> carry<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.559> relatively<00:01:02.430> small

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
truck can carry a relatively small

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.520 
truck can carry a relatively small
amount<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> concrete<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.899> need<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> trucks

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
amount of concrete so we need the trucks

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.960 
amount of concrete so we need the trucks
to<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.799> running<00:01:05.100> backwards<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.549> forwards

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to be running backwards and forwards

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.460 
to be running backwards and forwards
between<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.479> side<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.320> main

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
between this side and the main

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
between this side and the main
mahanakhon<00:01:07.860> site<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
mahanakhon site so it really is a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.179 
mahanakhon site so it really is a
logistics<00:01:09.990> challenge<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.650> need<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> mix<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
logistics challenge we need to mix the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.760 
logistics challenge we need to mix the
concrete<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.970> take<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.869> onto<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> main<00:01:13.470> site

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
concrete here take it onto the main site

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
concrete here take it onto the main site
send<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.880> way<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.360> building<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
send it all the way up the building and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.590 
send it all the way up the building and
then<00:01:16.320> use<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> question<00:01:17.729> becomes<00:01:18.030> how

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
then use it so the question becomes how

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.289 
then use it so the question becomes how
much<00:01:18.630> concrete<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.830> actually<00:01:20.310> mix<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.820> one

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
much concrete can we actually mix in one

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
much concrete can we actually mix in one
day<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.720> how<00:01:21.869> much<00:01:21.990> concrete<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.740> need

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
day and how much concrete do we need

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.460 
day and how much concrete do we need
well<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.880> batching<00:01:24.360> plant<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:25.110> produce

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
well this batching plant can produce

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.010 
well this batching plant can produce
around<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.340> 200<00:01:26.670> cubic<00:01:27.450> meters<00:01:27.869> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
around about 200 cubic meters of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.190 
around about 200 cubic meters of
concrete<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.560> day<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.119> our<00:01:30.119> requirement<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.049> we

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
concrete a day and our requirement if we

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.340 
concrete a day and our requirement if we
add<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.159> mega<00:01:32.369> columns<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.360> main<00:01:33.960> core

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
add up the mega columns the main core

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
add up the mega columns the main core
structure<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.070> well<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.460> each<00:01:35.610> floor<00:01:35.939> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
structure as well as each floor is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.319 
structure as well as each floor is
something<00:01:36.960> around<00:01:37.200> 500<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> 600<00:01:38.729> cubic<00:01:38.909> meters

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
something around 500 to 600 cubic meters

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.050 
something around 500 to 600 cubic meters
of<00:01:39.450> concrete<00:01:39.630> per<00:01:40.350> floor<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.820> means

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
of concrete per floor so what that means

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.270 
of concrete per floor so what that means
is<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.810> where<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> calculation<00:01:44.040> comes

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
is this is where the calculation comes

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.520 
is this is where the calculation comes
from<00:01:44.640> how<00:01:45.210> long<00:01:45.270> does<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.720> take<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.170> build<00:01:46.320> each

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
from how long does it take to build each

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050 
from how long does it take to build each
floor<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.070> answer<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> three<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> four

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
floor and the answer is three to four

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.139 
floor and the answer is three to four
days<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.960> reason<00:01:49.409> why<00:01:49.560> being<00:01:50.149> concrete

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
days the reason why being concrete

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.080 
days the reason why being concrete
that's<00:01:51.930> our<00:01:52.200> major<00:01:52.409> constraint<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.820> one

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that's our major constraint this is one
