 citizen who is already configured here 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.960
 we see the evolution of the fleet of 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.460
 watering during the week one 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.259

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.369
 sees the evolution of the sun here it's 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.060
 the fertilizer that I simply had a 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.409
 quiet 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.119
 since there is already seed 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.249
 apparently the flower power that him 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.530
 not suitable if I come for example on 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:04.630

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.340
 it also allows me to if I have a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.810
