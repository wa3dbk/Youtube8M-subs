00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
mean he can't be good

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.120 
mean he can't be good
but<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.840> fact<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> matter<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.590> he's

my<00:02:05.820> mind<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.329> flips<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> Andy<00:02:07.170> Carroll

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
my mind and flips it to Andy Carroll

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.619 
my mind and flips it to Andy Carroll
Andy<00:02:07.829> Carroll<00:02:08.039> had<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.550> not<00:02:09.030> even<00:02:09.209> full

young unproven players ridiculous and

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.930 
young unproven players ridiculous and

you say we spent more than that on

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.420 
you say we spent more than that on
Henderson<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.450> believe<00:02:32.659> we<00:02:32.750> spent<00:02:32.989> up<00:02:33.230> like<00:02:33.650> 220

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
Henderson I believe we spent up like 220

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.720 
Henderson I believe we spent up like 220
million<00:02:34.670> pounds<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.180> Henderson<00:02:36.489> but<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.610> have

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
million pounds on Henderson but you have

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.910 
million pounds on Henderson but you have
to<00:02:37.849> realize<00:02:38.209> it's<00:02:38.569> Brendan<00:02:39.079> Rodgers<00:02:39.260> he's

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
to realize it's Brendan Rodgers he's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.050 
to realize it's Brendan Rodgers he's
into<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.400> club

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
into the club

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.420 
into the club
yes<00:02:41.629> Brendan<00:02:42.079> Rodgers<00:02:42.230> managed<00:02:42.860> Joe<00:02:43.069> Allen

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
yes Brendan Rodgers managed Joe Allen

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.039 
yes Brendan Rodgers managed Joe Allen
he's<00:02:43.609> a<00:02:43.640> former<00:02:44.090> player<00:02:44.239> of<00:02:44.540> Brendan<00:02:44.870> Rodgers

he's a former player of Brendan Rodgers

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.229 
he's a former player of Brendan Rodgers
but<00:02:45.560> again<00:02:45.920> we<00:02:46.190> can't<00:02:46.459> let<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.700> get<00:02:47.030> in<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
but again we can't let that get in the

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.780 
but again we can't let that get in the
way<00:02:47.470> look<00:02:48.470> at<00:02:48.590> Roy<00:02:48.799> Hodgson<00:02:49.250> bringing<00:02:49.670> in

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
way look at Roy Hodgson bringing in

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.610 
way look at Roy Hodgson bringing in
players<00:02:50.030> like<00:02:50.269> Paul<00:02:50.569> can<00:02:50.780> Chesky<00:02:51.290> from<00:02:51.500> his

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
players like Paul can Chesky from his

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.369 
players like Paul can Chesky from his
former<00:02:52.069> club<00:02:52.340> Follin<00:02:52.760> follow<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.690> mean<00:02:53.840> just

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
former club Follin follow I mean just

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.410 
former club Follin follow I mean just
because<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.220> player<00:02:55.549> has<00:02:55.790> played<00:02:56.060> under<00:02:56.269> the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
because the player has played under the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.819 
because the player has played under the
manager<00:02:56.810> does<00:02:56.959> not<00:02:57.140> mean<00:02:57.319> he's<00:02:57.440> going<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.709> be

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
manager does not mean he's going to be

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.009 
manager does not mean he's going to be
good<00:02:58.129> with<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.430> club<00:02:58.640> we<00:02:59.269> have<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.599> look<00:02:59.810> at

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
good with the club we have to look at

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.349 
good with the club we have to look at
Joe<00:03:00.769> Allen<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.280> see<00:03:01.459> if<00:03:01.640> he's<00:03:01.790> gonna<00:03:01.940> fit<00:03:02.209> into

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
Joe Allen and see if he's gonna fit into

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.509 
Joe Allen and see if he's gonna fit into
our<00:03:02.450> squad<00:03:02.810> now<00:03:03.319> again<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.859> don't<00:03:03.920> think<00:03:04.129> Clint

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
our squad now again I don't think Clint

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.280 
our squad now again I don't think Clint
Dempsey<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.120> good<00:03:05.359> buy<00:03:05.510> either<00:03:05.780> because

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
Dempsey is a good buy either because

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.530 
Dempsey is a good buy either because
again<00:03:06.709> it's<00:03:06.950> some<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.400> same<00:03:07.700> things<00:03:08.180> he's

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
again it's some of the same things he's

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.380 
again it's some of the same things he's
old<00:03:08.840> he's<00:03:09.709> really<00:03:10.069> I<00:03:10.310> mean<00:03:10.579> last<00:03:10.879> season<00:03:11.269> was

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
old he's really I mean last season was

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.949 
old he's really I mean last season was
his<00:03:11.540> star<00:03:11.810> season<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:13.239> while<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.420> price<00:03:14.629> tags

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
his star season and while the price tags

his star season and while the price tags
a<00:03:15.079> little<00:03:15.260> bit<00:03:15.380> different<00:03:15.799> but<00:03:15.919> we<00:03:16.340> have<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:16.609> be

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
a little bit different but we have to be

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.759 
a little bit different but we have to be
careful<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.269> our<00:03:17.450> spending<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:17.930> spending<00:03:18.079> 15

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
careful on our spending and spending 15

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.650 
careful on our spending and spending 15
million<00:03:19.190> pounds<00:03:19.639> for<00:03:19.819> such<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> young<00:03:20.359> player

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
that has done virtually nothing and I'm

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.970 
that has done virtually nothing and I'm
not<00:03:23.239> trying<00:03:23.569> to<00:03:23.630> diss<00:03:24.049> Joe<00:03:24.410> Allen<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.859> make

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.710 
him look bad but realistically think
about<00:03:28.549> it<00:03:28.849> it<00:03:29.720> doesn't<00:03:30.319> make<00:03:30.500> sense<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:31.720> would

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
about it it doesn't make sense I would

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.099 
about it it doesn't make sense I would
rather<00:03:32.930> go<00:03:33.260> out<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.680> buy<00:03:33.950> someone<00:03:34.900> for<00:03:35.900> far

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
rather go out and buy someone for far

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.289 
rather go out and buy someone for far
cheaper<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:36.859> far<00:03:37.129> more<00:03:37.400> of<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.609> risk<00:03:37.910> and

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
cheaper that is far more of a risk and

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.479 
cheaper that is far more of a risk and
have<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.900> not<00:03:39.049> come<00:03:39.319> out<00:03:39.440> than<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.769> buy<00:03:40.129> Joe

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
have it not come out than to buy Joe

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.610 
have it not come out than to buy Joe
Allen<00:03:40.849> for<00:03:41.030> 15<00:03:41.359> million<00:03:41.720> pounds<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.290> have<00:03:42.470> it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
Allen for 15 million pounds and have it

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.159 
Allen for 15 million pounds and have it
flop<00:03:43.030> okay<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:44.090> this<00:03:44.359> is<00:03:44.569> just<00:03:44.599> my<00:03:45.019> opinion

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
flop okay so this is just my opinion

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.349 
flop okay so this is just my opinion
those<00:03:46.040> are<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.370> three<00:03:46.760> reasons<00:03:46.940> why<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.329> think

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
those are the three reasons why I think

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.270 
those are the three reasons why I think
Liverpool<00:03:48.019> should<00:03:48.169> not<00:03:48.319> just<00:03:48.590> sign<00:03:48.799> Joe<00:03:49.010> Allen

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
Liverpool should not just sign Joe Allen

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.319 
Liverpool should not just sign Joe Allen

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
how about you give me three reasons or

how about you give me three reasons or
maybe<00:03:56.989> one<00:03:57.410> reason<00:03:57.769> or<00:03:57.859> two<00:03:58.040> reasons<00:03:58.190> why<00:03:58.549> we

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
maybe one reason or two reasons why we

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.180 
maybe one reason or two reasons why we
should<00:03:59.209> sign<00:03:59.989> Joe<00:04:00.319> Allen<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.769> will<00:04:01.040> look
