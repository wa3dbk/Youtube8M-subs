00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.149 
that the ipad doesn't is an SD card slot
combine<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> cameras<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
combine that with the cameras and the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.679 
combine that with the cameras and the
ability<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.579> run<00:01:35.670> flash<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.540> get<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
ability to run flash and you get a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.179 
ability to run flash and you get a
device<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> iPad<00:01:37.950> does

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
device that can do what the iPad does

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.219 
device that can do what the iPad does
and<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.579> little<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.750> smaller<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and a little more but it's smaller and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679 
and a little more but it's smaller and
more<00:01:40.470> expensive<00:01:40.950> MSRP<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.090> 800<00:01:42.509> bucks

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
more expensive MSRP on this is 800 bucks

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.660 
more expensive MSRP on this is 800 bucks
so<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> think<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> jury<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> still<00:01:43.979> out<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.430> that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
so I think the jury is still out on that

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
so I think the jury is still out on that
question<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.750> almost<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.259> much<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> question

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
question it's almost as much a question

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.069 
question it's almost as much a question
of<00:01:47.040> culture<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.670> technology<00:01:48.299> most<00:01:48.780> people

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
of culture as technology most people

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
of culture as technology most people

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
asking which is better already have

their<00:01:51.090> allegiance<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.689> biases<00:01:52.229> suffice<00:01:52.979> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
their allegiance and biases suffice it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.160 
their allegiance and biases suffice it
to<00:01:53.189> say<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.790> believe<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> galaxy<00:01:54.780> tab<00:01:54.990> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
