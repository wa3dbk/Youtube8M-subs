00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.651
DRAGO

00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:08.215
---Tell us about the match.

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:28.218
I was very careful. I wasn't as aggressive, but I didn't waste time on foolish attacks.

00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:35.693
I'm glad I could get a down as a result.

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:23.700
---What do you think about Yamamoto's loss?

00:01:35.357 --> 00:01:48.338
It looked like he wasn't as in good a shape as when he fought me.

00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:52.507
It looked like he didn't have the fighting spirit that he usually has.

00:01:52.507 --> 00:02:06.183
Of course, Petrosyan is strong so he might not have won either way.
