00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
specifications let's see what we have so

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.000 
specifications let's see what we have so
for<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.050> audio<00:03:03.170> we've<00:03:04.170> got<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.410> 30<00:03:04.739> millimeter

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.830 
frequency range is 22 to 20 kilohertz
transmission<00:03:13.830> range<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:15.390> frequency

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
transmission range and the frequency

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.840 
transmission range and the frequency
response<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.500> an<00:03:16.620> effective<00:03:17.100> range<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.580> 10<00:03:17.820> to

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.740 

so<00:03:31.709> yeah<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.370> actual<00:03:32.640> wireless<00:03:33.000> range<00:03:33.480> on

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
so yeah the the actual wireless range on

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.820 
so yeah the the actual wireless range on
these<00:03:33.870> headphones<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.560> about<00:03:35.989> 30<00:03:36.989> feet<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.769> you

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
these headphones is about 30 feet so you

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.530 
these headphones is about 30 feet so you
should<00:03:38.160> be<00:03:38.250> able<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.430> travel<00:03:38.820> about<00:03:39.000> 30<00:03:39.300> feet

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
should be able to travel about 30 feet

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.390 
should be able to travel about 30 feet
