00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.440 

like<00:00:44.110> this<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.470> a<00:00:44.500> tattoo<00:00:44.950> machine<00:00:45.100> I<00:00:45.579> use<00:00:46.270> it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
like this is a tattoo machine I use it

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.389 
like this is a tattoo machine I use it
for<00:00:46.570> both<00:00:46.690> linings<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.590> shading

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
for both linings and shading

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:54.720 
for both linings and shading
I<00:00:48.430> don't<00:00:49.149> separate<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.780> two<00:00:53.430> diversity<00:00:54.430> dying

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
I don't separate the two diversity dying

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.479 
I don't separate the two diversity dying
mr.<00:00:55.210> Glenn<00:00:55.420> wildin<00:00:55.899> lots<00:00:56.680> of<00:00:56.800> people<00:00:57.129> have<00:00:57.250> one

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
mr. Glenn wildin lots of people have one

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.549 
mr. Glenn wildin lots of people have one
machine<00:00:57.790> to<00:00:57.850> shading<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.600> one<00:00:58.750> for<00:00:58.960> lining<00:00:59.379> or

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
machine to shading and one for lining or

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.740 
machine to shading and one for lining or
filling<00:00:59.980> but<00:01:00.730> I<00:01:00.820> think<00:01:01.089> this<00:01:01.239> kind<00:01:01.449> of<00:01:01.600> machine

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
filling but I think this kind of machine

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.189 
filling but I think this kind of machine
is<00:01:02.170> good<00:01:02.410> for<00:01:02.620> all<00:01:02.829> kinds<00:01:03.370> of<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.579> were<00:01:04.199> first

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
is good for all kinds of you were first

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
make the armature bar go up and down

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:51.470 
make the armature bar go up and down
correctly<00:01:40.270> with<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.869> Kois

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.660 

I'm<00:01:52.020> about<00:01:52.410> to<00:01:52.530> tackle<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.920> pad<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
I'm about to tackle a pad now the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.980 
I'm about to tackle a pad now the
machine<00:01:54.240> has<00:01:54.540> all<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.080> mechanical<00:01:55.680> parts

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
machine has all the mechanical parts

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:11.839 
machine has all the mechanical parts
let's<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.200> whether<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.650> works<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.160> not

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.300 

so<00:02:12.659> no<00:02:12.749> mechanical<00:02:13.200> masks<00:02:13.650> or<00:02:13.920> not<00:02:14.040> very

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
so no mechanical masks or not very

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.089 
so no mechanical masks or not very
cemented<00:02:15.150> any<00:02:15.450> now<00:02:15.780> some<00:02:16.319> machines<00:02:16.769> are

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
cemented any now some machines are

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.550 
cemented any now some machines are
designed<00:02:17.219> for<00:02:17.790> lining<00:02:18.329> and<00:02:18.450> others<00:02:19.260> for

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
designed for lining and others for

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.989 
designed for lining and others for
shading<00:02:19.950> at<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.909> machina<00:02:21.299> can<00:02:21.569> ask<00:02:21.749> for<00:02:21.989> all

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:22.999 
shading at the machina can ask for all

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.940 
shading at the machina can ask for all
others<00:02:23.999> the<00:02:24.120> hybrids<00:02:24.749> that<00:02:25.019> can<00:02:25.230> be<00:02:25.379> adjusted

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
others the hybrids that can be adjusted

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.300 
others the hybrids that can be adjusted
so<00:02:26.159> you<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.400> decide<00:02:26.909> whether<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.599> line<00:02:28.310> J's

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
so you can decide whether to line J's

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.940 
so you can decide whether to line J's
color<00:02:30.269> or<00:02:30.750> filly<00:02:32.989> club<00:02:33.989> or<00:02:34.139> ya<00:02:34.319> Maddalena
