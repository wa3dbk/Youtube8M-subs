00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
but I guess I'll find out when I get my

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.570 
but I guess I'll find out when I get my
cobb<00:02:18.120> accessport<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.900> mail<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:20.010> just

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
cobb accessport in the mail I just

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.570

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
I believe it's either one and a half or

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.540
