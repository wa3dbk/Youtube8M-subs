00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.899
 good players declared slaves today os 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.029
 let's show how we can have more 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:10.299
 of an account within a same 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.660
 mobile phone a tablet or from a 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:16.570
 Android PC emulator through a 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.720
 computer or something we will show you how 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.150
 we can do this because the first thing that 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.800
 we must have is an account for example 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.750
 here we have an open account 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.180
 clear clan the only thing that we will have to 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.520
 doing is where we have the adjustments 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.650
 whether on our mobile phone will be 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.410
 another adaptable form will come out as here 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.300
 but we just have to have adjustments and we 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.970
 we put in adjustments and we will have to go to 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.989
 manage account here we will have 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.980
 our accounts where we have 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.980
 synchronized our data of clear is 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.140
 clear for example from google account 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.470
 facebook where we have saved the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.020
 data we will have to add an account 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.670
 here we have added the two for 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.890
 example and we'll have to give it to add 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.350
 account and from here we will have different 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 options me for example I have clear 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.820
 plan saved on google so I would have 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 that add the google account and I 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.550
 they would say if you want to use an account 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.070
 available or create a new one in this 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.460
 case would be to use an account where the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.590
 have here we would put the mail 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:25.010
 and the password we would access and good 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.830
 I have some steps I would end up here 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.590
 added once we have our two 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.299
 accounts we will only have we see here 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.030
 it comes out that right now it's 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.560
 using is in green we will only have 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.110
 to click on the icon and here you are 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.310
 synchronize calendar contacts data 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.970
 of applications we had to mark 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.790
 application data 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.700
 right now we have is using it 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.140
 so we would have to use again 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.640
 the account below 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.450
 the new one we would have to get into the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.460
 that we have blocked and remove the data 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.490
 next mind and now the new account 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.350
 we want to achieve data get us 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.250
 in it and synchronize the data of the 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.530
 Applications 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.649
 and then we would have to go to 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.000
 applications search our game here 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.460
 it is clear clan and erase the data 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.860
 this would not cause the data to be erased 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.210
 permanently or nothing because our 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.410
 data are stored within the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.120
 google account if we have it 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.970
 synchronized 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.819
 we accept and the data has already been deleted 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.370
 here we will see now that once when 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.930
 let's go back to our game 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.390
 declared slaves will tell us how we expect 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.270
 you load 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.270
 it will turn out that now when we are 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.780
 achieving we will see that by blocking the 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.780
 departure 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.700
 tells us that if you already have an account 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.409
 let's have a look at the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.480
 function to link a device in the 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.060
 game settings now we'll see that 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.480
 when loading in the upper corner we 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.940
 it will come out that if we have an account for 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.320
 can synchronize and use it 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.320
 We hope you finish loading 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.049
 they are loaded 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.310
 and good and here as we see it is as if 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.270
 will start a new game but up here 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.940
 it tells you you already have an account 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.880
 it's a google symbol we'll just have to 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.300
 give him to connect and right now he tells me 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.820
 that formerly if you remember the 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.130
 synchronize look here in this by 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.960
 example has come out that we have for 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.820
 select one of the two accounts 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.950
 and we will just have to select the 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.830
 account for example is mine here and 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.110
 affect and we will get the name that 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.690
 we want to download the village of 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.310
 bosses and truth with help from the sale with 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.630
 the municipality of various and so 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.160
 will lose the progress of the game 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.050
 current or the game we had 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.180
 previously we will just have to give it 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.210
 guarantees because it will be the new game at 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.190
 have deleted the data before 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.190
 and now it will load our village 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.630
 we will see that it was different from the first 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.630
 that we had 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.190
 here we already have the other one or 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.190
 and with this we could already use 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.210
 any village remember we only have 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.449
 what adjustments 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.610
 where to manage account and add our 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.789
 account and following mind and of 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.700
 key flat applications and delete the 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:41.360
 data this is all a friend 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.360
 Greetings and I hope you go 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.360
 Y
