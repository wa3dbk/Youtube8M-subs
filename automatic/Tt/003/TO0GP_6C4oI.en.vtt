00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.710
 new video on destiny so that's 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.470
 true that I could have a lot of videos 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.060
 on this game the call of duty has advanced from 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.170

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.320
 your sparrows and frankly it's 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.180
 stylish look at you dancing and you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.210
 drive your sparrows as if 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.739
 as if you were sitting on it and so 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.059
