00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.429
 among the many health apps that always 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.750
 the more they make it available to me he says 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.849
 for patients there is one that has us 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.179
 particularly affected it is 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.749
 di woodok that addresses issues 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.279
 gastroenterological we can't do it 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.590
 tell in detail by Dr. 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.210
 vincenzo cennamo in charge of the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.699
 gastroenterology of the bologna Ausl 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.820
 then all what Woodok 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.130
 first murdoch is a system that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.289
 provides an application for patients is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.350
 absolutely free is available either 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.960
 for the play store that also for the iphone 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.300
 is a portal for doctors serves 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.400
 easily remember your symptoms e 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.930
 the therapies that you take and on the other 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.390
 part for the doctor to have a photograph 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.890
 immediate status of the patient without 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 before going into detail then let us 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 tell exactly how it works 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.370
 what does it mean because this name woodok 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.230
 what does budo mean that budo come out 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.820
 because it is a voodoo doll shaped 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.530
 doctor to hear directly 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.270
 your symptoms simply 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.250
 using your own finger exactly 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.339
 as is done with voodoo dolls with 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.960
 a good pin so then we'll see it 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.520
 cent to whom exactly it is addressed 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.710
 they are the patients for whom woodok is 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.780
 was designed 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.749
 woodok to a digital platform in 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.100
 this first launch is realized being 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:18.119
 of a gastroenterologist for patients 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.579
 suffering from diseases 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.140
 therefore gastroenterological patients with 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.439
 Crohn colitis type inflammatory diseases 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 ulcer patients there are then with 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.289
 irritable bowel disorders or 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.409
 reflux disease all together 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.009
 these diseases often affect many 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.229
 our 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.060
 so much so that some of these which 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.189
 reflux, for example, in 40 percent 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.380
 of Italians is present at least 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.270
 episodically then we see in the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.530
 specific what allows you to do at 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.780
 patient she was there a little hinted but 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.920
 let's see in more detail let's say for the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.179
 patient is what matters is 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.850
 application an application a lot 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.069
 simple and fun you need 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.920
 basically to record their own 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.509
 symptoms to record the therapies 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.240
 which are also remembered at 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.030
 patient with alarms and also in 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.369
 case for example of preparation for the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.560
 colonoscopy remembers exactly how 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.440
 follow the often complex preparation 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.690
 for the patient always through gods 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.940
 weapons that are remembered through 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.290
 the iphone or mobile phone 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.050
 and what are the advantages of 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.910
 this system well we expect that 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.250
 from the point of view of symptoms it is a 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.220
 clinical diary very easy to keep 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.870
 that responds immediately to the need 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.210
 of the patient to remember the symptom 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.550
 without having to mark it in the evening with a 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.290
 uncomfortable for him and from the point of view 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.310
 instead of adherence to therapy thanks 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.680
 to these alarms that sound 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.910
 regularly when it is due 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.590
 we take the formulas we expect a 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.600
 improvement in therapeutic adherence 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.540
 that a central theme of ours 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.760
 clinical problems dinners or we pass 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.220
 instead the doctor like the doctor 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.180
 interacts with the up 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.310
 then it is exactly an interaction 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.710
 because the application is for the patient 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:04.890
 instead the doctor must register on 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:06.600
 portal the website www.wfp.org it the code 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.490
 inserted in the patient's home ago 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.470
 so that there is an interface is a 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.750
 direct connection between the two in this 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.550
 so the patient can see all the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.500
 symptoms and time course of the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.239
 symptoms of the patient who gave the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.459
 allowed the doctor to watch them 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.130
 obviously and therapeutic adherence to 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.650
 planet was x xi prescribed by the doctor e 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.880
 the advantages of this interaction 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.250
 medical patient which are which 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.440
 imagine that they are doctor and we have dinner 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.970
 advantages are mainly at the moment 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.590
 of the visit we must remember that 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.750
 this system is not invasive for the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.850
 doctor the doctor checks the patient 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.239
 at the time of the visit not with gods 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.370
 continuous input that it cannot handle in 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.300
 that moment in that moment with a 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.030
 simple click 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.310
 he has the photograph of the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.370
 course of all past months of 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.970
 patient with the flow of wives e 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.560
 therapeutic improvement o 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.390
 worsening and able to cross 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.610
 this data on therapeutic adherence in 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.860
 few words can understand if the patient is 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.660
 was worse because the therapy did not 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.250
 worked or it was worse because 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.470
 is the therapy was not taken 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.120
 correctly that is a central theme from 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.320
 understand all this does not seem to understand 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.300
 that there is also help 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.269
 in the efficiency of the medical examination that 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.220
 unfortunately it is often very small 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.669
 time how it helps the visit 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.239
 medical 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.680
 the av doc system well first of all 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.830
 save the visit time we have 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.960
 a 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.259
 a chronometric medicine unfortunately in 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.599
 30 minutes we need to get medical history to understand 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.120
 what to the patient and also to give the therapies 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.680
 with this system we expect the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.379
 part of anamnesis, that is history 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.659
 of the patient is immediately picked up 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.490
 among other things and there are studies that 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.199
 demonstrate how when you ask a 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.030
 patient directly as he was in 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.490
 last six months he tells you in 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.620
 reality last week and apply it 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.180
 over six months because it is a perception a 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.419
 short term this way instead not 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.659
 we have a recognizable real data e 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.009
 comparable 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.190
 this is from the point of view of privacy 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.110
 Woodok how it behaves and in good standing 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.690
 absolutely yes obviously answers 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.020
 all the regulations in force regarding the 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.539
 time when the patient discharges 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.690
 must already register and must obviously 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:16.020
 give accept the regulation of 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.300
 privacy and more when the connection 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.909
 between the patient with riding the 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.469
 doctor with the portal is carried out there 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.849
 the release of the personal code of the 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.409
 so there was medical realization 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.360
 patient specification on that 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.860
 specific doctor issued another can 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.990
 see that data 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.639
 absolutely not to personal data are 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.039
 obviously protected by everyone 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.210
 the current goodall standards that arises from a 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.060
 beautiful team work he has 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.949
 collaborated on this project 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.690
 then the project was developed 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:46.699
 from project and communication 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.580
 I have followed 4 pinciroli giulia bernabè 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.849
 exactly the whole project 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.289
 mostly they also often 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:58.490
 keeping me very tight on the tracks e 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.110
 I also thank the crossbar but that has us 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.610
 supported with a non-contribution 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.410
 conditioned and above all in the 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.330
 dissemination of the application to all 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.430
 Italian gastroenterologists and also i 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.650
 good doctors we come to the future 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.720
 what how do you think about developing woodok 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.669
 what you have in mind as he said 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.919
 nietzsche doc is not a project 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.680
 specific for the anthropic blunder born 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.569
 as platforms it is obviously inside the 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.370
 I am a gastroenterologist 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.050
 initially addressed patients who 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.060
 however, they have gastroenterological diseases 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.130
 we expect that in the near future it will come 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.590
 expanded to other specialties because it is 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.330
 useful in general as a system in short 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.460
 all with the murdoch doll on the 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.319
 not all but many cell phones a 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.419
 minus all the doctors who fold from 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:42.669
 pain while at home they crush them with 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.669
 finger on their image doll
