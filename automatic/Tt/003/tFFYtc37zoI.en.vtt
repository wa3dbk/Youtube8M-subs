of the cuticle pusher I will also put a
link<00:00:43.100> to<00:00:43.219> where<00:00:43.339> I<00:00:43.460> purchased<00:00:43.760> this<00:00:44.149> as<00:00:44.359> well

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.109

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:50.119 
ok so here you can see that I'm pushing

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.660 
ok so here you can see that I'm pushing
back<00:00:50.299> the<00:00:50.600> epineurium<00:00:51.019> with<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.129> cuticle

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
back the epineurium with the cuticle

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.439 
back the epineurium with the cuticle
pusher<00:00:53.000> it's<00:00:53.869> actually<00:00:54.289> quite<00:00:54.559> blunt<00:00:54.979> but<00:00:55.760> it

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
pusher it's actually quite blunt but it

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.020 
pusher it's actually quite blunt but it
is<00:00:56.629> sharp<00:00:56.899> enough<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.260> bring<00:00:58.189> up<00:00:58.369> those<00:00:58.579> flaky

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
is sharp enough to bring up those flaky

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.619 
is sharp enough to bring up those flaky
bits<00:00:59.210> of<00:00:59.449> cuticle<00:00:59.750> as<00:01:00.079> you<00:01:00.260> can<00:01:00.439> see<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:01.629> from

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
bits of cuticle as you can see I from

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.200 
bits of cuticle as you can see I from
time<00:01:02.839> to<00:01:02.989> time<00:01:03.019> stop<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:03.829> brush<00:01:04.189> them<00:01:04.429> away<00:01:04.699> so

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
time to time stop and brush them away so

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.149 
time to time stop and brush them away so
that<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:05.390> can<00:01:05.750> then<00:01:05.780> go<00:01:06.259> back<00:01:06.289> and<00:01:06.500> work<00:01:06.800> on<00:01:06.979> the

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
that I can then go back and work on the

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.490 
that I can then go back and work on the
area<00:01:07.490> again<00:01:07.640> just<00:01:08.509> so<00:01:08.659> that<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:08.899> can<00:01:09.020> ensure

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
area again just so that I can ensure

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.139 
area again just so that I can ensure
that<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.740> have<00:01:09.950> removed<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.460> all<00:01:10.580> from<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.970> nail

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
that I have removed it all from the nail

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.710 
that I have removed it all from the nail
plate

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.550 

I<00:01:16.520> then<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.730> to<00:01:17.910> use<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> cuticle<00:01:18.660> stone<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
I then like to use the cuticle stone the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
I then like to use the cuticle stone the
reason<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.980> like<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.340> also<00:01:20.550> use<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> find

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
reason I like to also use this is I find

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.750 
reason I like to also use this is I find
that<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.140> very<00:01:22.260> good<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.250> into<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
that it's very good to get into the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.390 
that it's very good to get into the
corners<00:01:24.120> and<00:01:24.330> down<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> sidewalls

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
corners and down the sidewalls

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.190 
corners and down the sidewalls
I<00:01:26.460> did<00:01:26.910> a<00:01:26.940> pretty<00:01:27.180> thorough<00:01:27.450> job<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.050> could

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
I did a pretty thorough job as you could

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.710 
I did a pretty thorough job as you could
see<00:01:28.440> with<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.710> cuticle<00:01:29.250> pusher<00:01:29.700> however<00:01:30.480> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
see with the cuticle pusher however the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.410 
see with the cuticle pusher however the
cuticle<00:01:31.200> stone<00:01:31.560> does<00:01:32.400> still<00:01:32.760> manage<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.120> bring

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
cuticle stone does still manage to bring

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
cuticle stone does still manage to bring
up<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.720> lot<00:01:33.870> of<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.200> cuticle<00:01:34.830> that's<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.370> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
up a lot of that cuticle that's on the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.690 
up a lot of that cuticle that's on the
nail<00:01:35.670> plate

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.160 

you<00:01:40.700> only<00:01:40.850> need<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.120> be<00:01:41.390> gentle<00:01:41.660> I'm<00:01:42.020> not

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
you only need to be gentle I'm not

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.620 
you only need to be gentle I'm not
applying<00:01:42.470> much<00:01:42.800> pressure<00:01:43.190> at<00:01:43.430> all<00:01:43.630> you

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
applying much pressure at all you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.330 
applying much pressure at all you
obviously<00:01:45.140> don't<00:01:45.320> want<00:01:45.440> to<00:01:45.650> hurt<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.100> client

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
obviously don't want to hurt the client

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.430 
obviously don't want to hurt the client
and<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.920> does<00:01:49.190> work<00:01:49.670> effectively<00:01:50.180> if<00:01:50.660> you<00:01:51.050> are

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
and it does work effectively if you are

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:01.910 
and it does work effectively if you are
using<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.010> right<00:01:52.190> technique

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.490 

here<00:02:02.580> I'm<00:02:02.700> actually<00:02:02.850> using<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.659> pointy<00:02:04.259> end

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
here I'm actually using the pointy end

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.890 
here I'm actually using the pointy end
of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> cuticle<00:02:05.189> pusher<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.729> remove<00:02:06.270> bits<00:02:06.689> of

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
of the cuticle pusher to remove bits of

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.779 
of the cuticle pusher to remove bits of
cuticle<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.770> stuck<00:02:08.069> underneath<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
cuticle that have stuck underneath the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.210 
cuticle that have stuck underneath the
epineurium<00:02:09.319> I'm<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.530> actually<00:02:10.679> digging

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
epineurium I'm not actually digging

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.020 
epineurium I'm not actually digging
under<00:02:11.870> harshly<00:02:12.870> or<00:02:13.230> very<00:02:14.160> far<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.819> being

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
under harshly or very far and being

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.809 
under harshly or very far and being
quite<00:02:15.270> gentle<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.050> very<00:02:16.610> mindful<00:02:17.610> not<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
quite gentle and very mindful not to

00:02:17.819 --> 00:03:34.050 
quite gentle and very mindful not to
push<00:02:18.239> too<00:02:18.270> far<00:02:18.690> underneath

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.699 

here<00:03:35.060> I'm<00:03:35.150> using<00:03:35.180> my<00:03:35.629> cuticle<00:03:36.140> nippers<00:03:36.440> to

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
here I'm using my cuticle nippers to

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.830 
here I'm using my cuticle nippers to
actually<00:03:37.310> cut<00:03:37.489> off<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.640> piece<00:03:37.909> of<00:03:38.120> cuticle<00:03:38.450> that

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
actually cut off a piece of cuticle that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.140 
actually cut off a piece of cuticle that
I<00:03:39.110> couldn't<00:03:39.470> remove<00:03:39.739> with<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.430> cuticle

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
I couldn't remove with the cuticle

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.800 
I couldn't remove with the cuticle
