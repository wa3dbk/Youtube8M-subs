okay<00:00:01.290> guys<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.530> just<00:00:01.829> make<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.250> very<00:00:02.550> short<00:00:02.610> video

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay guys I just make a very short video

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.909 
okay guys I just make a very short video
about<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.580> battery<00:00:05.580> voltage<00:00:05.910> monitor<00:00:06.420> I

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919 
about this battery voltage monitor I

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.160 
about this battery voltage monitor I
wanted<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.040> show<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.540> original

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
wanted to show you this is the original

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.060 
wanted to show you this is the original
one<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.559> first<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.250> got<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:12.889> as<00:00:13.889> you

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
one the first one that I got and as you

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.870 
one the first one that I got and as you
can<00:00:14.219> see<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.639> LCD<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.719> quite<00:00:16.020> deep<00:00:16.640> it<00:00:17.640> was

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
can see the LCD is quite deep it was

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.250 
can see the LCD is quite deep it was
brighter<00:00:18.210> at<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> beginning<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.050> after

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
brighter at the beginning but after

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.740 
brighter at the beginning but after
maybe<00:00:20.160> no<00:00:20.430> more<00:00:20.640> than<00:00:20.820> 30<00:00:21.090> hours<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:22.250> using<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
maybe no more than 30 hours of using it

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
maybe no more than 30 hours of using it
the<00:00:24.750> backlight<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.680> quite<00:00:26.070> thin<00:00:26.340> right<00:00:26.849> now

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the backlight is quite thin right now

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.150 
the backlight is quite thin right now
and<00:00:27.300> also<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.170> power<00:00:28.410> consumption<00:00:28.859> it's

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and also the power consumption it's

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.730 
and also the power consumption it's
quite<00:00:30.029> right

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
quite right

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.319 
quite right
you<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:32.300> 31.5<00:00:33.300> milliamps<00:00:34.079> which<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:35.329> really

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
you see 31.5 milliamps which is really

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.229 
you see 31.5 milliamps which is really
highlighting<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.760> especially<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:38.969> small

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
highlighting for especially for small

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.380 
highlighting for especially for small
batteries<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.850> because<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.030> it's

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
batteries it will because it's it's

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.369 
batteries it will because it's it's
using<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.309> only<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> first<00:00:44.700> two<00:00:44.910> cells<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
using the only the first two cells to to

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.100 
using the only the first two cells to to
take<00:00:46.559> power<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.239> also<00:00:48.239> has<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> linear

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
take power and also has a linear

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.860 
take power and also has a linear
regulator<00:00:49.410> inside<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.579> everything<00:00:51.420> runs

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
regulator inside so it everything runs

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.010 
regulator inside so it everything runs
only<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.379> three<00:00:52.710> volt<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.629> quite

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
only at three volt it so it's quite

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.450 
only at three volt it so it's quite
wasteful<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:58.320> will<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.070> other

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
wasteful but you will see on this other

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.869 
wasteful but you will see on this other
one<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.090> modified<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.579> slower

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
one that I modified it is a bit slower

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
one that I modified it is a bit slower
because<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.449> running<00:01:03.719> at<00:01:04.019> four<00:01:04.949> megahertz

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
because it's running at four megahertz

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.880 
because it's running at four megahertz
instead<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.210> 16<00:01:06.840> megahertz<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.439> four<00:01:07.740> times

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
instead of 16 megahertz so four times

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.380 
instead of 16 megahertz so four times
slower<00:01:08.960> but<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.979> using<00:01:11.670> way

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
slower but as you can see is using way

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410 
slower but as you can see is using way
less<00:01:12.630> forward<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.619> also<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.790> modified

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
less forward and also what I modified

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.649 
less forward and also what I modified
that<00:01:16.409> use<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> most<00:01:17.610> power<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> backlight

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that use the most power is the backlight

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.140 
that use the most power is the backlight
and<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.490> notice<00:01:20.549> but

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and I don't know if you can notice but

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.070 
and I don't know if you can notice but
this<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.170> brighter<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:24.869> will

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
this this one is brighter and it will

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.740 
this this one is brighter and it will
stay<00:01:25.320> brighter<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:25.979> way<00:01:26.640> longer<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
stay brighter for way longer because the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.170 
stay brighter for way longer because the
backlight<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:28.380> uses<00:01:28.950> only<00:01:29.220> about<00:01:29.700> five

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
backlight now uses only about five

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.630 
backlight now uses only about five
millions<00:01:30.770> compared<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.430> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
millions compared with this one that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.679 
millions compared with this one that
used<00:01:33.770> fifteen<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:35.180> or<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.540> millions<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
used fifteen or or more millions and

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.950 
used fifteen or or more millions and
because<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> reduced<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:41.960> microcontroller

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
because I reduced the microcontroller

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
because I reduced the microcontroller
o'clock<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:45.409> four<00:01:46.409> megahertz

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
o'clock to four megahertz

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.710 
o'clock to four megahertz
I<00:01:47.909> also<00:01:49.549> reduce<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.759> power<00:01:50.939> consumption<00:01:51.390> with

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I also reduce the power consumption with

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.609 
I also reduce the power consumption with
about<00:01:52.020> five<00:01:52.439> millions<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.110> now<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.290> using

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
about five millions so now it's using

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.850 
about five millions so now it's using
only<00:01:55.850> 12.5<00:01:56.850> million<00:01:57.060> millions<00:01:57.719> which<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.229> much

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
only 12.5 million millions which is much

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.630 
only 12.5 million millions which is much
better<00:01:59.119> than<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.630> original<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:04.610> okay<00:02:05.610> so

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
better than the original one okay so

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.089 
better than the original one okay so
this<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.479> modified<00:02:07.259> one

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
this is the modified one

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.220 
this is the modified one
as<00:02:10.099> you<00:02:10.310> can<00:02:10.459> see<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.970> main<00:02:11.569> clock<00:02:11.870> it's<00:02:12.080> no

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
as you can see the main clock it's no

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.570 
as you can see the main clock it's no
four<00:02:12.620> megahertz<00:02:13.099> instead<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.239> 16<00:02:14.810> megahertz

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
four megahertz instead of 16 megahertz

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.339 
four megahertz instead of 16 megahertz
and<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.390> microcontroller<00:02:17.900> it's<00:02:18.260> a

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
and this is the microcontroller it's a

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.460 
and this is the microcontroller it's a
microchip<00:02:18.739> with<00:02:19.220> some<00:02:20.060> custom<00:02:20.660> chip<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.140> think

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
microchip with some custom chip I think

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.229 
microchip with some custom chip I think
that<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:21.920> can<00:02:22.099> only<00:02:22.129> find<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.879> Chinese

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
that you can only find on the Chinese

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.559 
that you can only find on the Chinese
market<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.890> 16<00:02:25.430> F<00:02:25.640> something<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.330> don't

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
market but it's a 16 F something I don't

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.750 
market but it's a 16 F something I don't
remember<00:02:27.019> exactly<00:02:27.500> again<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.129> can<00:02:28.310> find<00:02:28.519> it

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
remember exactly again you can find it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.100 
remember exactly again you can find it
if<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.780> are<00:02:29.950> familiar<00:02:30.950> with<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.430> microchip<00:02:32.110> and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
if you are familiar with a microchip and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.710 
if you are familiar with a microchip and
these<00:02:33.470> two<00:02:33.739> are<00:02:33.920> quad<00:02:34.549> amplifiers<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:35.660> you

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
these two are quad amplifiers so you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.190 
these two are quad amplifiers so you
have<00:02:35.989> eight<00:02:36.819> op<00:02:37.819> amps<00:02:38.239> here<00:02:39.160> used<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.760> measure

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
have eight op amps here used to measure

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.460 
have eight op amps here used to measure
individual<00:02:42.200> cells<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:44.569> one<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.230> nothing

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
individual cells and this one is nothing

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.720 
individual cells and this one is nothing
written<00:02:45.799> on<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:47.769> it's<00:02:48.769> probably<00:02:49.310> further

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.240 
written on it but it's probably further
displayed<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:53.260> there's<00:02:54.260> nothing<00:02:54.500> much<00:02:55.040> in

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
displayed so there's nothing much in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.490 
displayed so there's nothing much in
here<00:02:55.459> but<00:02:55.610> since<00:02:56.299> when<00:02:56.690> well-built

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500

backlight is this 5 ohm here it's a
small<00:03:12.530> SMD<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.340> think<00:03:13.700> it's<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:14.000> 6<00:03:14.329> or<00:03:14.450> 3<00:03:14.510> or<00:03:14.900> I

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.620 
small SMD I think it's a 6 or 3 or I
don't<00:03:15.230> know<00:03:15.319> exactly<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.549> since<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.569> don't

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
don't know exactly and since I don't

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.220 
don't know exactly and since I don't
have<00:03:17.900> these<00:03:18.079> small<00:03:18.440> SM<00:03:18.769> DS<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.870> used<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:21.049> large

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
have these small SM DS I used a large

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.089

truffle<00:03:22.160> resistant<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.150> 68<00:03:23.660> ohm<00:03:24.290> resistor

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
truffle resistant it's a 68 ohm resistor

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.150

and<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.180> serious<00:03:26.720> with<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.959> 5<00:03:27.440> ohm<00:03:27.650> one<00:03:27.889> so

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
and this is serious with a 5 ohm one so

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.849 
and this is serious with a 5 ohm one so
it's<00:03:28.370> about<00:03:28.780> 673<00:03:29.780> or<00:03:30.230> something<00:03:30.560> like<00:03:30.650> that

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
it's about 673 or something like that

should<00:04:32.050> be<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.620> good<00:04:33.430> thing<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.910> is<00:04:37.060> all<00:04:37.270> also

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
should be a good thing this is all also

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.420 
should be a good thing this is all also
the<00:04:39.460> fact<00:04:39.730> that<00:04:39.850> you<00:04:39.940> reduced<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:41.110> current<00:04:41.950> to

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
the fact that you reduced the current to

in very short time you it will be used

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.380 
in very short time you it will be used
useless<00:05:28.570> but<00:05:28.870> if<00:05:29.740> it's<00:05:30.010> already<00:05:30.640> damaged<00:05:31.120> you

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
useless but if it's already damaged you

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.110 
useless but if it's already damaged you
can<00:05:32.170> probably<00:05:32.440> replace<00:05:33.100> it<00:05:33.310> with<00:05:33.490> any<00:05:34.000> other

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
can probably replace it with any other

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.490 
can probably replace it with any other
LEDs<00:05:35.340> you<00:05:36.340> need<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.520> small<00:05:36.880> one<00:05:37.090> but<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:38.320> can

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
LEDs you need a small one but you can

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.550 
LEDs you need a small one but you can
use<00:05:38.710> any<00:05:38.950> any<00:05:39.400> other<00:05:39.670> LED<00:05:40.150> in<00:05:40.480> there<00:05:40.750> so<00:05:41.350> yes

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
use any any other LED in there so yes

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.860 
use any any other LED in there so yes
for<00:05:41.800> $12<00:05:42.670> I<00:05:43.000> really<00:05:43.300> recommend<00:05:43.870> this<00:05:44.610> battery

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
for $12 I really recommend this battery

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.350 
for $12 I really recommend this battery
voltage<00:05:46.870> monitor<00:05:47.350> but<00:05:48.010> you<00:05:48.250> just<00:05:48.520> need<00:05:48.730> to<00:05:48.880> fix

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
voltage monitor but you just need to fix

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.790 
voltage monitor but you just need to fix
them<00:05:49.660> especially<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:51.070> LED<00:05:51.400> backlight

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
them especially the LED backlight

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.170 
them especially the LED backlight
running<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.950> microcontroller<00:05:54.430> slower<00:05:55.000> it's

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
running the microcontroller slower it's

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.440 
running the microcontroller slower it's
not<00:05:55.600> really<00:05:56.170> necessary<00:05:56.920> you<00:05:57.490> save<00:05:57.790> about<00:05:57.970> five

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
not really necessary you save about five

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.830 
not really necessary you save about five
millions<00:05:58.900> but<00:05:59.760> largest<00:06:00.760> savings<00:06:00.970> of<00:06:01.450> around

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
millions but largest savings of around

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.090 
millions but largest savings of around
the<00:06:01.990> backlight<00:06:02.410> and<00:06:02.650> you<00:06:03.340> also<00:06:04.560> help<00:06:05.560> the

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
the backlight and you also help the

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.580 
the backlight and you also help the
brake<00:06:06.460> light<00:06:06.760> work<00:06:07.210> for<00:06:07.540> much<00:06:08.140> longer<00:06:08.350> than

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
brake light work for much longer than

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.210 
brake light work for much longer than
just<00:06:08.830> a<00:06:09.640> few<00:06:10.480> hours<00:06:13.590> this<00:06:14.590> is<00:06:14.710> a<00:06:14.770> good<00:06:14.950> device

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
just a few hours this is a good device

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.390 
just a few hours this is a good device
it's<00:06:15.490> quite<00:06:15.820> accurate<00:06:16.060> I<00:06:16.690> have<00:06:17.680> two<00:06:18.010> of<00:06:18.130> them

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
it's quite accurate I have two of them

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.440 
it's quite accurate I have two of them
and<00:06:18.840> both<00:06:19.840> seems<00:06:20.410> to<00:06:20.710> be<00:06:20.860> quite<00:06:21.610> accurate<00:06:21.850> at

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
and both seems to be quite accurate at

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.600 
and both seems to be quite accurate at
least<00:06:23.490> I<00:06:24.690> have<00:06:25.690> two<00:06:25.960> digits<00:06:26.380> that<00:06:26.650> are<00:06:26.710> for<00:06:27.400> for

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
least I have two digits that are for for

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.430 
least I have two digits that are for for
accurate<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.210> last<00:06:28.420> digit<00:06:28.810> maybe<00:06:28.990> not<00:06:29.230> so

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
accurate the last digit maybe not so

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.480 
accurate the last digit maybe not so
accurate<00:06:29.620> but<00:06:30.630> you<00:06:31.630> don't<00:06:31.870> find<00:06:32.170> too<00:06:33.070> many<00:06:33.220> of

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
accurate but you don't find too many of

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.129 
accurate but you don't find too many of
these<00:06:33.700> that<00:06:33.940> have<00:06:34.320> traded<00:06:35.320> it

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
these that have traded it

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.879 
these that have traded it
resolution<00:06:36.860> so<00:06:38.439> it<00:06:39.439> really<00:06:40.099> is<00:06:40.249> a<00:06:40.729> useful

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
resolution so it really is a useful

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:44.890 
resolution so it really is a useful
