which<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.179> just<00:01:03.390> drawn<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.749> with<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.929> black

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
which is just drawn out with a black

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.030 
which is just drawn out with a black
magic<00:01:04.500> marker<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:06.050> you're<00:01:07.050> going<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.680> draw

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
magic marker and you're going to draw

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.190 
magic marker and you're going to draw
the<00:01:08.100> outline<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.060> chocolate<00:01:09.270> fill<00:01:10.080> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the outline of it in chocolate fill it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.440 
the outline of it in chocolate fill it
in<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:11.340> okay<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.909> rough<00:01:12.119> looking

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
in and it's okay if it's rough looking

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.899 
in and it's okay if it's rough looking
because<00:01:12.689> moose<00:01:13.649> antlers<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.340> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.729> rough

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
because moose antlers are kind of rough

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.810 
because moose antlers are kind of rough
anyway<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.659> gives<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.460> realistic<00:01:17.460> kind<00:01:17.729> of

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
anyway so it gives it realistic kind of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.750 
anyway so it gives it realistic kind of
a<00:01:17.880> look<00:01:19.280> just<00:01:20.280> fill<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.640> in

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.400 

now<00:01:25.760> this<00:01:25.910> is<00:01:26.030> about<00:01:26.180> three<00:01:26.420> inches<00:01:26.450> long<00:01:26.900> by

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
now this is about three inches long by

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.610 
now this is about three inches long by
about<00:01:27.950> two<00:01:28.640> inches<00:01:29.150> wide<00:01:29.600> just<00:01:30.230> give<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:30.560> an

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
about two inches wide just give you an

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.470 
about two inches wide just give you an
idea<00:01:30.860> about<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.220> measurements<00:01:31.730> that<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.330> can

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
idea about the measurements that you can

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.790 
idea about the measurements that you can
make<00:01:32.600> them<00:01:32.720> any<00:01:32.780> size<00:01:33.110> or<00:01:33.290> shape<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:33.680> you

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
make them any size or shape that you

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
want put those in the refrigerator to

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.220 
want put those in the refrigerator to
cool<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:37.340> Harden<00:01:37.730> put<00:01:38.300> more<00:01:38.630> chocolate<00:01:38.900> icing

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
cool and Harden put more chocolate icing

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.170 
cool and Harden put more chocolate icing
in<00:01:39.470> a<00:01:39.530> bowl<00:01:39.710> melted<00:01:40.280> in<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.460> microwave<00:01:40.490> for

in a bowl melted in the microwave for
about<00:01:41.360> 20<00:01:41.840> seconds<00:01:42.310> until<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.520> gets<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
about 20 seconds until it gets the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.730 
about 20 seconds until it gets the
consistency<00:01:44.540> of<00:01:44.750> lightly<00:01:44.960> whipped<00:01:45.260> cream<00:01:45.530> or

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
melted ice cream and it'll still coat a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.720 
melted ice cream and it'll still coat a
spoon<00:01:49.280> but<00:01:49.580> it'll<00:01:49.910> flow<00:01:50.450> freely<00:01:51.460> as<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:52.580> can

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
you're going to dunk it in right up to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.240 
you're going to dunk it in right up to
the<00:01:57.650> edge<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.250> cupcake<00:01:58.460> paper<00:02:00.130> so<00:02:01.130> it's
