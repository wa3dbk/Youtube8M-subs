00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
output as the MG's which might be a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.260

problem<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.490> guitar<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.000> as<00:02:06.149> you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
problem with this guitar because as you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.950 
problem with this guitar because as you
can<00:02:06.420> tell<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> back<00:02:07.140> there<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.560> no

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
can tell on the back there is no

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.320 
can tell on the back there is no
back<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.460> it's<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.030> straight<00:02:11.390> with<00:02:12.310> so

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
back to it it's just straight with so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.350 
back to it it's just straight with so
they<00:02:14.330> would<00:02:14.600> probably<00:02:14.870> have<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:16.060> cut<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.090> hole

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
they would probably have to cut a hole

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.600 
they would probably have to cut a hole
in<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.810> or<00:02:17.990> they<00:02:18.380> might<00:02:18.590> put<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.190> where<00:02:19.340> you

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
in it or they might put it to where you

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.060
