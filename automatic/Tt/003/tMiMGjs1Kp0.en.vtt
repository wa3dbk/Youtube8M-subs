00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.279

looking<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> Coleman<00:00:21.119> exponent<00:00:22.050> tent

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
looking at the Coleman exponent tent

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.400 
looking at the Coleman exponent tent
this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.369> called<00:00:23.579> the<00:00:23.700> AV<00:00:23.939> or<00:00:24.270> x2<00:00:26.390> it's

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
advertised as a two-man tent but I'd say

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.430

it's<00:00:31.860> a<00:00:31.950> one-man<00:00:32.250> tent<00:00:32.489> realistically<00:00:33.440> one

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
which basically allow air to circulate

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.410 
which basically allow air to circulate
inside<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.580> tent<00:02:45.820> so<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.120> don't<00:02:46.300> get<00:02:46.360> any

well<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.020> just<00:03:07.050> done<00:03:07.350> here<00:03:07.560> basically<00:03:10.130> all

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
well it's just done here basically all

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.500 
well it's just done here basically all
right<00:03:11.250> another<00:03:11.550> good<00:03:11.790> thing<00:03:11.820> about<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.240> tent

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
right another good thing about this tent

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.250 
right another good thing about this tent
is<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.960> it<00:03:13.020> has<00:03:13.170> two<00:03:13.410> doors<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.990> bad

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
is that it has two doors so in bad

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.770 
is that it has two doors so in bad
weather<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:17.520> trick<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:17.970> enter<00:03:18.270> food.if

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
weather the trick is you enter food.if

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.180 
weather the trick is you enter food.if
door<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:20.780> inside<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.020> have<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.200> grand<00:03:22.560> Qi<00:03:22.800> area

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
door and inside you have a grand Qi area

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.680 
door and inside you have a grand Qi area
where<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.760> keep<00:03:23.910> your<00:03:23.970> boots<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.540> other

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
where you can keep your boots and other

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.290 
where you can keep your boots and other
stuff<00:03:25.010> as<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.220> see<00:03:26.400> there<00:03:28.610> so<00:03:29.610> that's<00:03:29.790> that's

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
stuff as you see there so that's that's

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.960 
stuff as you see there so that's that's
the<00:03:30.510> smaller<00:03:30.840> that's<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.560> smaller<00:03:31.860> door<00:03:34.970> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
the smaller that's the smaller door and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.070 
the smaller that's the smaller door and
then<00:03:36.120> as<00:03:36.240> in<00:03:36.390> comment<00:03:36.810> here<00:03:38.030> there's<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.120> longer

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
then as in comment here there's a longer

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.520 
then as in comment here there's a longer
door<00:03:41.090> which<00:03:42.090> essentially<00:03:42.720> runs<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.380> length

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
door which essentially runs the length

00:03:43.530 --> 00:04:02.060 
door which essentially runs the length
of<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:44.040> side<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.430> tent<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:01.470> as<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:01.920> can

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
of the side of the tent so as you can

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.430 
of the side of the tent so as you can
see<00:04:02.990> there's<00:04:03.990> another<00:04:04.170> door<00:04:04.500> here<00:04:05.870> I'm<00:04:06.870> enough

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
see there's another door here I'm enough

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.650 
see there's another door here I'm enough
on<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.250> inner<00:04:08.490> tent<00:04:09.680> unzips<00:04:10.680> right<00:04:10.980> here<00:04:13.010> and

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
on the inner tent unzips right here and

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.060 
on the inner tent unzips right here and
you<00:04:15.660> have<00:04:15.720> your<00:04:15.840> side<00:04:16.140> entry<00:04:16.530> which<00:04:16.859> just

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
you have your side entry which just

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.810 
you have your side entry which just
makes<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.370> easier<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.880> get<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.330> and<00:04:18.480> out<00:04:18.660> of

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
makes it easier to get in and out of

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.710 
makes it easier to get in and out of
unless<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:21.030> know<00:04:21.180> there's<00:04:21.510> bad<00:04:21.690> weather

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
unless you know there's bad weather

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:31.180 
unless you know there's bad weather
basically<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:30.030> yeah<00:04:30.240> that's<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.630> side<00:04:30.840> door

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
basically so yeah that's the side door

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.230 
basically so yeah that's the side door
obviously<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.310> benefit<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.790> having<00:04:32.910> two

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
obviously the benefit of having two

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.750 
obviously the benefit of having two
doors<00:04:33.480> is<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:34.710> know<00:04:34.800> if<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.040> weather<00:04:35.190> changes

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
doors is you know if the weather changes

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.340 
doors is you know if the weather changes
or<00:04:35.790> there's<00:04:36.120> changing<00:04:36.450> wind<00:04:36.630> directions<00:04:36.750> you

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
or there's changing wind directions you

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.640 
or there's changing wind directions you
can<00:04:37.500> eat<00:04:37.650> use<00:04:38.190> each<00:04:38.370> one<00:04:38.400> appropriately<00:04:39.650> also

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
can eat use each one appropriately also

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.710 
can eat use each one appropriately also

another reason I chose this tent is

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.009 
another reason I chose this tent is
because<00:06:48.039> of<00:06:48.159> the<00:06:48.249> pack<00:06:48.459> size<00:06:48.669> I<00:06:49.029> mean<00:06:49.869> it's

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:50.019 
because of the pack size I mean it's

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.779 
because of the pack size I mean it's
really<00:06:50.169> small<00:06:50.559> packs<00:06:51.339> down<00:06:51.579> -<00:06:53.189> Wow<00:06:54.219> I<00:06:54.519> think

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
really small packs down - Wow I think

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.269 
really small packs down - Wow I think
it's<00:06:54.939> 40<00:06:55.419> by<00:06:55.689> 16<00:06:56.259> centimeters<00:06:56.919> or<00:06:56.979> something

00:06:57.269 --> 00:06:57.279 
it's 40 by 16 centimeters or something

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:59.579 
it's 40 by 16 centimeters or something
like<00:06:57.369> this<00:06:57.579> so<00:06:57.849> it<00:06:58.240> fits<00:06:58.479> very<00:06:58.599> snugly<00:06:59.229> into
