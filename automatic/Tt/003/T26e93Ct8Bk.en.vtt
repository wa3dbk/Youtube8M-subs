00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:14.330
 U 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:28.000
 Thank you. 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:42.350
 Now I have two sketch lan to draw the same mine . 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:47.120
 The one on the left is the dry denim. 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:52.489
 Things come out very quickly and can be drawn simply because the water is missing 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.530
 Because it is partly comfortable , from now on, once I put the belt on it, 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:01.530
 Next, 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:03.570
 Using the tips of the blue, wide maca, I'm making a new color right away. 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.810
 character 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.780
 All in all, how do I get the seven colors? The black contours and the maca 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.850
 I left a little space between the colors 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 Also that if the end of the seven are almost never forgot the black outline of the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.690
 So does it look dark and express what line of clothing outline 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.410
 To emphasize the silhouette 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:34.050
 I'm treating it with a slight margin left. 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:39.090
 As you can see now, if I use a broad tip to quickly color 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:44.369
 Time can be reduced, and there is another bold expression. 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.050
 I'm very scared , so I use a little tip to draw a bit 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.880
 Resolved. 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:55.170
 Bold and draw. Now, dry dime. 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.240
 It's basically a little slick in that list. 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.630
 Covered parts Next wrinkled part Knee part 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.399
 What are some of those and now 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:15.290
 However, the overall difference in contrast is so dramatic 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:18.570
 But I'm still expressing it to give a little sense of reality . 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:24.480
 I'm seeing it filled. 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.620
 Also , the legs on the back are a little darker, 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.140
 To do 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.150
 Well 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.150
 I think he will be on his side. 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.090
 It's all over now . 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.590
 This would have been the case there would just not going to the cotton pants is distinguished by a flat way 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.630
 Movie Girard 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.930
 So now we move on to the next step in expressing Dan's power 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.680
 There is 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:03:00.960
 White colored pencil basically that fly Zip stick in the zipper part 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:06.240
 I'm using cheese, and if you 're like jeans, 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.340
 So much so that you can express it with a white pencil. 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.560
 It's very effective. 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:21.060
 Here, but not much, but I have radeunga part crease mark these parts 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:26.190
 Then a line at an angle diagonal to fit the lock quickly now with a line 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.820
 You knew a draw seosaengmyeon to avoid sharp pencil is because they do not know yet 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:35.670
 In the middle of it, 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:41.460
 In Can simyeon that a gold wire 2 when the yarn end to the blunt is nameumyeon 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:48.060
 I can not feel it fast because I play so much in the eye 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.530
 A frantic as sharp lines in the end area at regular intervals and a constant pressure 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.860
 You can. 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:58.340
 Now it's almost finished as a whole. 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.340
 I can not see it from a distance, but I feel a lot of denim in close proximity. 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.920
 U 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.920
 Thank you. 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.890
 we
