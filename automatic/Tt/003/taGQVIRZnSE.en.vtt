00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 hey people what's up I'm so first and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.640
 I have a short intro video for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410
 you and that again that's me today 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.750
 a little late at night 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.050
 uploaded videos but today was 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.560
 extremely fat weather with us and me 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 had a very beautiful girl 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.590
 asked if I was not what they me 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.809
 and of course I could 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.420
 Do not say no because she is one too 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.370
 really very good friend of mine but 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.890
 that now synonymous first and anyway in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.410
 this video is about it and that ms 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.590
 are information about a dlc against 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 and indeed to a zombie dlc I dazzle 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.039
 you ever grad man in the background 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.750
 photo 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.140
 I first thought that we were capable and so 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.920
 because left is just gta below 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.299
 then stands dead and right trevor this 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.340
 city ​​and that means just that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.680
 or that means half 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.420
 that come a zombie glc as I can 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.860
 again briefly explain why and indeed 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.750
 im a hacker called chrome xj who has 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.060
 that found out and that comes 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.360
 then the 1000 source code 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.299
 certain things found and could 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.390
 then create this picture of it 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.610
 what looks in the background and indeed falls 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.799
 for those people the chrome x-mas 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.869
 I do not know his again 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.380
 left channel description of the same applies 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.610
 as gta clou the programmed already very much 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.220
 long and has also once from the mod 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.899
 I think he develops menus for gta 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.180
 was even the first one for that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.070
 He has developed something for everyone 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.399
 case of rockstar worked as far as i did 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.680
 knows and if he says that then should 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.329
 that's right 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:07.740
 and what is close now 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:10.550
 or why that's really true 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.670
 100 percent is even likely 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.720
 during the day came more 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.750
 I will inform you now 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.730
 just in the picture here a blender 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.040
 You will not do anything with it 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.430
 but that is from the source code 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.940
 from gta the fur he found and in it 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.000
 probably that dlc is really 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.100
 will come and that only once for a 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.280
 single clarifies for multiplayer is it stop 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.250
 not yet confirmed but we can 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.910
 wait to see if that in the next few days 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.940
 or in the next time 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.980
 follow more info or until then 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.170
 stop someday or release 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.570
 Rockstar announced like that once 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.880
 that comes naturally as always 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.030
 unconfirmed information but something 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.710
 crooked xj says that's almost true 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.470
 always because he has been there for a long time 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.170
 and I would definitely mega 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.690
 geil find the zombie dc fucking no preference 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.960
 whether in single player or multiplayer 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.630
 zombies in always really cool 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.010
 and yes, we can already 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.110
 I wanted to be curious here 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.200
 Just let me know about this 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.910
 theme, as always, if of course, 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.680
 get newer information or 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.380
 Of course, I will get it right away 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.550
