this nice display we'll talk more about

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.469 
this nice display we'll talk more about
in<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> second<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.790> ahead<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.000> open<00:01:12.390> all

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
in a second if I go ahead and open all

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.730 
in a second if I go ahead and open all
of<00:01:12.600> my<00:01:12.689> different<00:01:12.869> apps<00:01:13.229> I've<00:01:13.409> got<00:01:13.560> running

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
of my different apps I've got running

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.210 
of my different apps I've got running
I've<00:01:14.130> had<00:01:14.369> these<00:01:14.549> running<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.210> days<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
I've had these running for days and it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.070 
I've had these running for days and it
seems<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.700> hold<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.210> well<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.509> it's

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
seems to hold up pretty well so it's

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.219 
seems to hold up pretty well so it's
pretty<00:01:19.259> fast<00:01:19.619> keep<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.369> these<00:01:20.520> running

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
pretty fast keep all these running

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.899 
pretty fast keep all these running
everything<00:01:22.229> seems<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.920> remain<00:01:23.189> snappy<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
everything seems to remain snappy so I

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.760 
everything seems to remain snappy so I
can't<00:01:24.210> really<00:01:24.330> complain<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
can't really complain there and for a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.859 
can't really complain there and for a
budget<00:01:25.979> phone<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.790> more<00:01:27.150> than<00:01:27.299> adequate<00:01:27.720> in

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
budget phone it's more than adequate in

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.420 
budget phone it's more than adequate in
my<00:01:28.290> testing<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:28.860> we'll<00:01:29.009> talk<00:01:29.159> more<00:01:29.369> about

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
my testing but we'll talk more about

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
my testing but we'll talk more about
that<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> moment<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.540> display<00:01:30.900> itself<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that in a moment the display itself is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.890 
that in a moment the display itself is
pretty<00:01:31.799> nice<00:01:32.009> now<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.490> you've<00:01:32.700> come<00:01:33.509> from<00:01:33.689> some

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
pretty nice now if you've come from some

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480 
pretty nice now if you've come from some
of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> higher<00:01:34.259> resolution<00:01:34.530> displays<00:01:35.280> you'll

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
of the higher resolution displays you'll

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
of the higher resolution displays you'll
probably<00:01:35.700> notice<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> five

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
probably notice it but this is a five

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.609 
probably notice it but this is a five
inch<00:01:37.619> 720p<00:01:38.009> display<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:39.210> IPS<00:01:39.689> LCD<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.439> has

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
inch 720p display it's IPS LCD and has

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.880 
inch 720p display it's IPS LCD and has
294<00:01:41.579> pixels<00:01:42.000> per<00:01:42.150> inch<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.960> basically<00:01:43.439> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
294 pixels per inch so basically it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280 
294 pixels per inch so basically it's
the<00:01:43.979> equivalent<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.700> say<00:01:45.149> an<00:01:45.210> iPhone<00:01:45.600> 6<00:01:46.020> that's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the equivalent of say an iPhone 6 that's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.609 
the equivalent of say an iPhone 6 that's
a<00:01:46.439> 720p<00:01:47.130> display<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.020> bad<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.530> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
display and it's actually the brightness

display and it's actually the brightness
is<00:01:56.369> turned<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> way<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.170> auto

is turned all the way up and I have auto
brightness<00:01:58.590> off<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.090> brightness<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.570> all

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
brightness off so the brightness is all

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the way up it is pretty good in sunlight

the way up it is pretty good in sunlight
but<00:02:02.579> inside<00:02:03.299> under<00:02:03.600> these<00:02:03.719> bright<00:02:03.990> lights

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
but inside under these bright lights

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.810 
but inside under these bright lights
it's<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.590> little<00:02:04.799> harder<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.640> there's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it's a little harder to see but there's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.029 
it's a little harder to see but there's
a<00:02:05.880> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.210> an<00:02:06.329> air<00:02:06.540> gap<00:02:06.719> here<00:02:07.110> where<00:02:07.799> it

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
a little bit of an air gap here where it

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.529 
a little bit of an air gap here where it
just<00:02:08.190> seems<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.700> screen<00:02:08.970> set<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
just seems like the screen set back a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.330 
just seems like the screen set back a
little<00:02:09.780> bit<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> budget<00:02:10.800> phone<00:02:10.979> that's

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
little bit now for a budget phone that's

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.860 
little bit now for a budget phone that's
not<00:02:11.489> really<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> bad<00:02:11.910> thing<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.569> really

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
not really a bad thing but on a really

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.670 
not really a bad thing but on a really
high-end<00:02:13.260> display

high-end display

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.559 
high-end display
you<00:02:13.739> might<00:02:13.890> notice<00:02:14.159> it<00:02:14.310> as<00:02:14.400> well<00:02:14.609> also<00:02:15.180> if<00:02:15.480> I

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you might notice it as well also if I

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.539 
you might notice it as well also if I
turn<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.019> off<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.469> under<00:02:16.650> really<00:02:17.189> really

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
turn this off and under really really

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.089 
turn this off and under really really
perfect<00:02:18.299> conditions<00:02:19.140> you'll<00:02:19.590> see<00:02:19.769> some<00:02:19.980> of

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
perfect conditions you'll see some of

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.399 
perfect conditions you'll see some of
the<00:02:20.159> light<00:02:20.340> reflecting<00:02:20.909> there<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:22.079> might<00:02:22.230> not

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
the light reflecting there you might not

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.869 
the light reflecting there you might not
be<00:02:22.530> able<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.739> see<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.129> there's<00:02:23.310> lines<00:02:23.640> in

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
be able to see it but there's lines in

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.339 
be able to see it but there's lines in
the<00:02:23.969> display<00:02:24.329> that<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.599> can<00:02:24.629> actually<00:02:25.079> see

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
the display that you can actually see

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.780 
the display that you can actually see
and<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.620> probably<00:02:25.859> used<00:02:26.219> for<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.549> touch

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and it's probably used for the touch

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.209 
and it's probably used for the touch
sensitivity<00:02:27.329> but<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.409> can<00:02:28.590> see<00:02:28.769> these<00:02:28.950> vertical

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
sensitivity but I can see these vertical

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.520 
sensitivity but I can see these vertical
lines<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.120> there<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.540> may<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.349> an

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
lines that are there and that may be an

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.020 
lines that are there and that may be an
annoyance<00:02:31.889> for<00:02:32.069> some<00:02:32.310> people<00:02:32.609> in<00:02:32.790> really

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
annoyance for some people in really

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.940 
annoyance for some people in really
bright<00:02:33.329> light<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.870> battery<00:02:34.200> inside<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.769> Moto

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
bright light the battery inside the Moto

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.069 
bright light the battery inside the Moto
G<00:02:35.189> is<00:02:35.400> not<00:02:35.670> removable<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.540> that's<00:02:36.780> unfortunate

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
G is not removable so that's unfortunate

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.199 
G is not removable so that's unfortunate
but<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.799> seems<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.129> be<00:02:38.189> pretty<00:02:38.459> sufficient<00:02:39.090> to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
but it seems to be pretty sufficient to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.670 
but it seems to be pretty sufficient to
get<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.359> through<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.629> day<00:02:39.870> without<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.200> problem
