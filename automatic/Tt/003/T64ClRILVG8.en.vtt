ah<00:00:12.930> the<00:00:13.930> only<00:00:14.170> downside<00:00:14.680> to<00:00:14.710> it<00:00:14.920> is<00:00:15.220> it's<00:00:15.910> a<00:00:16.030> lot

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
ah the only downside to it is it's a lot

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.000 
ah the only downside to it is it's a lot
quieter<00:00:16.600> than<00:00:17.110> a<00:00:17.200> straight<00:00:17.440> pipe<00:00:17.619> that<00:00:17.800> I<00:00:17.860> had

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
quieter than a straight pipe that I had

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.019 
quieter than a straight pipe that I had
on<00:00:18.160> there<00:00:18.369> but<00:00:18.910> I<00:00:19.180> kind<00:00:19.840> of<00:00:19.900> don't<00:00:20.050> like<00:00:20.230> that

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
on there but I kind of don't like that

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.200 
on there but I kind of don't like that
but<00:00:22.029> uh<00:00:22.090> I<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:24.279> do<00:00:24.430> stuff<00:00:24.700> in<00:00:24.820> first<00:00:25.029> and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
but uh I can do stuff in first and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.280 
but uh I can do stuff in first and
second<00:00:25.450> gear<00:00:25.540> now<00:00:25.689> that<00:00:25.869> I<00:00:25.930> couldn't<00:00:26.200> do

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
second gear now that I couldn't do

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.190 
second gear now that I couldn't do
before<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:27.550> an<00:00:27.790> absolute<00:00:28.210> animal<00:00:28.689> like<00:00:29.110> I

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
before it's an absolute animal like I

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.450 
before it's an absolute animal like I
haven't<00:00:29.470> lost<00:00:29.560> any<00:00:29.829> boost<00:00:29.980> I'm<00:00:30.160> still<00:00:30.340> in

it's not bad she's not loud enough so oh
well<00:01:24.380> but<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.710> definitely<00:01:25.890> helping<00:01:26.460> since

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
is that three inches the butt dyno is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.990 
is that three inches the butt dyno is
definitely<00:01:29.670> seeing<00:01:29.850> an<00:01:30.000> increase

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.390

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.290 

my<00:01:46.940> paws<00:01:47.390> are<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.630> lot<00:01:47.780> more<00:01:47.810> stable<00:01:48.140> to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.770
