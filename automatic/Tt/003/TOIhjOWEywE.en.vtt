flush<00:00:12.559> seamless<00:00:13.559> door<00:00:14.099> now<00:00:14.910> has<00:00:15.210> it's<00:00:15.389> been

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
flush seamless door now has it's been

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.470 
flush seamless door now has it's been
done<00:00:15.690> before<00:00:15.980> absolutely<00:00:16.980> but<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.090> think<00:00:18.359> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
done before absolutely but I think this

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.150 
done before absolutely but I think this
is<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.690> really<00:00:18.900> special<00:00:19.199> door<00:00:19.560> not<00:00:19.859> just

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
is a really special door not just

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.800 
is a really special door not just
because<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> most<00:00:20.910> compact<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.689> its

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
because it's the most compact of its

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.960 
because it's the most compact of its
kind<00:00:22.080> as<00:00:22.289> far<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.590> i<00:00:22.680> know<00:00:22.740> but<00:00:23.400> also<00:00:23.580> because

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
kind as far as i know but also because

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.450 
kind as far as i know but also because
it<00:00:24.210> uses<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:25.140> unique<00:00:25.350> technique<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.279> far

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
it uses a really unique technique as far

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.800 
it uses a really unique technique as far
as<00:00:26.580> i<00:00:26.699> know<00:00:26.760> i<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.150> i<00:00:27.180> haven't<00:00:27.359> really<00:00:27.599> seen

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
as i know i that i haven't really seen

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.870 
as i know i that i haven't really seen
anybody<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.529> before<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.250> i'll<00:00:29.460> show<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.699> guys

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
anybody do before and i'll show you guys

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.730 
anybody do before and i'll show you guys
that<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> moment<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:30.929> without<00:00:31.170> further<00:00:31.439> ado

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that in a moment but without further ado

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220 
that in a moment but without further ado
let's<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.160> ahead<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.550> show<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.270> working<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
let's go ahead and show it working it

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.620 
let's go ahead and show it working it
out<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.190> work<00:00:35.340> off<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> button<00:00:36.090> which<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
out to work off a button which was a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.810 
out to work off a button which was a
pain<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:36.989> ass<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.230> i<00:00:37.559> got<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> work<00:00:37.980> so

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
pain in the ass but i got it to work so

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.180 
pain in the ass but i got it to work so
here<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.059> go<00:00:39.290> here's<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.530> closing<00:00:43.100> here's<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
here we go here's the closing here's the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.940 
here we go here's the closing here's the
closing<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.719> opening

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.190 

as<00:00:51.190> you<00:00:51.640> can<00:00:51.730> see<00:00:51.910> it's<00:00:52.090> pretty<00:00:52.510> fast<00:00:52.900> I'll<00:00:53.110> do

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
as you can see it's pretty fast I'll do

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.860 
as you can see it's pretty fast I'll do
it<00:00:53.260> one<00:00:53.470> more<00:00:53.530> time<00:00:53.950> with<00:00:54.340> f1<00:00:55.240> active<00:00:57.870> so

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
it one more time with f1 active so

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:07.820 
it one more time with f1 active so
here's<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.380> closing<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:05.410> open

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.590 

now<00:01:08.830> if<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.370> paid<00:01:09.610> really<00:01:09.940> close<00:01:10.390> attention

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
now if you paid really close attention

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.050 
now if you paid really close attention
you<00:01:11.410> might<00:01:11.620> have<00:01:11.800> noticed<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:12.310> instead<00:01:13.000> of

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
you might have noticed that instead of

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.210 
you might have noticed that instead of
moving<00:01:13.390> across<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.500> then<00:01:14.710> back<00:01:14.980> the<00:01:15.190> other

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
moving across and then back the other

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.270 
moving across and then back the other
way<00:01:15.430> these<00:01:16.300> other<00:01:17.110> weather<00:01:17.410> is<00:01:17.590> closing<00:01:17.890> or

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
way these other weather is closing or

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.890 
way these other weather is closing or
opening<00:01:18.310> these<00:01:18.790> Pistons<00:01:19.240> are<00:01:19.360> always<00:01:19.720> moving

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
opening these Pistons are always moving

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.050 
opening these Pistons are always moving
in<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.230> same<00:01:20.440> direction<00:01:20.500> down<00:01:21.430> here<00:01:21.730> and<00:01:21.940> the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
in the same direction down here and the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.850 
in the same direction down here and the
same<00:01:22.270> direction<00:01:22.480> up<00:01:22.750> here<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.200> I'll<00:01:23.620> show<00:01:23.830> you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
same direction up here and I'll show you

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.600 
same direction up here and I'll show you
why<00:01:24.160> right<00:01:24.490> now<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:25.660> here<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.230> the<00:01:26.710> wiring<00:01:27.340> of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
why right now so here is the wiring of

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.760 
why right now so here is the wiring of
this<00:01:27.850> three<00:01:28.120> by<00:01:28.240> three<00:01:28.600> seamless<00:01:29.140> flush<00:01:29.470> door

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
this three by three seamless flush door

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.190 
this three by three seamless flush door
the<00:01:30.990> total<00:01:31.990> wiring<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.650> 12<00:01:33.310> x<00:01:33.640> 12<00:01:34.000> x<00:01:34.150> 6<00:01:34.720> giving

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
the total wiring is 12 x 12 x 6 giving

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.850 
the total wiring is 12 x 12 x 6 giving
it<00:01:35.290> an<00:01:35.640> 864<00:01:36.640> block<00:01:36.910> volume<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:38.050> previous<00:01:38.530> most

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
it an 864 block volume the previous most

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.080 
it an 864 block volume the previous most
compact<00:01:39.310> one<00:01:39.670> I've<00:01:39.910> seen<00:01:40.180> was<00:01:40.870> 17<00:01:41.440> x<00:01:42.040> 13<00:01:42.580> x<00:01:42.610> 5

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
compact one I've seen was 17 x 13 x 5

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.440 
compact one I've seen was 17 x 13 x 5
which<00:01:43.120> is<00:01:43.630> about<00:01:43.810> an<00:01:44.130> 1105<00:01:45.130> block<00:01:45.430> volume<00:01:45.850> so

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
which is about an 1105 block volume so

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.380 
which is about an 1105 block volume so
it's<00:01:46.630> quite<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:47.700> significantly<00:01:48.700> compact<00:01:49.150> and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
it's quite a significantly compact and

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.070 
it's quite a significantly compact and
it's<00:01:50.170> pretty<00:01:50.710> it's<00:01:51.400> pretty<00:01:51.550> fast<00:01:52.119> too<00:01:52.360> as<00:01:52.840> far

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
it's pretty it's pretty fast too as far

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.880 
it's pretty it's pretty fast too as far
as<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.350> know<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:55.060> let's<00:01:55.420> take<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.630> look<00:01:55.930> at<00:01:56.200> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
as I know so let's take a look at the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.480 
as I know so let's take a look at the
mechanism<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.090> was<00:01:59.080> talking<00:01:59.440> about<00:01:59.530> so

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
mechanism that I was talking about so

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.490 
mechanism that I was talking about so
this<00:02:01.150> is<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.450> mechanism<00:02:01.720> instead<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.320> having

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
this is the mechanism instead of having

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.440 
this is the mechanism instead of having
extenders<00:02:03.220> on<00:02:03.400> either<00:02:03.520> side<00:02:03.850> there's

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
extenders on either side there's

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.200 
extenders on either side there's
actually<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.810> piston<00:02:05.350> tape<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:06.550> circulates

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
actually a piston tape that circulates

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.480 
actually a piston tape that circulates
the<00:02:07.540> same<00:02:08.110> way<00:02:08.380> through<00:02:08.950> just<00:02:09.220> three

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
the same way through just three

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.479 
the same way through just three
different<00:02:09.970> sets<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.390> one<00:02:10.630> tick<00:02:10.869> pulses<00:02:11.350> on<00:02:11.560> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
different sets of one tick pulses on the

other time you close and open it it'll

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.050 
other time you close and open it it'll
exchange<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.470> Pistons<00:02:17.890> on<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> bottom<00:02:18.519> for

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
exchange the Pistons on the bottom for

exchange the Pistons on the bottom for
the<00:02:19.120> Pistons<00:02:19.330> on<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> top<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.769> can<00:02:20.890> see<00:02:20.950> that

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
the Pistons on the top you can see that

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.729 
the Pistons on the top you can see that
one<00:02:22.150> time<00:02:22.390> when<00:02:22.600> you're<00:02:22.750> opening<00:02:23.140> these

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
one time when you're opening these

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.580 
one time when you're opening these
Pistons<00:02:24.310> maybe<00:02:24.580> be<00:02:25.090> used<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.780> activate<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
Pistons maybe be used to activate the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.710 
Pistons maybe be used to activate the
spot<00:02:26.830> on<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.980> top<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:28.090> next<00:02:28.330> time<00:02:28.570> you're

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
spot on the top and the next time you're

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.780 
spot on the top and the next time you're
opening<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.230> they<00:02:29.470> may<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.709> used<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.370> activate

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
opening it they may be used to activate

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.790 
opening it they may be used to activate
the<00:02:30.970> Bloods<00:02:31.180> on<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.450> bottom<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.959> think<00:02:32.620> it's<00:02:32.739> a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
the Bloods on the bottom I think it's a

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.530 
the Bloods on the bottom I think it's a
really<00:02:32.830> interesting<00:02:33.370> concept<00:02:34.150> not<00:02:34.330> just

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
really interesting concept not just

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.140 
really interesting concept not just
because<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.780> how<00:02:35.050> it's<00:02:35.459> used<00:02:36.459> but<00:02:36.790> also<00:02:36.970> just

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
because of how it's used but also just

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.270 
because of how it's used but also just
kind<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.690> how<00:02:37.930> thinking<00:02:38.500> about<00:02:38.709> how<00:02:38.860> different

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
kind of how thinking about how different

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.240 
kind of how thinking about how different
components<00:02:39.820> can<00:02:39.940> change<00:02:40.390> based<00:02:41.080> on<00:02:41.380> when

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
components can change based on when

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.070 
components can change based on when
you're<00:02:42.459> activating<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.209> which<00:02:43.420> time<00:02:43.810> you're

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
you're activating it which time you're

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.259 
you're activating it which time you're
activating<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.370> yeah<00:02:45.580> it's<00:02:45.790> just<00:02:45.970> kind<00:02:46.209> of

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
activating it so yeah it's just kind of

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.820 
activating it so yeah it's just kind of
an<00:02:46.390> interesting<00:02:46.690> way<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.110> approach<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.739> i

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
an interesting way to approach it i

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.150 
an interesting way to approach it i
think<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.370> i<00:02:48.459> pulled<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.970> off<00:02:49.090> pretty<00:02:49.300> well<00:02:50.160> so

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
think and i pulled it off pretty well so

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.759 
think and i pulled it off pretty well so
you<00:02:51.280> can<00:02:51.430> find<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.390> world<00:02:52.690> file<00:02:53.170> for<00:02:53.620> this

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
you can find the world file for this

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.699 
you can find the world file for this
door<00:02:54.070> in<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.700> description<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.570> if<00:02:56.530> you're
