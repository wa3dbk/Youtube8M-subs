which<00:00:35.309> give<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> better<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
which give a better and what I think is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.310 
which give a better and what I think is
a<00:00:37.140> more<00:00:37.380> natural<00:00:37.829> sound<00:00:38.399> reproduction<00:00:39.320> Denon

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
a more natural sound reproduction Denon

a more natural sound reproduction Denon
also<00:00:40.559> includes<00:00:40.860> certain<00:00:41.129> technologies<00:00:41.730> which

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
also includes certain technologies which

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.060 
also includes certain technologies which
they<00:00:42.239> caught<00:00:42.480> kusik<00:00:42.899> optimizer<00:00:43.350> technology

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
they caught kusik optimizer technology

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.279 
they caught kusik optimizer technology
which<00:00:45.059> essentially<00:00:45.450> puts<00:00:45.690> ambient<00:00:46.140> air

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
which essentially puts ambient air

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.680 
which essentially puts ambient air
pressure<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.680> both<00:00:46.890> sides<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.940> Nora<00:00:48.120> not

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
pressure on both sides that Nora not

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.569 
pressure on both sides that Nora not
only<00:00:48.930> helps<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.260> better<00:00:49.530> sound<00:00:49.800> quality<00:00:50.280> but

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
only helps with better sound quality but

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.139 
only helps with better sound quality but
is<00:00:50.670> also<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.180> power<00:00:51.420> efficient<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> okay<00:00:54.030> if

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is also more power efficient so okay if

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
is also more power efficient so okay if
you're<00:00:54.270> lucky<00:00:54.390> enough<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.780> own<00:00:55.079> an<00:00:55.469> iPhone<00:00:56.100> or

you're lucky enough to own an iPhone or
an<00:00:56.489> iPod<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.300> you're<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.719> full

experience and having a go with these
headphones<00:01:48.020> once<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.560> put<00:01:48.740> them<00:01:48.830> on<00:01:49.010> because

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
headphones once you put them on because

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.200 
headphones once you put them on because
of<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.210> extra<00:01:50.420> padding<00:01:50.690> around<00:01:50.780> there

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
of the extra padding around there

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.180 
of the extra padding around there
the<00:01:53.210> sound<00:01:53.690> is<00:01:53.869> held<00:01:54.080> into<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.770> the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
the sound is held into the the

the sound is held into the the
headphones<00:01:55.729> perfectly<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.509> mean<00:01:56.810> exterior

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
headphones perfectly so I mean exterior
