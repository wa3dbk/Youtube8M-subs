00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
slot the micro SD card now it does

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.380 
slot the micro SD card now it does
actually<00:02:04.079> take<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.219> larger<00:02:05.640> capacity

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
actually take the larger capacity

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.710 
actually take the larger capacity
microsd<00:02:06.990> card<00:02:07.259> which<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.580> 128<00:02:08.580> gigabytes<00:02:09.119> but

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
microsd card which is 128 gigabytes but

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.360 
microsd card which is 128 gigabytes but
it<00:02:09.810> does<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.140> egg<00:02:10.349> whites<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.920> internal

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
it does have egg whites of internal

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.910 
it does have egg whites of internal
memory<00:02:11.489> anyway<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:13.110> battery<00:02:13.620> is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
memory anyway so battery is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
memory anyway so battery is
place<00:02:14.130> all<00:02:14.280> which<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.580> big<00:02:14.819> bonus<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.480> to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
place all which is a big bonus and to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.210 
place all which is a big bonus and to
put<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.170> back<00:02:16.319> cover<00:02:16.560> back<00:02:16.709> on<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.010> can't

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
put the back cover back on you can't

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.280 
put the back cover back on you can't
just<00:02:17.400> push<00:02:17.580> around<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.849> edges<00:02:18.000> now<00:02:18.930> I'm

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
just push around the edges now I'm

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.809 
just push around the edges now I'm
actually<00:02:19.470> going<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.739> cut<00:02:20.099> quite<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.489> lot<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
actually going to cut quite a lot of

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.550 
actually going to cut quite a lot of
scenes<00:02:21.060> because<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.840> actually<00:02:22.020> does<00:02:22.290> take<00:02:22.470> a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
scenes because this actually does take a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.470 
scenes because this actually does take a
long<00:02:22.830> long<00:02:23.130> time<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.819> install<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.239> his

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
long long time for it to install on his

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.630 
long long time for it to install on his
apps<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.989> get<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:25.470> self<00:02:25.650> powered<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.459> while

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
apps and get it self powered on so while

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.699 
apps and get it self powered on so while
it's<00:02:26.819> doing<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.290> I'm<00:02:28.290> actually<00:02:28.440> going<00:02:28.650> to

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
it's doing that I'm actually going to

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.630 
it's doing that I'm actually going to
run<00:02:28.860> down<00:02:29.130> through<00:02:29.280> some<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.550> the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.430

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
this phone in terms of spec wise it's

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.520 
this phone in terms of spec wise it's
only<00:03:44.459> running<00:03:44.609> 512<00:03:45.359> megabytes<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.900> RAM<00:03:46.170> but

only running 512 megabytes of RAM but

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.750 
only running 512 megabytes of RAM but
like<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.769> said<00:03:46.829> witness<00:03:47.310> phone<00:03:47.430> doesn't

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
like I said witness phone doesn't

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.250 
like I said witness phone doesn't
actually<00:03:47.850> need<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.150> lot<00:03:48.359> of<00:03:48.390> high<00:03:48.630> specs<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.140> get

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
actually need a lot of high specs to get

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.539 
actually need a lot of high specs to get
it<00:03:49.350> running<00:03:49.440> smooth<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.250> other<00:03:50.459> than

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
it running smooth so other than

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.310 
it running smooth so other than
drop-down<00:03:51.180> notifications<00:03:51.359> which<00:03:52.170> I've

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
thing that they've introduced in 8.1 and

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.380 
thing that they've introduced in 8.1 and
that<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.959> wallpapers<00:03:58.819> so<00:03:59.819> basically<00:04:00.239> we<00:04:00.299> have

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
that is wallpapers so basically we have

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.819 
that is wallpapers so basically we have
to<00:04:00.510> do<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.930> have<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.140> basically<00:04:01.440> choose<00:04:01.769> a

to do is you have to basically choose a
photo<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.310> any<00:04:02.549> kind<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.850> photo<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.239> like<00:04:03.390> and

photo of any kind of photo you like and

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.479 
photo of any kind of photo you like and
it<00:04:03.720> changes<00:04:04.049> some<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.380> live<00:04:04.590> tiles<00:04:04.980> now

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
it changes some of the live tiles now

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.849 
it changes some of the live tiles now
not<00:04:05.700> all<00:04:05.730> live<00:04:06.120> tiles<00:04:06.660> have<00:04:07.079> actually<00:04:07.500> enabled

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
not all live tiles have actually enabled

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.319 
not all live tiles have actually enabled
this<00:04:07.950> or<00:04:08.100> not<00:04:08.220> all<00:04:08.430> applications<00:04:09.120> should<00:04:09.180> i

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
this or not all applications should i

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.449 
this or not all applications should i
say<00:04:09.510> have<00:04:09.660> enabled<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.260> but<00:04:11.190> they<00:04:11.340> are

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
say have enabled this but they are

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.280 
say have enabled this but they are
releasing<00:04:11.880> updates<00:04:12.000> constantly<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.959> do<00:04:13.109> this

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
releasing updates constantly to do this

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.840 
releasing updates constantly to do this
so<00:04:13.590> at<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.829> moment<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.160> can<00:04:14.250> see<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> set<00:04:14.700> that

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
so at the moment you can see I set that

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.789 
so at the moment you can see I set that
motor<00:04:15.030> bike<00:04:15.239> headlight<00:04:15.450> as<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:16.590> wallpaper

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
motor bike headlight as the wallpaper

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.190 
motor bike headlight as the wallpaper
and<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.430> can<00:04:17.579> see<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.880> moves<00:04:18.090> along<00:04:18.359> with<00:04:18.780> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
and you can see it moves along with the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.560 
and you can see it moves along with the
live<00:04:19.530> tiles<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.190> personally<00:04:20.789> think<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.299> this

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
live tiles I personally think that this

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.120 
live tiles I personally think that this
will<00:04:21.810> actually<00:04:22.049> look<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.380> bit<00:04:22.560> too<00:04:22.800> cluttered

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
will actually look a bit too cluttered

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.640 
will actually look a bit too cluttered
so<00:04:23.820> for<00:04:24.090> me<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.270> actually<00:04:24.630> like<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:24.900> very<00:04:25.289> clean

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
so for me I actually like a very clean

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.100 
so for me I actually like a very clean
wallpaper

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
wallpaper

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.020 
wallpaper
no<00:04:27.199> something<00:04:27.620> like<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.830> blueblack<00:04:28.430> just<00:04:28.939> a

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
no something like the blueblack just a

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.179 
no something like the blueblack just a
very<00:04:29.419> neutral<00:04:29.689> color<00:04:30.199> and<00:04:30.800> then<00:04:30.889> it<00:04:31.039> doesn't

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:31.189 
very neutral color and then it doesn't

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.649 
very neutral color and then it doesn't
get<00:04:31.430> too<00:04:31.639> cluttered<00:04:31.969> you<00:04:32.240> can<00:04:32.389> actually<00:04:32.479> see

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 
get too cluttered you can actually see

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.740 
get too cluttered you can actually see
the<00:04:32.900> live<00:04:33.050> tile<00:04:33.289> information<00:04:34.599> dimension<00:04:35.599> was

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
the live tile information dimension was

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.420 
the live tile information dimension was
the<00:04:35.960> phone<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.289> actually<00:04:36.439> very<00:04:36.590> average<00:04:37.099> sized

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
the phone is actually very average sized

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.309 
the phone is actually very average sized
and<00:04:37.909> if<00:04:38.030> we<00:04:38.120> compare<00:04:38.479> it<00:04:38.599> to<00:04:38.689> the<00:04:38.780> massive

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
and if we compare it to the massive

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.369 
and if we compare it to the massive
Lumia<00:04:39.860> 1520<00:04:40.479> yeah<00:04:41.479> she<00:04:41.599> gets<00:04:41.870> completely

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:42.379 
Lumia 1520 yeah she gets completely

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.469 
Lumia 1520 yeah she gets completely
dwarfed<00:04:42.949> by<00:04:43.039> it<00:04:43.219> but<00:04:43.789> don't<00:04:43.969> think<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.300> phone

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
dwarfed by it but don't think the phone

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.059 
dwarfed by it but don't think the phone
is<00:04:44.509> actually<00:04:44.780> that's<00:04:45.050> more<00:04:45.379> obviously<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:45.949> has

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
is actually that's more obviously it has

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.279 
is actually that's more obviously it has
got<00:04:46.219> a<00:04:46.250> 4.5<00:04:46.879> inch<00:04:47.060> display<00:04:47.539> so<00:04:47.599> it's<00:04:47.930> more<00:04:48.199> than

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
got a 4.5 inch display so it's more than

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.050 
got a 4.5 inch display so it's more than
big<00:04:48.439> enough<00:04:48.469> in<00:04:48.770> fact<00:04:49.039> it's<00:04:49.520> half<00:04:49.789> an<00:04:49.939> inch

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
big enough in fact it's half an inch

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.719 
big enough in fact it's half an inch
bigger<00:04:50.389> than<00:04:50.599> the<00:04:50.719> iphone<00:04:51.020> 5<00:04:51.349> s's<00:04:51.560> display<00:04:52.129> so

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
bigger than the iphone 5 s's display so

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.659 
bigger than the iphone 5 s's display so
it's<00:04:53.000> definitely<00:04:53.389> a<00:04:53.449> good<00:04:54.020> size<00:04:54.259> handset<00:04:54.860> but

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
it's definitely a good size handset but

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.159 
it's definitely a good size handset but
obviously<00:04:55.759> if<00:04:56.060> we<00:04:56.150> can<00:04:56.300> pair<00:04:56.449> it<00:04:56.509> up<00:04:56.689> to<00:04:56.960> the

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
obviously if we can pair it up to the

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.429 
obviously if we can pair it up to the
Nokia<00:04:57.530> Lumia<00:04:57.560> 1520<00:04:58.569> it's<00:04:59.569> completely<00:05:00.139> dwarfed

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:00.439 
Nokia Lumia 1520 it's completely dwarfed

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.619 
Nokia Lumia 1520 it's completely dwarfed
but<00:05:00.740> then<00:05:00.889> again<00:05:00.919> most<00:05:01.430> phones<00:05:01.699> are<00:05:01.909> now<00:05:02.509> in

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
but then again most phones are now in

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.209 
but then again most phones are now in
terms<00:05:02.779> of<00:05:02.930> camera<00:05:03.229> quality<00:05:03.379> that's<00:05:03.949> something

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:04.219 
terms of camera quality that's something

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.790 
terms of camera quality that's something
I<00:05:04.250> might<00:05:04.279> do<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.580> separate<00:05:04.939> video<00:05:05.090> on<00:05:05.270> later<00:05:05.800> but

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
I might do a separate video on later but

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.040 
I might do a separate video on later but
I<00:05:06.830> will<00:05:07.189> cover<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.879> basic<00:05:08.389> applications<00:05:08.930> you

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
I will cover the basic applications you

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.809 
I will cover the basic applications you
get<00:05:09.199> straight<00:05:09.500> away<00:05:09.740> straight<00:05:10.250> at<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.430> box<00:05:10.639> on

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819

the camera now you get the standard
windows<00:05:12.830> camera<00:05:13.340> which<00:05:13.669> is<00:05:13.939> okay<00:05:14.569> it's<00:05:14.810> not

that's actually do a little bit towards

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.820 
that's actually do a little bit towards
the<00:06:16.669> sensor<00:06:17.120> size<00:06:17.529> it's<00:06:18.529> I<00:06:18.589> just<00:06:18.710> got<00:06:18.800> a

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
the sensor size it's I just got a

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.529 
the sensor size it's I just got a
quarter<00:06:19.250> inch<00:06:19.430> sensor<00:06:19.699> so<00:06:20.060> it's<00:06:20.210> a<00:06:20.270> little<00:06:20.419> bit

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
quarter inch sensor so it's a little bit

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.300 
quarter inch sensor so it's a little bit
bigger<00:06:20.810> than<00:06:20.990> your<00:06:21.139> average<00:06:21.259> 5<00:06:21.710> megapixel

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
bigger than your average 5 megapixel

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.279 
bigger than your average 5 megapixel
sensor<00:06:22.729> so<00:06:23.089> that's<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.539> to<00:06:23.719> wrap<00:06:23.870> it<00:06:24.020> up<00:06:24.110> this

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
sensor so that's it to wrap it up this
