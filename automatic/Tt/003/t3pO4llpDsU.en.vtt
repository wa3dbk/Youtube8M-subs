00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
just happening because it's in some of

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.650 
just happening because it's in some of

the windows 10 in the future but i can
already<00:03:28.440> say<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.280> they'll<00:03:29.730> probably<00:03:29.910> be

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
already say that they'll probably be

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.330 
already say that they'll probably be
more<00:03:30.209> drivers<00:03:30.660> very<00:03:31.200> soon<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.889> case<00:03:32.040> when
