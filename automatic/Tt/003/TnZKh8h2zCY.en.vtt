usually give birth to just one pup so
it's<00:01:33.970> very<00:01:34.180> important<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.720> conserve<00:01:35.049> each<00:01:35.350> and

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
it's very important to conserve each and

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.760 
it's very important to conserve each and
every<00:01:36.100> large<00:01:36.340> bat<00:01:36.610> we<00:01:36.789> see<00:01:37.140> their<00:01:38.140> young<00:01:38.440> will

every large bat we see their young will

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.770 
every large bat we see their young will
stay<00:01:38.950> with<00:01:39.159> them<00:01:39.340> for<00:01:39.640> around<00:01:39.789> 12<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.330> 14<00:01:40.750> weeks

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.680 
stay with them for around 12 to 14 weeks
and<00:01:41.289> then<00:01:42.220> they<00:01:42.550> become<00:01:42.819> mature<00:01:43.210> enough<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.479> go

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
and then they become mature enough to go

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.440 
and then they become mature enough to go
