 a welcome welcome that dimension 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:15.490
 vegan today we are going to make a smoothie 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.349
 celery and chia if we have the ingredients 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.779
 as you will see I have changed the blender well 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.340
 that we are celebrating the first video 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.580
 with our blender 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.599
 we are going to use more or less 33 stems of 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.210
 celery as well as with leaf and all 2 kiwis 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.280
 an apple a banana three oranges the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.750
 juice of three oranges since we have the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.120
 main ingredient that has a lot 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.040
 megan 3 which is the chia or the seeds of 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.290
 Chia can also be called a 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.269
 spoonful we are going to use if they have also 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.510
 a teaspoon of coconut oil for 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.180
 make it richer and a little water and a 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.400
 some mineral or filtered water 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.540
 we connect the fast in pieces in 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.450
 reality for this blender is not 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.420
 necessary but good we cut it 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.220
 We peel everything and put everything inside 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.220
 blender - chia seeds 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.149
 let's get juice out of oranges 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.210
 and 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.960
 ah 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.340
 Now let's add a teaspoon of 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.340
 coconut fat or coconut oil 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.439
 we go 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.320
 we mix the dyad slightly so that it 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.640
 integrate well with the color is very useful if 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.319
 they want a better texture can 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.870
 add a little water but this way to 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.270
 I love it and let it rest two or 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.590
 three minutes for him to do the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.209
 mucilage 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.850
 We are here and decorating our 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.660
 moody's 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.940

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.030

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.030
