00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
and it looked cool and it pushes a lot

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.510 
and it looked cool and it pushes a lot
of<00:00:24.940> air<00:00:25.060> actually<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:26.950> Baxter<00:00:27.280> flow<00:00:27.520> is<00:00:27.700> 42

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
of air actually the Baxter flow is 42

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.910 
of air actually the Baxter flow is 42
CFM<00:00:30.520> which<00:00:31.090> is<00:00:31.210> I<00:00:31.330> think<00:00:31.360> cubic<00:00:31.840> foot<00:00:32.290> cubic

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
CFM which is I think cubic foot cubic

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.590 
CFM which is I think cubic foot cubic
feet<00:00:33.070> per<00:00:33.340> meter<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.640> other<00:00:36.640> series<00:00:37.270> I<00:00:37.300> don't

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
feet per meter and other series I don't

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.030 
feet per meter and other series I don't
know<00:00:37.660> what<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.870> difference<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.290> -<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:38.800> Fox

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
know what the difference is - the Fox

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.130 
know what the difference is - the Fox
one<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:40.620> Fox<00:00:41.620> 2<00:00:41.890> looks<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:42.730> same<00:00:43.030> but<00:00:43.360> you

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
one and Fox 2 looks the same but you

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.500 
one and Fox 2 looks the same but you
know<00:00:44.260> ok<00:00:44.800> anyway<00:00:45.160> so<00:00:45.700> um<00:00:46.120> yeah<00:00:46.960> it's<00:00:47.460> ever

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
know ok anyway so um yeah it's ever

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.420 
know ok anyway so um yeah it's ever
lubricating<00:00:49.510> bearing<00:00:49.870> um<00:00:50.440> long<00:00:50.980> life<00:00:51.160> bring

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
lubricating bearing um long life bring

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.760 
lubricating bearing um long life bring
anyway<00:00:51.760> uh<00:00:51.970> yeah<00:00:52.180> so<00:00:52.360> he<00:00:52.450> pushes<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.260> lot<00:00:53.410> of<00:00:53.560> air

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
anyway uh yeah so he pushes a lot of air

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.240 
anyway uh yeah so he pushes a lot of air
and<00:00:53.800> it's<00:00:54.570> 12<00:00:55.570> less<00:00:55.810> than<00:00:56.050> 28<00:00:56.470> decibels<00:00:57.100> so

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
and it's 12 less than 28 decibels so

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.880 
and it's 12 less than 28 decibels so
it's<00:00:57.400> not<00:00:57.550> too<00:00:57.850> loud<00:00:58.030> so<00:00:58.840> I<00:00:59.320> just<00:00:59.649> kind<00:00:59.829> of

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
it's not too loud so I just kind of

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.139 
it's not too loud so I just kind of
bought<00:01:00.010> this<00:01:00.190> just<00:01:00.340> because<00:01:00.550> I<00:01:00.640> figured<00:01:00.970> once

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
bought this just because I figured once

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.920 
bought this just because I figured once
I<00:01:01.300> have<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.690> two<00:01:02.230> guy<00:01:02.380> first<00:01:02.620> cards<00:01:02.920> in<00:01:03.130> there

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
I have the two guy first cards in there

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.570 
I have the two guy first cards in there
it<00:01:04.930> might<00:01:05.140> use<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.590> little<00:01:05.830> bit<00:01:05.920> more<00:01:06.100> there

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
it might use a little bit more there

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.399 
it might use a little bit more there
might<00:01:06.729> want<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.300> little<00:01:07.450> more<00:01:07.600> cooling<00:01:07.960> it

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
might want a little more cooling it

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:17.070 
might want a little more cooling it

doesn't have any LEDs which just I don't
know<00:01:23.110> kind<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.409> nice<00:01:23.530> maybe<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.220> other<00:01:24.340> was

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
basic fan controller

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.190 
basic fan controller
thank<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:33.970> chiller<00:01:35.190> TCI<00:01:36.190> cooler<00:01:36.520> so<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.090> air

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
thank you chiller TCI cooler so the air

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.330 
thank you chiller TCI cooler so the air
gets<00:01:38.200> sucked<00:01:38.350> in<00:01:38.530> here<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:38.860> then<00:01:38.979> gets

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
gets sucked in here and then gets

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.730 
gets sucked in here and then gets
diverted<00:01:39.549> directly<00:01:40.119> out<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.540> back<00:01:40.750> so

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
diverted directly out of the back so

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.740 
diverted directly out of the back so
I'll<00:01:41.979> probably<00:01:42.250> have<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:42.909> put<00:01:43.119> on<00:01:43.150> top<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.630> my

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
I'll probably have it put on top of my

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.240 
I'll probably have it put on top of my
case<00:01:43.960> with<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.229> hot<00:01:44.380> air<00:01:44.470> will<00:01:44.590> rise<00:01:44.740> up<00:01:45.010> and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
case with the hot air will rise up and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.570 
case with the hot air will rise up and
get<00:01:45.549> sucked<00:01:46.150> out<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.510> taking<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.340> vs.<00:01:48.340> out<00:01:48.490> of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
get sucked out and taking a vs. out of

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.539 
get sucked out and taking a vs. out of
the<00:01:48.700> top<00:01:49.560> anyway<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:50.650> let<00:01:50.950> me<00:01:51.040> go<00:01:51.130> ahead<00:01:51.310> and

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
the top anyway so let me go ahead and

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.390 
the top anyway so let me go ahead and
install<00:01:51.880> this<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.659> can<00:01:52.810> fire<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.049> up<00:01:53.140> and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
install this and we can fire it up and

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.320 
install this and we can fire it up and
see<00:01:54.400> what<00:01:55.000> it<00:01:55.119> sounds<00:01:55.360> like

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.720 

all<00:01:59.870> right<00:02:00.050> so<00:02:00.590> before<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:01.280> talk<00:02:01.490> about<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
all right so before I talk about the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.770 
all right so before I talk about the
installation<00:02:01.970> I'm<00:02:02.300> gonna<00:02:02.420> start<00:02:02.540> off<00:02:02.630> by

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
installation I'm gonna start off by

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.380 
installation I'm gonna start off by
saying<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.260> know<00:02:03.410> my<00:02:04.070> case<00:02:04.310> cabling<00:02:04.940> is<00:02:05.060> messy

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
saying I know my case cabling is messy

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.480 
saying I know my case cabling is messy
this<00:02:06.080> is<00:02:06.140> disgusting<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.070> gross<00:02:07.100> I

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
this is disgusting and gross I

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.060 
this is disgusting and gross I
understand<00:02:07.910> but<00:02:08.450> if<00:02:08.510> you<00:02:08.630> own<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:08.960> case<00:02:09.260> you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
understand but if you own this case you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.460 
understand but if you own this case you
know<00:02:10.460> very<00:02:10.910> well<00:02:11.150> but<00:02:11.360> unless<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.020> have<00:02:12.050> flat

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
know very well but unless you have flat

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.560 
know very well but unless you have flat
cables<00:02:12.860> which<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.100> recommend<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:14.150> hard<00:02:14.450> to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
cables which I recommend it's hard to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.790 
cables which I recommend it's hard to
move<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:14.870> around<00:02:14.990> like<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.620> long

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
move this around like this is the long

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.490 
move this around like this is the long
is<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.700> pin<00:02:17.000> cable<00:02:17.210> can<00:02:17.960> go<00:02:18.140> sorry<00:02:18.470> I

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
is that the the pin cable can go sorry I

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.020 
is that the the pin cable can go sorry I
bought<00:02:18.980> an<00:02:19.100> extension<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.640> try<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:19.910> run

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
bought an extension to try and run

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.760 
bought an extension to try and run
around<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.390> motherboard<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:20.870> there<00:02:21.050> but<00:02:21.680> even

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
around the motherboard up there but even

around the motherboard up there but even
those<00:02:21.980> cables<00:02:22.340> are<00:02:22.400> gonna<00:02:22.490> be<00:02:22.640> pinched

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
those cables are gonna be pinched

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.690 
those cables are gonna be pinched

the the one screw and then you can see
it<00:02:47.600> from<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.840> back<00:02:48.050> on<00:02:48.440> top<00:02:48.770> there<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:51.080> is<00:02:51.260> very

it wobbles out a bit even though I have

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.650 
it wobbles out a bit even though I have
the<00:02:58.220> screw<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.580> it's<00:02:58.760> sitting<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.390> slot

it<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.470> resting<00:03:01.070> on<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.780> gap<00:03:03.080> I'm<00:03:03.260> like<00:03:03.440> one

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
it is resting on the gap I'm like one

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.979 
it is resting on the gap I'm like one
pin<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.010> graphics<00:03:04.400> card<00:03:04.480> one<00:03:05.480> rubber<00:03:05.690> pin

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
pin of the graphics card one rubber pin

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.240 
pin of the graphics card one rubber pin
over<00:03:06.320> here<00:03:06.500> behind<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.010> sli<00:03:07.580> bridge<00:03:10.870> actually

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
over here behind the sli bridge actually

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.320 
over here behind the sli bridge actually
yeah<00:03:13.250> there's<00:03:13.430> like<00:03:13.520> one<00:03:13.700> rubber<00:03:14.000> pin<00:03:14.150> on<00:03:14.239> the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
yeah there's like one rubber pin on the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.970 
yeah there's like one rubber pin on the
other<00:03:14.360> side<00:03:14.570> of<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.840> car<00:03:15.020> that<00:03:15.230> but

why'd<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:17.959> leave<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.230> bridge<00:03:18.350> in<00:03:18.530> there

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
why'd you leave the bridge in there

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.900 
why'd you leave the bridge in there
because<00:03:18.770> I'm<00:03:19.010> supposed<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.340> have<00:03:19.489> two<00:03:19.640> cards

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
because I'm supposed to have two cards

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.340 
because I'm supposed to have two cards
in<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.270> but<00:03:20.900> if<00:03:20.959> you've<00:03:21.050> seen<00:03:21.080> my<00:03:21.320> other

in here but if you've seen my other
video<00:03:21.739> where<00:03:21.800> tigerdirect<00:03:22.670> kind<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:22.970> screwed

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
video where tigerdirect kind of screwed

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.060 
video where tigerdirect kind of screwed
up<00:03:23.480> on<00:03:23.660> me<00:03:23.780> anyway<00:03:24.200> that's<00:03:24.830> not<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.010> point

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
up on me anyway that's not the point

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.890 
up on me anyway that's not the point
regardless<00:03:25.760> I've<00:03:25.940> got<00:03:26.090> this<00:03:26.209> installed<00:03:26.570> here

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
regardless I've got this installed here

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.050 
regardless I've got this installed here
so<00:03:27.500> I'm<00:03:27.620> going<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:27.800> go<00:03:27.980> ahead<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.550> replace<00:03:28.940> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
so I'm going to go ahead and replace the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.270 
so I'm going to go ahead and replace the
power<00:03:29.660> connection<00:03:30.170> for<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:30.650> card<00:03:30.920> with<00:03:31.100> bad

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
power connection for this card with bad

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.820 
power connection for this card with bad
code<00:03:31.520> connected<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.000> my<00:03:32.090> fan<00:03:32.300> controller<00:03:32.830> and

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
code connected to my fan controller and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.920 
code connected to my fan controller and
then<00:03:34.010> we<00:03:34.160> can<00:03:34.280> see<00:03:34.520> how<00:03:35.300> powerful<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.810> is<00:03:35.870> and

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
then we can see how powerful it is and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.330 
then we can see how powerful it is and
what<00:03:36.170> kind<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.350> job<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.709> does<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.100> will<00:03:37.190> come

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
what kind of job it does and will come

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.190 
what kind of job it does and will come
with<00:03:37.430> air<00:03:37.610> flow<00:03:37.700> it<00:03:37.850> moves<00:03:38.060> okay

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.600 

okay<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:42.260> I've<00:03:42.470> gone<00:03:42.590> ahead<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:42.920> connected

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
okay so I've gone ahead and connected

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.540 
okay so I've gone ahead and connected
the<00:03:43.760> power<00:03:44.000> very<00:03:44.780> ugly<00:03:45.050> I<00:03:45.500> know<00:03:46.040> if<00:03:46.250> someone's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
the power very ugly I know if someone's

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.309 
the power very ugly I know if someone's
in<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.730> comments<00:03:47.150> on<00:03:47.270> it<00:03:47.420> but<00:03:47.690> it's<00:03:47.959> my<00:03:48.110> power

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
in the comments on it but it's my power

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.870 
in the comments on it but it's my power
supply<00:03:48.560> that's<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.069> real<00:03:49.220> problem<00:03:49.400> having

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
supply that's the real problem having

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.240 
supply that's the real problem having
all<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.060> thick<00:03:50.300> cables<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:50.840> not<00:03:51.830> being<00:03:52.069> the

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
all the thick cables and not being the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.949 
all the thick cables and not being the
perfect<00:03:52.459> power<00:03:52.730> supply<00:03:52.970> for<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.239> case<00:03:53.540> but<00:03:53.930> I

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
perfect power supply for this case but I

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.370 
perfect power supply for this case but I
bought<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.230> because<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.650> looks<00:03:54.800> cool<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.280> know

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
bought it because it looks cool I know

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.120 
bought it because it looks cool I know
okay<00:03:57.380> oh<00:03:59.470> yeah<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.620> wouldn't<00:04:00.830> follow<00:04:00.950> me

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
okay oh yeah that wouldn't follow me

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.660 
okay oh yeah that wouldn't follow me
turning<00:04:01.340> on<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.550> power<00:04:01.700> on<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.030> back<00:04:03.550> here<00:04:04.550> we

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
turning on the power on the back here we

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.500 
turning on the power on the back here we
go<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:06.310> go<00:04:07.310> ahead<00:04:07.610> here<00:04:07.849> and<00:04:07.970> just<00:04:08.120> turn<00:04:08.300> on<00:04:08.390> my

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
go and go ahead here and just turn on my

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.820 
go and go ahead here and just turn on my
computer<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.870> then<00:04:11.930> now<00:04:12.380> I'm<00:04:12.470> going<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.680> turn

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
computer and then now I'm going to turn

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.530 
computer and then now I'm going to turn
up<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.489> control<00:04:14.450> on<00:04:14.630> my<00:04:14.780> bank<00:04:15.230> controller

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
up the control on my bank controller

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:25.560 
up the control on my bank controller
sorry<00:04:17.540> that<00:04:17.690> lights<00:04:17.900> not<00:04:18.200> from<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.560> fan

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.910 

okay<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.970> actually<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.690> not<00:04:29.020> as<00:04:29.290> allowed<00:04:29.740> as

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
okay so it actually is not as allowed as

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:39.300 
okay so it actually is not as allowed as
I<00:04:30.010> was<00:04:30.160> expecting<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:36.760> is<00:04:38.010> this<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.160> on

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
I was expecting and this is this is on

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.360 
I was expecting and this is this is on
full<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:41.080> but<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.620> nice<00:04:41.740> thing<00:04:41.980> is<00:04:42.010> with<00:04:42.280> my

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
full so but the nice thing is with my

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.550 
full so but the nice thing is with my
fan<00:04:42.610> controller<00:04:42.970> if<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:43.870> see<00:04:44.020> my<00:04:44.170> other<00:04:44.260> video

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
fan controller if you see my other video

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.580 
fan controller if you see my other video
now<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.920> new<00:04:45.190> one<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.580> can<00:04:46.210> just<00:04:46.780> put<00:04:47.290> it<00:04:47.380> on<00:04:47.410> to

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
now the new one I can just put it on to

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.730 
now the new one I can just put it on to
PWM<00:04:48.100> mode<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:49.020> then<00:04:50.020> it's<00:04:50.170> controlled<00:04:50.560> at<00:04:50.710> the

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
PWM mode and then it's controlled at the

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.220 
PWM mode and then it's controlled at the
same<00:04:51.010> speed<00:04:51.250> as<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.790> CPU<00:04:52.420> fan<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.840> so<00:04:52.990> just

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
same speed as the CPU fan and so just

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.160 
same speed as the CPU fan and so just
it'll<00:04:53.530> slow<00:04:53.740> down<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:54.130> as<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.430> CPU<00:04:55.170> detects

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
it'll slow down in as the CPU detects

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.230 
it'll slow down in as the CPU detects
heat<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:58.060> will<00:04:58.330> speed<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.230> up<00:04:59.850> it's<00:05:00.850> back<00:05:01.090> at

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
heat it will speed it up it's back at

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.480 
heat it will speed it up it's back at
full<00:05:01.420> speed<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.950> turn<00:05:03.160> down<00:05:03.190> about<00:05:03.550> half

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
full speed and you turn down about half

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.730 
full speed and you turn down about half
then<00:05:06.490> turn<00:05:06.730> all<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:06.940> way<00:05:07.030> off

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.490 

so<00:05:12.340> this<00:05:12.520> has<00:05:12.640> been<00:05:12.790> my<00:05:12.850> video<00:05:13.500> installation

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
so this has been my video installation

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.360 
so this has been my video installation
of<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:15.040> Fox<00:05:15.790> one<00:05:16.000> PCI<00:05:16.390> card<00:05:16.690> it<00:05:16.990> did<00:05:17.620> move<00:05:18.190> a

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
of the Fox one PCI card it did move a

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.340 
of the Fox one PCI card it did move a
sufficient<00:05:19.000> amount<00:05:19.060> of<00:05:19.270> air<00:05:19.420> and<00:05:19.660> it's<00:05:20.140> not

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
sufficient amount of air and it's not

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.380 
sufficient amount of air and it's not
too<00:05:20.590> loud<00:05:20.770> which<00:05:21.040> is<00:05:21.220> really<00:05:21.490> nice<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:21.910> I'm

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
too loud which is really nice so I'm

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.450 
too loud which is really nice so I'm
gonna<00:05:22.540> pair<00:05:23.050> this<00:05:23.290> one<00:05:23.470> up<00:05:23.620> too<00:05:23.950> for<00:05:24.130> it<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.370> my

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
gonna pair this one up too for it to my

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.460 
gonna pair this one up too for it to my
other<00:05:24.720> card<00:05:25.720> when<00:05:26.080> I<00:05:26.110> run<00:05:26.350> this<00:05:26.500> computer<00:05:26.920> and

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
other card when I run this computer and

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.650 
other card when I run this computer and
that<00:05:29.470> should<00:05:30.130> wear<00:05:30.760> eye<00:05:30.790> shadow<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.300> won't<00:05:31.600> do

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
that should wear eye shadow it won't do

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.880 
that should wear eye shadow it won't do
anything<00:05:31.870> my<00:05:31.960> computer<00:05:32.290> doesn't<00:05:32.410> overheat<00:05:32.650> as

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
anything my computer doesn't overheat as

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.210 
anything my computer doesn't overheat as
it<00:05:33.040> is<00:05:33.160> obviously<00:05:33.640> with<00:05:33.820> 14<00:05:34.540> fans<00:05:34.810> in<00:05:34.990> here<00:05:35.220> but

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
it is obviously with 14 fans in here but

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.310 
it is obviously with 14 fans in here but
I<00:05:36.250> kind<00:05:36.520> of<00:05:36.550> bought<00:05:36.700> it<00:05:36.820> just<00:05:36.850> for<00:05:37.320> giggles

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
I kind of bought it just for giggles

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.180 
I kind of bought it just for giggles
anyway<00:05:39.280> it's<00:05:39.610> a<00:05:39.760> it's<00:05:40.030> a<00:05:40.090> really<00:05:40.270> nice<00:05:40.420> some<00:05:41.190> it

anyway it's a it's a really nice some it
is<00:05:42.310> a<00:05:42.340> really<00:05:42.910> nice<00:05:43.060> cooler<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.200> it<00:05:44.530> does<00:05:44.710> what

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
is a really nice cooler and it does what

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.630 
is a really nice cooler and it does what
it's<00:05:45.280> supposed<00:05:45.550> to<00:05:45.670> do<00:05:45.880> and<00:05:47.220> that's<00:05:48.220> pretty

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
it's supposed to do and that's pretty

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.740 
it's supposed to do and that's pretty
much<00:05:48.730> all<00:05:48.850> I<00:05:48.910> can<00:05:49.120> say<00:05:49.270> because<00:05:49.390> I<00:05:49.570> won't<00:05:49.690> be

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
much all I can say because I won't be

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.990 
much all I can say because I won't be
monitoring<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.230> for<00:05:50.470> speed<00:05:50.800> or<00:05:50.830> anything<00:05:51.040> or

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
monitoring it for speed or anything or

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.610 
monitoring it for speed or anything or
how<00:05:52.390> much<00:05:52.540> air<00:05:52.720> it's<00:05:52.840> moving<00:05:53.050> because<00:05:53.170> I'm<00:05:53.380> not

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
how much air it's moving because I'm not

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.710 
how much air it's moving because I'm not
really<00:05:53.860> gonna<00:05:53.950> be<00:05:54.010> watching<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.690> because<00:05:55.690> I

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
really gonna be watching it because I

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.200 
really gonna be watching it because I
don't<00:05:55.960> really<00:05:56.350> need<00:05:56.470> it<00:05:56.910> anyway<00:05:57.910> thanks<00:05:58.180> for

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
don't really need it anyway thanks for

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.600 
don't really need it anyway thanks for
watching<00:05:58.300> guys
