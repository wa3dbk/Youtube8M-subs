00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.310 
nothing to do with it anymore
and<00:05:33.220> you<00:05:33.550> got<00:05:33.730> to<00:05:33.880> wonder<00:05:34.030> if<00:05:34.450> you<00:05:34.930> get<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.260> a

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
and you got to wonder if you get to a

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.600 
and you got to wonder if you get to a
point<00:05:35.500> where<00:05:35.800> you<00:05:35.950> collect<00:05:36.250> all<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.550> stuff

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
point where you collect all this stuff

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.510 
point where you collect all this stuff
and<00:05:37.060> when<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.240> finally<00:05:37.450> collect<00:05:37.930> it<00:05:38.520> it's

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
and when you finally collect it it's

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.190 
and when you finally collect it it's
just<00:05:39.670> not<00:05:39.850> it<00:05:40.240> doesn't<00:05:40.510> have<00:05:40.660> any<00:05:40.840> meaning<00:05:41.170> to

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
just not it doesn't have any meaning to

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.880 
just not it doesn't have any meaning to
you<00:05:41.320> anymore

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
you anymore

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.160 
you anymore
so<00:05:42.190> you<00:05:42.250> just<00:05:42.460> sell<00:05:42.700> it<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:43.360> I<00:05:43.810> guess<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.140> just

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
so you just sell it and I guess it just

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.080 
so you just sell it and I guess it just
kind<00:05:44.410> of<00:05:44.440> goes<00:05:44.560> back<00:05:44.800> to<00:05:44.860> my<00:05:45.070> topic<00:05:45.520> you<00:05:45.880> buy

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
kind of goes back to my topic you buy

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.820 
kind of goes back to my topic you buy
this<00:05:46.150> stuff<00:05:46.480> just<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.900> collect<00:05:47.170> it<00:05:47.380> or<00:05:47.560> do<00:05:47.710> you
