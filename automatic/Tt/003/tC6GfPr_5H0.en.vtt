00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.459
 in this video we will show briefly 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.969
 how the new double module is sister 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:15.200
 vÃ©lez toys using a CÃ¡diz radio and 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:18.230
 let's show how the 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.869
 radio can copy it clear 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.519
 that will not be perfect perfect 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.800
 because not all helicopters are 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.949
 same but they will have a good base 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.259
 so that at least they can start with the 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.099
 making fine point and taste of each 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.900
 one 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.970
 the helicopter is going to fly but not the 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.380
 better conditions suddenly after 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.480
 each one is going to put more control less 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.650
 command more steps less steps that is very 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.650
 individual of each model 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.510
 what we are going to do first with the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.770
 radio is to press the left button 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.900
 central the menu turn on if you 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.810
 they already have a helicopter here 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.840
 in the case a cube in 450 see what 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.880
 change from model to model 2 to 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.130
 model 3 if you have already programmed the 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.560
 simulator always remember first 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.390
 change the model in this case this was 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.720
 a virgin radio so I'm going to 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.640
 program everything in model 1 and this that 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.229
 is the type of dish they have that 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.770
 place in h l 3 yes yes it is in ap hl 3 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.450
 h of 2 with these right buttons 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.390
 extremes are changing us until 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.210
 come to hl 3 in the model that you 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.510
 they want to program the b 9 22 we squeeze 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.900
 escape 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.900
 and we already have the selected model 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.640
 to the module we are going to place this option 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.179
 this adapter cable that has as a 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.179
 Y 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:55.170
 we plug in here 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.170
 and this sheet we are going to place here 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.610
 we turn on the module from here 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.090
 and we will meet with two lights 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.009
 nobody the sign that is in green 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.720
 means that the module is being 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.700
 receiving signal from the radio equipment if 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.860
 I turn off the radio that light they turn 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.860
 red I turn on the radio 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.010
 the light turns green and this other light 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.070
 that is also in green this read 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.290
 indicates the type of channel layout 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.020
 that the radio team has if we have 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.270
 a radio j of r spectrum we need 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.280
 that this light is in red we press the 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.830
 middle button until it turns red 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.510
 if we have a radio any light 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.910
 it should be off we press 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.450
 one more time and it turns off and our team 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.580
 here says the layout of the channels 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.090
 it's the same as in futaba spoiler on 1 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.950
 elevator 2 motor 3 with 4 and the step in the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.020
 channel 6 so we need that light 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.400
 be in green we press again in 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.489
 green 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.739
 let's turn everything off so much the team 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.530
 radio as the module because to 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.989
 twinning in helicopter we must first 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.090
 feed him and then turn on the 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.920
 radio equipment so we place 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.430
 batteries 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.110
 we plugged it and this model 922 like 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.970
 center to the three turns by requires a 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.400
 little bit quickly in all this what 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.180
 we leave there we light modules and 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 we turn on radio 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.590
 notice that you have to take the signal there 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.110
 took the typical centering of the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.700
 gyroscopes 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.700
 everything is working here 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.840
 I'm going to show how I stay 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.890
 programming to be able to fly the venue 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.560
 22 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:47.950
 we started with the reversals channel one 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:50.709
 normal 2 normal 3 reverse 4 normal 5 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.760
 normal but 4 reverse 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.690
 Now let's repeat because I 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.950
 wrong moral 1 normal 2 normal 3 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.510
 reverse 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.050
 4 reverse 5 normal 6 normal channel 7 no 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.580
 interest 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:12.250
 let's know 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:15.100
 about 100 100 absolutely all except 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 channel 5 that I put it in 120 to give it 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.000
 a little more gain but it's not 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.400
 fundamental if you want you can leave 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.130
 absolutely all in 100 l for if not 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.390
 they touch it there's no problem the next 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.640
 which is the one of the streams I always go 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.640
 going from menu to menu by pressing 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.180
 just the word - notice that you leave 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.180
 all the streams at zero did not touch anything 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.490
 the next one is the dual rate and there it is 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.310
 where you can go and give you more 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.290
 value or less value to these to be able to 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.370
 have the sensitivity that you like 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:53.440
 the amount of command that they like I leave 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:55.960
 160 100 60 100 60 can give more than 100 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.330
 or less than 60 to have difference of 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.560
 there in the dual drive I press once again 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.220
 menu and I meet the 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.640
 exponential to me I like 35% for 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.610
 elevator spoiler and 20% for tails 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.680
 we remember the more exponential the more 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.680
 soft for stationary flight is 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.139
 the trote hole of course that remains 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.870
 at zero I squeeze new menu I find 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.800
 with the gyroscope for a normal good to 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.680
 I stayed in 87 for ela and lab in 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.330
 95 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.669
 the auxiliary is a channel that does not 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.919
 we use we go to the engine for the 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:36.539
 normal curve we have 0 25 50 75 100 the 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.060
 five first points of the curve is 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:42.630
 as it normally comes 7 to the radio 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.780
 factory we went to and from and I put the 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.039
 five points in 100 come back 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.580
 addicts how do you like this 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.280
 helicopter 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.100
 one more and step to step first is the 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.300
 normal curve with its five points 147 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:04.840
 I 'm staying 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:07.060
 this 45 and the next in 47 65 75 90 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:14.889
 now we go to the air which is the most 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:17.139
 delicate we have 25 35 57 75 and 82 and 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.090
 these are the values â€‹â€‹that are perhaps the most 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.580
 to have to play a little each 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.860
 because it is very particular for each 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.659
 model what follows is the auto 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.580
 rotation that in this case does not interest 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:33.039
 because there is a broken car but we were left 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:34.780
 in 35 45 57 65 and 75 we already paid to the plate 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.580
 this is but important these 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.969
 important that you normally cut 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.129
 starts at 50% and is very much in command 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:45.039
 helicopter goes out of control directly 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:46.960
 I can not fly it with more than 36 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.270
 maximum 40 percent but it's very 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.360
 difficult to control it so the mixture 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.240
 of the dish spoiler 36 the elevator 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.729
 stay at 36 and 80 passing through 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.310
 hundred if I give it one more time I go back to 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.560
 the reverse with this programming 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.050
 basic 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:08.040
 they can go plucking to have 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:11.090
 quickly in flight in 1922 with the 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.090
 radio kbs
