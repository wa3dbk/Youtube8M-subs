they want to wait around for that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.240 
they want to wait around for that
opportunity<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.390> run<00:01:06.659> past<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.229> thus<00:01:07.860> they

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
opportunity to run past them thus they

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
opportunity to run past them thus they
camp<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.479> clever<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.990> always

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
camp but you know what clever is always

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.410 
camp but you know what clever is always
running<00:01:10.590> around<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.270> not

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
running around because if you're not

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960 
running around because if you're not
rushing<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.930> you're<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.260> running<00:01:13.830> around<00:01:14.220> if

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
rushing if you're not running around if

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.670 
rushing if you're not running around if
you're<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.270> using<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> map<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.650> your

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you're not using the map to your

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.160 
you're not using the map to your
advantage<00:01:17.159> by<00:01:17.520> searching<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.450> taking<00:01:18.900> people

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
advantage by searching and taking people

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.890 
advantage by searching and taking people
off<00:01:19.320> guard<00:01:19.380> quickly<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.150> no<00:01:21.270> game<00:01:21.540> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
off guard quickly there is no game I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.450 
off guard quickly there is no game I
mean<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.439> everyone<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> sit

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
mean if you if everyone is just to sit

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.840 
mean if you if everyone is just to sit
back<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.299> no<00:01:24.570> game<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
back there would be no game so that is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
back there would be no game so that is
why<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.030> always<00:01:27.509> stir<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> pot<00:01:28.259> rather<00:01:28.650> than

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
why I always stir the pot rather than

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.880 
why I always stir the pot rather than
settle<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> pot<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> mean<00:01:30.890> but

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
settle the pot you know what I mean but

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.950 
settle the pot you know what I mean but
yeah<00:01:32.100> at<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.700> point<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:33.090> watching<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.509> UAV

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.569 
yeah at this point I'm watching my UAV
for<00:01:34.170> indications<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.799> where<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.070> go<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> I

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
for indications as to where to go and I

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
for indications as to where to go and I
did<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.299> bullet<00:01:36.840> ring<00:01:37.200> off<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.590> this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
did see a bullet ring off in this

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.319 
did see a bullet ring off in this
direction<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> nice<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:39.090> kill

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
direction and I got a nice little kill

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.870 
direction and I got a nice little kill
take<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.720> guy<00:01:39.869> by<00:01:40.049> surprise<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.680> i<00:01:41.549> love<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
take that guy by surprise and i love it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
take that guy by surprise and i love it
when<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.060> bullet<00:01:42.299> gets<00:01:42.479> fired<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.020> there

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
when that bullet gets fired and there

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.859 
when that bullet gets fired and there
and<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.610> doesn't<00:01:45.149> kill<00:01:45.240> me<00:01:45.299> because<00:01:45.600> obviously

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and it doesn't kill me because obviously

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.630 
and it doesn't kill me because obviously
that<00:01:46.200> gives<00:01:46.590> me<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> chance<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.159> knife<00:01:47.399> them

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that gives me the chance to knife them

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.889 
that gives me the chance to knife them
because<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.570> don't<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
because i know that they don't have a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.749 
because i know that they don't have a
bullet<00:01:49.290> most<00:01:49.530> likely<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:50.189> could<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.670> an

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
bullet most likely they could have an

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.100 
bullet most likely they could have an
additional<00:01:51.149> bullet<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:51.630> knife<00:01:51.840> someone

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
additional bullet if they knife someone

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.130 
additional bullet if they knife someone
cuz<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> pilot<00:01:52.950> bullets<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:54.180> stack<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:54.930> you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
cuz the pilot bullets they stack if you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.149 
cuz the pilot bullets they stack if you
if<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> kill<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.149> other<00:01:57.540> than<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
if you get a kill but other than that

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.770 
if you get a kill but other than that
it's<00:01:59.159> usually<00:01:59.640> pretty<00:01:59.759> safe<00:02:00.149> once<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.630> hear

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it's usually pretty safe once you hear

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's usually pretty safe once you hear
that<00:02:00.899> bullet<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.320> run<00:02:01.469> out<00:02:01.590> there<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.950> nice

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
that bullet to run out there and nice

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.429 
that bullet to run out there and nice
them<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.390> i<00:02:03.540> am<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> five

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
them and as you can see i am on a five

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.380 
them and as you can see i am on a five
point<00:02:04.920> streak<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.670> there's<00:02:05.909> nothing<00:02:06.090> going

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
point streak and there's nothing going

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.210 
point streak and there's nothing going
on<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> map<00:02:06.899> right<00:02:07.079> now<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:08.099> know

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
on on the map right now and you know

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.559 
on on the map right now and you know
rightfully<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.849> there's<00:02:09.119> probably<00:02:09.209> only<00:02:09.479> like

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
rightfully so there's probably only like

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.020 
rightfully so there's probably only like
four<00:02:09.840> people<00:02:10.170> left<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.640> guy<00:02:11.819> up

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
a distance and run out of because he's

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.230 
a distance and run out of because he's
not<00:02:16.000> watching<00:02:16.390> his<00:02:16.690> back<00:02:16.930> son<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.580> yeah<00:02:18.850> that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
leaves the UAV to show two more

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.010 
leaves the UAV to show two more
survivors<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.300> one<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.480> them<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.630> actually

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
survivors and one of them is actually

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.080 
survivors and one of them is actually
about<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.380> die<00:02:23.530> right<00:02:23.560> now<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.370> am<00:02:24.730> checking

about to die right now so I am checking

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.420 
about to die right now so I am checking
the<00:02:25.630> score<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.380> can<00:02:26.560> see<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.010> final

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
the score and I can see that this final

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.760 
the score and I can see that this final
survivor<00:02:27.730> has<00:02:28.150> two<00:02:28.510> lives<00:02:28.780> left<00:02:28.900> while<00:02:29.320> i<00:02:29.350> only
