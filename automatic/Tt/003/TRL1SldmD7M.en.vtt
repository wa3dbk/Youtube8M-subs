00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.280
Geoff: Ah, that hurts so bad...

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.920
Gavin: Right, you gotta end up stood on the same leg, but with your other leg behind you.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.460

Griffon: Hold on, let me get ready.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.360
Griffon: I'll stretch.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.460
Gavin: I don't wanna be held responsible if you break stuff.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.780
Gavin: Was that you stretching?

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.060
*Griffon laughing*

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.840
Griffon: Alright *Giggle* That's enough of that!

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.480
Griffon: Oh! I didn't stand up again, but I got over my leg!

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.920
Gavin: That was good I mean yo-

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.920
Griffin: And it didn't hurt.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.780
Geoff: I did that and he didn't say it was good.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.760
Griffin: No, it hurts...

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.200
*Gavin laughing*

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.720
Gavin: Hows- Hows your spine?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.460
Griffon: My whole right side is paralysed!

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.000
Gavin: Did you just break your back?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.160
Griffon: Uhm, No but I think i'm no longer able to use this section of my body.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.080
Gavin: So you have to be..stood up when you finish, OK?

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.160
Griffon: Oh!...No, Oh!

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.980
Geoff: You OK?

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.080
Griffon: I hope so.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.540
Geoff: Is that it, you've given up?

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.040
*Gavin and Griffon laugh*

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.860
Gavin: So..

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.040
Gavin: You were just on camera, and you like broke your hand open.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.080
Griffon: Can I get some ice?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.660
Gavin: Yeah.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.400
Griffon: Ah!

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.320
Gavin: It might be broken.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.140
Geoff: Can I point out that-
Gavin: So- So Team- Team leg jump.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.780
Gavin: Geoff, you uh- you took 4 attempts.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.780
Geoff: But I did it!
Gavin: And uh- you-

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.240
Gavin: You made-
Griffin: 4 attempts?!

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.800
Geoff: But I did it.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.320
Gavin: You made what was the loudest thud on the ground I've ever heard.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.400
Gavin: Griffon, you jumped over your leg every time but you...broke your finger in half.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.700
Griffon: Yeah, landing is not my strong point.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.140
Geoff: I'd like to-
Griffon: I think i fucked it up.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.700
*Gavin laughs*
Griffon: I think I fucked up!

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.660
Geoff: I'd like to point out that at the end, I did it...

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.220
Geoff: And...
Gavin: Yeah! You did do it.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.380
Gavin: although my phone crashed and kinda didn't show it but..

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.940
*All laugh*

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.820
Geoff: I'd also- I'd also like to point out that..

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.680
Geoff: DICK PUNCH!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.560
*Gavin in pain*

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.940
Gavin: He got me in the gennies!

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.120
Gavin: He got me right in the genitalia.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.840
Griffon: I'm sorry.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.020
Gavin: Got a feeling he got me in the nob.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.020
*Gavin and Griffon laugh*

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.240
Gavin: We're all in pain now.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.600
Griffon: Yeah.
Gavin: Except for Geoff..

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.800
Griffon: So it was an unsuccessful evening.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.660
Gavin: Yeah, Geoff's not in pain!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.400
Griffon: Let's figure out a new challenge for him.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.380
Gavin: You've got a bent finger and i've got a bent cock.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.400
*Griffon laughs*

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.760
Griffon: We match!

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.940
*Both laugh*

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.480
Gavin: Ahh shit.
Griffon: Ah it hurts so bad.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.260
Geoff: Uhhh last night was a mistake..

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.220
*Griffon laughs*

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.460
Geoff: I can't feel my leg.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.440
Griffon: Lemme see.
Geoff: Alright.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.440
Geoff: I can go like this, and then..Ah Ah OK!

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.620
Geoff: That's as far as it goes.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.240
Griffon: Look at what you did to my finger.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.400
Gavin: I feel bad, but i did say before you broke your finger "I won't be held responsible for anything you BREAK"

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.460
Gavin: So..I cleared myself on that one.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.860
Griffon: Ya' know what..Gavin?

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.560
Griffon: You're an asshole.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.840
Gavin: He punched me in the nob.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.300
Griffon: Thank you for doing that.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.960
Millie: Uhh, I can-

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.380
Griffon: Well you saw daddy fall on his face!

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.080
Millie: Yeah.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.220
Geoff: How did you feel about that?

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.080
Millie: *Giggles* Silly..

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.680
Geoff: Yeah, silly.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.760
Griffon: You're a bad influence.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.640
Gavin: I am, that's why i'm here.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.180
Geoff: They're trying to take America back, one drunken family at a time.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.080
*All laugh*

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.220
Griffon: I've never had an X-ray before.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.940
Doctor: Oh really?

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.660
Griffon: Yeah, it's my first one.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.540
Doctor: Wow, damn that's cool.
Griffon: Yeah, very exciting.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.960
Griffon: Oh, awesome.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.280
Doctor: Let me blow it up for ya.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.540
Doctor: OK, so we're looking at uh, this finger right here.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.940
Doctor: So how did you do this?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.940
Griffon: Uhm, my friend dared me to jump over my own leg...and uh, I didn't land it-

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.700
Griffon: and when I was trying to catch myself from falling, I hit my hand against the wall and it snapped my finger sideways.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.340
Doctor: Well we all do silly things due to peer pressure from time to time.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.360
Griffon: I'm a little old for peer pressure, but I guess i'm still affected by it.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.380
Doctor: Yeah.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.440
*Griffon laughs*

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.380
Griffon: I guess I have 2 fractures, 2 little like small fractures in the knuckle.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.040
Griffon: It's in place still but uhm, they're cracked, my knuckles cracked-

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.080
Griffon: So i'm gonna have to go see some specialist about it and probably do physical therapy..

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.820
Griffon: So I don't have arthritis later.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.360
*Griffon sighs*

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.800
Griffon: Thanks Gavin..
