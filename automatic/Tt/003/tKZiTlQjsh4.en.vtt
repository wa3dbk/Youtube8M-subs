on pace on down and distance we're down
distance<00:00:59.620> is<00:00:59.710> concerned<00:01:00.070> these<00:01:00.610> guys<00:01:00.790> gonna

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
distance is concerned these guys gonna

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.340 
distance is concerned these guys gonna
have<00:01:01.210> room<00:01:01.390> back<00:01:01.629> there<00:01:01.659> to<00:01:02.140> throw<00:01:02.260> the

well<00:01:46.480> they<00:01:47.110> spread<00:01:47.410> teams<00:01:47.680> out<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.100> they

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
well they spread teams out and they

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.710 
well they spread teams out and they
attack<00:01:48.520> vertically<00:01:49.180> down<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.450> field<00:01:49.630> they

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
attack vertically down the field they

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.910 
attack vertically down the field they
don't<00:01:49.870> dink<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.290> dunk<00:01:50.320> their<00:01:50.590> way<00:01:50.710> down<00:01:50.890> the

don't dink and dunk their way down the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.250 
don't dink and dunk their way down the
field<00:01:51.040> like<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.970> Buffalo<00:01:52.450> Bills<00:01:52.690> these<00:01:53.080> guys

field like the Buffalo Bills these guys
attack<00:01:53.650> vertically<00:01:54.159> so<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.580> look<00:01:54.730> at<00:01:54.820> those

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
attack vertically so you look at those

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.250 
attack vertically so you look at those
corners<00:01:55.360> they're<00:01:55.540> going<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.750> have<00:01:55.870> to<00:01:55.960> step<00:01:56.140> up

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260

AJ Green keep him busy at the line of

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.649 
AJ Green keep him busy at the line of
scrimmage<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.940> want<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.180> make<00:02:01.330> him<00:02:01.480> go<00:02:01.510> to

call well making rules guys and that's

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.490 
call well making rules guys and that's
why<00:02:05.680> I<00:02:05.710> think<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.430> Texas<00:02:07.019> have<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.170> come<00:02:08.349> in

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
why I think the Texas have to come in

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.770 
why I think the Texas have to come in
and<00:02:08.679> make<00:02:08.830> sure<00:02:08.860> their<00:02:09.220> secondary<00:02:09.700> has<00:02:10.569> to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
and make sure their secondary has to

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.949 
and make sure their secondary has to
play<00:02:10.959> their<00:02:11.140> best<00:02:11.170> game<00:02:11.620> all<00:02:12.370> season<00:02:12.930> take<00:02:13.930> a

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
play their best game all season take a

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.080 
play their best game all season take a
look<00:02:14.110> at<00:02:14.260> cincinnati's<00:02:15.010> keys<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.519> victory<00:02:15.730> see

look at cincinnati's keys to victory see

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.000 
look at cincinnati's keys to victory see
how<00:02:16.300> they<00:02:16.480> can<00:02:16.540> maintain<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.230> stranglehold

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
how they can maintain that stranglehold

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.119 
how they can maintain that stranglehold
on<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.790> six<00:02:19.060> playoff<00:02:19.330> spot<00:02:19.799> when<00:02:20.799> I<00:02:20.830> look<00:02:21.040> at

being i think the bengals will come in

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.250 
being i think the bengals will come in
and<00:04:08.010> take<00:04:08.190> at<00:04:08.370> least<00:04:08.910> three<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.660> four<00:04:09.690> shots

deep<00:04:10.620> down<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.010> field<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.370> safety<00:04:11.850> play

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
deep down the field so that safety play
