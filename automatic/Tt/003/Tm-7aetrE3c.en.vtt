00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
don't have the receipt I really really

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.850 
don't have the receipt I really really
like<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:23.960> hair<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:24.440> hair<00:00:24.650> it's<00:00:24.800> really

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
like the hair and the hair it's really

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.410 
like the hair and the hair it's really
soft

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
soft

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.260 
soft
it<00:00:27.080> was<00:00:27.230> $5.99<00:00:28.040> plus<00:00:28.340> tax<00:00:28.760> for<00:00:29.690> each<00:00:29.870> pack<00:00:30.290> and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
it was $5.99 plus tax for each pack and

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.240 
it was $5.99 plus tax for each pack and
like<00:00:32.270> I<00:00:32.300> said<00:00:32.599> it's<00:00:32.750> just<00:00:32.780> really<00:00:33.079> soft<00:00:33.500> this

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
like I said it's just really soft this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:44.680 
like I said it's just really soft this
is<00:00:34.309> how<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.640> hair<00:00:34.940> look

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.779 

on<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.170> package<00:00:45.590> it<00:00:45.800> does<00:00:45.859> say<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:46.309> can<00:00:46.579> use

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
on the package it does say you can use

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.389 
on the package it does say you can use
heat<00:00:47.120> I<00:00:47.269> do<00:00:47.359> plan<00:00:47.840> on<00:00:47.899> using<00:00:48.109> heat<00:00:48.620> under<00:00:49.399> here

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
heat I do plan on using heat under here

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.920 
heat I do plan on using heat under here
like<00:00:52.399> I<00:00:52.519> said<00:00:52.550> it<00:00:52.940> would<00:00:53.210> have<00:00:53.329> probably<00:00:53.719> had

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
like I said it would have probably had

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.599 
like I said it would have probably had
some<00:00:54.199> shedding<00:00:54.710> but<00:00:54.949> that<00:00:55.159> was<00:00:55.280> okay<00:00:55.579> because

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
some shedding but that was okay because

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.790 
some shedding but that was okay because
it's<00:00:56.180> not<00:00:56.329> like<00:00:56.510> I'm<00:00:56.690> leaving<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:57.109> hair<00:00:57.320> in<00:00:57.530> for

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
it's not like I'm leaving a hair in for

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.180 
it's not like I'm leaving a hair in for
a<00:00:57.829> really<00:00:58.010> long<00:00:58.219> time<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.860> shedding

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
a really long time and the shedding

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.130 
a really long time and the shedding
probably<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:02.000> due<00:01:02.269> to<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.570> fact<00:01:02.809> that<00:01:02.899> it's

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
probably is due to the fact that it's

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.710 
probably is due to the fact that it's
loose<00:01:03.829> it's<00:01:04.159> not<00:01:04.280> like<00:01:04.610> one<00:01:04.850> attract<00:01:05.210> anything

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
loose it's not like one attract anything

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.859 
loose it's not like one attract anything
so<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.350> course<00:01:06.560> you're<00:01:06.740> gonna<00:01:06.799> get<00:01:07.039> some<00:01:07.869> hair

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
so of course you're gonna get some hair

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.070 
so of course you're gonna get some hair
coming<00:01:09.110> off<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.940> reason<00:01:11.299> why<00:01:11.450> I'm<00:01:11.600> taking<00:01:11.810> it

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
coming off the reason why I'm taking it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.160 
coming off the reason why I'm taking it
back<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.530> because<00:01:12.740> it's<00:01:13.220> too<00:01:13.580> soft<00:01:14.060> when<00:01:14.810> I<00:01:14.869> try

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
back is because it's too soft when I try

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.190 
back is because it's too soft when I try
to<00:01:15.200> crochet<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:16.640> tried<00:01:17.630> with<00:01:17.840> just<00:01:18.020> one

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
to crochet it and I tried with just one

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.669 
to crochet it and I tried with just one
pack<00:01:18.500> yesterday<00:01:21.819> crocheting<00:01:22.819> it<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.679> the

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
pack yesterday crocheting it and the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.639 
pack yesterday crocheting it and the
knots<00:01:25.069> wouldn't<00:01:25.580> stay<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.300> I<00:01:27.020> was<00:01:27.259> looking<00:01:27.530> up

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
knots wouldn't stay and I was looking up

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.410 
knots wouldn't stay and I was looking up
on<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> few<00:01:28.250> pumps<00:01:28.490> about<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.300> they<00:01:29.360> were

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
on a few pumps about it and they were

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.770 
on a few pumps about it and they were
saying<00:01:29.720> like<00:01:29.929> um<00:01:30.520> use<00:01:31.520> nail<00:01:31.850> glue<00:01:31.880> but<00:01:32.479> I'm<00:01:32.600> not

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
saying like um use nail glue but I'm not

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.480 
saying like um use nail glue but I'm not
comfortable<00:01:33.289> putting<00:01:33.440> nail<00:01:33.770> glue<00:01:34.039> in<00:01:34.220> my<00:01:34.250> hair

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
comfortable putting nail glue in my hair

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.789 
comfortable putting nail glue in my hair
just<00:01:35.479> because<00:01:35.780> if<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.140> nail<00:01:36.289> glue<00:01:36.530> just

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
just because if the nail glue just

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.620 
just because if the nail glue just
doesn't<00:01:37.190> get<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.549> this<00:01:37.759> hair<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.330> gets<00:01:38.509> on

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
doesn't get on this hair and it gets on

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.309 
doesn't get on this hair and it gets on
my<00:01:38.840> hair

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
my hair

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.919 
my hair
it'll<00:01:39.770> be<00:01:39.860> throughout<00:01:40.159> my<00:01:40.369> entire<00:01:40.429> day<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.810> I

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
it'll be throughout my entire day and I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.380 
it'll be throughout my entire day and I
wasn't<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.350> didn't<00:01:42.590> want<00:01:42.709> to<00:01:42.799> chance<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.390> and

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
wasn't I didn't want to chance that and

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.820 
wasn't I didn't want to chance that and
especially<00:01:44.659> since<00:01:44.959> I'm<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.289> one<00:01:45.500> that's

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
especially since I'm the one that's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.190 
especially since I'm the one that's
doing<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.789> don't<00:01:47.330> think<00:01:47.450> I'm<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.659> chance<00:01:47.990> and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
doing it I don't think I'm a chance and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.959 
doing it I don't think I'm a chance and
if<00:01:48.289> someone<00:01:48.590> else<00:01:48.710> was<00:01:48.950> doing<00:01:49.039> it<00:01:49.219> but<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:49.670> think

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
if someone else was doing it but I think

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.700 
if someone else was doing it but I think
that<00:01:50.299> they<00:01:50.390> will<00:01:50.570> have<00:01:50.719> a<00:01:50.869> better<00:01:51.049> precision

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
that they will have a better precision

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.170 
that they will have a better precision
of<00:01:52.100> where<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.700> glue<00:01:52.909> is<00:01:53.270> opposed<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.380> me<00:01:55.180> so

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
of where the glue is opposed to me so

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.969 
of where the glue is opposed to me so
hopefully<00:01:56.659> they<00:01:56.810> allow<00:01:57.020> me<00:01:57.079> to<00:01:57.350> take<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.740> back

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
hopefully they allow me to take it back

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.679 
hopefully they allow me to take it back
since<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:58.549> don't<00:01:58.759> have<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.000> receipt<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.539> was

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
since I don't have the receipt and I was

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.200 
since I don't have the receipt and I was
just<00:01:59.840> there<00:02:00.049> last<00:02:00.170> like<00:02:00.649> I'm<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.909> is<00:02:02.149> my

all<00:02:05.240> my<00:02:05.659> edges<00:02:06.079> are<00:02:06.320> out<00:02:08.920> my<00:02:09.920> edges<00:02:10.310> aren't<00:02:10.579> out

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
all my edges are out my edges aren't out

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.300 
all my edges are out my edges aren't out
our<00:02:11.840> should<00:02:12.200> have<00:02:12.320> left<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.709> edge<00:02:12.890> around

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
our should have left the edge around

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.120 
our should have left the edge around
here<00:02:13.820> output<00:02:14.060> that's<00:02:14.510> okay<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:15.049> have<00:02:15.530> my<00:02:15.560> back

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
here output that's okay I have my back

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.310 
here output that's okay I have my back
out<00:02:17.380> it's<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.470> in<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.709> ponytail<00:02:23.079> edges<00:02:24.079> and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
out it's just in a ponytail edges and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.800 
out it's just in a ponytail edges and
then<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:24.890> have<00:02:25.070> this<00:02:25.310> side<00:02:25.640> out<00:02:25.850> I'm<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.630> reason

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
then I have this side out I'm the reason

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.630 
then I have this side out I'm the reason
why<00:02:26.989> I<00:02:27.019> have<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.440> middle<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.010> sides<00:02:28.250> because

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
why I have a middle in the sides because

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.090 
why I have a middle in the sides because
I<00:02:28.910> want<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.299> be<00:02:29.390> able<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.600> switch<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.019> up<00:02:30.109> and<00:02:30.470> I

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
I want to be able to switch it up and I

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.890 
I want to be able to switch it up and I
have<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.489> still<00:02:31.670> look<00:02:31.850> natural<00:02:32.269> so<00:02:32.299> if<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.630> put

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
have it still look natural so if I put

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.140 
have it still look natural so if I put
if<00:02:33.109> I<00:02:33.620> haven't<00:02:34.010> going<00:02:34.190> down<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.519> middle<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:34.940> can

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
if I haven't going down the middle I can

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.819 
if I haven't going down the middle I can
still<00:02:35.450> separated<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:37.150> blended<00:02:38.150> like<00:02:38.299> that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
still separated and blended like that

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.230 
still separated and blended like that
