vocoder enhancement on and GarageBand

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.959 
vocoder enhancement on and GarageBand
for<00:00:59.430> some<00:00:59.820> reason<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.309> if<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.489> ever<00:01:02.670> heard<00:01:02.940> me

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
for some reason so if you ever heard me

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.770 
for some reason so if you ever heard me
like<00:01:03.329> yelling<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.199> Pikachu<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.729> suck<00:01:06.210> or

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
like yelling for Pikachu or you suck or

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.740 
like yelling for Pikachu or you suck or
something<00:01:07.140> animated<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> would<00:01:08.010> auto-tune<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
something animated it would auto-tune it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.719 
something animated it would auto-tune it
and<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.350> realized<00:01:10.830> how<00:01:11.040> crappy<00:01:11.549> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
and I just realized how crappy that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.960 
and I just realized how crappy that
sound<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.020> yeah<00:01:13.260> I'd<00:01:14.220> fixed<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.760> so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
sound and but yeah I'd fixed that so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.100 
sound and but yeah I'd fixed that so
that<00:01:15.150> hopefully<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.720> shouldn't<00:01:15.990> happen

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that hopefully that shouldn't happen

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.440 
that hopefully that shouldn't happen
anymore<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.280> guys<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.030> me<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
anymore but if you guys would like me to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
anymore but if you guys would like me to
auto-tune<00:01:19.049> an<00:01:19.200> entire<00:01:19.530> commentary<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.430> for

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
guys want me to go the full 15 minutes I

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.260 
guys want me to go the full 15 minutes I
would<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.230> more<00:02:15.470> than<00:02:15.560> happy<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.890> do<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
would be more than happy to do so and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.690 
would be more than happy to do so and
I'll<00:02:17.750> try<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:17.960> trim<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.410> down<00:02:18.440> as<00:02:18.710> well<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.220> we

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
I'll try to trim it down as well so we

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.980 
I'll try to trim it down as well so we
can<00:02:19.850> pack<00:02:20.060> as<00:02:20.240> much<00:02:20.450> out<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.720> game<00:02:20.870> as

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
can pack as much out the game as

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.510 
can pack as much out the game as
possible<00:02:21.440> into<00:02:21.530> one<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.860> these<00:02:21.950> because<00:02:22.190> this

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
possible into one of these because this

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.720 
possible into one of these because this
is<00:02:22.640> going<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.910> take<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.360> lot<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.730> separate

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
is going to take a lot of separate

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.340 
is going to take a lot of separate
episodes<00:02:26.210> in<00:02:26.720> order<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.050> get<00:02:27.170> through<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
episodes in order to get through the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.860 
episodes in order to get through the
entire<00:02:27.620> game<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.220> mean<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.210> takes<00:02:29.360> hours<00:02:29.720> to

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
entire game I mean it takes hours to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.770 
entire game I mean it takes hours to
complete<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:30.380> kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.620> obvious

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
complete it's kind of obvious

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.260 
complete it's kind of obvious
so<00:02:32.780> we<00:02:33.200> are<00:02:33.410> ever<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:34.640> close<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.120> getting

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
so we are ever so close to getting

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.790 
so we are ever so close to getting
Metapod<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.140> whole<00:02:36.350> 10<00:02:36.650> there<00:02:37.190> he<00:02:37.340> goes

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
Metapod up the whole 10 there he goes

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.130
