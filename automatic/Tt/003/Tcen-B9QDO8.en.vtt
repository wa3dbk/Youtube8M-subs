00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.540
 at 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.950
 sometimes listens to their age as half 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.310
 final so it's not obvious he finally 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310
 be careful 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.140
 obviously and who as 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.140
 measure I think we will not really 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.539
 our goal is essentially the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.860
 rally raid the desert races these 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.530
 little layers of baja are nice 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.679
 because it federates people 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.280
 to develop machines and have fun at 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.280
 less than 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.600
 fun it's a vehicle that goes everywhere 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.250
 everyone everywhere going down 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.820
 everywhere they swallow most of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.460
 barriers 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.990
 we still feel safe with the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.970
 protective bars the chassis 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.140
 tubular which is also nice I 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.270
 think there are people who ride to 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.850
 two so happens to share a moment to 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.380
 share sensations 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.500
 I who come from the bike it's true that 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.690
 it is 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.290
 it's something that I liked 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.290
 beginning 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.189
 to cars we have a rally raid 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.810
 it's also effective while one like 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.560
 the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.510
 one all these sandy lands 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.290
 or then the Moroccan tracks there are 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.870
 many changes of direction 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.680
 with very French tracks 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.870
 since there are clearances that 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.239
 ignites pretty interesting now 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.010
 the big lack of ssb is the speed 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.420
 peak but good 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.340
 we work on it and then we hope we 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.340
 can evolve all that then 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.390
 it's still a parked vehicle 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.020
 power weight ratio which is easy to 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.430
 bring back then on a test of 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.800
 an automatic transmission is so it's 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.580
 true it's super easy to take 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.210
 its brands 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.590
 after hey, you have to go on 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.420
 speed is the time to learn in the 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.980
 vehicle and terrain but it's 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.980
 natives who are very tactical 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.700
 with 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
 here 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.820
 another via a channel that was put 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.209
 in his exits manually we did not 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.500
 not completed 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.199
 so we did not make it to Lille 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.639
 had a room to change go out the 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.160
 machine one repaired at engineered knew that 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.820
 troubleshoot them to get out their machine 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.639
 is called solidarity 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.410
 it goes 10 relative to each other there 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.560
 had a guy from jps next to me 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.570
 to help me out he was giving a dumpling 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.500
 we're stopped while he's here 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.980
 there is still a lot like that in the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.980
 that's the hecatomb 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.720
 the other years I wanted with my 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.890
 brother-in-law is me the most handsome brother 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.310
 and with my sister I am handsome he is 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.940
 fresh at us there is no such thing 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.560
 test 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.180
 now there is a small championship 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.660
 which has been in place for two years or 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.190
 three years is not good bajas 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.630
 could very well now do the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.610
 championship at home but we no longer 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.010
 of friends in the world of csv in 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.030
 france as in belgium so how 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.030
 enjoy it well we continue to see 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.160
 we did not hear about in France yesterday 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.330
 races we went to do with a 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.560
 completely original machine one is 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.940
 went to do the front page to the tower and 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.050
 we won the first battle there he goes 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.690
 commit at least 60 and his sensations 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.490
 the first over 120 we hung 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.490
 directly we were hot 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.300
 madonna solve our problem is a 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.690
 mystery begins to dry kind is 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.729
 love 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.050
 see the problem is they have 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:00.520
 planted your choice 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.520
 but like his series hot hot 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.160
 we gave ourselves the year 2014 all ways 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.650
 to develop the machine for the 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.540
 test on the badges know nothing it's 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.060
 not good for the win otherwise would 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:22.750
 lived a super light she can like 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.670
 they all have lived there who over 150 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.810
 kg more than the others but it's a 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.550
 big handicap 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.850
 but it's with the desert to separate 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:39.340
 baja vehicle was off again we 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:41.080
 does here at least to report the 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.460
 believe you want to change I had everything 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.570
 I was asked on the thing we shop 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.400
 can work to find the bolts 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:51.220
 and I was in the mud I did not follow 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.600
 I do not want to see everything but I do not see 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.430
 put the cnegi but they hit me 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.260
 all in I will remind that I demens 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.260
 all that is barely sustainable is 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.979
 like that was typing in the abyss mixer 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.979
 bun in the direction
