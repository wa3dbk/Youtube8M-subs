opened the packaging but I haven't

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.119 
opened the packaging but I haven't
looked<00:00:41.760> inside<00:00:42.180> yet<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
looked inside yet so this is what you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.139 
looked inside yet so this is what you
see<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:49.100> pour<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.190> all<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.489> contents

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
interesting thought it was gonna be

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.210 
interesting thought it was gonna be
played<00:02:44.700> maybe<00:02:45.700> I'll<00:02:45.910> turn<00:02:46.090> blue<00:02:46.330> later<00:02:47.220> magic

Japanese<00:02:48.760> stuff<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.970> after<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.780> we<00:02:53.620> mix<00:02:54.400> it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
Japanese stuff so after that we mix it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.920 
Japanese stuff so after that we mix it
right<00:02:57.010> think<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.980> so<00:03:00.210> it<00:03:01.210> doesn't<00:03:01.510> really<00:03:01.630> say

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
right think so so it doesn't really say

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.720 
right think so so it doesn't really say
to<00:03:01.990> mix<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.680> packaging<00:03:03.190> but<00:03:03.490> I'm<00:03:03.580> gonna

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
to mix on the packaging but I'm gonna

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.140 
to mix on the packaging but I'm gonna
mix<00:03:03.940> anyways

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.380 

not<00:03:13.150> thermally<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> guess<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.820> I'm<00:03:15.910> gonna<00:03:16.090> put

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
not thermally I guess so I'm gonna put

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:24.510 
not thermally I guess so I'm gonna put
the<00:03:16.840> package<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> room<00:03:17.740> Burchill<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:24.310> can

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
the package in the room Burchill you can

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:34.770 
the package in the room Burchill you can
really<00:03:24.790> smell<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.180> already<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.600> we're<00:03:34.750> just

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
really smell it already so we're just

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:48.090 
really smell it already so we're just
gonna<00:03:35.110> mix<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.710> now<00:03:46.530> then<00:03:47.530> look<00:03:47.860> that

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
gonna mix it now then look that

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:59.160 
gonna mix it now then look that
appetizing<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.900> far<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:58.420> it's<00:03:58.810> just<00:03:58.930> really

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
appetizing so far so it's just really

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.820 
appetizing so far so it's just really
awkward<00:03:59.440> when<00:03:59.860> it's<00:04:00.010> so<00:04:00.160> quiet<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.590> great

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
awkward when it's so quiet so the great

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.660 
awkward when it's so quiet so the great
one<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.280> tasted<00:04:06.640> like<00:04:06.700> phony<00:04:07.180> grape<00:04:07.780> flavors<00:04:08.320> I

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
one it tasted like phony grape flavors I

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.830 
one it tasted like phony grape flavors I
didn't<00:04:09.670> really<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.210> much<00:04:10.360> when<00:04:10.780> I

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
didn't really like it that much when I

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.800 
didn't really like it that much when I
finished<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.380> whole<00:04:11.410> thing<00:04:11.620> anyways<00:04:12.690> cuz<00:04:13.690> I

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
finished the whole thing anyways cuz I

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.420 
finished the whole thing anyways cuz I
thought<00:04:14.020> it<00:04:14.170> would<00:04:14.290> be<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.500> waste<00:04:14.770> if<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:15.190> didn't

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
thought it would be a waste if I didn't

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.970 
thought it would be a waste if I didn't
seems<00:04:18.430> like<00:04:18.730> it's<00:04:18.940> almost<00:04:19.540> finish<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.680> it's

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
seems like it's almost finish so it's

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.960 
seems like it's almost finish so it's
pretty<00:04:24.250> thick<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:28.870> smells<00:04:29.410> really<00:04:29.620> strong

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
pretty thick and it smells really strong

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.410 
pretty thick and it smells really strong
