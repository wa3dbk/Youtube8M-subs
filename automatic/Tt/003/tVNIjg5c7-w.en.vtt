00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.349
 change brake pads suzuki samurai 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:13.059
 first what you have to do is take out 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.170
 the obvious wheel once the wheel 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:20.170
 have outside 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:26.529
 you have to catch and take out these two 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.529
 screws that you have here 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.890
 I do not know if it will look good 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.890
 this one here 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.150
 this important here to get this 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.650
 first because if you take out the ones that hold 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.460
 the clamp 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.460
 these here that I have not dropped 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 these 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.640
 these here that go 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.710
 in these holes you can not get 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.280
 these two screws for things move to the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.500
 pinza you can not get it out 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.500
 once you have these two screws 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.090
 these 2 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.440
 It is very easy 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.030
 take out the clamp the clamp would come out 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:33.130
 upwards as you can see important 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.730
 before pulling the caliper pull the piston 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.760
 as far back as possible 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.510
 to be able to place the new shoes 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.620
 which are thicker 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.940
 you place 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.170
 the two shoes in their place very easy and 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.100
 put the clamp back 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.100
 in its place 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.110
 You see the piece in its place very easy 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.420
 to make sure you I noticed that these 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.420
 little blue screws 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.750
 the thread sealer try to buy it 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.230
 what I use is mural 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.360
 18 I think it's a rock lord 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.730
 pretty good to avoid these 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.220
 small screws tightened with headquarters 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.820
 vibrations the potholes and so on with the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.820
 danger that entails 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.690
 when removing the two screws from the clamp 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.910
 you fix here there are fixer 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.910
 thread threading stations 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.530
 well it is advisable to put it to avoid 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.140
 vibrations 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.360
 and good bumps that these two screws 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.780
 I disappear what I use 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.780
 is 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.510
 at 50 it's like a special glue that 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.540
 is not as strong as the tite and avoids 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.680
 that the screws 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.680
 loosen up 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.010
 let's put the mural 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.010
 already put these screws 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.880
 with a few drops is enough does not 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.880
 miss you 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.020
 once 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.650
 presented the screws 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:40.510
 we will put the ones that hold the clamp for 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.510
 then put to treat it well 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:54.010
 once you have some screws 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.140
 that hold this the clamp will be fixed 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.110
 Y 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.240
 we will press 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.260
 with a 19 key 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.260
 the screws 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.850
 they hold the clip to the disc 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.850
 one 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.390
 and 2 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.600
 just need to place the wheel and very 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.330
 important to verify that the liquid 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.490
 brakes have risen to the level set 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.260
 if you have no loss no 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.190
 no liquid will have to be filled 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.630
 assemble the wheel and test the brakes 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.560
 before leaving the road to stain some 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.400
 how many times and check 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:58.670
 that the car brakes correctly and until 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.860
 Here is the link on how to change 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.539
 the brake pads 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.539
 of a samurai suzuki 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.600
 this rich 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:19.820
 photo dedicates the chip with its moral 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.820
 I hope to serve as a great help
