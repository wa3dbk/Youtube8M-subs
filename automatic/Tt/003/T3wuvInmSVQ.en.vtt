00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.330
 vice president of ideology and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.639
 vice president of party campaign 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.200

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.330
 point out that they respect the decision made 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.650
 by the general prosecutor of judicial and zara 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.020
 the case of the former president of the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 republic francisco flÃ³rez from 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.250
 there they say they are of the opinion that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.330
 follow a due process of law and it will be 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.670
 the judicial body who determines whether 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.040
 whether or not the former president is guilty 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.200
 we must let the institutions 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.270
 operate, I believe that in that sense 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.540
 president francisco flowers as he 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.649
 will know how to handle the case and you have to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.690
 have confidence in the institutionality 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 of the country when asking these leaders 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.559
 of the tricolor if they expelled or not 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.989
 francisco flowers of the party as they 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.550
 caution that said decision does not 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.550
 it will be taken by the national executive council 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.230
 of sand that will depend on the court of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.640
 ethics with whom we have not had 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.620
 Contact 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.239
 we must also be respectful of the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.129
 instance corresponding to the interior 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.229
 of the match his criteria should or should not 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.489
 expel francisco sand flowers there 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.470
 that let the institution function 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.659
 the ready state of the entire court of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.979
 ethics of the party and this one has to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.020
 operate as established by the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.400
 statutes but not only the cohen has 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.080
 reacted on the subject and that is 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.580
 also the former presidential candidate of the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.110
 tricolor norman quijano who in his 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.970
 moment asked the court of ethics of 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.220
 party that momentarily withdrew 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.670
 privileges to francisco flores talked about 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.190
 case and yes it did with caution I 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.560
 I do not know the judicial requirement 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.050
 the prosecution has done the only thing that I see 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.940
 is that the institutions have started to 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.860
 work in this particular case not 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.420
 I have more comment also with 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.090
 caution I think about whether or not you should 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.649
 eject be tricolor flowers all your 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.539
 criterion should or should not be expelled 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.130
 francisco party flowers I do not have me 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.950
 why to comment on that subject is in 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.270
 hands of state institutions 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.039
 regardless of what they say in sand 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.869
 What is certain is that the next 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.399
 Friday morning is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.350

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.590
