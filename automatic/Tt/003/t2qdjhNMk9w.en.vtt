 today in golden relief 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.650
 I realized that the secret chamber people 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:14.290
 is to have a number of pages smaller than 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:21.680
 this collection here that has 287 pages 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:25.160

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.580

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.580
 even smaller right animation diagramming 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.920

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.270
 I do not like white sheets because I 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.130
