00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
if wait a second we've actually stuck

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.229 
if wait a second we've actually stuck
together

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
together

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.540 
together
but<00:00:45.930> they<00:00:46.020> look<00:00:46.200> pretty<00:00:46.440> cool<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.829> did<00:00:50.039> you

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
but they look pretty cool and I did you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
but they look pretty cool and I did you
can't<00:00:50.789> see<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.270> did<00:00:51.510> mostly<00:00:52.289> entirely

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
can't see it but I did mostly entirely

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.970 
can't see it but I did mostly entirely
lose<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> bottom<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.910> rest<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.300> them

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
lose the bottom the rest of them

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:07.080 
lose the bottom the rest of them
receivable<00:00:56.090> saves<00:00:59.000> so

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.399 

and<00:01:07.479> then<00:01:07.600> I'm<00:01:07.659> gonna<00:01:07.750> leave<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.140> burn

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
and then I'm gonna leave that to burn

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.510 
and then I'm gonna leave that to burn
because<00:01:08.590> that's<00:01:08.799> what<00:01:08.979> it<00:01:09.040> looked<00:01:09.189> like<00:01:09.280> on

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
because that's what it looked like on

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.389 
because that's what it looked like on
the<00:01:09.549> last<00:01:10.030> time<00:01:10.180> yeah<00:01:10.299> I<00:01:10.329> saw<00:01:10.770> how<00:01:11.770> it<00:01:11.950> survived

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
the last time yeah I saw how it survived

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.539 
the last time yeah I saw how it survived
it<00:01:13.240> just<00:01:13.600> saw<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.229> can't<00:01:14.530> just<00:01:14.680> start<00:01:15.369> to

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
it just saw so you can't just start to

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.020 
it just saw so you can't just start to
burn<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.030> then<00:01:16.360> walk<00:01:16.780> away<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.350> won't

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
burn it and then walk away it won't

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.319 
burn it and then walk away it won't
continue<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.240> burn<00:01:20.700> come<00:01:21.700> back<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.030> our<00:01:22.060> big

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
continue to burn come back to our big

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.940 
continue to burn come back to our big
stack

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.109 

I<00:01:29.299> think<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.659> leather<00:01:30.840> gloves<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> we

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
I think it is for leather gloves so we

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.260 
I think it is for leather gloves so we
lost<00:01:34.490> more<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> documents<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.420> time

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
lost more of the documents that time

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.730 
lost more of the documents that time
through<00:01:39.270> them

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
through them

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.020 
through them
let's<00:01:40.740> remember<00:01:40.920> actually<00:01:41.490> read<00:01:41.640> all<00:01:41.759> except

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
let's remember actually read all except

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.350 
let's remember actually read all except
for<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.210> bottom<00:01:42.390> ones<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.259> burnt

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
for the bottom ones I got a little burnt

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.760 
for the bottom ones I got a little burnt
it's<00:01:45.360> still<00:01:45.690> rather<00:01:45.899> moving<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.619> guess

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it's still rather moving in I guess

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.660 
it's still rather moving in I guess
that's<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.100> better<00:01:47.250> plan<00:01:47.750> uh-huh<00:01:49.640> bottom<00:01:50.640> one

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that's a better plan uh-huh bottom one

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.510 
that's a better plan uh-huh bottom one
going<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.710> pretty<00:01:52.860> how<00:01:53.039> it<00:01:53.159> curls

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520

techniques to read this bird paper you

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:16.789 
techniques to read this bird paper you
would<00:02:07.080> have<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.470> be<00:02:07.679> very<00:02:08.069> very<00:02:08.369> careful<00:02:15.799> all

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
would have to be very very careful all

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.229 
would have to be very very careful all
right<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.220> big<00:02:17.400> stack<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.880> left<00:02:18.060> burning

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
right I have a big stack we left burning

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.320 
right I have a big stack we left burning
for<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.600> while<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.380> if<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.650> want<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.060> pull

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
for a while and if you want you can pull

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.300 
for a while and if you want you can pull
off<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.690> top<00:02:21.870> pages<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.799> pages<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
off the top pages and the pages in the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.430 
off the top pages and the pages in the
middle<00:02:23.670> are<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.630> things<00:02:24.840> along<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.200> edges

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
middle are just things along the edges

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.930 
middle are just things along the edges
then<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.769> still<00:02:26.010> read<00:02:26.190> them

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.390

interesting if there's a huge stack of

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.450 
interesting if there's a huge stack of
papers<00:02:35.170> even<00:02:35.410> after<00:02:35.710> burning<00:02:35.920> for<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.220> little

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
papers even after burning for a little

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.340 
papers even after burning for a little
while<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:37.240> get<00:02:37.420> there<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.690> time<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.050> middle

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
while to get there and time the middle

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.720 
while to get there and time the middle
pages<00:02:38.710> are<00:02:38.830> still<00:02:39.070> readable

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
pages are still readable

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.610 
pages are still readable
there's<00:02:40.270> finished<00:02:40.660> all<00:02:40.810> around<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> edges<00:02:41.500> in

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
there's finished all around the edges in

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.340 
there's finished all around the edges in
black<00:02:41.800> but<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:43.660> figure<00:02:43.810> out<00:02:43.930> what<00:02:44.140> was<00:02:44.260> on

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
black but you can figure out what was on

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.550 
black but you can figure out what was on
them<00:02:44.500> pretty<00:02:44.590> easy<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:46.540> something<00:02:47.440> else

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
them pretty easy so just something else

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.540 
them pretty easy so just something else
to<00:02:47.830> think<00:02:47.950> about

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
to think about

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.160 
to think about
alright<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.240> my<00:02:49.360> eyebrows<00:02:49.570> feel<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.870> little

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
alright so my eyebrows feel a little

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.460 
alright so my eyebrows feel a little
singed<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.460> looks<00:02:51.790> like<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:53.110> super

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
singed but it looks like the super

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.380 
singed but it looks like the super
sleuth<00:02:53.830> scenario<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.700> least<00:02:54.940> likely<00:02:55.030> to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
sleuth scenario is the least likely to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.270 
sleuth scenario is the least likely to
be<00:02:55.480> successful<00:02:56.200> because<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.620> ends<00:02:56.920> up<00:02:56.980> being

be successful because it ends up being

be successful because it ends up being
so<00:02:57.520> delicate<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.110> idea<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.680> trying<00:02:59.980> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
so delicate that the idea of trying to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.380 
so delicate that the idea of trying to
figure<00:03:00.190> out<00:03:00.280> what<00:03:00.430> was<00:03:00.580> written<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.120> them<00:03:01.270> with

figure out what was written on them with

figure out what was written on them with
chemicals<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.320> as<00:03:02.950> likely<00:03:03.190> as<00:03:03.640> finding<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.300> half

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
charred piece that you can just read and

save it from the fire if you're fast

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.380 
save it from the fire if you're fast
enough<00:03:13.360> works<00:03:14.200> pretty<00:03:14.440> darn<00:03:14.770> well<00:03:15.270> there<00:03:16.270> was

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
enough works pretty darn well there was

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.640 
enough works pretty darn well there was
a<00:03:16.420> couple<00:03:16.510> times<00:03:16.840> where<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.140> did<00:03:17.290> get<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> little

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
a couple times where it did get a little

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.210 
a couple times where it did get a little
more<00:03:17.920> burned<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:20.110> idea<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.530> burning<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:21.070> and

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
more burned the idea of burning it and

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.300 
more burned the idea of burning it and
just<00:03:21.550> leaving<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.150> there<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.560> usually<00:03:23.860> burns

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
just leaving it there it usually burns

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.490 
just leaving it there it usually burns
out<00:03:24.550> unless<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.120> sit<00:03:25.390> there<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.570> hold<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.990> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
out unless you sit there and hold it and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.960 
out unless you sit there and hold it and
then<00:03:26.740> again<00:03:26.950> you're<00:03:27.160> back<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.550> delicate
