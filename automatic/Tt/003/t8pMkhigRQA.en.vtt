00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you can see PLC so yeah it actually is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
you can see PLC so yeah it actually is

it is with the app on the tablet or the
smartphone<00:00:53.520> app<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:57.210> works<00:00:57.449> pretty<00:00:57.719> well

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
smartphone app but it works pretty well

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.580 
of the gopro so let's see what happens
if<00:02:43.400> we<00:02:43.520> go<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:44.330> web<00:02:45.140> browser<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.890> go<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
if we go to a web browser and go to the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.650 
if we go to a web browser and go to the
address<00:02:51.590> 10<00:02:51.890> dot<00:02:52.100> v<00:02:52.310> dot<00:02:52.340> v<00:02:52.730> dot<00:02:52.790> 9<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.660> gopro

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
address 10 dot v dot v dot 9 the gopro

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:05.560 
address 10 dot v dot v dot 9 the gopro
and<00:02:56.660> we'll<00:02:56.960> add<00:02:57.140> port<00:02:58.150> 8080<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:04.070> look<00:03:04.460> takes<00:03:05.420> us

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
and we'll add port 8080 so look takes us

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.810 
and we'll add port 8080 so look takes us
to<00:03:05.780> an<00:03:05.930> umbrella<00:03:07.870> web<00:03:08.870> page<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:10.250> GoPro<00:03:10.430> so

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
to an umbrella web page on the GoPro so

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.210 
to an umbrella web page on the GoPro so
I<00:03:10.880> think<00:03:10.970> that's<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.900> board<00:03:12.200> or<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.890> chip

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
I think that's the the board or the chip

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.310 
I think that's the the board or the chip
that's<00:03:13.430> on<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.940> GoPro<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.870> don't<00:03:15.110> know<00:03:15.170> much

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
that's on the GoPro I don't know much

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.940 
that's on the GoPro I don't know much
about<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.770> but<00:03:16.400> here<00:03:16.880> we<00:03:17.450> have<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:18.110> few

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
about it but here we have a few

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.040 
about it but here we have a few
different<00:03:19.100> folders<00:03:19.940> we<00:03:20.300> want<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.630> take<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> look

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
different folders we want to take a look

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.800 
different folders we want to take a look
at<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.410> live<00:03:21.880> folder<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:24.910> this<00:03:25.910> file<00:03:26.360> here

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
at the live folder and this file here

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.220 
at the live folder and this file here
this<00:03:27.200> thing<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.959> be<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:29.990> dot<00:03:31.420> m3u8<00:03:32.420> we'll<00:03:32.959> click

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
this thing and be a dot m3u8 we'll click

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.350 
this thing and be a dot m3u8 we'll click
that<00:03:33.880> got<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:34.910> bunch<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.740> settings<00:03:36.740> here<00:03:37.360> so

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
that got a bunch of settings here so

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.400 
that got a bunch of settings here so
what<00:03:38.900> we'll<00:03:39.050> do<00:03:39.200> is<00:03:39.350> highlight<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.959> thing<00:03:42.230> up

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
what we'll do is highlight this thing up

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.820 
what we'll do is highlight this thing up
here<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.900> copy<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.550> so<00:03:46.550> if<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:46.940> want<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.830> just

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
here and copy it so if you want to just

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.250 
here and copy it so if you want to just
look<00:03:49.040> at<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.340> it's<00:03:49.580> 10.5<00:03:50.150> dot<00:03:50.360> v<00:03:50.510> dot<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:50.840> port

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
look at that it's 10.5 dot v dot on port

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.220 
look at that it's 10.5 dot v dot on port

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.170 

and<00:04:22.620> we'll<00:04:22.920> do<00:04:23.300> Network<00:04:24.300> stream<00:04:25.640> this<00:04:26.640> pops<00:04:26.940> up

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
and we'll do Network stream this pops up

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.700 
and we'll do Network stream this pops up
so<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.050> have<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:29.490> IP<00:04:29.760> address<00:04:30.420> that<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.750> copied
