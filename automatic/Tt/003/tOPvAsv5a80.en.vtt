so here is a bit of an unboxing I
already<00:00:09.389> opened<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.719> unboxed<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.410> but<00:00:10.849> this<00:00:11.849> is

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000

a<00:00:12.030> Faisal<00:00:12.480> ball<00:00:12.690> head<00:00:13.190> guess<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> CB<00:00:14.910> 30

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
a Faisal ball head guess it's the CB 30

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.519 
a Faisal ball head guess it's the CB 30
see<00:00:17.420> you<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.750> not<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> fluke<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.410> on

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
see you know it's not a fluke it's on

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.220 
see you know it's not a fluke it's on
both<00:00:19.650> sides<00:00:19.890> look<00:00:20.100> CB<00:00:20.460> 30<00:00:20.699> C<00:00:20.939> ball<00:00:21.210> head<00:00:21.420> from

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
both sides look CB 30 C ball head from

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.259 
both sides look CB 30 C ball head from
Faisal<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:25.250> this<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.430> what's<00:00:26.640> how<00:00:27.029> comes

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
Faisal it is this is what's how comes

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.029 
Faisal it is this is what's how comes
packaged<00:00:27.720> systems<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.890> all

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
packaged systems you know it's all

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.600 
packaged systems you know it's all
secured<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.519> here<00:00:29.960> comes<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.170> bubble<00:00:31.470> wrap

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:48.340 

there's<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> ball<00:00:36.000> head<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:45.200> there<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.320> go

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
there's the ball head and there you go

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.610 
there's the ball head and there you go
the<00:00:49.350> CB<00:00:49.800> 30<00:00:50.070> C<00:00:50.340> ball<00:00:50.670> head<00:00:50.879> Faisal<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.379> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the CB 30 C ball head Faisal so this is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.610 
the CB 30 C ball head Faisal so this is
it's<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> miniature<00:00:55.940> arca-swiss

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
it's like a miniature arca-swiss

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.500 
it's like a miniature arca-swiss
head<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:00.840> inexpensive<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.390> super<00:01:03.390> high

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
head you know inexpensive but super high

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.640 
head you know inexpensive but super high
quality<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.019> mean<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.100> fit<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.400> finish<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.650> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
quality I mean the fit and finish is so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.080 
quality I mean the fit and finish is so
close<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.520> arca-swiss

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
close to the the arca-swiss

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.260 
close to the the arca-swiss
but<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.810> much<00:01:09.990> smaller<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:12.000> comes<00:01:12.210> with

it can't come off because the grooves in
the<00:01:45.930> bottom<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.409> plate<00:01:47.000> won't<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.479> past<00:01:48.840> this

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the bottom of a plate won't go past this

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.560 
the bottom of a plate won't go past this
little<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.610> metal<00:01:50.939> knob<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:51.509> here

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
little you know metal knob right here

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
little you know metal knob right here
it's<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.290> safety<00:01:52.799> precaution<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.640> is

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it's just a safety precaution which is

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.929 
it's just a safety precaution which is
great<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.479> adjust<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
great and you know you can adjust the

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.480 
great and you know you can adjust the
here<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.060> obviously<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:02.100> adjuster<00:02:02.460> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
here is obviously the the adjuster to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.709 
here is obviously the the adjuster to
lock<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.030> plate<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.540> two

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
lock the plate in and then this the two

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.119 
lock the plate in and then this the two
adjustments<00:02:07.259> right<00:02:07.409> here<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:09.300> major

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
adjustments right here the major

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.199 
adjustments right here the major
adjuster<00:02:11.150> for<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> ball<00:02:12.420> head

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
adjuster for the ball head

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.940 
adjuster for the ball head
and<00:02:15.209> then<00:02:15.989> if<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.230> want<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.680> then<00:02:16.799> this

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and then if you want and then this

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.970 
and then if you want and then this
adjusts<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.610> amount<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.390> friction<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.680> if<00:02:19.799> you

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
adjusts the amount of friction so if you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.649 
adjusts the amount of friction so if you
want<00:02:20.189> it<00:02:20.310> when<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.849> loose<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.390> want<00:02:21.569> to

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
want it when this is loose you want to

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.319 
want it when this is loose you want to
have<00:02:21.780> hardly<00:02:22.079> any<00:02:22.290> friction<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.329> you

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
have hardly any friction on here you

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.539 
have hardly any friction on here you
know<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.569> adjust<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.079> too<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:25.620> really

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
know you can adjust that too so really

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.429 
know you can adjust that too so really
just<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.329> know<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> great<00:02:27.659> piece<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:27.989> equipment
