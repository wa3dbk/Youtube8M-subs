00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.410
 the flight of the feather art images 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.570
 in mexico and europe is the first 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.609
 international exhibition that is presented 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.100
 about the non-Hispanic mosaics of 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.650
 feathers we have a selection of over 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:38.290
 50 facts between the 16th century and the century 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:47.320
 19 the first section of the exhibition 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:49.390
 it's titled flight and I want the second part 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.960
 of the exhibition whose title is 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.960
 nature between art and science and here 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.930
 we want to investigate present 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.600
 help the public to observe what happened 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.050
 with these objects when they arrived at the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.050
 the old world 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.020
 in the end 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.150
 francisco of the mass account that half 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.580
 of the slag 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.100
 I think there are up to more than 200 or 300 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.170
 figures represented in the minister 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.409
 then the lovers are re 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.660
 appropriating is not only the engraving 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.200
 iconography but also aesthetics 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.540
 of the miniature and they already become 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.210
 miniaturized objects of feathers if 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.909
 we see for example half of milan or the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.610
 half of Florence to the profiles of 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.860
 these 200 or 300 portraits that can be 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.660
 see everything are made with us 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.789
 then it 's reattaching the art of 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.410
 design that is remembering the aesthetic 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.810
 of the miniature that are re 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.330
 interpreting recorded models the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.120
 miniature the idea was just that it 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.730
 illuminated these were not illuminated 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.030
 manuscripts through the gold leaf 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.070
 the gold leaf the lovers reinvent 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.140
 that aesthetics of brilliance to 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.650
 through that of the essence idea of 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.650
 the figures 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:37.599
 We are presenting this selection of 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.609
 works of the amateurs the artists of 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.069
 the plumaria novohispanos in a context 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.409
 much wider aesthetic that includes 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.269
 both painting and sculpture works 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:51.800
 prehispanic ceramic gold obsidian 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.760
 find books 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.760
 Y 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.080
 they are works that have to do with the use 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.210
 for example the magnificent cali covers 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.370
 of the National Museum of Anthropology 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.410
 We know 100% if it is a piece 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.690
 prehispanic or non-Hispanic what yes 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.590
 we know is that it was used as a cover 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.900
 lime is even a piece of origin 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.540
 prehispanic the use that is given is 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:30.300
 just as it covers calyx inside 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:33.000
 the mass ceremony all that axis is 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.550
 called itinerary is offered and is the axis 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.890
 let's say the backbone of all the 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.350
 exhibition and it is divided into different 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.060
 parts the first part is called a 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.580
 new sacred image with point of 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.310
 interrogation and here we return to the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.150
 Novohispana context to the local context 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.460
 remember we have gone to milan 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.230
 we have gone to bologna we have gone to all 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.480
 europe either with these representations 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.160
 allegorical of America as being 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.120
 feathered but also the feathers are 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.120
 They were in Mexico 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.739
 that second part piety is reliquaries and 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.000
 liturgies and offerings again not 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.790
 we are simply making a 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.940
 comparison between the prehispanic and the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.940
 European 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.900
 t 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.870
 Y 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.600
 to the last room of this axis let's say that 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.910
 backbone itinerary his offering 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.910
 it's a room called in situ 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.270
 and I want to highlight that polyphony of this 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.800
 project because it is a project that is not 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.750
 I could have done for one 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.340
 person not then it's really the 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.560
 fruit of a collective work in which 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.540
 a lot of researchers participated 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.940
 Mexicans and the project that has been 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.380
 enriched very much has on Tuesday 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.990
 precisely the collaboration with the 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.880
 munal by all the whole team of the mural 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.920
 and also with the function team 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.810
 national anthropology flight of the 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.790
 Feather art images in Mexico and 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:29.000
 europe is an exhibition that will be in the 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.000
 mont to March 24 and closes on 19
