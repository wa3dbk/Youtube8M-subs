now<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:48.019> kind<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.349> funny<00:02:48.560> one<00:02:48.739> because

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
now this is kind of a funny one because

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.250 
now this is kind of a funny one because
if<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.099> don't<00:02:49.400> know<00:02:49.549> this<00:02:49.760> melody<00:02:50.260> you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
if you don't know this melody you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.199 
if you don't know this melody you
haven't<00:02:51.530> been<00:02:51.620> alive<00:02:51.890> for<00:02:52.160> long<00:02:52.340> right<00:02:52.670> so

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
haven't been alive for long right so

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.490 
haven't been alive for long right so
it's<00:02:53.390> going<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.569> start<00:02:53.720> out<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.109> seat<00:02:54.379> and

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
it's going to start out on a seat and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.509 
it's going to start out on a seat and
we're<00:02:54.620> just<00:02:54.739> gonna<00:02:54.829> play<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.099> with<00:02:55.250> our<00:02:55.370> right

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
we're just gonna play it with our right

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.979 
we're just gonna play it with our right
hand<00:02:55.549> just<00:02:56.120> take<00:02:56.329> a<00:02:56.359> look<00:02:56.569> at<00:02:56.720> your<00:02:56.840> keyboard

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
hand just take a look at your keyboard

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.720 
hand just take a look at your keyboard
watch<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.650> lights<00:02:57.829> under<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.220> keys<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.639> see

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
watch the lights under the keys and see

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.490 
watch the lights under the keys and see
which<00:02:58.910> notes<00:02:59.150> I'm<00:02:59.329> playing

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.930 

now<00:03:08.500> here's<00:03:08.710> kind<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.040> big<00:03:09.220> jump<00:03:09.490> it's<00:03:09.850> an

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
now here's kind of a big jump it's an

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.510 
now here's kind of a big jump it's an
octave<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.590> have<00:03:11.710> to<00:03:11.800> go<00:03:11.890> from<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.160> thumb<00:03:12.370> to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
octave so you have to go from a thumb to

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:20.880 
octave so you have to go from a thumb to
a<00:03:12.550> pinkie<00:03:12.820> up<00:03:12.850> there

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.020 

now<00:03:21.890> you'll<00:03:22.069> notice<00:03:22.280> when<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.549> just<00:03:22.819> played

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
now you'll notice when I just played

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.610 
now you'll notice when I just played
that<00:03:23.239> I<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.540> know<00:03:23.689> the<00:03:23.810> fingering<00:03:24.230> was<00:03:24.349> kind

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
that I you know the fingering was kind

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.740 
that I you know the fingering was kind
of<00:03:24.680> atrocious<00:03:25.250> but<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.819> reality<00:03:26.360> is<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:26.689> is

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
of atrocious but the reality is this is

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.059 
of atrocious but the reality is this is
kind<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.170> tough<00:03:27.349> one<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.620> do<00:03:27.739> that<00:03:27.920> with

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
kind of a tough one to do that with

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.589 
kind of a tough one to do that with
let's<00:03:28.310> start<00:03:28.579> where<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.819> octave<00:03:29.209> happens

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
let's start where that octave happens

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.009 
let's start where that octave happens
that<00:03:30.939> okay<00:03:31.939> now<00:03:32.120> let's<00:03:32.329> think<00:03:32.510> about<00:03:32.659> then

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
that okay now let's think about then

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.240 
that okay now let's think about then
just<00:03:33.230> see<00:03:33.319> if<00:03:33.379> there's<00:03:33.560> some<00:03:33.709> smarter<00:03:34.069> way<00:03:34.220> to

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
just see if there's some smarter way to

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.890 
just see if there's some smarter way to
do<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:34.760> by<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.060> way<00:03:35.269> there<00:03:35.510> is<00:03:35.540> no

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
do it and by the way there is no

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.509 
do it and by the way there is no
absolute<00:03:36.409> right<00:03:36.440> or<00:03:36.769> wrong<00:03:36.920> here<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.400> is

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
absolute right or wrong here this is

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.339 
absolute right or wrong here this is
just<00:03:37.640> trying<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:37.970> find<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.629> smoothest<00:03:39.079> way<00:03:39.290> to

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
just trying to find the smoothest way to

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.809 
just trying to find the smoothest way to
kind<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.709> keep<00:03:39.829> yourself<00:03:40.010> from<00:03:40.370> running<00:03:40.640> into

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
kind of keep yourself from running into

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.089 
kind of keep yourself from running into
a<00:03:40.849> roadblock<00:03:41.060> or<00:03:41.590> running<00:03:42.590> out<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.709> fingers

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
a roadblock or running out of fingers

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.920 
a roadblock or running out of fingers
it's<00:03:43.310> probably<00:03:43.609> a<00:03:43.640> better<00:03:43.760> way<00:03:44.030> maybe<00:03:44.659> I'll<00:03:44.810> do

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
it's probably a better way maybe I'll do

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.300 
it's probably a better way maybe I'll do
this<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.930> then<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.500> lets<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.859> play<00:03:49.099> if<00:03:49.159> you

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
this and then that lets you play if you

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.770 
this and then that lets you play if you
put<00:03:49.489> your<00:03:49.609> third<00:03:49.819> finger<00:03:50.000> on<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.329> half<00:03:50.510> there

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
put your third finger on that half there

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.220 
put your third finger on that half there
that<00:03:51.019> lets<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.349> play<00:03:51.500> this

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
that lets you play this

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.080 
that lets you play this
and<00:03:53.680> then<00:03:53.920> gives<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.489> if<00:03:54.610> your<00:03:54.760> thumb<00:03:54.910> is

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
and then gives you that if your thumb is

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.940 
and then gives you that if your thumb is
on<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.360> D<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.599> gives<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:55.989> enough<00:03:56.200> reach<00:03:56.709> to

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
on that D it gives you enough reach to

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.710 
on that D it gives you enough reach to
go<00:03:57.069> up<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.370> maybe<00:03:57.519> get<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:57.970> B<00:03:58.180> flat<00:03:58.390> with

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
go up and maybe get that B flat with

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.140 
go up and maybe get that B flat with
your<00:03:58.870> ring<00:03:59.080> finger<00:04:02.640> now<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:03.819> felt<00:04:04.060> pretty

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
your ring finger now that felt pretty

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.610 
your ring finger now that felt pretty
good<00:04:04.390> I<00:04:04.569> don't<00:04:04.750> think<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.080> did<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.319> that<00:04:05.440> well

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
good I don't think I did it that well

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.020 
good I don't think I did it that well
the<00:04:05.739> first<00:04:05.980> time<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.370> let<00:04:06.519> me<00:04:06.610> play<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.879> one

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the first time so let me play it one

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.520 
the first time so let me play it one
more<00:04:07.209> time<00:04:07.420> for<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.780> just<00:04:07.989> start<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.319> finish

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
more time for you just start to finish

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.229 
more time for you just start to finish
so<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.010> can<00:04:09.190> just<00:04:09.310> see<00:04:09.489> exactly<00:04:09.910> what<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.180> is

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
so you can just see exactly what it is

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.699 
so you can just see exactly what it is
and<00:04:10.599> then<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.750> can<00:04:10.959> take<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.140> few<00:04:11.319> minutes<00:04:11.620> and

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
and then you can take a few minutes and

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:27.000 
and then you can take a few minutes and
get<00:04:11.800> that<00:04:11.920> underhand
