00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
macbook pros basically I mentioned

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.780 
macbook pros basically I mentioned
before<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:13.170> do<00:00:13.320> expect<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:14.040> refreshed

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
before that we do expect a refreshed

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.430 
before that we do expect a refreshed
MacBook<00:00:15.120> Pros<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.199> around

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
MacBook Pros to be around

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.080 
MacBook Pros to be around
january-february<00:00:17.430> which<00:00:17.580> would<00:00:17.760> be<00:00:17.850> pretty

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
january-february which would be pretty

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.380 
january-february which would be pretty
accurate<00:00:18.240> because<00:00:18.600> Mac<00:00:19.529> refreshes<00:00:20.490> usually

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
accurate because Mac refreshes usually

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.240 
accurate because Mac refreshes usually
happen<00:00:21.750> once<00:00:22.470> every<00:00:22.619> seven<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
happen once every seven and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.340 
happen once every seven and
three-quarter<00:00:23.670> months<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.260> we'll<00:00:25.260> be

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
three-quarter months and we'll be

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.109 
three-quarter months and we'll be
looking<00:00:25.470> there<00:00:25.769> around<00:00:26.010> basically<00:00:26.609> january

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
looking there around basically january

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.019 
looking there around basically january
or<00:00:27.180> mid-february<00:00:27.810> something<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.590> so

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
or mid-february something like that so

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.800 
or mid-february something like that so
considering<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.090> last<00:00:30.240> numbers<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.630> June

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
considering the last numbers in June

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.319 
considering the last numbers in June
which<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> when<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.320> bought<00:00:31.560> mine<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.610> basically

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
which is when I bought mine so basically

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.740

macbook airs and the macbook pros for

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.780 
macbook airs and the macbook pros for
launched<00:01:45.689> simultaneously<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.159> new<00:01:47.310> refresh

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
launched simultaneously the new refresh

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.920 
launched simultaneously the new refresh
so<00:01:48.619> that's<00:01:49.619> where<00:01:49.829> i<00:01:49.890> got<00:01:49.950> mine<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.840> other

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
so that's where i got mine I so in other

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.960 
so that's where i got mine I so in other
words<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.770> definitely<00:01:53.159> do<00:01:53.250> expect<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.790> see

my<00:02:11.280> subscribers<00:02:12.150> vast<00:02:12.690> again<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> question

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
my subscribers vast again the question

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.030 
my subscribers vast again the question
where

where

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.119 
where

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
get a macbook macbook pro this doesn't

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.890 
get a macbook macbook pro this doesn't
see<00:02:17.219> any<00:02:17.340> what<00:02:17.489> difference<00:02:17.879> again<00:02:18.299> that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
see any what difference again that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.750 
see any what difference again that
macbook<00:02:19.109> pro<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.709> entry<00:02:19.920> level<00:02:19.950> 13<00:02:20.430> inch<00:02:20.609> that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
macbook pro the entry level 13 inch that

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.750 
macbook pro the entry level 13 inch that
they're<00:02:20.939> referring<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.719> is<00:02:22.620> overdue<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.579> this

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
they're referring to is overdue for this

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.640 
they're referring to is overdue for this
refresh<00:02:24.269> so<00:02:24.510> they<00:02:24.900> may<00:02:25.019> start<00:02:25.290> them<00:02:25.500> off<00:02:25.590> with

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
refresh so they may start them off with

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.970 
refresh so they may start them off with
the<00:02:26.099> 3.06<00:02:26.849> gigahertz<00:02:27.329> core2duo<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.439> maybe<00:02:28.799> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the 3.06 gigahertz core2duo so maybe the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.099 
the 3.06 gigahertz core2duo so maybe the
entry-level<00:02:29.280> macbook<00:02:30.239> pro<00:02:30.480> will<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:30.930> that

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
entry-level macbook pro will be that

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.410 
entry-level macbook pro will be that
processor<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.859> then<00:02:32.430> after<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.239> you'll

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
processor and then after that you'll

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.880 
processor and then after that you'll
have<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.659> option<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.930> go<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.170> core<00:02:34.319> i5<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
have the option to go to core i5 and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.710 
have the option to go to core i5 and
move<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.159> 17<00:02:35.519> inch<00:02:35.670> down<00:02:35.849> i'll<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.239> core

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
move the 17 inch down i'll have the core

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.199 
move the 17 inch down i'll have the core
i7<00:02:37.200> option<00:02:37.500> probably<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.579> higher<00:02:38.939> end

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
i7 option probably that the higher end

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.270 
i7 option probably that the higher end
15<00:02:39.659> inches<00:02:39.930> well<00:02:40.109> I<00:02:40.349> think<00:02:40.829> they<00:02:40.889> do<00:02:41.010> something

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
15 inches well I think they do something

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.250 
15 inches well I think they do something
similar<00:02:41.609> like<00:02:41.909> what<00:02:42.180> they<00:02:42.299> did<00:02:42.359> with<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.840> imax

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
similar like what they did with the imax

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.589 
similar like what they did with the imax
it's<00:02:43.469> i<00:02:43.650> don't<00:02:44.370> think<00:02:44.909> we've<00:02:45.269> seen<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.569> last

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
it's i don't think we've seen the last

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.069 
it's i don't think we've seen the last
of<00:02:46.049> course<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.409> do<00:02:46.590> owe<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.889> terms<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.310> a

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
of course you do owe in terms of a

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.660 
of course you do owe in terms of a
refreshed<00:02:49.079> mac<00:02:49.439> but<00:02:49.829> we'll<00:02:50.220> see<00:02:50.400> what<00:02:50.549> happens

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
refreshed mac but we'll see what happens

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.909
