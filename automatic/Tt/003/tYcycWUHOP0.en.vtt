00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.430
Are you curious about why the Common Application
added the new question about failure--the

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.879
one that asks you to "recount an incident
or time when you experienced failure" and

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.489
to describe how it affected you and the lessons
that you learned from it?

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:18.359
Want to understand why colleges want to know
how potential students handle situations that

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.359
involve failure?

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.600
Then stay tuned.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.949
Hi.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.380
It's Dr. Bernstein, the president of Get Yourself
Into College, and today I want to give you

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:39.160
the inside scoop on the significance of this
new question, which you might find surprising.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.940
After all, given the highly competitive nature
of undergraduate college admissions who wants

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.260
to reveal any time or situation when you weren't
successful?

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.260
It seems counterintuitive, right?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.739
You just want to show only the very best parts
of yourself.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:54.960
And I understand that.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.390
You should do as much as possible to reveal
to admissions officers your special qualities,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.839
skills, and accomplishments.

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.200
If you have access to the complete online
version of the Get Yourself Into College program,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.410
then you know from module one, which focuses
on recommendations, that there are specific

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.470
ways you can reach out to teachers and thereby
turn what seem to be your weaknesses--or your

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.470
failures--into strengths.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.430
Why do I mention this here?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.640
Well, the teachers writing your recommendations
are actually asked to rank you in terms of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:43.920
your ability to respond to setbacks, so they
need to know how you handle them!

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.190
The Common App essay question about failure
is sort of inviting you to write about how

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.150
you've transformed a failure into something
positive.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.310
That is, you're not just being asked to write
about a time when you failed, although you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.970
do need to provide a behind-the-scenes glimpse
into that failure.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.840
You're also being asked for your perspective
on it.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.150
Colleges want to know how the experience influenced
and what lessons you've learned from it.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.530
So if you choose this option, you really do
need to show that even though you failed in

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.999
a specific situation, you also grew from the
experience.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:30.060
. .and you have to do this in a sophisticated,
nuanced kind of way.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:45.239
What seems on the surface or in the moment
to be a failure can actually 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.810
be a source of strength and convey something
very positive about you--and serve as an indicator

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.189
that actually likely to excel in college.

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:55.189
Interesting, eh?

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.189
Look.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.189
Don't just take it from me.

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:04.739
Listen to what the MIT admissions team has
to say in "The Match Between You and MIT":

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.790
"MIT wants to admit people who are not only
planning to succeed, but who are not afraid

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.139
to fail.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:19.349
When people take risks in life, they learn
resilience as a result--because risk leads

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.400
to failure as often as it leads to success.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.209
The most creative and successful people--and
MIT is loaded with them--know that failure

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.049
is part of life and that if you stay focused
and don't give, goals are ultimately realized."

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.599
When you go to college--whatever college you
go to--you're going to be faced with new,

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.510
complex and challenging situations that are
designed to stimulate you.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.029
. .that are intended to raise the bar for
you. . .and if you're not capable of handling

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:52.680
setbacks--whether they're minor or major ones--you
are going to have a really hard time succeeding

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.680
in college.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.299
You need to be resilient--you need to have
strategies for bouncing back from things that

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.819
don't go exactly as planned.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.180
. .You need to know how to fine-tune your
course of action.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.180
. .your ways of thinking.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.180
As a professor who's worked with thousands
of college freshmen and as someone who served

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.180
as an academic honors advisor, I can tell
you that one of the reasons why some students

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.180
really struggle during their first year is
because they haven't learned these underlying

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.180
life skills.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.290
It's not just that college is harder.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.439
. .or that there's more work.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.109
. . It's that you need to these underlying
skills that help you navigate your way in

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.709
a new setting that's full of challenges.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.490
And, as the quote from the MIT team reveals,
success often involves taking risks.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.720
But hey, don't just take it from MIT.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.720
. .

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.200
Listen to what JK Rowling--the incredibly
successful author of the Harry Potter series,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.080
had to say in her 2008 Harvard Commencement
Address, which she titled: "The Fringe Benefits

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:39.830
of Failure, and The Importance of Imagination":
"It is impossible," she declared, "to live

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.411
without failing at something, unless you live
so cautiously that you might as well not have

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.520
lived at all--in which case, you fail by default."

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.750
Think about that.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.750
Now.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.980
. .the next set of things we have to consider
are what constitutes failure.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.830
. .what kinds of failure might you want to
write about in your essay?

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:12.100
So make sure you check out the next video
in this series because that's where I'm getting

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.810
into these issues.
