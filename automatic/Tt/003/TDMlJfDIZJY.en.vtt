00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:51.869
 There was a guy waiting for me. 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:54.000
 the galley is this then the programming of the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.470

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.719
 that each one will be able to post video 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.110

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.360
 ya know when to that appears after 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.500
 appears after there is that candidate was 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.649
 washed out 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.200
 I thought I had solved this. 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.640
 She died pedro motta that I had not 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.350
 will walk the map and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.150
 and as neither of the old inside game pulling 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.620
 I'll wait I want to kill you so I 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.569
 stay here waiting I want to here by 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.620
 No one else kills me when I die. 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.360
 nobody kills me 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.300
 Look at the whereabouts on your side, I see. 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.300
 I 'll wait to die, they're taking a shot. 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:44.489
 reaching the goal again to a support 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.489
 in the middle 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.739
 here comes a guy who passed a guy 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:57.790
 I did not kill a grenade here and it has 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:03:00.250
 A lot of people still do not know who 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.100
 was someone going to post what about 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.860
 if it will decide if it is still important 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.019
 saying that I will be would be one of the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.420
 channel's eyes would be responding to 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.400
 You my comments and everything else 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.860

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:30.040
 that hashtag straight something like that 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:37.480

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:43.560

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:46.620
