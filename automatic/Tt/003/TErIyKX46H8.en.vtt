we have a unit here to kind of talk a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.770 
we have a unit here to kind of talk a
little<00:00:34.530> bit<00:00:34.680> about<00:00:34.860> its<00:00:35.040> features<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.780> what

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
little bit about its features and what

center we have alien effects which lets
you<00:01:55.950> customize<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.610> lighting<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.119> even

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
you customize the lighting you can even

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.940 
you customize the lighting you can even
set<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.509> morphine<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.320> tie<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.560> into<00:01:58.740> an

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
set up morphine you can tie it into an

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.440 
set up morphine you can tie it into an
application<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.640> you'd<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.299> when

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
application if you'd like so that when

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
application if you'd like so that when
you<00:02:00.570> open<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.320> game<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> lighting<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.100> turn<00:02:02.250> on

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you open a game the lighting can turn on

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.029 
you open a game the lighting can turn on
or<00:02:02.759> off<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:03.990> actually<00:02:04.820> using<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.850> same<00:02:06.119> API

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
or off it's actually using the same API

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.529 
or off it's actually using the same API
that<00:02:08.039> enables<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.580> customize<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.209> with

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that enables you to customize it with

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.660 
that enables you to customize it with
games<00:02:10.200> as<00:02:10.379> well<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.950> certain<00:02:11.250> games<00:02:11.459> out

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
games as well so that certain games out

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.470 
games as well so that certain games out
there<00:02:11.700> will

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
there will

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.270 
there will
actually<00:02:12.750> interact<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.319> lighting<00:02:13.650> so

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
actually interact with the lighting so

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.490 
actually interact with the lighting so
if<00:02:14.400> you're<00:02:14.489> losing<00:02:15.269> health<00:02:15.750> or<00:02:16.080> you're<00:02:16.230> losing

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
if you're losing health or you're losing

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.699 
if you're losing health or you're losing
or<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.459> get<00:02:17.610> shot<00:02:17.849> for<00:02:18.060> example<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.959> game

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
or you get shot for example the game

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.440 
or you get shot for example the game
will<00:02:19.860> actually<00:02:20.159> send<00:02:20.370> commands<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.090> alien

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
will actually send commands to the alien

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.300 
will actually send commands to the alien
effects<00:02:21.780> hardware<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.099> will<00:02:23.190> actually

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
effects hardware and it will actually

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.220 
effects hardware and it will actually
modify<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.360> lighting<00:02:24.690> based<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.140> way

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
modify the lighting based on the way

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.199 
modify the lighting based on the way
it's<00:02:25.349> pre-configured<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.580> also<00:02:26.730> have<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.060> the
