00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
this as a log off Aria uncommon it's
white<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.409> not<00:01:55.560> very<00:01:55.710> good<00:01:55.979> steam<00:01:56.579> born

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
white so that's not very good steam born

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.660

a rare in my opinion and this side so
very<00:02:03.719> cool<00:02:03.960> or<00:02:04.259> second<00:02:04.590> decide<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.189> today<00:02:06.170> so

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
