 above insert the stick on the box with us 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.180
 according to the statement 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.520

 note that the back cover is enough 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.250
 fine side keys go along with 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.180
 the cap is also present with us 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.220

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.799
 of stickers that distributes evenly 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.799
 and heat emanating from the processor 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:38.019
 accommodation 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.750
 back panel can tell you the panel 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.269

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.540

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.680
 recessed flash 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.680
 done on technology years rather 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.790
 just a little bit when recessed and side 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:59.199
 the keys work correctly softly in moderation 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.819
 hard here's the back panel of us 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.780

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.569
 shiny lenovo company logo 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.069
 also liked the metal inserts 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.930
 the display protrudes slightly from the general 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:16.709
 housing on one millimeter is enough 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.609
 stylish such an element of all 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.750

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.550
 the ends are very comfortable smartphone lies in 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:30.319
 hand despite the soul he is 5 inches he 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.229
 really comfortable in my hand 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:38.900

 hold in hand 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.039
 our corners are rounded although it seems 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.949
 seemingly sharp but in his hand 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.530

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.729

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.259
 smartphone works correctly pokamist 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.270
 smartphone works most likely on 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:04.550
 8-core processor from the company 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:07.939
 mediatek 6592 I have not looked a little 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.240
 I'll run antutu later 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:11.990
 or do a full review on this 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.759
 smartphone 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.759
 here is but the first impression is the camera with us 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.759

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.259
 we have very good macro 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.419
 ribbed surface is very visible 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.870
 our laptop is also good 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:37.699
 fonts are drawn 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:41.030

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.780
 her they are in full review I once again you 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.710
 I repeat it we have a first impression 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.960
 firmware right now empty 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.470
 days preset standard 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:55.069
 google and standard services 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:06:01.090
 after the new firmware here with the shell 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:01.090
 voyu oh worth 442 kitkat 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:10.129
 display brightness margin is very good at 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.229
 0 display backlight 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.419
 so and with the most bright and all 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.669
 can be seen enough in bright light 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.250
 the clay is good picture so and when 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.349
 Minimal lighting when outdoors 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.940
 completely dark anyone is in the dark 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:25.580
 indoors you can do zero 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.779
 brightness while the picture will remain with 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:33.110
 color rendering is also an interesting fact i 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:36.080
 noticed in this firmware and now you 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.090
 show the chip one thing that more than me 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.650
 I liked it first of all 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.659
 for lovers of apple makers 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.509
 there was such a thing 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:52.009
 nothing reminds me i think reminds 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:54.409
 who used iPhones knows interestingly 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:58.430
 very solution I liked the shell 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:59.240
 as always upgrade hope buy 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.819
 white 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.139
 soon all will unite 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.259
 operating systems 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.270
 and any user can go to 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:11.509
 phone lenovo quietly do not worry 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.249
 like something out of external changes Well 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:15.819
 dear friends it was a first look at 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:19.759
 lenovo p 70 I really liked him 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:20.990
 The phone is smart with a full review of you 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.080
 show all the tests 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:27.860
 now I can only say that the assembly 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.020
 the phone always makes me happy but also of whether 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.900
 time I say this is an eight-core long-liver 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.300
 from lenovo 4000 battery 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.960
 milliamp-hours 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:41.990
 of say he is so long-lived stylish and 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.289
 powerful i think the phone is first of all 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:48.560
 positioning itself as a gamer of 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:51.770
