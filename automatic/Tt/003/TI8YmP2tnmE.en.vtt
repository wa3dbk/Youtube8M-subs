there's a little manual that comes

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
there's a little manual that comes
inside<00:00:39.750> deep<00:00:40.020> box<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.129> case<00:00:41.309> itself<00:00:41.640> to

show you how to install the case now we

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.940 
show you how to install the case now we
usually<00:00:45.690> don't<00:00:45.840> really<00:00:46.110> think<00:00:46.260> about<00:00:46.410> how<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
usually don't really think about how to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.540 
usually don't really think about how to
install<00:00:47.280> cases<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.690> case<00:00:49.550> you

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
install cases but in this case you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.889 
install cases but in this case you
should<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.910> know<00:00:51.120> how<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> install<00:00:51.719> it

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
should really know how to install it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.319 
should really know how to install it
because<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.309> didn't<00:00:53.760> read<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
because at first I didn't read it and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.060 
because at first I didn't read it and
when<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.809> start<00:00:55.140> putting<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.680> felt<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
when I start putting in I felt like I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.520 
when I start putting in I felt like I
was<00:00:56.190> gonna<00:00:56.309> break<00:00:56.670> my<00:00:56.879> phone<00:00:57.180> scratch<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.320> or

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
was gonna break my phone scratch it or

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
was gonna break my phone scratch it or
potentially<00:00:59.250> even<00:00:59.370> break<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> case<00:01:00.000> when

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
potentially even break the case when

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.270 
potentially even break the case when
first<00:01:00.660> putting<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.829> after<00:01:02.070> reading

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
first putting it on but after reading

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.369 
first putting it on but after reading
the<00:01:02.489> manual<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.000> shop<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.629> them<00:01:03.840> showing<00:01:04.199> me

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the manual and shop and them showing me

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.030 
the manual and shop and them showing me
how<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.530> do<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
how to do it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.039 
how to do it
I<00:01:05.070> felt<00:01:05.339> much<00:01:05.519> easier<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.180> much<00:01:06.600> safer

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
I felt much easier and much safer

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
I felt much easier and much safer
putting<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.369> cutouts<00:01:08.760> at<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> bottom

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
putting it on the cutouts at the bottom

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.780 
putting it on the cutouts at the bottom
are<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:09.900> very<00:01:10.200> precise<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.250> has<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> very

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
are very very precise and it has a very

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.820 
are very very precise and it has a very
cool<00:01:12.000> cutout<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.689> don't<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.530> why<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
cool cutout I don't know really why it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.280 
cool cutout I don't know really why it
looks<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> chipped<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
it's supposed to be like that I really
don't<00:01:17.460> know<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.640> reason<00:01:18.060> why<00:01:18.210> same<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.730 
enjoyed this case so far I've been using
about<00:01:38.820> two<00:01:39.030> weeks<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.509> I've<00:01:39.869> actually<00:01:40.229> tried

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
about two weeks and I've actually tried

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.140 
about two weeks and I've actually tried
up<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> leather<00:01:41.280> case<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.119> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
up to the leather case on this and I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.429 
up to the leather case on this and I
preferred<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> alot<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> case<00:01:43.049> over<00:01:43.229> this

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
preferred the alot of the case over this

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.810 
preferred the alot of the case over this
because<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.280> $20<00:01:44.939> less<00:01:45.149> almost<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> same

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
because it's $20 less almost as the same

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.520 
because it's $20 less almost as the same
pretty<00:01:47.820> much<00:01:47.909> has<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.119> same<00:01:48.450> feeling<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
pretty much has the same feeling in the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
pretty much has the same feeling in the
hand<00:01:49.740> except<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> mattes<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.119> that's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
hand except this is mattes and that's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.389 
hand except this is mattes and that's
leather<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.960> leather<00:01:52.409> world<00:01:52.710> where<00:01:53.009> more

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
leather and leather world where more

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.760 
leather and leather world where more
quickly<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.060> easily<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:55.530> will

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
quickly and easily and this one will

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.190 
quickly and easily and this one will
last<00:01:56.310> me<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.759> longer<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> same

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
last me much longer it's the same

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.499 
last me much longer it's the same
thinness<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.070> overall<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.329> very

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
thinness and overall it's just a very

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.139 
thinness and overall it's just a very
same<00:02:00.750> case<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.009> only<00:02:02.250> difference<00:02:02.820> that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
same case but the only difference that

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.499 
same case but the only difference that
it<00:02:03.420> makes<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:05.000> material<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.119> made<00:02:06.329> out

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it makes is the material it's made out
