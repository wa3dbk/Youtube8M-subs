00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.090
 Hi, I hope you have a great day 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.190
 name is andrés jiménez 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 sometimes asked as ideas 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.360
 crazy as the tallest buildings in the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.890
 world the longest bridges or houses 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.080
 that do not affect the environment can 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.750
 move from that just from one idea to one 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.250
 reality today we will talk 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 about the reason for being the column 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.580
 vertebral architecture 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.650
 component that allows the architect 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
 builder develop all your ideas 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.680
 and carry them in reality we will talk 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.680
 of architectural design 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.680
 it is defined as architectural design to 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
 the discipline that aims 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.550
 generate proposals and ideas for 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.080
 creation and realization of spaces 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.850
 physicists framed within the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.830
 architecture through design 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.690
 architectural plan what will be 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.850
 finally the building built with 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.860
 all the details aesthetic image 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.750
 its structural systems and all the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.000
 other systems that make up the work 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.070
 Have you ever imagined that there is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 a specialty of architecture that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.130
 is dedicated only to planning in 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.290
 all its aspects the future 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.970
 construction well the design 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.800
 architectural is an idea that comes the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.680
 design process and it serves to ensure 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.440
 one or several qualities of the project 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.890
 image functionality economy harmony e 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.420
 innovation in architectural design 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.550
 other spheres or areas of the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 design whose purpose is the development 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.270
 of structures with great design 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 structural decorative shapes as in 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.980
 the interior design furniture design 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.960
 of gardening and lighting design 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.540
 There are several types of design concepts 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.760
 the blacks of spiritual character up 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.350
 those aimed at meeting needs 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.700
 clearly practices the challenge for the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.380
 designer is according to the type of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.120
 project in question select the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.550
 appropriate type of concept that will apply 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.720
 in fact it can even be pointed out that in 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.030
 the design there are no good or bad 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.760
 concepts but good or bad choice of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.350
 these the wise choice of the concept 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.360
 It will depend on the consideration of the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.790
 particular characteristics of the project 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.800
 time and number of users activities 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.990
 that services offered are developed 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.910
 context where the project will be located 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.490
 availability of technical resources and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.590
 economic, among other patterns of 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.420
 concepts there are very many for example 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.340
 we can find the analogy with the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.230
 nature that studies the forms 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.210
 organic of plant animals or 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.730
 minerals to reinterpret them and 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.290
 express in a new design the design 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.240
 architectural is divided into four 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.040
 stages the first is the study of 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.110
 referents this means that a 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.180
 from the application or contract of the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.040
 investors the architects or 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.350
 engineers are documented on the subject 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.330
 which they screened in the second stage 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.070
 tailor the design program or 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.640
 work by identifying the components 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.830
 of the system 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.240
 and particular requirements this 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.380
 plays a substantial role in the 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.450
 investor process 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.040
 because this is who decides the aspects 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.590
 financial and economic aspects of the new 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.630
 investment the third stage is about 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.670
 the conceptual approach to the objective 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.620
 of design although it can be modified 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.240
 subsequently they are considered as 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.890
 relevant aspects the context 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.140
 architectural criteria 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.209
 structural budgeting function 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.040
 and the form is phase culminates with the 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.450
 completion of the preliminary draft in the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.640
 center to 12 as desired by the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.170
 investor to useful ways and to what 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.320
 is stipulated in the design program 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.090
 architectural and finally the fourth 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.160
 stage is charged with carrying out the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.660
 executive project concludes the process 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.700
 of architectural design with the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.650
 preparation of executive documentation 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.650
 as the set of drawings drawings 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.870
 schematics and explanatory texts used 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.700
 for the construction of the work in this 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.920
 moment the architectural design has 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.140
 finished and everything is ready for the passage 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.090
 at the beginning of the construction stage it is 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.590
 impossible to conceive the effectiveness of a 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.959
 architectural work in all its 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.209
 functional aesthetic parameters 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.549
 spatial and structural without a 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.360
 Appropriate design process within 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.980
 some of the 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.690
 that are taken into account in the design 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.570
 architectural are the 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.290
 creativity organization environment 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.130
 construction functionality constructive system 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.020
 financial viability 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.230
 the aesthetic plastic expression and the 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.940
 innovation the architectural design of 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.800
 meet the needs of spaces 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.870
 habitable for the human being from the 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.430
 aesthetic and the technological the design 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.410
 architectural presents solutions 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.360
 technical and constructive 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.890
 architecture projects some of the 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.450
 aspects that are taken into account for the 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.570
 Architectural design are creativity 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.550
 the organization the physical environment the 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.530
 functionality the construction and the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.990
 financial viability in summary 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.669
 accounts we can say that one the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.230
 design project in architecture 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.690
 understands the development of the design of 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.640
 a building the distribution of uses 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.620
 and spaces how to use the 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.120
 materials and technologies and the 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.790
 preparation of the package of plans 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.340
 details and perspectives 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.470
 2 the architectural design should be 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.300
 appropriate to employ the technology of 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.550
 structural systems look for 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.050
 efficiency and productivity allow 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.040
 accessibility to all segments 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.560
 social 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.150
 3 currently design 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.160
 architecture has evolved in the 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.140
 conceptual and technological aspects 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.030
 then the manual labor of the designers 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.400
 and architects has been facilitated since 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.990
 late 20th century with the foray into 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.060
 the market of innovative and useful 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.800
 design tools I hope this 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.390
 information has been useful to solve 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.310
 your doubts you can contact with
