00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.640
 wrote with represented in the enzyme then 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.130
 dark drug contributing 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.010
 digestion its composition includes enzymes 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.400
 lipase which carries the same 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:31.020
 amylase break down carbohydrates charge 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.699
 proteins and other ingredients are hydrolyzed 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.879
 bile 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:42.360
 2 in a century we pour two milliliters of suar 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.360
 chicken protein for this take an egg 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:55.440
 liver in half and you either protein in a mug 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.080
 yolk as long as we leave take a spoon and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:25.740
 divide approximately 2 milliliters of chicken 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.740
 squirrel in every shoot 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:52.070
 now take the third tube for any 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:58.250
 two liters of water need a little more 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:02.250
 next we take ammonium sulfate 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.040
 let's make it centered so that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.060
 get a concentrated solution 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.729
 must be dissolved 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.520
 maximum amount of substance in 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:23.570
 the minimum amount of water we have water 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:23.570
 there is now falling asleep sulfate check and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.959
 shuffle the connection 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.430
 and while we leave take sale 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:55.240
 one pill now we need it 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:00.880
 grind or grind in a mortar for 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:08.530
 take this paper we put on it 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:16.320
 crystal fold it to tailoring not 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.320
 showered start learning 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:34.560
 take the powder 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.560
 about 2 match head 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:48.560
 the reaction is because on eyes we take 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:54.519
 hot water we put there a test tube on 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:57.680
 some time both upholstery we 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.220
 checked in the flooding there temperature is 36 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.989
 degrees for you 7 minutes now 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.530
 pour in one milliliter 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.950
 saturated sauce and fleet agony in each 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.950
 forever 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.160
 in one of the test tubes at the bottom is formed 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:31.060
 sediment 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:34.930
 and the second no change in the second 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.760
 change is not observed protein guide 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.730
 realized further on acid and peak 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.560
 sith with low molecular weight 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.960
 which is not the case in the presence of 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.820
 strong electrolytes in our case 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.820
 strong rift or is ammonium sulphate
