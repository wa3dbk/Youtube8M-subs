for<00:00:07.680> DS<00:00:07.859> clotilda<00:00:08.340> tag<00:00:08.760> which<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.360> used<00:00:09.570> for

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
for DS clotilda tag which is used for

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.999 
for DS clotilda tag which is used for
cloth<00:00:09.990> simulation<00:00:12.230> it's<00:00:13.230> quite<00:00:13.500> easy<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.889> use

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
cloth simulation it's quite easy to use

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.000 
cloth simulation it's quite easy to use
but<00:00:14.580> there<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> catch<00:00:15.240> as<00:00:15.540> you'll<00:00:15.839> see<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.770> we

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
but there is a catch as you'll see if we

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.040 
but there is a catch as you'll see if we
start<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> plain<00:00:17.730> object<00:00:18.359> which<00:00:18.779> most

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
start with a plain object which most

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.650 
start with a plain object which most
closely<00:00:19.500> represents<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:20.189> piece<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> cloth<00:00:20.789> then

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
closely represents a piece of cloth then

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.420 
closely represents a piece of cloth then
increase<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.230> number<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.529> segments<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.279> make

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
increase the number of segments to make

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.150 
increase the number of segments to make
it<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> little<00:00:23.730> smoother<00:00:24.350> then<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:26.039> that

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
it a little smoother then with that

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.120 
it a little smoother then with that
plane<00:00:26.460> selected<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.630> go<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> tags<00:00:28.230> clotilda

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
plane selected if we go to tags clotilda

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.540 
plane selected if we go to tags clotilda
tag<00:00:29.630> cloth<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> tag<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.160> supplies<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
tag cloth we get a tag that supplies a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.299 
tag cloth we get a tag that supplies a
bunch<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.090> forces<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> object<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.890> force

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
bunch of forces to the object now force

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.240 
bunch of forces to the object now force
implies<00:00:35.850> dynamics<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.200> movement<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
implies dynamics that is movement so

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.650 
implies dynamics that is movement so
let's<00:00:38.460> see<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.730> happens<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.390> click<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
let's see what happens if we click to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.049 
let's see what happens if we click to
play<00:00:39.960> animation<00:00:40.410> button<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.550> should<00:00:41.790> start

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
play animation button it should start

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.060 
play animation button it should start
falling<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.780> something<00:00:43.230> under<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> influence

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
falling or something under the influence

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.970 
falling or something under the influence
of<00:00:44.160> gravity<00:00:44.360> but<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> doesn't<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.559> here's<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
of gravity but it doesn't so here's the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.440 
of gravity but it doesn't so here's the
trick<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.730> need<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> make<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> object

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
trick we need to make the object

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.319 
trick we need to make the object
editable<00:00:49.289> by<00:00:49.530> clicking<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> icon<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.730> using

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
editable by clicking this icon or using

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.840 
editable by clicking this icon or using
the<00:00:51.420> keyboard<00:00:51.600> shortcuts<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.789> we

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the keyboard shortcuts see now if we

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.910 
the keyboard shortcuts see now if we
play<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> object<00:00:54.809> will<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.170> influenced<00:00:55.770> by

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
play it the object will be influenced by

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.549 
play it the object will be influenced by
gravity<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.430> fall<00:00:56.850> downward<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:58.020> course<00:00:58.350> this

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
gravity and fall downward of course this

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
gravity and fall downward of course this
isn't<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.949> proper<00:00:59.160> demonstration<00:00:59.430> of<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
isn't a proper demonstration of the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
isn't a proper demonstration of the
cloth<00:01:00.390> effect<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.170> let's<00:01:01.379> move<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> cloth

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
cloth effect so let's move the cloth

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.609 
cloth effect so let's move the cloth
plane<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.430> along<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> y<00:01:03.000> axis<00:01:03.260> actually<00:01:04.260> we

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
plane up along the y axis actually we

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
plane up along the y axis actually we
need<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> delete<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> cloth<00:01:05.549> tag<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.000> order<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
need to delete the cloth tag in order to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.450 
need to delete the cloth tag in order to
be<00:01:06.450> able<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> move<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> plane<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.189> can

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
be able to move the plane now we can

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.310 
be able to move the plane now we can
slide<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> plane<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.450> add<00:01:10.020> another

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
slide the plane up and add another

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.050 
slide the plane up and add another
object<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> scene<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> cloth<00:01:11.760> can

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
object to the scene that the cloth can

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.929 
object to the scene that the cloth can
collide<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.920> we<00:01:13.920> also<00:01:14.100> need<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> remember<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
collide with we also need to remember to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.670 
collide with we also need to remember to
replace<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> cloth<00:01:15.869> tag<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> plane

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
replace the cloth tag to the plane

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.490 
replace the cloth tag to the plane
object<00:01:17.150> if<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.360> hit<00:01:18.479> play<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
object if we hit play now we see the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
object if we hit play now we see the
cloth<00:01:19.770> plane<00:01:20.130> falls<00:01:20.520> right<00:01:20.700> through<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
cloth plane falls right through the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
cloth plane falls right through the
other<00:01:21.299> object<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:22.890> because<00:01:23.040> we

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
other object and this is not because we

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
other object and this is not because we
fail<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.549> make<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.970> new<00:01:24.119> object<00:01:24.540> editable

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
fail to make the new object editable

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
fail to make the new object editable
instead<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.610> neglected<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
instead it is because we neglected to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.060 
instead it is because we neglected to
tell<00:01:27.420> cinema<00:01:27.840> 4d<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.350> treat<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
tell cinema 4d to treat this like a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.550 
tell cinema 4d to treat this like a
collision<00:01:29.670> object<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> new<00:01:31.380> object

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
collision object so with the new object

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.219 
collision object so with the new object
selected<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.759> tags<00:01:33.180> fulfill<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> tag

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
selected go to tags fulfill the tag

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.130 
selected go to tags fulfill the tag
Collider<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> cloth<00:01:36.329> plane<00:01:36.630> will<00:01:36.840> fall

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
Collider now the cloth plane will fall

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140 
Collider now the cloth plane will fall
and<00:01:37.439> wrap<00:01:37.590> around<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> object

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
and wrap around the object

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.700 
and wrap around the object
cool

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
cool

a<00:01:41.770> good<00:01:42.549> exercise<00:01:42.820> for<00:01:43.030> learning<00:01:43.600> more<00:01:43.750> about

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
a good exercise for learning more about

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.560 
a good exercise for learning more about
the<00:01:44.260> cloth<00:01:44.500> tag<00:01:44.799> is<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.100> make<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.280> flag<00:01:45.729> so

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
the cloth tag is to make a flag so

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.330 
the cloth tag is to make a flag so
delete<00:01:46.869> everything<00:01:47.200> start<00:01:47.920> with<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.070> plain

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
x-direction note that you also need to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.910 
x-direction note that you also need to
increase<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.720> wind<00:02:32.900> strength<00:02:33.260> setting<00:02:33.829> in

order<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.489> work<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:36.049> works<00:02:36.410> but

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
order for this to work so this works but

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.430 
order for this to work so this works but
the<00:02:36.799> flag<00:02:37.040> looks<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.400> little<00:02:37.489> too<00:02:37.760> floppy<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:39.290> go

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the flag looks a little too floppy so go

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.559 
the flag looks a little too floppy so go
to<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.739> tag<00:02:40.040> tab<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.670> increase<00:02:41.390> the

to the tag tab and increase the

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.720 
to the tag tab and increase the

stiffness play around with some of the
other<00:02:43.879> settings<00:02:44.329> as<00:02:44.510> well<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.250> now<00:02:46.250> we<00:02:46.310> have<00:02:46.579> a

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
other settings as well and now we have a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:57.980 
other settings as well and now we have a
decent<00:02:46.910> flag<00:02:47.299> simulation<00:02:48.019> nice

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990
