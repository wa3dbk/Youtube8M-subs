income of physicians at that time by

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.219 
income of physicians at that time by
something<00:01:24.909> between<00:01:25.260> 17<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.439> 30<00:01:26.650> percent<00:01:28.229> now

something between 17 to 30 percent now
the<00:01:29.290> recent<00:01:30.280> figures<00:01:30.460> would<00:01:30.729> probably<00:01:31.150> be<00:01:31.270> in

the recent figures would probably be in

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
I would like to see that evidence and so

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.830 
I would like to see that evidence and so
would<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:21.550> of<00:03:22.550> course<00:03:22.610> licensures<00:03:23.570> use

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
would you and of course licensures use

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.680 
would you and of course licensures use
much<00:03:24.110> more<00:03:24.350> broadly<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:25.630> mentioned<00:03:26.630> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
much more broadly I mentioned the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.570 
much more broadly I mentioned the
medical<00:03:27.020> example<00:03:27.500> because<00:03:27.770> it<00:03:27.950> seems<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.430> more

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
medical example because it seems a more

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.600 
medical example because it seems a more
best<00:03:28.880> justified<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.410> way<00:03:30.610> it's

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
best justified and it is in a way it's

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.970 
best justified and it is in a way it's
it's<00:03:32.300> harder<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.810> argue<00:03:32.990> against<00:03:33.650> than<00:03:33.830> almost

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
it's harder to argue against than almost

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.250 
it's harder to argue against than almost
anything<00:03:34.370> else<00:03:34.610> but<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.600> go<00:03:35.750> down<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.110> line

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
anything else but you go down the line

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.480 
anything else but you go down the line
have<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.560> ever<00:03:36.710> looked<00:03:36.860> at<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> number<00:03:37.460> of

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
have you ever looked at the number of

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.150 
have you ever looked at the number of
