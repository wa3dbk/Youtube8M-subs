00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 and this 5 1 did not hurt 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.050
 3 this is not 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.050
 Victoria Tesliuk 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:15.559
 it's hard now 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.390
 as notes that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.859
 statistical committee 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.859
 cases when 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.920
 Well, like for example 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.680
 only 4 39 it opens a half 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.120
 of the year 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 everything will work out 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.590
 this approach is very bad 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.590
 now 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 if you lose 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 if a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.850
 Besides 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.480
 I work 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.280
 in the previous 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.780
 there was a situation so far 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.780
 after labor 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.330
 price volume open 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.350
 minus it is very dangerous 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.890
 Further 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.410
 ignore 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.410
 farther 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.750
 does not know 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.049
 there are arguments about how much more complicated 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.089
 in twitter 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.089
 if you remove here 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.839
 4 4 4 seconds to honor 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.539
 you can insert killed the younger generation 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.769
 in the document 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.899
 let's 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.569
 penalty 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.669
 according to statements
