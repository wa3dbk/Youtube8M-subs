that a lot of times you're coming trim
making<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.190> transition<00:04:35.400> from<00:04:35.700> ballet<00:04:36.240> to

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
making that transition from ballet to

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.480 
making that transition from ballet to
hip-hop<00:04:36.690> can<00:04:37.290> be<00:04:37.440> difficult<00:04:37.950> but<00:04:38.160> one<00:04:38.340> thing

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
hip-hop can be difficult but one thing

hip-hop can be difficult but one thing
with<00:04:38.610> ballet<00:04:38.760> we<00:04:39.000> do<00:04:39.150> have<00:04:39.300> counts<00:04:39.780> all<00:04:40.320> right

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
with ballet we do have counts all right

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.290 
with ballet we do have counts all right
and<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.800> dance<00:04:41.040> classes<00:04:41.490> we<00:04:41.610> do<00:04:41.760> have<00:04:41.910> counts

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
and in dance classes we do have counts

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.000 
and in dance classes we do have counts
so<00:04:42.390> if<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.630> if<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.110> learn<00:04:43.290> through<00:04:43.560> counts

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
so if you if you learn through counts

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.390 
so if you if you learn through counts
then<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:44.760> have<00:04:44.970> your<00:04:45.210> your<00:04:45.750> one<00:04:45.960> two<00:04:46.620> three

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
then you have your your one two three

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.260 
then you have your your one two three
