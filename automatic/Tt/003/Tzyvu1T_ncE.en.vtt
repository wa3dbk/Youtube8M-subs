with an Arri Alexa ProRes shot I know

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.940 
with an Arri Alexa ProRes shot I know
that<00:00:20.390> this<00:00:20.480> is<00:00:20.660> recorded<00:00:21.140> in<00:00:21.260> log<00:00:21.440> C<00:00:21.710> and

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
that this is recorded in log C and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.770 
that this is recorded in log C and
suppose<00:00:22.580> I'm<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:22.790> kind<00:00:23.090> of<00:00:23.210> colorist<00:00:23.600> who's

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 
suppose I'm the kind of colorist who's

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.540 
suppose I'm the kind of colorist who's
comfortable<00:00:24.050> with<00:00:24.320> applying<00:00:24.860> my<00:00:25.040> grades<00:00:25.310> in

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
the camera space all I'd need is an

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.740 
the camera space all I'd need is an
appropriate<00:00:28.400> way<00:00:28.760> to<00:00:28.820> view<00:00:29.090> log<00:00:29.300> C<00:00:29.540> and

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
appropriate way to view log C and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.840 
appropriate way to view log C and
traditionally<00:00:30.650> I'd<00:00:30.800> do<00:00:31.010> this<00:00:31.160> by<00:00:31.370> downloading

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
traditionally I'd do this by downloading

p3 luck and I can work in much the same

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.959 
p3 luck and I can work in much the same
way<00:00:43.640> as<00:00:43.969> a<00:00:44.030> classic<00:00:44.510> film<00:00:44.780> grade<00:00:45.699> suppose<00:00:46.699> on

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
way as a classic film grade suppose on

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.610 
way as a classic film grade suppose on
the<00:00:47.089> other<00:00:47.210> hand<00:00:47.480> I<00:00:47.690> was<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.319> kind<00:00:48.559> of

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
the other hand I was the kind of

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.529 
the other hand I was the kind of
colorist<00:00:49.100> who<00:00:49.280> likes<00:00:49.519> to<00:00:49.699> grade<00:00:49.909> in<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.210> display

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
colorist who likes to grade in a display

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.619 
colorist who likes to grade in a display
space<00:00:51.010> then<00:00:52.010> traditionally<00:00:52.819> I<00:00:52.999> would<00:00:53.030> use<00:00:53.449> the

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
space then traditionally I would use the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.719 
space then traditionally I would use the
same<00:00:53.659> kind<00:00:54.170> of<00:00:54.260> luck<00:00:54.469> to<00:00:54.859> render<00:00:55.159> the<00:00:55.249> material

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
same kind of luck to render the material

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.450 
same kind of luck to render the material
on<00:00:55.850> input<00:00:56.440> provided<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.530> display<00:00:57.920> space<00:00:58.219> of

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
on input provided the display space of

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.790 
on input provided the display space of
the<00:00:58.579> luck<00:00:58.729> matches<00:00:59.210> my<00:00:59.359> grading<00:00:59.629> display<00:01:00.079> then

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
the luck matches my grading display then

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.349 
the luck matches my grading display then
there's<00:01:01.010> no<00:01:01.159> need<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.370> apply<00:01:01.819> a<00:01:01.850> lot<00:01:02.089> or

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
there's no need to apply a lot or

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.410 
there's no need to apply a lot or

I<00:01:05.630> can<00:01:06.229> now<00:01:06.380> continue<00:01:06.740> in<00:01:07.130> much<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.310> same<00:01:07.520> way

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
I can now continue in much the same way

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.060 
I can now continue in much the same way
