00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
going to be focusing on color gain and

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.499 
going to be focusing on color gain and
white<00:01:15.720> point<00:01:15.960> lighting<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:18.030> color<00:01:18.270> gain

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
white point lighting the color gain

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.320 
white point lighting the color gain
changes<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> amount<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.530> red<00:01:19.890> green<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:21.000> blue

changes the amount of red green and blue

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
changes the amount of red green and blue
coloring<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.259> drag<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> slider<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
coloring if you drag the slider to the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.490 
coloring if you drag the slider to the
right<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.790> increases<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> intensity<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:25.320> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
right it increases the intensity if you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
right it increases the intensity if you
drag<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> left<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.689> decreases<00:01:27.689> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
drag it to the left it decreases that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.940 
drag it to the left it decreases that
intensity<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:28.590> each<00:01:28.650> respective<00:01:29.009> color<00:01:30.950> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
intensity for each respective color so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
intensity for each respective color so
what<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.100> basically<00:01:32.159> did<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.909> my<00:01:33.000> intro<00:01:33.360> was

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
what I basically did for my intro was

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.710 
what I basically did for my intro was
take<00:01:34.020> each<00:01:34.200> video<00:01:34.500> segment<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.570> change<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
take each video segment and change the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.149 
take each video segment and change the
color<00:01:36.900> gain<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> notice

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
color gain so that there was a notice

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
color gain so that there was a notice
noticeable<00:01:38.790> difference<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> color<00:01:39.450> so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
noticeable difference in the color so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.539 
noticeable difference in the color so
when<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> played<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.770> looked<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.280> fluid

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
when it played it looked like one fluid

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
when it played it looked like one fluid
