00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
650 so I'm just kind of holding off

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.200 
650 so I'm just kind of holding off
because<00:04:47.920> I<00:04:48.130> know<00:04:48.190> I<00:04:48.280> could<00:04:48.550> find<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.850> cheaper

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
because I know I could find it cheaper

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.960 
because I know I could find it cheaper
eventually<00:04:49.690> look<00:04:50.350> at<00:04:50.440> that<00:04:50.790> is<00:04:51.790> that

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
eventually look at that is that

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:01.619 
eventually look at that is that
beautiful<00:04:52.120> or<00:04:52.450> what

true<00:05:02.229> cronograph<00:05:02.710> movement<00:05:03.249> and<00:05:03.580> for<00:05:03.729> those

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
true cronograph movement and for those

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:04.829 
true cronograph movement and for those
of<00:05:03.939> you<00:05:03.999> who<00:05:04.059> don't<00:05:04.179> know<00:05:04.270> what<00:05:04.449> a<00:05:04.509> chronograph
