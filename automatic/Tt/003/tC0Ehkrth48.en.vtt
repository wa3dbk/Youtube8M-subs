not<00:06:06.569> bad<00:06:06.780> they<00:06:07.439> make<00:06:07.650> a<00:06:07.680> pair<00:06:07.979> of<00:06:08.009> frame<00:06:08.370> 2

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 
not bad they make a pair of frame 2

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.640 
not bad they make a pair of frame 2
which<00:06:10.319> is<00:06:10.590> the<00:06:10.979> exact<00:06:11.460> same<00:06:11.729> as<00:06:12.000> this<00:06:12.529> but<00:06:13.529> it's

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
which is the exact same as this but it's

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.050 
which is the exact same as this but it's
a<00:06:13.710> little<00:06:13.919> longer<00:06:14.129> but<00:06:14.430> I<00:06:14.490> like<00:06:14.669> this<00:06:14.819> because

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
a little longer but I like this because

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.350 
a little longer but I like this because
it<00:06:15.389> at<00:06:15.889> plus<00:06:16.889> um<00:06:17.159> when<00:06:17.729> I<00:06:17.759> bought<00:06:18.029> it<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.180> store

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
it at plus um when I bought it the store

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.610 
it at plus um when I bought it the store
didn't<00:06:18.509> have<00:06:18.539> any<00:06:18.719> more<00:06:18.870> pair<00:06:19.050> for<00:06:19.199> him<00:06:19.289> to<00:06:19.409> but

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
didn't have any more pair for him to but

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.080 
didn't have any more pair for him to but
I<00:06:19.650> kind<00:06:19.860> of<00:06:19.949> like<00:06:20.069> this<00:06:20.159> one<00:06:20.340> better<00:06:20.550> then<00:06:20.969> it

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
I kind of like this one better then it

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.309 
I kind of like this one better then it
cuz<00:06:21.240> my<00:06:21.360> step-brother<00:06:21.629> has<00:06:21.900> that<00:06:22.080> one<00:06:22.669> then<00:06:23.669> um

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
cuz my step-brother has that one then um

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.779 
cuz my step-brother has that one then um
because<00:06:25.319> this<00:06:25.529> one<00:06:25.680> is<00:06:25.830> more<00:06:26.099> touching<00:06:26.699> it

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
because this one is more touching it

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:33.679 
because this one is more touching it
fits<00:06:27.060> in<00:06:27.180> your<00:06:27.210> pocket<00:06:27.389> better<00:06:32.449> but<00:06:33.449> it's

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:33.689 
fits in your pocket better but it's

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:43.300 
fits in your pocket better but it's
actually<00:06:34.080> not<00:06:34.259> as<00:06:34.620> big<00:06:34.800> as<00:06:34.919> it<00:06:34.949> looks<00:06:41.180> but<00:06:42.180> um

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
actually not as big as it looks but um

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.119 
actually not as big as it looks but um
and<00:06:44.310> I<00:06:44.460> am<00:06:45.319> like<00:06:46.319> I<00:06:46.440> was<00:06:46.560> saying<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:46.949> UM

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.129 
and I am like I was saying the UM

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.249 
and I am like I was saying the UM
paraphrase<00:06:47.759> a<00:06:47.789> little<00:06:47.879> longer<00:06:48.479> it's<00:06:48.810> actually

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
paraphrase a little longer it's actually

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.749 
paraphrase a little longer it's actually
it's<00:06:49.379> a<00:06:49.469> bit<00:06:49.620> longer<00:06:49.860> but<00:06:50.159> I<00:06:50.219> think<00:06:50.490> this<00:06:50.610> fits

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
it's a bit longer but I think this fits

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.300 
it's a bit longer but I think this fits
in<00:06:50.849> your<00:06:50.909> pocket<00:06:51.060> better<00:06:51.389> and<00:06:52.099> um<00:06:53.099> I<00:06:53.250> think

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
in your pocket better and um I think

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.820 
in your pocket better and um I think
it's<00:06:53.490> about<00:06:53.759> five<00:06:54.360> bucks<00:06:54.629> more<00:06:54.870> I'm<00:06:55.440> not<00:06:55.620> quite
