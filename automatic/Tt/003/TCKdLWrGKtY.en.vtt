00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.650 
flat coat to what work we've done
already<00:00:24.529> I've<00:00:25.529> done<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> bit<00:00:26.039> more<00:00:26.250> work<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
kit since last time we visited it I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.950 
kit since last time we visited it I
thought<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.910> nose<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.809> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
thought that the the nose with it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.700 
thought that the the nose with it's
fairly<00:00:34.200> pale<00:00:35.090> gray<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.870> yellow<00:00:37.200> areas<00:00:37.590> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
fairly pale gray and the yellow areas of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
fairly pale gray and the yellow areas of
the<00:00:37.770> front<00:00:38.010> looked<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.610> little<00:00:38.850> bit<00:00:38.969> flat<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the front looked a little bit flat and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.520 
the front looked a little bit flat and
soo<00:00:39.899> dimensional<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.040> I've<00:00:41.129> added<00:00:41.370> some

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
soo dimensional so I've added some

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.889 
soo dimensional so I've added some
fairly<00:00:43.530> subtle<00:00:43.800> panel<00:00:44.670> highlighting<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
fairly subtle panel highlighting and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.889 
fairly subtle panel highlighting and
also<00:00:46.230> shadows<00:00:46.890> shading<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
also shadows shading with with the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.459 
also shadows shading with with the
airbrush<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> meantime<00:00:51.199> I've<00:00:52.199> also

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
airbrush in the meantime I've also

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.430

thread and makes it hard to actually get

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.080 
thread and makes it hard to actually get
the<00:02:36.610> lid<00:02:36.790> off<00:02:37.980> when<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.160> happens<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.580> me<00:02:39.790> I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
the lid off when this happens to me I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.330 
the lid off when this happens to me I
run<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.780> jar<00:02:41.020> under<00:02:41.470> some<00:02:41.650> hot<00:02:41.860> water<00:02:42.040> and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
run the jar under some hot water and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.110 
run the jar under some hot water and
then<00:02:43.240> I've<00:02:43.810> got<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.050> rubber<00:02:44.710> mat<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.520> is

that today
first<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.320> all<00:03:11.410> we'll<00:03:12.370> add<00:03:12.550> some<00:03:15.570> flat<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
first of all we'll add some flat to the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
first of all we'll add some flat to the
paint<00:03:17.080> Cup<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.650> today<00:03:18.400> we'll<00:03:19.269> be<00:03:19.300> using<00:03:19.800> poly

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
paint Cup and today we'll be using poly

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.350 
paint Cup and today we'll be using poly
scale<00:03:21.070> alcohol<00:03:21.580> thinner<00:03:21.880> but<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.239> also

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
scale alcohol thinner but you can also

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.009 
scale alcohol thinner but you can also
use<00:03:22.450> water<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:24.430> thin<00:03:24.670> down<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:25.570> paint

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
use water to to thin down the paint

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.470 
use water to to thin down the paint
I<00:03:26.050> like<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.709> alcohol<00:03:27.070> thinner<00:03:27.310> because<00:03:27.489> the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
I like the alcohol thinner because the

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.610 
I like the alcohol thinner because the
the<00:03:29.470> fine<00:03:30.209> nozzle<00:03:31.209> makes<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.660> very<00:03:31.870> easily<00:03:32.080> to

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
the fine nozzle makes it very easily to

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.759 
the fine nozzle makes it very easily to
get<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:33.239> specific<00:03:34.239> amount<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.900> thinner<00:03:35.410> into

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
get a specific amount of thinner into

in this case an old notepad I'm pretty

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.080 
in this case an old notepad I'm pretty
happy<00:03:53.290> with<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.440> so<00:03:53.830> let's<00:03:54.070> actually<00:03:54.910> start

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
happy with that so let's actually start

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.449 
happy with that so let's actually start
on<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.690> model<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.110> like<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.070> start<00:03:57.280> on<00:03:57.370> the

on the model I like to start on the
lower<00:03:57.640> surfaces<00:03:58.180> we<00:03:58.959> just<00:03:59.140> have<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.350> fine

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
lower surfaces we just have a fine

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.570

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
of the model it really won't take very

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.410
