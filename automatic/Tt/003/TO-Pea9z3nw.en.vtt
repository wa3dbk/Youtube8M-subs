00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
back together so I'll figure it out or

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.270 
back together so I'll figure it out or
I'll<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.579> send<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> Kenna<00:00:39.090> powder<00:00:40.280> take

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
I'll just send it to Kenna powder take

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.549 
I'll just send it to Kenna powder take
sixty<00:00:41.640> motor<00:00:42.649> cases<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.829> split<00:00:44.129> came

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
sixty motor cases just split came

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.500 
sixty motor cases just split came
there's<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.680> nothing<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.640> basically

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
there's really nothing to it I basically

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.700 
there's really nothing to it I basically
just<00:00:48.600> jammed<00:00:48.930> everything<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> clutch<00:00:49.500> cover

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
just jammed everything the clutch cover

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.020 
just jammed everything the clutch cover
because<00:00:49.980> there<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.250> nothing<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.910> just

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
because there was nothing to it just

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.200 
because there was nothing to it just
some<00:00:51.270> gears<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.840> go<00:00:51.960> together<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:53.210> basically

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
some gears that go together so basically

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.729 
some gears that go together so basically
I'm<00:00:54.690> pretty<00:00:54.870> sure<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.140> gonna<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.500> big

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
I'm pretty sure that's gonna be a big

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.319 
I'm pretty sure that's gonna be a big
bitch<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.129> put<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.430> together<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:57.000> because

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
bitch to put back together just because

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.040 
bitch to put back together just because
it<00:00:57.449> was<00:00:57.539> easy<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.899> take<00:00:58.020> apart<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:59.809> got<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> little

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
it was easy to take apart I got a little

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.820 
it was easy to take apart I got a little
porting<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.350> where<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
porting on the in the where the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.530 
porting on the in the where the
crankshaft<00:01:05.070> goes<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.610> bit<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.240> pretty

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
crankshaft goes a little bit it's pretty

stupid things right here I tried to as
you<00:01:55.170> could<00:01:55.290> see<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:55.950> couldn't

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
you could see it but it just couldn't

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.760 
you could see it but it just couldn't
just<00:01:57.570> had<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> take<00:01:57.930> off<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:58.380> bolt<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
just had to take off that one bolt to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.280 
just had to take off that one bolt to
move<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> way

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
move that out of the way

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.600 
move that out of the way
50<00:02:01.290> ohms<00:02:01.470> easier<00:02:01.770> than<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> thought<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.310> get<00:02:02.460> out

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
50 ohms easier than I thought to get out

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.460 
50 ohms easier than I thought to get out
but<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.510> why<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:03.720> was<00:02:03.810> easy<00:02:03.900> cuz<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
but you know why it was easy cuz it

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.310 
but you know why it was easy cuz it
actually<00:02:04.770> broke<00:02:06.080> that's<00:02:07.080> not<00:02:07.470> good<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.950> all

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
actually broke that's not good at all

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.030 
actually broke that's not good at all
okay<00:02:10.320> broke<00:02:11.130> my<00:02:11.370> shift<00:02:11.610> drum<00:02:12.620> I'm<00:02:13.620> not<00:02:13.830> happy

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
okay broke my shift drum I'm not happy

okay broke my shift drum I'm not happy
at<00:02:14.280> all<00:02:14.340> about<00:02:14.490> that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
at all about that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.910 
at all about that
and<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.209> gotta<00:02:18.390> find<00:02:18.570> one<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.810> these<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:22.770> when

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
and I gotta find one of these just when

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.960 
and I gotta find one of these just when
I<00:02:22.950> thought<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.160> was<00:02:23.340> easy<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.640> take<00:02:23.790> apart<00:02:23.910> huh

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
I thought it was easy to take apart huh

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.890 
I thought it was easy to take apart huh
hopefully<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.060> new<00:02:27.209> one<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.570> got<00:02:27.750> will

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
hopefully the new one that I got will

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.830 
hopefully the new one that I got will
not<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:29.580> head<00:02:29.880> over<00:02:30.120> here<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.660> I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
not have this head over here on it I

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.390 
not have this head over here on it I
could<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.290> put<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.590> after<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.280> don't

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
could just put that on after but I don't

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.520 
could just put that on after but I don't
even<00:02:32.459> think<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.850> do<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> looks

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
even think you can do that so it looks

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.390 
even think you can do that so it looks
like<00:02:34.560> I'll<00:02:34.739> have<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.920> try<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.130> get<00:02:35.280> off<00:02:35.370> that

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
like I'll have to try to get off that

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.710 
like I'll have to try to get off that
boat<00:02:35.730> right<00:02:35.940> there<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.300> could<00:02:36.450> take<00:02:36.540> off

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
boat right there so I could take off

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.000 
boat right there so I could take off
this<00:02:36.840> whole<00:02:37.050> assembly<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.620> I'll<00:02:37.800> work<00:02:37.950> with

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
this whole assembly but I'll work with

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.210 
this whole assembly but I'll work with
that<00:02:38.220> later<00:02:38.570> all<00:02:39.570> right<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.560> yeah<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> case<00:02:41.040> it's
