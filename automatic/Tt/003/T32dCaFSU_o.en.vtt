00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.009
 hello guys welcome to my channel 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.679
 if you are watching this video, it's because 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.660
 your mother or someone from you 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.640
 family does not get to have a pet 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.800
 ok so here I have some tics 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:25.320
 some guidelines to follow to make it 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.289
 easier to convince them so to speak 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.140
 I buy them the first thing you have to 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.960
 is to be sure that you can do 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.600
 charge of him and that you can commit 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.129
 to do all your care and have in 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.489
 account for everything negative and positive 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.900
 of the animal that you have chosen from 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.350
 hence, let's start 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.420
 If you do not want by spending money 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.780
 summer share your all expenses 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.840
 if they have a pay you can talk about it and 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.170
 dedicate a part to alcohol nothing 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.710
 Clear 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.159
 and if you do not have pay then something that I 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.159
 I now make all the money I have at 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.939
 better for your birthday for your saint 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.470
 for life and always leaves a part 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.200
 saved for example 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.420
 in twenty euros let's put that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.610
 never spend yourself in case there's ever 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.850
 to take your animal to the veterinarian of 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.470
 urgency and you do not have to pay it then 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.470
 that is a good technique 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.440
 well, it can also be for lack 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.200
 of space in this case try to choose 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.560
 an animal that is small a water type 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.869
 and from the roll that the cage is a 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.350
 animal from cages in the terrarium or 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.149
 fish tank or something like paquito you see or 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.149
 how do you look at the cookie 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.940
 and you will always have your room if the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.630
 problem is that you share room 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.700
 ask your partner if 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.830
 agrees on the idea and if not then 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.530
 that helps you somewhere to choose the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.680
 animal that he or she too 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.790
 you agree to have if what you 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.590
 your family member is worried that the waves 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.890
 diseases 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.900
 Well, if you want, look 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.790
 infect something or whatever 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.980
 show him not to inform himself about his 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.280
 most common diseases and check if 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.560
 they are dangerous for the human being 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.230
 If the problem is with them that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.420
 example they do not want to end up dealing 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.630
 of an animal that you do not want to get bored 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.550
 of committing to spend time to 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.739
 spend time with him and perform his 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:58.290
 cares if what happens to him is that and he says 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.450
 that does not believe you because it happened to you 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.700
 I know that with this animal that you had 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.330
 I do not know how many years and tweets do not but if 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.820
 and so I'm going to put on and they tell you 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:15.420
 they do not believe you because for whatever reason 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.590
 I have a little trick but do not take me 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.590
 by crazy please 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.690
 but to give him a deal you will see the deal 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.450
 will consist of the following you 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.500
 you will pick up a doll or a stuffed animal or something 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.750
 like that and I'll treat it like a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.370
 animal as if it were the animal that 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.140
 you have chosen if for example it is a 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:42.910
 hamster then you have to commit to 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:45.860
 clean the cage every time or 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.620
 whatever it is also the water all 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.690
 the days and all that you do with the 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.180
 doll you will have a place prepared to 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.760
 doll where the original hamster would go and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.610
 you do all the care during 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.190
 a few months so he does not think that he 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.260
 they bore him and they will verify that 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:09.800
 really because you do the care and 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.070
 The treatment will consist of I take care of 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.720
 this doll to this stuffed animal or this what 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.720
 it is not really 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:24.150
 but the good whatsapp I commit myself to 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.639
 take care of this doll as if it were 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.979
 true in exchange for that if I get it 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.710
 during the months that you ask me 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.060
 please do not pass you always tell 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.510
 that 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.380
 then you let me have the animal 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.760
 really if I get to pass the test 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.600
 they will usually say yes if they tell you 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.940
 I do not feel it, but normally 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.400
 this trick only work well is it 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.490
 it happened to me 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.590
 It's a little crazy but it can be useful 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.419
 done to me is working because what 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.820
 I'm doing right now because 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.539
 you want a guinea pig look at me I'm not 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.539
 who lie 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.470
 you are taking me for what right now 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.470
 or you are living with all that 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.419
 I would need an almond guinea pig you see 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.960
 a good rabbit will not happen is the most 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:19.770
 like I found around here for my 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.600
 fourth and good because that's all there is 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.130
 houses wants to leave also in the video 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.130
