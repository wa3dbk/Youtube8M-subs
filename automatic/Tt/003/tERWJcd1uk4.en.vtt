00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
light this this really is it is a very

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
light this this really is it is a very
thin<00:00:52.949> very<00:00:53.100> light<00:00:53.579> device<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.120> i<00:00:54.239> really

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
thin very light device which i really

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.049 
thin very light device which i really
like<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.010> thirty-three<00:00:56.520> percent<00:00:56.699> thinner

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
like it is thirty-three percent thinner

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.510 
like it is thirty-three percent thinner
than<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.600> old<00:00:57.840> model<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:59.070> feels<00:00:59.399> like

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
than the old model and it feels like

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.920 
than the old model and it feels like
it's<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.730> fifty<00:01:00.210> percent<00:01:00.510> thinner<00:01:00.780> than

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's about fifty percent thinner than

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
it's about fifty percent thinner than
the<00:01:01.079> old<00:01:01.199> model<00:01:01.289> since<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> flat<00:01:02.609> back

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the old model since it has a flat back

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
the old model since it has a flat back
now<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.510> set<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.809> down<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.140> flat<00:01:04.320> surface

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
now so you set it down on a flat surface

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.700 
now so you set it down on a flat surface
that's<00:01:04.949> not<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> wiggle<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.710> aluminum

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that's not going to wiggle the aluminum

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
that's not going to wiggle the aluminum
feels<00:01:08.100> slightly<00:01:08.490> different<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> feels<00:01:09.150> like

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
feels slightly different it feels like

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.469 
feels slightly different it feels like
it<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.630> less<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.170> brushed<00:01:10.590> feel<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
it is less of a brushed feel to it and

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.260 
it is less of a brushed feel to it and
more<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.810> guess<00:01:13.470> soft<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.340> feels<00:01:14.490> harder<00:01:14.939> if

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
more I guess soft but it feels harder if

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.350 
more I guess soft but it feels harder if
that<00:01:15.450> makes<00:01:15.659> any<00:01:15.720> sense<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.549> does<00:01:18.090> feel

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that makes any sense so it does feel

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.530 
that makes any sense so it does feel
better<00:01:19.670> but<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.060> big<00:01:21.210> things<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
better but just the big things that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.030 
better but just the big things that
thinness<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.259> incredible<00:01:22.740> they've<00:01:22.890> also

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
thinness it's incredible they've also

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.280 
thinness it's incredible they've also
gotten<00:01:23.340> rid<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> some<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> aluminum<00:01:25.020> bezel

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
gotten rid of some of the aluminum bezel

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.380 
gotten rid of some of the aluminum bezel

asphalt 6 gaming and everything just a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.530 
asphalt 6 gaming and everything just a
really<00:03:20.220> great<00:03:20.430> device<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.910> think<00:03:21.120> it's<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.330> solid

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
really great device I think it's a solid

really great device I think it's a solid
upgrade<00:03:21.840> over<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.260> iPad<00:03:22.650> 1<00:03:22.920> not<00:03:23.790> necessarily

upgrade over the iPad 1 not necessarily

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.290 
upgrade over the iPad 1 not necessarily
a<00:03:24.540> necessary<00:03:25.440> upgrade<00:03:25.860> right<00:03:26.400> now<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:27.000> speed

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
a necessary upgrade right now the speed

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.020 
a necessary upgrade right now the speed
you<00:03:27.570> feel<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.080> but<00:03:28.290> it's<00:03:28.320> not<00:03:28.620> dramatic<00:03:29.220> unless

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
you feel it but it's not dramatic unless

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.600 
you feel it but it's not dramatic unless
you<00:03:30.210> are<00:03:30.420> severe<00:03:30.930> power<00:03:31.170> user<00:03:31.500> once<00:03:32.040> software

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
you are severe power user once software

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.760 
you are severe power user once software

dual core processor this will really

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.140 
dual core processor this will really
overtake<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.230> iPad<00:03:37.560> 1<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.490> iphone<00:03:38.850> 4

overtake the iPad 1 and the iphone 4
which<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.570> starting<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.140> feel<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.350> little

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
which is starting to feel a little

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.770 
which is starting to feel a little
sluggish<00:03:40.770> which<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.250> with<00:03:41.400> that's<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.790> 4-1<00:03:42.600> gear

and solo core processor but the ipad 2
is<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:45.000> solid<00:03:45.330> upgrade<00:03:45.450> that's<00:03:46.200> unless<00:03:46.650> you

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
is a solid upgrade that's unless you

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.200 
is a solid upgrade that's unless you
have<00:03:46.980> buckets<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.550> money<00:03:47.610> sitting<00:03:47.850> around<00:03:48.000> you

have buckets of money sitting around you

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.210 
have buckets of money sitting around you
really<00:03:48.540> don't<00:03:48.780> have<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.140> upgrade<00:03:49.530> right<00:03:49.980> now

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
really don't have to upgrade right now
