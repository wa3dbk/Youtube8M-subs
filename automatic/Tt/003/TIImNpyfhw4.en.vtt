00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.900
 I think it's a balance, let's not say 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.549
 It was excellent but it is a balance 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.680
 positive knowing that we came from 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.510
 an injury and the rise we had at 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.179
 end of the tournament was good for 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.009
 us and we know that is ours 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.869
 next, let's do big things 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.439
 that he lacked the equity to be in the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.470
 party of the quarterfinals we missed 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.730
 be more effective we had many options 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.230
 and at the beginning land does not 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.419
 concreted and that cost us for the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 final when when we wanted and we started 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.379
 to add all the points no longer us 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.679
 reached but then we already have an idea and 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.820
 we already know what to play in his career 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:40.170
 good still with equity for 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.210
 insurance is sometimes ratified 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.679
 I contract his continuity yes yes I already have 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 contract with them until December would be 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.730
 loan and good I'll be until December 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.679
 I have heard them around me have 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.749
 called some some equipment but in 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.070
 that time because I can not take the 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.809
 decision because as you know I 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.640
 I belong to national because my contract 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.170
 is with national and right now I am 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.789
 loan with equity and I have to meet 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.339
 my contract has been said something by the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.290
 oil lipsticks have called me 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.090
 they have called and we have spoken it seems to me 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.070
 very interesting but although I think it's going 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.900
 to be difficult because of the economic issue 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.450
 I imagine 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.040
 I do not know if for the economic but for 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.080
 what I have as I say contract 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.180
 national and contract with equity and 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.560
 So now what if these things 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.810
 in national then we would have to talk 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.940
 with them and then a little complicated 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.310
 I imagine that the taste is there 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.270
 wanting to be always sees in some 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.160
 moment to return to the team in that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.900
 oil yes sure you do not know that this 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.640
 is the team of my loves the team that 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.090
 I want so that I will always want 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.240
 play and well let's hope that if you can 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.220
 come happy and if we do not expect that in 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.150
 a future do it a few days 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.830
 short vacations here in 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.390
 barrancabermeja and a few short days 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.830
 share with the family rest and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.420
 take a breath for what the other one is coming 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.700
 semester when I reminded you the presents 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.110
 on June 99 tell us about the others 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.450
 players who are in equity is good 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.020
 one is also going to start you go there 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.119
 is training for guillén 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.009
 right now I'm staying with sub-20 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.009
 training but but then there they have 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.710
 taken into account has played 23 games and 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.539
 it's a boy who is going to come in hopefully 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.429
 better semester not the second already the 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.500
 finalization of the league with this equity 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.790
 and it comes back in its personally also yes 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.930
 let's hope that if this is the case with the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.940
 help from god we know about the conditions 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.970
 that we have and the great team that we have 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.879
 formed came to drugs not to arms 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.140

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.030
