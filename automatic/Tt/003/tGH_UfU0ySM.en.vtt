00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello girls now I will show a few 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.990
 tricks with magnetic gel polish on white 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.560
 the basis on our gray-beige magnetic 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.390
 gel polish take a magnet and attach to 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.880
 the end of the nail and then such 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.590
 with short movements, as if I am dragging off 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.630
 right morning to the base of the nails is obtained 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.630
 Here is a cat gradient 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.300
 then the second layer I repeat also such 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.940
 designs can be made in different colors 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.120
 the basics and there will be different effects 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 and you can also do the reverse side 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.780
 gradient 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.540
 here for example on a black base with 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.970
 that you can hold the magnet longer 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:01.400
 the end of the marigold is not necessary to drive them 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:03.800
 many get a cool second gradient 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.350
 way of war standard design with 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.320
 I'm a cat on a black basis on our 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.369
 green cat's eye and magnet 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.130
 I put an edge and it turns out our 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.670
 cat's eyes diverge on the sides well and 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.159
 so in 2 layers 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 You can leave it so, but you can do it somehow 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:29.530
 beat some kind of painting for example 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.020
 reptiles lay out trips or rhinestones but 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.950
 here is an example of a normal cat's eye 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.740
 who knows we all put a magnet 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.960
 in the middle and it appears that 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.710
 Looks much more interesting when 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.710
 black backing 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.110
 and you can play instead of black 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.860
 substrate for example use blue or 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.070
 red or white button on your 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.070
 discretion 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.370
 Unfortunately my camera is not very transmit 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.650
 color but it looks very cool when 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.820
 and a green glazochki poseredinke and 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.820
 blue pearl on the sides 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.390
 and one more option how to play with 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.910
 the cat's eye is actually here 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.450
 lots of options for how to play with 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.450
 a cat 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.880
 again, I repeat all this is possible 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.210
 I add some other design 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.530
 murals and decorations 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.870
 whatever you want 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.700
 and thanks for watching subscribe 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.590
 to ask me questions in 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.830
 comments i'm happy for anything 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.830
 I will answer
