00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
will change the size to like 24 and

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.620 
will change the size to like 24 and
that's<00:04:18.440> good<00:04:18.829> i'm<00:04:19.430> editing<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.329> font

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
that's good i'm editing the font

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.340 
that's good i'm editing the font
changing<00:04:21.169> the<00:04:21.260> size<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.799> 24<00:04:22.310> it's<00:04:23.300> all<00:04:23.450> okay<00:04:23.780> so

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
changing the size to 24 it's all okay so

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.140 
changing the size to 24 it's all okay so
now<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.710> we<00:04:24.830> did<00:04:25.039> that<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.520> can<00:04:25.700> change<00:04:25.940> the

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
now that we did that we can change the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.379 
now that we did that we can change the
color<00:04:26.419> now<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:27.740> we<00:04:27.830> can<00:04:27.860> go<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.310> draw<00:04:28.550> the

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
color now so we can go to the draw the

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.300 
color now so we can go to the draw the
draw<00:04:29.690> event<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:31.669> draw<00:04:31.940> tab<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.740> select<00:04:33.740> set

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
draw event the draw tab and select set

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.830 
draw event the draw tab and select set
underscore<00:04:34.850> color<00:04:35.120> we're<00:04:35.479> going<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.690> place

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
underscore color we're going to place

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.310 
underscore color we're going to place
that<00:04:36.020> first<00:04:36.350> make<00:04:37.220> sure<00:04:37.250> its<00:04:37.520> first<00:04:38.320> now

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
that first make sure its first now

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.710 
that first make sure its first now
change<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.680> color<00:04:40.039> for<00:04:40.550> this<00:04:40.729> autocheck<00:04:41.419> it

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
change the color for this autocheck it

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.710 
change the color for this autocheck it
to<00:04:41.810> this<00:04:41.930> blue<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:42.500> like<00:04:43.070> this<00:04:43.190> blue<00:04:43.660> set<00:04:44.660> color

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
to this blue I like this blue set color

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.650 
to this blue I like this blue set color
the<00:04:47.290> code<00:04:47.560> equivalent<00:04:48.160> of<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:48.520> would<00:04:48.880> be<00:04:49.060> the

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
the code equivalent of this would be the

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.220 
the code equivalent of this would be the
same<00:04:49.930> as<00:04:50.290> drawn<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.340> course<00:04:51.550> six<00:04:51.990> but<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.110> would

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
same as drawn of course six but it would

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.780
