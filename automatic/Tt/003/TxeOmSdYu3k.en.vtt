00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.670 
off and basically throw it away so I'm
gonna<00:02:13.290> do<00:02:13.500> was<00:02:14.570> recycle<00:02:15.570> every<00:02:16.080> single<00:02:16.470> piece

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
gonna do was recycle every single piece

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.650 
gonna do was recycle every single piece
of<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.980> car<00:02:17.040> even<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.850> gasoline<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.510> was

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
of this car even the gasoline that was

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.410
