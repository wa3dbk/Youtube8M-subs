do the jab SAP and hold a wheelie so the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.029 
do the jab SAP and hold a wheelie so the

it off or bend the legs the front tire
comes<00:01:02.190> down<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.670> hit<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> skid<00:01:03.120> plate<00:01:03.300> so

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
comes down and hit the skid plate so

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
comes down and hit the skid plate so
this<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> hit<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.189> ledge<00:01:05.820> straight

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
this we have to hit the ledge straight

gripping the rock and pulling us to the
top<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> wheel<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.180> let's<00:01:12.960> try<00:01:15.290> not<00:01:16.290> bad<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
top on a wheel it let's try not bad the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.520 
top on a wheel it let's try not bad the
front<00:01:18.180> tire<00:01:18.360> wasn't<00:01:18.869> too<00:01:18.990> high<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.439> was

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
front tire wasn't too high it was

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.109 
front tire wasn't too high it was
skimming<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:19.979> surface<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.700> noticed<00:01:21.060> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
skimming the surface and I noticed this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.630 
skimming the surface and I noticed this
body<00:01:21.420> was<00:01:21.659> very<00:01:21.930> far<00:01:22.229> forward<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> think<00:01:23.400> if

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
body was very far forward so I think if

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.249 
body was very far forward so I think if
we<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.880> his<00:01:24.000> body<00:01:24.180> back<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.869> better<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
we get his body back you better do a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.410 
we get his body back you better do a
higher<00:01:25.470> wheelie

okay Tommy mistake first time is coming

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.399 
okay Tommy mistake first time is coming
in<00:01:35.940> too<00:01:36.150> fast<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.990> they're<00:01:37.200> afraid

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
in too fast because they're afraid

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
in too fast because they're afraid
they're<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.830> going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> make<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.850> faster

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
they're not going to make it the faster

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.420 
they're not going to make it the faster
you<00:01:39.330> come<00:01:39.510> in<00:01:39.720> less<00:01:40.560> chance<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.190> front

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you come in less chance of the front

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.160 
you come in less chance of the front
tire<00:01:41.640> staying<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> retired<00:01:43.080> hit

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
tire staying up it's a retired hit

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.840 
tire staying up it's a retired hit
sooner<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.800> harder<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.340> pulls<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> front

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
sooner and harder and pulls the front

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.320 
sooner and harder and pulls the front
tire<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.990> come<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.320> slower<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:48.060> bike

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
tire down if you come in slower the bike

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.840 
tire down if you come in slower the bike
will<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:48.900> up<00:01:49.259> straighter<00:01:49.830> straight<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
will go up straighter straight up to the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.109 
will go up straighter straight up to the
sky

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
sky

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880 
sky
and<00:01:51.450> better<00:01:51.720> chance<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.290> holding<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.710> Willie

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and better chance of holding the Willie

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.499 
and better chance of holding the Willie
so<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> told<00:01:53.520> him<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> slow<00:01:53.759> down<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.150> second

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
so I told him to slow down the second

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.170 
so I told him to slow down the second
time<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:54.900> did<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.170> much<00:01:55.320> better<00:01:56.180> we're

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
time and he did it much better we're

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.120 
time and he did it much better we're
going<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.720> same<00:01:58.020> ledge<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
going to do this same ledge with the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.730 
going to do this same ledge with the
front<00:01:59.340> tire<00:01:59.400> against<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> rock<00:02:00.440> he<00:02:01.440> made<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
front tire against the rock he made it

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.499 
front tire against the rock he made it
pretty<00:02:01.890> easy<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.340> I'm<00:02:02.430> confident<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.330> he

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
pretty easy and I'm confident that he

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.540 
pretty easy and I'm confident that he
can<00:02:03.720> do<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.899> from<00:02:04.110> dead<00:02:04.289> stop<00:02:04.470> I<00:02:04.950> want<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> use

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
can do it from dead stop I want to use

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.760 
can do it from dead stop I want to use
this<00:02:05.700> example<00:02:06.539> because<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.259> lot<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:07.590> times

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
this example because a lot of times

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.620 
this example because a lot of times
riders<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.429> need<00:02:08.610> five<00:02:08.850> foot<00:02:09.119> run<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
riders think they need five foot run and

height and front tire rebound thing down
that's<00:03:04.220> what<00:03:04.489> happens<00:03:05.060> when<00:03:05.599> he<00:03:05.720> moves<00:03:06.049> and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
that's what happens when he moves and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.229 
that's what happens when he moves and
hits<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.739> target<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:07.910> what<00:03:08.060> happens

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
hits the target and it's what happens

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.930 
hits the target and it's what happens
when<00:03:08.629> he<00:03:08.750> balances<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.440> this<00:03:09.560> position<00:03:10.099> so

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
when he balances in this position so

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.809 
when he balances in this position so
before<00:03:11.269> he<00:03:11.360> goes<00:03:11.739> you'll<00:03:12.739> see<00:03:12.950> him<00:03:13.129> squat<00:03:13.579> down

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.300 
before he goes you'll see him squat down
at<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.180> suspension<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:14.959> then<00:03:15.079> jump<00:03:15.500> up<00:03:15.680> with

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
at the suspension and then jump up with

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:25.150 
at the suspension and then jump up with
the<00:03:16.400> suspension<00:03:22.329> beautiful<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:24.739> that's<00:03:24.920> why

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
the suspension beautiful so that's why

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.890 
the suspension beautiful so that's why
you<00:03:25.220> do<00:03:25.430> jabs<00:03:25.730> app<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.180> hit<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.420> front<00:03:26.629> tire

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
you do jabs app and hit the front tire

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.310 
you do jabs app and hit the front tire
low<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.680> compress<00:03:28.099> this
