00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.020
 alright here we have the television of the 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:12.019
 Series 2015 of Sony and the series R 555 have 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.450
 size of 32 40 and 48 and once 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.900
 connected to the internet either with the cable 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.329
 lan or via wifi we will be able to have 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.430
 access to greater applications always and 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:25.509
 when we enter the operating store in 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.149
 this case then I am in the applications 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:32.239
 they are divided by categories we are 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:37.000
 I am now in the category of new 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.000
 where I can see quite a few applications 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.480
 to show them all I can search 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.220
 also the most popular 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.579
 what are these applications that appear 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.280
 here all if I want to give all of them 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.530
 only time but of course it is much better 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.449
 see them by 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.260
 stages here are the applications that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.550
 they are only for movies and televisions 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.730
 television series television 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.920
 there are different there are enough if we 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.229
 we move the cursor to the right we go 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.810
 to see all kinds of applications what 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.409
 good of these applications that are already 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.540
 pre-installed we do not need 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.390
 download them if I 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.650
 I have access to see any of these 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.909
 applications the only thing that I have to 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.030
 do is 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.119
 and press ok and either open them or 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.880
 add them to my applications so that they 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.520
 make me a folder of my favorites and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.490
 my favorites are going to be my applications 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.039
 that those exposed in the upper part in 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.700
 this case if I squeeze here I already leave 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.289
 all applications to which 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.990
 I have faster access because they are the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.920
 that are classified within the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.109
 favorites 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.950
 equally the television has no games 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.950
 they are games so 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.369
 as full of technology as the games 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.490
 of the android tv but they are games 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.409
 that in their free time they can 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.930
 play them and spend pleasant moments and 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.010
 in the same way we have a great 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.960
 amount of games available 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.690
 in this part of the television we have the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.390
 internet tv function where there are several 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.850
 channels that transmit their content to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.120
 through the network and this is not being 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.970
 updating 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.220
 every day exclusive applications for 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.220

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.680
 to the kids 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.670
 either 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.970
 games 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.530
 hits tv highly recommended 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.800
 If you have children, you can show them 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.620
 travel nature sports we had already 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.590
 time state news there for 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.580
 music then finally the TV 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.160
 has many applications, it is a smart 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.980
 tv but without a browser and 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.080
 the applications are somewhat hidden 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.570
 we 're not going to see them from premiums at first 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.730
 a single on the main screen but 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.170
 same way we can interact with the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.650
 TV and to be able to use it from a 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.230
 way more 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.440
 more the more connectivity the better 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.120
 so 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.700
 we're going to go to the main menu to 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.230
 finish what you see in the main menu 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.730
 the information part of the internet only 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.400
 they come 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.930
 and these applications that like them 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.049
 we mentioned is not a smart team and because 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.640
 you can only netflix youtube and tractor and 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.440
