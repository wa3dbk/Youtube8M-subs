00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.730
 give what you and us 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.720
 There in the Texas metropolis

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.570
 Ninth participation for the u14 for the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.079
 attendance maybe you will tell 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.500
 few words to davis cup that will be 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.890
 nine participated from below 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.229
 what is special about this tournament 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.090
 Although the biggest tournament is North America 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.649
 just want to forget the biggest one 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.460
 that you us during the tournaments 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.840
 But all of them are also following various media 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.100
 is North America's biggest tournament 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.140
 overall against man in tournaments 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.979
 seven age groups over 180 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.799
 Team part of our team in the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.369
 tournament falls so our 15 with 32 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.950
 men 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.859
 the 19 we play so called 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.140
 supergroup the one loaded in the 12 one 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.549
 substances from all over the world 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.439
 brazil denmark england etc 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.039
 The tournament takes place over a whole week 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.780
 instead of 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.390
 every game is over the full 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.649
 game time not as if you se 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.810
 the tournaments usual shortened more 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.130
 playing time and overall is natural 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.110
 a great experience apart from the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.260
 athletic that our players at 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.060
 guest families 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.739
 and stay there for a little over ten days 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.299
 in the so-called American way of life 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.010
 immerse yourself and boys of the same age 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.310
 who also play football 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.690
 In the end , the biggest one has been 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.280
 difference to the normal German 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.079
 international tournament in germany 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.209
 somehow the car China in Germany 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.790
 hardly subscribe with the own 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.500
 at least not those are then 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.060
 Mostly on a weekend 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.890
 the shorter play sessions with these 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.140
 tournaments and so we in Germany 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.790
 I think only if at all 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.000
 Small correct me a tournament in the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.389
 year out play say 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.250
 international determines that 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.519
 overall experience of one language others 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.470
 culture to russia if you certainly 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.239
 impressive for the games and the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.650
 There are also sportsmen in the sport 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.810
 group differences between 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.579
 teams or the international 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.200
 teams if other way 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.220
 play that is already on the ground 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.049
 we need to go there 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.269
 we play everything completely redevelopment 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.090
 play since they are at summerjam 15 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.470
 up to 1 and actually in our league 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.970
 at a very high level but again and again 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.579
 speaks against the same opponent 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.609
 munich 60 munich stuttgart freiburg 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.449
 as loud et cetera and you get 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.489
 just have a look over the 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.629
 the edge of the plate when you go against the 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.549
 Mexican team is playing against 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.290
 a Brazilian versus American 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.819
 team referees come out 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.980
 So you can do it all over the world 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.060
 be that against the mexican 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.370
 team plays with one 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.379
 umpire from New Zealand and the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.870
 then the player must also learn 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.099
 therefore to find one to adapt there 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.519
 to get along with it 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.519
 okay for you it is the first participation 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.260
 what do you expect from your trip? 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.870
 dennis or symbols for you 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.879
 personally as well as sport not good 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.760
 of course I would go that far 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:10.180
 the goal should come already that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.669
 Being semi- private for me it is 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.829
 now for the first time 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.019
 That's why I'm so happy about America 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.849
 me out and again I 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.449
 already said has great fun for guys 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.940
 Experience 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.240
 also helps with host families and 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.490
 just live on my completely different life 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.500
 perhaps 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.870
 to know the way of life in other names 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.750
 learn what makes it so then 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.550
 exciting and exciting for the guys 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.180
 he awaits rudolf becker teams in the 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.229
 19 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.599
 that we have the deep thalia creative 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.720
 then have the comments from brazil 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:51.660
 we have the fc fulham from england and the 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.880
 electrik you okay so from the names 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.340
 I would say strong already 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.669
 If you are a very strong group 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.979
 and i will be very good personally because 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.240
 We also communicate that way 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:11.909
 Of course we want to be with the 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:13.650
 best know well says come to you 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:26.460
 are indeed already have an old 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:29.280
 So at least all the last years 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.990
 do you have that except for one exception always 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.389
 sven once even acquires that 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.270
 won the tournament 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.800
 how do you see your chances offer yes 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.030
 that is relatively difficult because yes 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.430
 No team can go to me 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.590
 played so far we always have a lot 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.469
 but it is done every year 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.800
 completely new and in the sense I can not 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:48.780
 say 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.449
 the chance teams do not know 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.219
 from the past as I said there we 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.650
 always be in the semi final I assume 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:57.930
 the chances are that we continue 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:03.120
 as classified in these spheres 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:06.889
 so it's probably already 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.930
 Do that again as a young journalist 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.979
 very clearly 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.490
 but if you became curious now 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:16.800
 be and continue to pursue like 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.770
 our teams or like it 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.789
 will go for us in the Texas metropolis 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.310
 then just have a look at us 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:26.930
 homepage over we have a special one 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:30.060
 created page that reads 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.969
 www.eintracht.de frankfurt.de / tennis 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.370
 cup there you will find next to the diary 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:38.039
 also our links to our facebook 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.670
 page or to our live 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.530
 ticker via twitter 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:46.480
 and besides, we will be back here 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:49.600
 about google + report on 27th 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.010
 at 17 o'clock is curious who as 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.120
 conversation partner will be there 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.410
 then definitely make one live 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.220
 circuit to germany is so much 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.080
 already betrayed 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.080
 until then have a nice time
