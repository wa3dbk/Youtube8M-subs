00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
flags all of a sudden I see a flag and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.709 
flags all of a sudden I see a flag and
they<00:00:14.400> say<00:00:14.580> are<00:00:14.700> tied<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.150> clipped<00:00:15.389> him<00:00:15.540> and

they say are tied and clipped him and
how's<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.560> tough<00:00:16.740> start<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.310> then<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> next

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
how's it tough start so then the next

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.880

play<00:00:17.940> jessee<00:00:18.330> rolls<00:00:18.359> an<00:00:18.750> ankle<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.800> I'm

play jessee rolls an ankle and I'm

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.519 
play jessee rolls an ankle and I'm
thinking<00:00:20.160> maybe<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.640> ran<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.060> our<00:00:21.210> lives

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
thinking maybe we ran out of our lives

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.640 
thinking maybe we ran out of our lives
we<00:00:22.529> ran<00:00:22.740> through<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> few<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> last<00:00:23.490> four<00:00:23.820> weeks

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
we ran through a few the last four weeks

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.859 
we ran through a few the last four weeks
then<00:00:25.650> later<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> game<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:27.269> rips<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.720> up

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
then later in the game just rips one up

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.109 
then later in the game just rips one up
the<00:00:27.990> middle<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.289> get<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> holding<00:00:28.830> call<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the middle we get a holding call but you

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.550 
the middle we get a holding call but you
know<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.359> got<00:00:30.660> over<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.960> hump<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.289> thought<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
know we got over that hump I thought the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.229 
know we got over that hump I thought the
critical<00:00:31.980> turning<00:00:32.219> point<00:00:32.340> really<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
critical turning point really was the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.290 
critical turning point really was the
roughing<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.260> kicker<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:35.280> then<00:00:35.489> Johnny<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
roughing the kicker and then Johnny you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.490 
roughing the kicker and then Johnny you
know<00:00:36.390> someone<00:00:36.930> mentioned<00:00:37.200> he<00:00:37.260> didn't<00:00:37.410> have

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
know someone mentioned he didn't have

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.600 
know someone mentioned he didn't have
his<00:00:37.590> best<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> want<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.219> tell<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> this

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
his best and I want to tell you this

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.340 
his best and I want to tell you this
they<00:00:38.910> had<00:00:39.030> receivers<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.690> were<00:00:39.780> jammed<00:00:40.110> so

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
they had receivers that were jammed so

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.479 
they had receivers that were jammed so

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
sometimes you had no one to throw to

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.850 
sometimes you had no one to throw to
they<00:00:42.120> did<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> great<00:00:42.510> job<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.170> ends<00:00:43.649> and

took away something and you got to give
them<00:00:45.960> credit<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.500> sure<00:00:46.980> wouldn't<00:00:47.219> blame<00:00:47.399> Johnny

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

I thought he threw some nice balls that

may<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.120> been<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> most<00:01:00.629> exciting

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
may have been one of the most exciting

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.049 
may have been one of the most exciting
runs<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> year<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:02.370> pure<00:01:02.760> brilliance

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
runs of the year just pure brilliance

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.630 
runs of the year just pure brilliance
and<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.080> unfortunate<00:01:04.439> something<00:01:05.400> about<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and it was unfortunate something about a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.670 
and it was unfortunate something about a
kick<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.600> then<00:01:07.020> we're<00:01:07.500> down<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
kick down there and then we're down to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
kick down there and then we're down to
one<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.280> had<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> couple<00:01:08.729> bad<00:01:08.970> place

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
one and we had a couple bad place

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
one and we had a couple bad place
fortunately<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.500> third<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.130> got<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
fortunately that third one we got to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
fortunately that third one we got to
wait<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> flats<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.840> got<00:01:12.930> him<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
wait out in the flats and got him a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.770 
wait out in the flats and got him a
freebie<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:14.000> even<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.210> fumbled<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
freebie but even when we fumbled at the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
freebie but even when we fumbled at the
end<00:01:15.900> i<00:01:16.020> thought<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.619> difference<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.430> had<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
end i thought the difference we had a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.090 
end i thought the difference we had a
little<00:01:17.670> more<00:01:17.790> energy<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.830> when<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.920> can't

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
little more energy and when you can't

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.560 
little more energy and when you can't
throw<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> football<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:21.240> were<00:01:21.299> kind<00:01:21.479> of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
throw the football they were kind of

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
throw the football they were kind of
restricted<00:01:22.080> yeah<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.159> kept

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
restricted yeah and so we just kept

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
restricted yeah and so we just kept
pounding<00:01:23.729> even<00:01:24.240> though<00:01:24.330> take<00:01:24.780> nothing<00:01:25.080> away

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
pounding even though take nothing away

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.190 
pounding even though take nothing away
from<00:01:25.229> 29<00:01:26.060> they<00:01:27.060> were<00:01:27.119> big<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.479> us<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:27.810> pounding

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
from 29 they were big on us or pounding

your<00:01:47.490> way<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:48.030> how<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> saw<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.290> John

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
your way what how I saw that was John

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
your way what how I saw that was John
was<00:01:51.600> getting<00:01:51.930> pressure<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.830> for<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
was getting pressure really for the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.280 
was getting pressure really for the
first<00:01:53.160> time<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.880> year<00:01:53.940> he<00:01:54.660> was<00:01:54.810> trying<00:01:55.230> to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
first time this year he was trying to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
first time this year he was trying to
roll<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.770> throw<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> little<00:01:56.310> different<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.940> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
roll out throw a little different and I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.970 
roll out throw a little different and I
think<00:01:57.660> he<00:01:58.080> was<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.380> trying<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.740> throw<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
think he was just trying to throw the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.860 
think he was just trying to throw the
ball<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.430> far<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.820> he<00:01:59.940> could<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.570> mearns

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
ball as far as he could and have mearns

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.600 
ball as far as he could and have mearns
he<00:02:01.050> run<00:02:01.260> under<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:02.130> worked<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.460> couple

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
he run under it and it worked a couple

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.310 
he run under it and it worked a couple
times<00:02:02.940> I<00:02:03.030> think<00:02:03.240> mearns<00:02:03.450> II<00:02:03.600> carried<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.110> guys

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
times I think mearns II carried you guys

times I think mearns II carried you guys

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
was the block it goes to any runs but I

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.620 
was the block it goes to any runs but I
was<00:03:11.459> hoping<00:03:11.670> one<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:11.880> our<00:03:12.060> guys<00:03:12.300> would<00:03:12.540> have

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
was hoping one of our guys would have

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.410 
was hoping one of our guys would have
kicked<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.959> down<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.260> field<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:14.310> uh<00:03:14.520> they

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
kicked it down the field but uh they

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.030 
kicked it down the field but uh they
don't<00:03:15.600> know<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.780> that's<00:03:16.290> what<00:03:16.560> you're<00:03:16.920> able

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
don't know that that's what you're able

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.160 
don't know that that's what you're able
to<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:17.400> but<00:03:17.790> still<00:03:18.090> they<00:03:18.570> didn't<00:03:18.780> have<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> field

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
to do but still they didn't have a field

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.690 
to do but still they didn't have a field
goal<00:03:19.320> kicker<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.070> hurts

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
goal kicker and that hurts

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.520 
goal kicker and that hurts
yeah<00:03:20.849> even<00:03:21.480> at<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> end<00:03:21.870> I'm<00:03:22.050> thinking<00:03:22.349> we're

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
yeah even at the end I'm thinking we're

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.990 
yeah even at the end I'm thinking we're
only<00:03:22.650> up<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:23.040> they<00:03:23.220> kick<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.400> field<00:03:23.610> goal<00:03:23.760> they

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
only up to they kick a field goal they

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.729 
only up to they kick a field goal they
beat<00:03:24.150> us<00:03:24.180> but<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:25.019> didn't<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.319> that<00:03:25.470> threat

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
beat us but they didn't have that threat

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.949 
beat us but they didn't have that threat
I<00:03:25.980> think<00:03:26.430> they<00:03:26.550> had<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.849> go<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.180> six<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.780> was

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
I think they had to go for six that was

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.690 
I think they had to go for six that was
their<00:03:28.140> only<00:03:28.290> their<00:03:28.769> only<00:03:29.010> hope<00:03:29.190> down<00:03:29.430> late

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
their only their only hope down late

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.580 
their only their only hope down late
