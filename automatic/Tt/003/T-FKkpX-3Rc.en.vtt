 last corner and now also the faith 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.879
 Maria sebastian kehl behind it would be 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.920
 michael Bergmann berg dropped it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.849
 brought 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.950
 he has hired the whip trained 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:25.030
 and does not believe him in the bit 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.030
 that the race was slow 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.980
 now he no longer has the whip 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.640
 shouldered he pays them in 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.640
 the work 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.680

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.300
 Yes 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:18.220
 because a man like arjan's shield 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:26.430
 stream times to emotions mature and capable 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:28.660
 they are due the iceman now 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.470
 he probably will not forgive 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:37.920
 a look for his relationships 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:42.640
 euphoric into the life of the lashes 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.700
 and the note that points to 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.130
 horse that is undoubtedly the best thing the 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.200
 man has ever driven and he has many 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.660
 but I drove many great horses 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.230
 believe that came to expression after the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.870
 motto look at this horse 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:03.010
