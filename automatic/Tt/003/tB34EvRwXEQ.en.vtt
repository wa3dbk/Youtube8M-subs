one<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> artists<00:00:28.439> things<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:28.920> of

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
one of the artists things right out of

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.470 
one of the artists things right out of
the<00:00:29.160> gate<00:00:29.400> was<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.910> need<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> calibrate

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the gate was that you need to calibrate

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.080 
the gate was that you need to calibrate
the<00:00:30.779> TV<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> gamepad<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> way<00:00:32.910> they

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the TV with the gamepad but the way they

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.330 
the TV with the gamepad but the way they
do<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.420> makes<00:00:33.719> no<00:00:33.960> sense<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.190> turn

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
do this makes no sense you have to turn

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.580 
do this makes no sense you have to turn
the<00:00:35.520> gamepad<00:00:36.030> screen<00:00:36.210> towards<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> TV<00:00:37.380> and
