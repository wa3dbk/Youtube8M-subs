00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:03.700
 yea 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.640
 cent 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.819
 this need to make 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:11.619
 but I talk about something I love 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:16.789
 life incarnation if you do not think if you're afraid the time is now for you 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.650
 to change 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.380
 his concept of criminal action 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.079
 and the project 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.329
 it's amazing 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.490
 and I think she's a strong ally in makeup 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.340
 until a day to day for you who does not like theater theater dance with 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.739
 washed face 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.380
 you may find it going to ruin everyday in every ordinary stock 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.220
 I'm sure it will look beautiful 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.970
 so this same 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.609
 I started talking about 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.760
 everton has a lawn and I really like it I've used it several times 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.490
 information in the netto schools 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.840
 and this one I bought a little bit 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.350
 it is necessary that the other 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.870
 but he comes with this talk he had so far spare and she does all the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.950
 difference 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.710
 the durability of these works is very good 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.430
 for those who are at the base of the race do not go that way you will flourish 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.380
 around here 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.440
 then she runs the risk of being cut civilians so it has to take a lot 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.050
 care and as a reserve motto this is no problem you exchange is still 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.690
 long time 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.690
 and now a little secret behind 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.830
 are you 6- to be happy ' 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.830
 position here 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.710
 because well close to the root of the eyelashes 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 I usually give the engine kept getting in the way of lifting 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.950
 and they close very slowly 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.610
 I presented here nothing happened, we took advantage of it 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.189
 I'm going to squeeze and nike runs a little bit up so 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.790
 according to alessandro anos 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.050
 to implant 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.140
 with the difference 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.110
 knowing that not even listening to all 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.030
 so do now on the other side 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.570
 I'm going to position 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.509
 well give it up 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.059
 it's the grip 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:12.560
 and did this to play 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.029
 manama - stay in wait 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.169
 present in the composition 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.889
 strength in those cheats 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.989
 with that it is meant firmino son raises a little bit 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.989
 I wait seconds 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.809
 the mission 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:34.349
 the difference 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.349
 I will now give another one that 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.299
 remembering course before passing the miner he 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.389
 There are people who can even say after 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.339
 but it suggests just passing through another ie if it were a 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:51.889
 light synonyms 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.739
 starace catar 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.349
 there do it 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.769
 and then 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.769
 You run race 3 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.869
 Look makes all the difference how far forward with the bbc 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.059
 in shooting with a little pepper 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:18.089
 this elimination of reagents now I will go through the marking and leaving family 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:23.719
 My life at sea in the name of your team The master's degree lasts six months 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.899
 So you and your current team 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:28.629
 This change is very good. 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.109
 very good person and good 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.039
 and so it also has to give this type of tasteless preference 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.199
 It's perfectly separate from me because you want the questions 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.729
 I think the first 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.619
 if it's for good 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.109
 heverton however once again such a standard 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.109
 in the past 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.599
 he also defines well and did not speak, nor does it always remain that thing 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.739
 exaggerate the dose study of the dancer 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.969
 and that other 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.669
 tintin this is a reason 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.400
 That's why I say this difference is going to believe me I do not know until 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.270
 snow comes out slowly 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.789
 and they are Jose that you have to like is not more unpredictable there 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.009
 and you know 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.229
 and bet on a next one with other disaster tips
