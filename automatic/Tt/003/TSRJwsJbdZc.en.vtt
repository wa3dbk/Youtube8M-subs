00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.970
 again, it's much better when I 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.920

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.540

 everything will create and here more 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.170
 impressive it is possible to close all 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.880
 the borders and I'm going to leave people 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.640
 swimming in the sea yes and I'm going to hire 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.110
 sharks with regular to the head to 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.110
 that they eat people 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.849
 how difficult it is to be I am going to make the 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.500
 I breathe the national for example 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.790
 we introduce into the programming to give 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.019
 start to the national chain of 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.489
 President of the Argentine Republic 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.079
 for people like they are Argentines for 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.489
 Argentines are often leaving 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.409
 that the valley is wrong here there are problems 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.110
 serious for example I have few left 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.450
 cereal look does not even fill the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.489
 reason stresses you and if not, I can not 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.919
 everything I do not know if with five married plan 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.209
 tell me 4 and 16 private can propose 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.209
 It is very difficult 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.080
 with that he does not ask why they put 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.640
 always his narrowed photons do not 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.590
 I understand since that egg would count 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.330
 Julián Serrano to catch it and what 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.230
 They throw julian wax is not a dadnatas 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.630
 lustra vehicle if Julian Serrano says 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.640
 something is because that something is true or 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.380
 is right if Julian Serrano says 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.630
 that the earth is flat the earth is 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.520
 flat two points points points 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.210
 medians and realists have already made their 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.070
 poster I also want to be president 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.780
 that they want that that does not have I have of 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.550
 the hips as I said his sister 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.900
 like me who makes himself hate more than me 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.360
 so I have the three requirements 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.180
 needed to be president or I'm not 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:08.970
 proud two I say boludeces 3 do what 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:14.460
 What do you do? There are people who are going to vote 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:16.600
 we have is not serious 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.490
 with this answer I just finished 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.930
 of losing mission to humanity can not 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.820
 to be that returned is the only one that has more 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.590
 of 5 neurons can not be we want a 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.470
 healthy country a country with good 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.740
 that's why we need that all together not 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.270
 let's do a mandatory karate class 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.220
 to school to stop injustice 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.720
 we'll get batman in batman wins 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.430
 two blocks to select the 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.400
 inflation to command but above all 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.170
 never will we never fight in any way 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.820
 corruption we consider corruption 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.680
 as the most sacred heritage of the 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.780
 argentina corruption is tradition is 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.860
 culture is history 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.940
 Votame votate 9 versus the 999 party 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.400
 failure and unnecessary violence 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.210
 because loading people is not necessary 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.210
 but it's not suck an egg 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.410
 A) Yes 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.620
 we have a healthy country 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.530
