 That's it, I'm here again to give 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:13.370
 one more tip here the defect is that 40 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:21.530
 hps what 40 is here 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:24.050
 binds the jack to jack on source and we in 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.529
 of the light bulb does not have the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:33.379
 all voltages some tensions reaches 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:39.640
 fall but you come here he does not care 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.640
 there were not many people going to bios 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:51.649
 50% may be the most bios in g1 in g 42 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.479
 This one here I know that 40 still has a lot 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.239
 personnel are changing to upgrade ships and 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.359
 the time it takes is not working 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.129
 same way this is the license plate 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.129
 flag to see four 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.390

 to teach that a simple personal cd passes 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.009
 then it breaks a lot of head fast I fix it 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.280
 quick does not light up taking the measurements I 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.549
 I saw it's a short you put the door 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.759
 so it was for you here of the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.780
 blood wave thieves 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.880
 I found this enabled in short I 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.600
 had several other doors here with the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.220
 same problem and all and got trained in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.630
 course the easy procedure almost easy 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.429
 easy to do 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:04.970
 I'll do it right there, pretty soon. 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:04.970
 you see ready 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.270
 I took the capacitor you can see 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:28.930
 I'll go there and start the place. 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.930
