try to get down here so there's so one

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.530 
try to get down here so there's so one
on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> right<00:01:37.590> side<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.430> already<00:01:38.610> did<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
on the right side which already did and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.639 
on the right side which already did and
the<00:01:40.409> other<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:42.470> see<00:01:43.470> this

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the other one is right here you see this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.830 
the other one is right here you see this
piece<00:01:43.860> right<00:01:43.979> here<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.740> right<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
piece right here just one right here and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.050 
piece right here just one right here and
there's<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.110> right<00:01:49.380> here

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
there's one right here

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.190 
there's one right here
so<00:01:51.060> they're<00:01:51.329> both<00:01:51.540> seventeen<00:01:52.020> millimeter<00:01:54.200> so

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
so they're both seventeen millimeter so

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.749 
so they're both seventeen millimeter so
that's<00:01:55.409> why<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> motorcycle<00:01:56.250> jag<00:01:56.490> want<00:01:56.700> to

jack it up later and put a rush in there

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.850 
jack it up later and put a rush in there
17<00:02:00.689> millimeter<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:02.009> pop<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:03.590> one<00:02:04.590> side

drain plug on this thing but yep you
need<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.489> take<00:02:47.610> all<00:02:47.730> three<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.150> them<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.590> then

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
need to take all three of them and then

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.180

half<00:02:54.780> let<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.290> idle<00:02:55.440> for<00:02:55.799> like<00:02:55.890> about<00:02:55.980> 20

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
half let it idle for like about 20

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.390 
half let it idle for like about 20
seconds<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.880> then<00:02:57.690> pour<00:02:58.349> another<00:02:58.560> two<00:02:59.130> quarts

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
seconds and then pour another two quarts

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.890 
seconds and then pour another two quarts
in<00:02:59.519> there<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.880> my<00:03:00.090> bucket<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.510> take<00:03:00.720> about

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
in there so my bucket you take about

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.930 
in there so my bucket you take about
five<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.069> half<00:03:02.130> quarts<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.750> then<00:03:04.940> that's

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
five and a half quarts and then that's

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.039 
five and a half quarts and then that's
pretty<00:03:06.120> much<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:06.480> how<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.690> change<00:03:06.810> your<00:03:06.930> oil

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
pretty much it on how to change your oil

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.710 
pretty much it on how to change your oil
it's<00:03:07.260> pretty<00:03:07.410> easy<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:07.920> got<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.690> got<00:03:09.690> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
it's pretty easy just got a got a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.210 
it's pretty easy just got a got a
custom-made<00:03:10.110> little<00:03:10.470> ramp<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.890> it

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
custom-made little ramp for it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.100 
custom-made little ramp for it
a<00:03:11.250> motorcycle<00:03:12.180> jack<00:03:12.360> would<00:03:12.510> be<00:03:12.599> helpful<00:03:12.959> if

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
a motorcycle jack would be helpful if

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.490 
a motorcycle jack would be helpful if
not<00:03:13.370> what<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.400> did<00:03:14.610> right<00:03:14.819> here<00:03:15.109> and<00:03:16.109> then

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
not what I did right here and then

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.400 
not what I did right here and then
that's<00:03:16.829> it<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.780> just<00:03:18.780> be<00:03:18.870> careful<00:03:19.049> when<00:03:19.290> you're

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
that's it so just be careful when you're

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.990 
that's it so just be careful when you're
riding<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:20.040> know<00:03:20.130> put<00:03:20.340> like<00:03:20.489> support<00:03:20.880> on

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
riding that you know put like support on

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.210 
riding that you know put like support on
it<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.420> way<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.570> doesn't<00:03:21.720> tip<00:03:21.930> over<00:03:22.290> but

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
it so that way it doesn't tip over but

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.140 
it so that way it doesn't tip over but
yes<00:03:23.579> how<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.730> do<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.390> on<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.850> do<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.060> any

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
yes how I do it so on you can do it any

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.180 
yes how I do it so on you can do it any
way<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.390> want<00:03:27.690> but<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.019> safest<00:03:28.350> way<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.560> put<00:03:29.160> a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
way you want but the safest way is put a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.650 
way you want but the safest way is put a
motorcycle<00:03:29.640> jack<00:03:29.819> in<00:03:29.970> there<00:03:30.650> alright
