we're<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.899> do<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> very<00:00:04.290> simplistic<00:00:04.740> to

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
we're going to do a very simplistic to

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.260 
we're going to do a very simplistic to
keep<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.339> natural<00:00:05.520> flavor<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.120> fish

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
keep the natural flavor of the fish

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.450 
keep the natural flavor of the fish
intact<00:00:06.779> we'll<00:00:07.080> have<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.319> skin<00:00:07.620> on<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.010> we'll

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
intact we'll have the skin on and we'll

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.100 
intact we'll have the skin on and we'll
grill<00:00:08.639> away<00:00:08.849> right<00:00:09.660> now<00:00:09.690> I'm<00:00:09.840> just<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.050> to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
grill away right now I'm just going to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.709 
grill away right now I'm just going to
oil<00:00:10.740> up<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.070> grill<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.580> doesn't<00:00:11.849> stick<00:00:12.120> and

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
oil up the grill so it doesn't stick and

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.209 
oil up the grill so it doesn't stick and
put<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> flame<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.620> don't<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> put<00:00:14.130> as

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
put a flame that I don't have to put as

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.910 
put a flame that I don't have to put as
much<00:00:14.429> oil<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.360> fish<00:00:15.570> itself<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.800> also

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
much oil on the fish itself and it also

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.680 
much oil on the fish itself and it also
keeps<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.430> fish<00:00:17.609> from<00:00:17.820> burning<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.630> a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
keeps the fish from burning so it's a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.939 
keeps the fish from burning so it's a
nice<00:00:18.810> beautiful<00:00:19.140> fresh<00:00:19.470> sockeye<00:00:19.920> salmon

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
nice beautiful fresh sockeye salmon

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.560 
nice beautiful fresh sockeye salmon
we're<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.699> keep<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.910> very<00:00:21.029> simple<00:00:21.480> we're

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
we're going to keep it very simple we're

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.939 
we're going to keep it very simple we're
going<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.750> season<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> little<00:00:22.710> kosher

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
going to season it with a little kosher

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.250 
going to season it with a little kosher
salt<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.670> black<00:00:24.150> cracked<00:00:24.510> pepper<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> that's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
salt and black cracked pepper and that's

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:35.800 
salt and black cracked pepper and that's
it

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.960 

so<00:00:36.380> skin<00:00:36.620> side<00:00:36.830> up<00:00:36.980> depends<00:00:37.580> on<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.760> thickness

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
so skin side up depends on the thickness

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.250 
so skin side up depends on the thickness
of<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.270> fish<00:00:38.510> for<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.780> amount<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:39.050> time

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
of the fish for the amount of time

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.010 
of the fish for the amount of time
usually<00:00:39.890> it's<00:00:40.460> about<00:00:40.670> four<00:00:41.060> minutes<00:00:41.270> per<00:00:41.750> inch

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
usually it's about four minutes per inch

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.350 
usually it's about four minutes per inch
on<00:00:42.320> each<00:00:42.920> side<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.550> we're<00:00:43.910> going<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.090> move<00:00:44.239> it

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
on each side and we're going to move it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.320 
on each side and we're going to move it
one<00:00:44.600> time<00:00:44.900> to<00:00:45.230> get<00:00:45.590> those<00:00:45.710> nice<00:00:45.950> beautiful

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
one time to get those nice beautiful

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.049 
one time to get those nice beautiful
directional<00:00:47.330> grill<00:00:47.750> marks<00:00:48.610> what's<00:00:49.610> nice<00:00:49.850> is

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
directional grill marks what's nice is

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.520 
directional grill marks what's nice is
you'll<00:00:50.210> know<00:00:50.330> the<00:00:50.480> salmon<00:00:50.840> is<00:00:50.900> ready<00:00:51.080> to<00:00:51.290> move

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
you'll know the salmon is ready to move

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.280 
you'll know the salmon is ready to move
when<00:00:52.000> it<00:00:53.000> comes<00:00:53.330> up<00:00:53.480> easy<00:00:53.690> if<00:00:53.900> you<00:00:53.989> have<00:00:54.020> to

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
when it comes up easy if you have to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.869 
when it comes up easy if you have to
like<00:00:54.410> scrape<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.160> get<00:00:55.280> in<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:55.489> either<00:00:55.640> your

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
like scrape and get in it either your

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.640 
like scrape and get in it either your
grills<00:00:56.120> not<00:00:56.270> seasoned<00:00:56.750> enough<00:00:56.960> or<00:00:57.199> the

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
grills not seasoned enough or the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.799 
grills not seasoned enough or the
Salmons<00:00:58.010> not<00:00:58.160> cooked<00:00:58.460> enough<00:00:58.580> so<00:00:59.420> what

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
Salmons not cooked enough so what

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.360 
Salmons not cooked enough so what
happens<00:01:00.230> when<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.470> grill<00:01:00.680> is<00:01:00.769> hot<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.309> the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
happens when the grill is hot and the

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.040 
happens when the grill is hot and the
right<00:01:01.519> temperature<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:02.300> allows<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.870> fish

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
right temperature that allows the fish

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.770 
right temperature that allows the fish
to<00:01:03.080> go<00:01:03.379> on<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.160> see<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.670> instantly<00:01:05.239> so

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
to go on to it and see you instantly so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.240 
to go on to it and see you instantly so
that<00:01:05.930> they<00:01:06.020> don't<00:01:06.140> stick<00:01:06.590> when<00:01:06.830> it's<00:01:06.979> too<00:01:07.220> cold

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
that they don't stick when it's too cold

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.190 
that they don't stick when it's too cold
and<00:01:07.940> your<00:01:08.030> fish<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.390> sticking<00:01:08.810> that's

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
and your fish is sticking that's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.780 
and your fish is sticking that's
definitely<00:01:09.440> because<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.040> grill<00:01:10.250> is<00:01:10.399> not<00:01:10.580> hot

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
definitely because the grill is not hot

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.730 
definitely because the grill is not hot
enough<00:01:10.960> it's<00:01:11.960> going<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.170> be<00:01:12.229> about<00:01:12.350> four

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
enough it's going to be about four

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.139 
enough it's going to be about four
minutes<00:01:12.950> on<00:01:13.190> each<00:01:13.250> side<00:01:15.790> so<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.880> get<00:01:17.030> those

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
minutes on each side so to get those

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.400 
minutes on each side so to get those
nice<00:01:17.360> hash<00:01:17.570> marks<00:01:17.840> I'm<00:01:17.930> going<00:01:18.050> to<00:01:18.110> turn<00:01:18.229> at<00:01:18.350> the

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
nice hash marks I'm going to turn at the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.460 
nice hash marks I'm going to turn at the
opposite<00:01:18.860> direction<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:21.110> I'm<00:01:21.200> gonna<00:01:21.320> do<00:01:21.380> the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
opposite direction and I'm gonna do the

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.070 
opposite direction and I'm gonna do the
same<00:01:21.500> with<00:01:21.680> this<00:01:21.950> fish<00:01:25.030> so<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.479> put<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.750> salmon

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
same with this fish so we put the salmon

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.130 
same with this fish so we put the salmon
down<00:01:27.170> skin<00:01:27.619> side<00:01:27.860> up<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.970> allow<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.270> salmon<00:01:30.020> to

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
down skin side up to allow the salmon to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.620 
down skin side up to allow the salmon to
cook<00:01:30.410> upward<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.340> allow<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.759> skin<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.210> ads-b

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
cook upward and allow the skin to ads-b

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.450 
cook upward and allow the skin to ads-b
be<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.869> vapor<00:01:33.200> barrier<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.680> keep<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:33.979> moisture

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
be a vapor barrier to keep the moisture

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.520 
be a vapor barrier to keep the moisture
in<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.090> when<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:35.330> flip<00:01:35.630> that<00:01:35.810> over<00:01:36.200> then<00:01:36.410> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
in so when we flip that over then the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.020 
in so when we flip that over then the
skin<00:01:36.770> will<00:01:36.920> do<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.130> opposite<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.640> latch<00:01:37.820> like

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
skin will do the opposite to latch like

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.270 
skin will do the opposite to latch like
a<00:01:38.210> saute<00:01:38.869> pan<00:01:38.899> almost<00:01:39.320> keeping<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.830> hot<00:01:39.979> and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
a saute pan almost keeping it hot and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.890 
a saute pan almost keeping it hot and
actually<00:01:40.790> releasing<00:01:41.270> some<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.540> moisture

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
actually releasing some of that moisture

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.350 
actually releasing some of that moisture
back<00:01:42.049> into<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.409> top<00:01:42.560> part<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.119> you've<00:01:44.119> got<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
back into the top part so you've got the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.730 
back into the top part so you've got the
nice<00:01:44.479> color<00:01:44.780> differences<00:01:45.260> so<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.470> can<00:01:45.590> see

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
nice color differences so you can see

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.160 
nice color differences so you can see
it's<00:01:46.250> got<00:01:46.400> a<00:01:46.430> nice<00:01:46.610> golden<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:47.299> it<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.900> white

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
it's got a nice golden to it that white

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.960 
it's got a nice golden to it that white
there<00:01:48.409> is<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.530> little<00:01:48.740> bit<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.340> fat<00:01:49.760> the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
there is a little bit of the fat the

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.030 
there is a little bit of the fat the
richness<00:01:50.180> kind<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:50.930> coming<00:01:51.320> out<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.860> meat

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
richness kind of coming out of the meat

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.200 
richness kind of coming out of the meat
so<00:01:52.250> we're<00:01:52.340> going<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.520> flip<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:52.970> skin

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
so we're going to flip it to the skin

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.880 
so we're going to flip it to the skin
side<00:01:53.450> where<00:01:53.750> we'll<00:01:53.869> finish<00:01:53.990> our<00:01:54.200> cookie

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.860 

so<00:01:59.400> we've<00:01:59.550> actually<00:01:59.700> moved<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.240> salmon<00:02:00.600> three

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
so we've actually moved the salmon three

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.840 
so we've actually moved the salmon three
times<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> nice<00:02:02.190> delicate<00:02:02.430> fish

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
times because it's a nice delicate fish

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.790 
times because it's a nice delicate fish
this<00:02:03.030> helps<00:02:03.270> keep<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.510> intact<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:04.200> nice<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
this helps keep it intact and nice and

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.360 
this helps keep it intact and nice and
moist

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
moist

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.280 
moist
so<00:02:06.330> even<00:02:06.540> though<00:02:06.660> we've<00:02:06.810> cooked<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
so even though we've cooked it with the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.560 
so even though we've cooked it with the
skin<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.980> skin<00:02:08.430> is<00:02:08.550> unedible<00:02:09.000> today<00:02:09.360> due

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
skin on the skin is unedible today due

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.609 
skin on the skin is unedible today due
to<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.750> fact<00:02:09.960> that<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.140> didn't<00:02:10.350> remove<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to the fact that we didn't remove the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.560 
to the fact that we didn't remove the
scales<00:02:11.040> if<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.550> wanted<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.850> eat<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.210> skin<00:02:12.450> like

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
scales if we wanted to eat the skin like

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.510 
scales if we wanted to eat the skin like
a<00:02:12.630> crispy<00:02:13.080> salmon<00:02:13.290> skin<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:14.190> would<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.430> to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
a crispy salmon skin we would have to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.190 
a crispy salmon skin we would have to
remove<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.880> scales<00:02:15.150> first<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:15.840> since<00:02:16.050> we're

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
remove the scales first but since we're

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.810 
remove the scales first but since we're
just<00:02:16.380> field<00:02:16.560> dressing<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.250> going

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
just field dressing it and going

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.670 
just field dressing it and going
authentic<00:02:18.390> rustic<00:02:18.600> we<00:02:18.960> left<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.260> skin<00:02:19.470> and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
authentic rustic we left the skin and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.230 
authentic rustic we left the skin and
scales<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.370> eat<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:20.850> off<00:02:21.030> there

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
scales on and eat it right off there

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.120 
scales on and eat it right off there
we'll<00:02:21.900> notice<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.350> when<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.530> cut<00:02:22.800> into<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
we'll notice that when we cut into the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.220 
we'll notice that when we cut into the
fish<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:24.390> would<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.660> portion<00:02:25.050> for<00:02:25.200> a
