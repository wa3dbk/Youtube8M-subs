00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.150
 let's set up the jimbal for 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.360
 our drone the first thing we have to 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.400
 to do is to make us a support 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.570
 so that the camera does not operate on you 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.570
 ground then 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:21.010
 once placed the supports we will 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:25.710
 place the pro in the support of the 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.710
 gym back now we plug in the station 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.190
 and we will put the battery 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.940
 to the phantom 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:44.890
 and we go advanced ying badly and we put what 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.930
 we connect the jean marc 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.170
 we remove the battery 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.170
 do not 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 and return to a stream 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.170
 when we reconnect we can 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.400
 note that the game is already activated 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.890
 art 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.890
 Now what we have to choose appears 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.190
 and calibrate 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.190
 the potentiometer behind the station 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 you can see how it moves once 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.110
 calibrated squeeze in phoenix once 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.540
 calibrated has marked us two positions 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.420
 negative and positive and here we have the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.720
 midpoint 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.189
 now let's connect the drone the cable 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.869
 Positive feeding with positive 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.350
 well we already have the cables connected 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.690
 the one of feeding and this the one that regulates 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.390
 the camera 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.420
 let's connect again drone 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.570
 and see what happens what problem we have of 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.310
 here 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.310
 that when the drone goes forward 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.630
 the jimbal 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.440
 maintains the position then we are not going 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.050
 to leave the propellers 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.380
 to remedy it in this small 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.260
 here behind we can mark up 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.480
 where we want the camera to go up and a 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.240
 marked up here then here you 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.540
 I put a plastic and no longer passes that 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.540
 position 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.670
 this is the position that I have made for 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.850
 the jimbal here we have the position 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.850
 maximum the center and the minimum 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.650
 and then to the profits and here's the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.079
 speed 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.390
 with which the camera rotates if we want 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.030
 let's go faster because we change this 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.220
 range then once activated the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.049
 jimbal and changed the profits of the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.049
 motors remove the battery 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.900
 and we have it ready
