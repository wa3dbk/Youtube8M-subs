00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.759
 Hello dear gardeners today I 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.270
 I'll tell you about when digging garlic 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.430
 how to keep it arrow you 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.500
 garlic is garlic which 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.379
 grows besides leaves 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.260
 long arrow inflorescence on the ends 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.570
 usually gardeners remove the arrow in order 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.690
 to form a good large 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.269
 teeth in the morning not to 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.320
 miss time the exact time of cleaning 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.260
 garlic 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.489
 I recommend leaving two on the garden 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.949
 large garlic arrows and on these 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.199
 arrows buds watch out for 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.870
 the time when we have to remove the garlic 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.350
 time it comes as soon as it bursts 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.190
 wrap inflorescence here is this thing she 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.960
 bursts bursts and appears we see 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.330
 these little ones are small 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.940
 purple in this case in this class 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.550
 as soon as the wrapper burst 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.030
 it is already worth digging for garlic 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.750
 Asimov arrow Yusch and quenching garlic 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.149
 Smolensk region 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.200
 this time is somewhere in the middle 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:35.479
 maybe closer to the end of July here in this 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.819
 time garlic we have to dig one for two 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.979
 the arrows that we leave we will let 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.619
 then to increase our harvest 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.140
 garlic breeding these bulbs we 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.630
 we will plant in the fall and next year we 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.209
 1 teeth are formed which subsequently 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.360
 will give already in gas full 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:55.789
 fairly large rank after 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.369
 garlic we chose dug it needed 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.340
 dry for this we put it under 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.009
 canopy where he is 45 days juice in such 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.550
 under a canopy of dug garlic 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.670
 should dry 45 days as soon as 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.129
 garlic on demand we clean it for 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.099
 this shoot a little dirtiest 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:22.140
 upper integumentary scales are removed here 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:27.910
 You see how clean svetlenky sale 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.879
 I cut off the remaining degree if you 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.920
 You will braid in post this higher if 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.209
 you will just keep heads on 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.459
 two and a half three centimeters insert 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.849
 what to do with the roots here now 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.930
 I already have such dry we can 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.950
 cut a little Dagestani 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.720
 gardeners 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.390
 these are the remaining roots 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.430
 watered over a burner or candle flame 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.069
 so the garlic is kept longer 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.530
 when Naples is in such a condition 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.590
 dried garlic you will have stored 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.390
 all winter 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.549
 should remember that if you fall with 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.280
 harvesting garlic then the cloves will move away from 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.230
 arrows respond such garlic here 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.780
 it's not too faded into the case and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.730
 more will be worse it is stored badly 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.500
 stored so we will set aside for you 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.440
 planting in the fall 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.780
 peel the garlic for storage until such 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.480
 states that dents are not exposed 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.910
 worth it is necessary that two or three coating 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.340
 the scales were completely left therefore I 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.850
 I recommend just slightly remove 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.019
 earth dirty scales and in such 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.299
 able to store wish you good 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.389
 a large harvest of garlic so that you have it 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.690
 well preserved see our channel 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.930
 good luck to you 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.930
