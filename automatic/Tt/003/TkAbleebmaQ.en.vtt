00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
using Camtasia and I fiddled around with

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.950 
using Camtasia and I fiddled around with
the<00:00:16.890> audio<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.680> video<00:00:19.680> settings<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.699> if<00:00:21.570> it

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
get to a chain point drop down into the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.730 
get to a chain point drop down into the
pit<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:27.540> where<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.450 

okay<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:37.270> one's<00:01:37.539> hard<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.229> get<00:01:38.439> to<00:01:38.649> it's<00:01:38.950> in

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
okay this one's hard to get to it's in

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.929 
okay this one's hard to get to it's in
there's<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.479> bunch<00:01:40.719> of<00:01:40.840> barrels<00:01:41.079> up<00:01:41.439> here<00:01:41.710> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
there's a bunch of barrels up here and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.730 
there's a bunch of barrels up here and
what<00:01:42.939> you<00:01:43.060> do<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.570> either<00:01:43.990> shoot<00:01:44.470> them

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
what you do is you either shoot them

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.029 
what you do is you either shoot them
from<00:01:44.950> far<00:01:45.189> away<00:01:45.220> or<00:01:45.759> you<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.590> have<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.920> get

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
from far away or you but you have to get

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.270 
from far away or you but you have to get
up<00:01:48.189> here<00:01:48.429> so<00:01:48.640> I'd<00:01:48.820> suggest<00:01:49.060> just<00:01:49.509> doing<00:01:49.780> this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
up here so I'd suggest just doing this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.889 
up here so I'd suggest just doing this
drop<00:01:51.280> down<00:01:51.310> into<00:01:51.729> this<00:01:51.939> pit<00:01:54.149> well<00:01:55.149> run<00:01:55.360> up<00:01:55.630> this

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
drop down into this pit well run up this

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.039 
drop down into this pit well run up this
when<00:01:56.530> you're<00:01:56.679> on<00:01:56.829> that<00:01:57.100> wall<00:01:57.700> at<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.149> height

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
when you're on that wall at the height

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.990 
when you're on that wall at the height
of<00:01:59.079> it<00:01:59.560> before<00:01:59.950> you<00:01:59.979> grab<00:02:00.340> onto<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.789> ledge

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
of it before you grab onto the ledge

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.660 
of it before you grab onto the ledge
jump<00:02:01.630> off<00:02:01.869> over<00:02:02.470> this<00:02:02.679> wall<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.250> then<00:02:03.399> hover

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
jump off over this wall and then hover

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.539 
jump off over this wall and then hover
over<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:05.259> that's<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.950> only<00:02:05.979> way<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.340> can

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
over this and that's the only way I can

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.699 
over this and that's the only way I can
see<00:02:06.909> how<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.149> do<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.959> right<00:02:11.110> right<00:02:11.349> after

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709

come in here you jump up there there
will<00:02:45.910> be<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> patch<00:02:46.329> of<00:02:46.359> trees<00:02:46.780> there<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:47.709> you

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
will be a patch of trees there then you

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.690 
will be a patch of trees there then you
swing<00:02:48.280> across<00:02:48.459> using<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.329> chain<00:02:49.720> thing<00:02:50.700> go

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
swing across using that chain thing go

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.170 
swing across using that chain thing go
there<00:02:51.940> there<00:02:52.510> there<00:02:53.190> go<00:02:54.190> down<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.519> rail<00:02:54.670> jump

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
there there there go down the rail jump

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.240 
there there there go down the rail jump
to<00:02:55.569> this<00:02:55.720> rail<00:02:55.959> hundreds<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.769> barrels

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
to this rail hundreds and the barrels

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.780 
to this rail hundreds and the barrels
that<00:02:57.430> were<00:02:57.609> right<00:02:57.790> here<00:02:59.310> all<00:03:00.310> right<00:03:00.459> number

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
that were right here all right number

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.449 
that were right here all right number
eight<00:03:00.970> basically<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.139> just<00:03:02.170> keep<00:03:02.920> going<00:03:03.160> then

eight basically you just keep going then

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.520 
eight basically you just keep going then
the<00:03:03.970> way<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.150> normally<00:03:04.720> would<00:03:05.170> through<00:03:05.410> this

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the way you normally would through this

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.129 
the way you normally would through this
level<00:03:05.859> jump<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:06.639> rail<00:03:06.880> jump<00:03:07.540> off<00:03:07.750> and

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
level jump on this rail jump off and

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.960 
level jump on this rail jump off and
it's<00:03:08.440> on<00:03:08.650> one<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.160> barrels<00:03:09.459> on<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.760> sledge

it's on one of the barrels on the sledge
all<00:03:12.970> right<00:03:13.150> number<00:03:13.690> nine<00:03:13.930> it's<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.880> basically

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
all right number nine it's I basically

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.050 
all right number nine it's I basically
on<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.480> rail<00:03:17.040> they<00:03:18.040> didn't<00:03:18.340> really<00:03:18.519> try<00:03:18.910> and
