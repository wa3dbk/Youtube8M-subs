00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.730
 new technique sloth video 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.529
 I was just in the apple store here with me 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.540
 in dÃ¼sseldorf and have something for me 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.309
 my iphone got them on me 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.929
 Follow twitter or instagram or something 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 have already noticed the big one 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.390
 question was what color should my envelope 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.240
 for the iphone 6 plus get 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.910
 I have all cases extensively 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.550
 looked quickly was clear 50 euro for 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.890
 I would never have the leather case at all 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 for this my white silver model 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.870
 maybe even blue in consideration 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.579
 pulled but everyone knows quickly out in the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.649
 at the latest when I saw 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.530
 that the red from the plastic or 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.270
 polycarbonate case a lot 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 brighter and stronger knows that red 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.039
 from the leather case you also save her 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.940
 at the plastic acer now just ten 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.760
 euro the dinger costs it looks at you 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.809
 40 euro 50 euro for such a case so 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.670
 I still can not believe it 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.230
 that I spent so much coal 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.780
 I mean the thing apple can 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 maximum 50 cents in the last meal euro 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.510
 production or a trimmings 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.580
 Itself with shipping and all 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.439
 possible the profit margin here at the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.939
 Things need to be right I do not want to 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.409
 and then count on the leather 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.920
 I do not want to calculate cases either 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.830
 want 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.200
 I stood until the end of the election red 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.939
 or I know myself then for white 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.130
 decided because I thought so 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.290
 is less obvious and natural 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.000
 Everything is coming over to the front 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.470
 and then I thought so when I was 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 get me other heights or 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.180
 cheap caves or aftermakers cave 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.340
 You always get that in colorful or with 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.590
 motives with bunnies on it and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.360
 everything but such a white one knows 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.479
 which hopefully then exactly to the housing 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.470
 it will be very likely 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.119
 not only with apple but there I have 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.979
 a higher hit rate and now 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.439
 Let's see, we open it 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.509
 the arrow marks the place 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.210
 rub prof 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.030
 that should be enough and then we can do that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.229
 Just get out of here and do that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.229
 That's it, and now it's upholstered 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.060
 light gray in gray with fabric and the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.469
 fabric also runs in rantrum then 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.719
 That's what I'm looking for now, of course 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.540
 one is always afraid of these 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.070
 plastic covers that the 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.720
 the edges have something there 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.070
 can happen when you go outside 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.120
 I do not have that here 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.320
 calms me down here even if I still 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.880
 Never the will had the mine 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.760
 somehow scratched but that it was 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.030
 here and is and looks so soft 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.310
 good from then the feeling yes rubber stop 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.530
 So rather rubbery than plastic flexible 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.570
 Fits fits and now we push 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.630
 but the six times just one 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:40.060
 side and then the other 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.910
 and there wants rain should be good first impression 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.520
 this color does not seem to be here 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.570
 quite the same that points and there 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.490
 I am a little disappointed 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.310
 that just reminds me of the motorola 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.520
 Moto X3 also the frame other color than 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.590
 the front was what was on the display but of 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.100
 behind 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.140
 okay okay i dont now it is 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.480
 Of course not as beautiful as nature 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.160
 iphone what bothers me is why do 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.230
 she's also in a white yesterday 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.590
 black border but well there I have to 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.080
 by 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.780
 now the feeling in the hand yes that 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.239
 iphone in the original apple case feels 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.950
 definitely thick at it feels too 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.530
 not so nice anymore but that feels 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.220
 a whole corner was massive 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.910
 just the plus here with so good keys 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.709
 check louder 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.709
 a pleasant pressure point works 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.150
 is absolutely okay and also taste a 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.220
 I need a little more power 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.310
 So the taste of that would have a bit 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.769
 Train until he is there with the same 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.080
 could push sovereignty 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.450
 but every day more difficult listening yet 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.549
 In any case, so what do we have 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.840
 otherwise I'm just between 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.580
 also easy on it 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.650
 I have to clear my nail here 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.989
 pure and then up we have of course 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.180
 nothing and of course then the bottom 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.950
 big gap with it we still 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.959
 easily get our headphones in 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.540
 microphone lightning board that is beautiful 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.370
 of course, at this high construction 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.850
 if i have any jobs for 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.320
 put it in or something worked 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.880
 that easily work with this 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.769
 because you are not limited to that 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.630
 dock will hamper and the speaker 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.820
 is also completely free and open 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.350
 that pleases and from scratch 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.270
 yes, I have one now 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.280
 contain white case but it hits 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.860
 not one hundred percent white from the 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.160
 iphone so much is said and of course 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.960
 I will report how fast that is 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.730
 Things dirty if you do it again 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.170
 trouble clean war I need 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.970
 But a week before I really the one 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.260
 said get back the way here so 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.660
 very slightly discreet one more 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.120
 cut defense now, 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.870
 hope that makes the case big 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.550
 falls from the iphone would be deterred 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.930
 I do not bet you clearly have you 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.880
 with such a thing a better chance 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.710
 your iphone of course, scratches on 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.610
 the back on any surfaces 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.770
 he gets protected 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.500
 the display is of course also here 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.050
 The frame of the case is above the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.850
 display over so well I say so 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.710
 let's say three four millimeters 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.380
 certainly means i can too 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.700
 easily now the thing on the display 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.100
 with the table rubbing without me 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.000
 to have to think 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.750
 if I now but the corners 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.270
 Of course, there are always the anguished 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.620
 biggest biggest chance that 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.380
 the thing when falling also such a 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.490
 corner pops there is of course us 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.440
 You can also get out of it 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.000
 So pure and make it fix there 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.040
 I have no scruples now either 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.870
 problems and more current that feels 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.880
 Soft and padded here 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.410
 nothing will scratch the iphone 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.470
 But if I'm upholstering one 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.910
 corner look yes that's a little bit 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.680
 after is a bit soft and 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.650
 Of course I have only one extra here 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.290
 Protection knew about it means easier 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.210
 fall from what I do from the desk or 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.030
 something like this or out of the pants pocket 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.350
 that should work there you should 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.030
 No or there I have a tick now 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.940
 less fear but I do not go away 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.590
 from that this case i know one 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.630
 iphone crashed on a staircase 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.520
 will save or gave a bike ride 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.200
 from the bag falls because you have to 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.330
 drive up stronger guns 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.020
 but I feel a bit safer 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.220
 me so even if the iphone is six 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.260
 placed in the wide straight up 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.100
 just spent a whole massive corner 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.230
 But it also does not feel like it 's slipping anymore 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.210
 So many are saying that this is 6 plus 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.580
 so big so slippery that we are bad too 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.290
 This stops the year this year 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.000
 rubber stuff that does not slip in yours 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.530
 fingers I say now there would 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.820
 much more effort there with the 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.750
 finger when he flies him towards it 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.280
 move 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.200
 you probably have a bit 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.480
 more grip so for the people who say 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.570
 that these the iphone are so slippery 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.580
 or too smooth, yes, with such a hollow 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.810
 there you get another feeling but it 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.340
 gets fatter, too 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.840
 but that should have been me now 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.240
 So I chose the white one 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.650
 means I can not get a fortune 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.470
 same place as my back or 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.360
 I find a red ford without a place somewhere 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.380
 sticker and can that fortuna logo 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.980
 then, so to speak, reverse it 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.510
 have been 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.830
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.830
 and until the next video
