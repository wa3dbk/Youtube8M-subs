this video is going to be showing you a
bunch<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.849> basic<00:00:12.240> background<00:00:12.480> techniques<00:00:13.259> all

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
bunch of basic background techniques all

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.160 
bunch of basic background techniques all
layered<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.250> top<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.490> each<00:00:14.730> other<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.900> page

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
layered on top of each other this page

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
layered on top of each other this page
already<00:00:16.560> has<00:00:16.830> one<00:00:17.100> technique<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.910> that

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
already has one technique on it that

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.720 
already has one technique on it that
we've<00:00:18.390> already<00:00:18.570> shared<00:00:19.070> and<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.189> acrylic

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
we've already shared and that's acrylic

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.529 
we've already shared and that's acrylic
paint<00:00:21.090> put<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.470> cling<00:00:23.220> film<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.970> then

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
paint put on to cling film and then

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.679 
paint put on to cling film and then
placed<00:00:25.080> onto<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.680> page<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.119> page<00:00:27.359> was

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
placed onto the page with the page was

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.560 
placed onto the page with the page was
painted<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.369> retardo<00:00:29.369> gel<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
painted with retardo gel so that it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.269 
painted with retardo gel so that it
wouldn't<00:00:30.810> dry<00:00:30.929> straightaway<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
wouldn't dry straightaway and then the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.639 
wouldn't dry straightaway and then the
cling<00:00:33.180> wrap<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> paint<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.500> was

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
cling wrap with the paint on it was

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.790 
cling wrap with the paint on it was
scrunched<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.969> give<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:37.290> really<00:00:37.559> cool

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
scrunched to give this this really cool

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.630 
scrunched to give this this really cool
texture<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.579> got<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.520> picked<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
texture that it's got and I picked it

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000 
texture that it's got and I picked it
straight<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.989> put<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.649> back<00:00:43.800> down

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
straight up and then I put it back down

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.740 
straight up and then I put it back down
on<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.280> page<00:00:44.550> did<00:00:44.879> exactly<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.480> same<00:00:45.510> thing

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
on this page did exactly the same thing

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.700 
on this page did exactly the same thing
and<00:00:46.370> then<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:50.809> took<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> rest<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> paint

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and then I took the rest of the paint

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.490 
and then I took the rest of the paint
that<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.190> still<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.820> cling<00:00:54.120> film<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that was still on this cling film and I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.439 
that was still on this cling film and I
just<00:00:55.739> press<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> cling<00:00:56.460> film<00:00:56.640> straight<00:00:57.090> into

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
just press the cling film straight into

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.319 
just press the cling film straight into
this<00:00:57.660> journal<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.550> paint<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> lot

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
this journal so the paint is a lot

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
this journal so the paint is a lot
sparser<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.440> still<00:01:02.010> created<00:01:02.609> this

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
sparser but it's still created this

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:11.380 
sparser but it's still created this
really<00:01:02.910> cool<00:01:03.059> texture<00:01:03.539> site

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.660 

so<00:01:12.380> all<00:01:12.440> I've<00:01:12.590> done<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.770> put<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.100> little<00:01:13.310> bit<00:01:13.460> of

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
so all I've done is put a little bit of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.590 
so all I've done is put a little bit of
white<00:01:14.450> acrylic<00:01:14.990> onto<00:01:15.770> my<00:01:16.130> palette<00:01:17.000> pad<00:01:17.210> here

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
white acrylic onto my palette pad here

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.180 
white acrylic onto my palette pad here
and<00:01:17.630> I'm<00:01:17.900> just<00:01:18.080> going<00:01:18.260> to<00:01:18.320> run<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.800> brayer

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
and I'm just going to run the brayer

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.680 
and I'm just going to run the brayer
through<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:19.880> then<00:01:20.810> apply<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.920> page

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
through it and then apply it to the page

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:31.570 
through it and then apply it to the page
like<00:01:23.690> this<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:27.100> creates<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:29.080> translucent<00:01:30.580> layer

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
like this so creates a translucent layer

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.580 
like this so creates a translucent layer
of<00:01:31.910> white<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.690> it's<00:01:32.840> going<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.080> push<00:01:33.320> that

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
of white and it's going to push that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:02:23.199 
of white and it's going to push that
bright<00:01:34.250> paint<00:01:35.170> into<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.290> background

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.570 

do<00:02:24.209> this<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.660> can<00:02:24.840> use<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.440> palette<00:02:25.920> knife<00:02:25.950> like

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
do this you can use a palette knife like

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.680 
do this you can use a palette knife like

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
doesn't even have to be a piece of

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.940 
doesn't even have to be a piece of
plastic<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.930> piece<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.560> cardboard

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.729 
plastic it can be a piece of cardboard
from<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.880> recycling<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.780> will<00:02:42.989> work<00:02:43.349> just

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
from the recycling that will work just

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.350 
from the recycling that will work just
as<00:02:43.920> well<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.099> piece<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.550> cereal<00:02:44.940> box<00:02:45.150> or

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
I like white acrylic as a unifying layer

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
blend several layers together to make

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:59.290 
blend several layers together to make
them<00:03:31.580> look<00:03:31.760> more<00:03:32.060> cohesive<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.200> more
