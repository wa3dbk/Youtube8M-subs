most liquid who doesn't know that a lot
of<00:00:40.620> people<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.100> once<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> reaches<00:00:41.610> four

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
of people but once it reaches four

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.160 
of people but once it reaches four
degrees<00:00:42.030> Celsius<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.629> gets<00:00:42.809> less<00:00:43.110> dense

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
degrees Celsius it gets less dense

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
degrees Celsius it gets less dense
before<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.890> freezes<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.520> when<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> freezes

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
before it freezes and when it freezes

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.850 
before it freezes and when it freezes
it's<00:00:45.420> still<00:00:45.690> less<00:00:45.989> dense<00:00:46.289> than<00:00:46.469> liquid<00:00:46.530> water

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it's still less dense than liquid water

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010 
it's still less dense than liquid water
which<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.610> why<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.850> floats<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> witch

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
which is why it floats like a witch

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.180 
which is why it floats like a witch

now<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> paradox<00:00:50.850> we're<00:00:51.000> talking<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
now the paradox we're talking about is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.850 
now the paradox we're talking about is
called<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> Pemba<00:00:52.050> effect<00:00:52.350> spelled<00:00:52.710> like

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
called the Pemba effect spelled like

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.080 
called the Pemba effect spelled like
somebody<00:00:53.250> got<00:00:53.370> frustrated<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
somebody got frustrated with the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.369 
somebody got frustrated with the
keyboard<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.570> hurled<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.840> across<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> room

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
keyboard and hurled it across the room

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.750 
keyboard and hurled it across the room
and<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> cordless<00:00:56.070> keyboard<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.640> it's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and it was a cordless keyboard so it's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.220 
and it was a cordless keyboard so it's
still<00:00:56.940> work<00:00:57.090> even<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.690> smashed<00:00:57.899> against

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the wall and left a mark that got you in

bonds<00:01:32.820> happen<00:01:33.210> when<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> hydrogen<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
bonds happen when the hydrogen of a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.929 
bonds happen when the hydrogen of a
water<00:01:34.200> molecule<00:01:34.380> interacts<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> oxygen

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
water molecule interacts with the oxygen

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.240 
water molecule interacts with the oxygen
of<00:01:36.060> another<00:01:36.150> water<00:01:36.600> molecule<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
of another water molecule like a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.539 
of another water molecule like a
Halloween<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.650> college<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> idea<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
Halloween in college so the idea is that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.399 
Halloween in college so the idea is that
these<00:01:41.729> hydrogen<00:01:42.150> bonds<00:01:42.509> create<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.990> repulsion

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
these hydrogen bonds create a repulsion

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.260 
these hydrogen bonds create a repulsion
between<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.950> molecules<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.759> causes<00:01:45.119> those

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
between the molecules that causes those

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.940 
between the molecules that causes those
standard<00:01:45.750> covalent<00:01:46.290> bonds<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.649> mentioned

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
standard covalent bonds we mentioned

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.770 
standard covalent bonds we mentioned
before<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.430> store<00:01:47.670> energy<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.329> stretch<00:01:48.570> out

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
before to store energy and stretch out

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.080 
before to store energy and stretch out
so<00:01:49.200> has<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.649> water<00:01:49.920> warm<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.610> hydrogen<00:01:50.850> bond

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so has the water warm to hydrogen bond

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880 
so has the water warm to hydrogen bond
stretch<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> covalent<00:01:52.350> bonds<00:01:52.500> give<00:01:52.740> up

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
stretch and the covalent bonds give up

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.499 
stretch and the covalent bonds give up
their<00:01:53.040> energy<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.759> equivalent<00:01:54.420> of

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
their energy this is the equivalent of

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
their energy this is the equivalent of
cooling<00:01:55.229> despite<00:01:55.890> heating<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
cooling despite heating up this

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.249 
cooling despite heating up this
