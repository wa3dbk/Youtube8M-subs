like the color-block trend in a shirt so

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.810 
like the color-block trend in a shirt so
it<00:04:28.350> has<00:04:28.470> like<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> blue<00:04:28.979> the<00:04:29.190> turquoise<00:04:29.370> and

thought that it was really pretty and
its<00:05:02.340> sheer<00:05:02.550> once<00:05:02.760> again<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:03.539> it'll<00:05:03.690> be<00:05:03.720> really

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
though they're over a bathing suit or

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.469 
though they're over a bathing suit or

really<00:06:26.490> washed<00:06:26.760> me<00:06:27.060> out<00:06:27.090> and<00:06:27.630> it<00:06:28.470> made<00:06:28.710> me<00:06:28.740> look

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
really washed me out and it made me look

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.890 
really washed me out and it made me look
paler<00:06:29.550> than<00:06:29.669> it<00:06:29.909> was<00:06:30.090> several<00:06:30.360> isn't<00:06:30.690> really<00:06:30.870> a

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
paler than it was several isn't really a

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.450 
paler than it was several isn't really a
fan<00:06:31.110> of<00:06:31.139> that<00:06:31.380> so<00:06:31.590> I'm<00:06:31.710> trying<00:06:31.740> to<00:06:32.130> figure<00:06:32.430> out

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
fan of that so I'm trying to figure out

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.310 
fan of that so I'm trying to figure out
ways<00:06:32.700> to<00:06:32.760> make<00:06:33.090> it<00:06:33.180> a<00:06:33.270> little<00:06:33.419> bit<00:06:33.599> better<00:06:33.659> so<00:06:34.080> I

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
ways to make it a little bit better so I

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.140 
ways to make it a little bit better so I
think<00:06:34.979> that's<00:06:35.279> about<00:06:35.460> it<00:06:35.580> for<00:06:35.789> my

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
think that's about it for my
