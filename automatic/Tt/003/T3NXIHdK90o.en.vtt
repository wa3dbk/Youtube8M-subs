their<00:01:05.990> foundations<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.160> skin<00:01:07.400> products

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
their foundations and skin products

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.310 
their foundations and skin products
generally<00:01:08.090> are<00:01:08.390> awesome<00:01:08.840> it's<00:01:09.020> just<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
generally are awesome it's just the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.410 
generally are awesome it's just the
range<00:01:09.560> of<00:01:09.920> colors<00:01:10.730> they<00:01:10.850> just<00:01:11.060> don't<00:01:11.240> have

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
range of colors they just don't have

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.200 
range of colors they just don't have
enough<00:01:11.540> colors<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.500> suit<00:01:12.710> everybody<00:01:13.210> anyway

I've<00:02:07.729> kind<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.060> branched<00:02:08.599> out<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.780> little<00:02:09.110> bit

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
I've kind of branched out a little bit

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.379 
I've kind of branched out a little bit
into<00:02:09.470> more<00:02:09.649> lighter<00:02:10.009> kind<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.549> foundation<00:02:11.120> so

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.150 
into more lighter kind of foundation so
like<00:02:12.019> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
like the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160 
like the
I've<00:02:13.280> been<00:02:13.430> decay<00:02:13.670> naked<00:02:13.820> skin<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.540> bought<00:02:15.020> the

I've been decay naked skin I bought the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.020 
I've been decay naked skin I bought the
Laura<00:02:15.380> Mercier<00:02:15.830> tinted<00:02:16.070> moisturizer<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.940> I

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.810 
Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and I
do<00:02:17.090> love<00:02:17.360> them<00:02:17.630> both<00:02:18.340> maybe<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.490> because<00:02:19.610> I

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
do love them both maybe it's because I

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.080 
do love them both maybe it's because I
don't<00:02:20.090> go<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.750> much<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.140> full<00:02:21.410> on

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
don't go for so much of a full on

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.340 
don't go for so much of a full on
foundation<00:02:23.090> look<00:02:23.270> as<00:02:23.450> much<00:02:23.600> as<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.900> used<00:02:23.930> to

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
foundation look as much as I used to

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.080 
foundation look as much as I used to
because<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.800> can<00:02:24.980> use<00:02:25.220> concealers<00:02:25.880> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
because you can use concealers and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.180 
because you can use concealers and
things<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.570> cover<00:02:26.780> imperfections<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.830> that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
things to cover imperfections and that

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.620 
things to cover imperfections and that
kind<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.430> stuff<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.670> never<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:29.090> used<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.480> do

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
kind of stuff I never really used to do

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.120 
kind of stuff I never really used to do
so<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:29.960> could<00:02:30.170> have<00:02:30.410> something<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.980> do<00:02:31.100> with

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
so it could have something to do with

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.600 
so it could have something to do with
that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.730 
that
anyway<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.390> claims<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.900> give<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.230> luminous

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
anyway this claims to give a luminous

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.770 
anyway this claims to give a luminous
complexion<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.520> smooth<00:02:34.850> skin<00:02:35.060> now<00:02:35.750> I

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
complexion and smooth skin now I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.930 
complexion and smooth skin now I
definitely<00:02:36.140> think<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:36.770> very<00:02:36.950> luminous<00:02:37.190> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
definitely think it's very luminous it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.690 
definitely think it's very luminous it
definitely<00:02:38.660> evens<00:02:39.050> out<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.230> complexion<00:02:39.700> it's

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
definitely evens out the complexion it's

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.590 
definitely evens out the complexion it's
not<00:02:40.970> oily<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:43.160> gives<00:02:43.430> 24-hour<00:02:44.090> hydration

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
not oily and it gives 24-hour hydration

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.220 
not oily and it gives 24-hour hydration
and<00:02:44.870> has<00:02:45.080> an<00:02:45.230> SPF<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.800> 15<00:02:46.460> it's<00:02:47.090> very<00:02:47.420> light<00:02:47.780> now

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
and has an SPF of 15 it's very light now

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.650 
and has an SPF of 15 it's very light now
I<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:48.440> have<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.920> say<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.520> I'm<00:02:50.120> probably<00:02:50.360> gonna

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
I do have to say that I'm probably gonna

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.600 
I do have to say that I'm probably gonna
go<00:02:50.870> through<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.230> quite<00:02:51.500> quickly<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.220> very

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
go through this quite quickly it is very

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.820 
go through this quite quickly it is very
liquidy<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.630> I'm<00:02:54.140> only<00:02:54.320> gonna<00:02:54.470> show<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.770> a

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
liquidy and I'm only gonna show you a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.320 
liquidy and I'm only gonna show you a
little<00:02:54.950> bit<00:02:55.070> because<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.400> hate<00:02:55.640> wasting<00:02:56.150> things

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
little bit because I hate wasting things

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.300 
little bit because I hate wasting things
so<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.720> can<00:02:56.990> see<00:02:57.430> it's<00:02:58.430> quite<00:02:58.790> liquidy<00:03:00.310> slowly

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
so you can see it's quite liquidy slowly

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.180 
so you can see it's quite liquidy slowly
started<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.790> drip<00:03:02.120> down<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.660> cover<00:03:02.930> my<00:03:03.440> beauty

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
started to drip down and cover my beauty

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.970 
started to drip down and cover my beauty
spot<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.850> way<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.270> applies

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
spot and this is the way that it applies

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.660 
spot and this is the way that it applies
so<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:10.880> got<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.300> fairly<00:03:12.020> decent<00:03:12.520> amount<00:03:13.520> of

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
so it's got a fairly decent amount of

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.790 
so it's got a fairly decent amount of
coverage<00:03:14.090> if<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.570> see<00:03:14.840> now<00:03:15.410> from<00:03:15.620> other

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
coverage if you can see now from other

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.590 
coverage if you can see now from other
CC<00:03:16.340> creams<00:03:16.610> from<00:03:16.790> what<00:03:16.970> I've<00:03:17.060> seen<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.540> heard

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
CC creams from what I've seen and heard

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.900 
CC creams from what I've seen and heard
is<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.800> coverage<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.280> not<00:03:19.459> really<00:03:19.760> meant

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
is that the coverage is not really meant

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.220 
is that the coverage is not really meant
it's<00:03:20.240> not<00:03:20.300> really<00:03:20.510> meant<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.720> be<00:03:20.900> about

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
it's not really meant to be about

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.890 
it's not really meant to be about
coverage<00:03:21.650> some<00:03:22.459> people<00:03:22.760> even<00:03:22.940> use<00:03:23.090> CC<00:03:23.600> creams

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
coverage some people even use CC creams

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.990 
coverage some people even use CC creams
with<00:03:24.290> their<00:03:24.530> foundation<00:03:25.160> but<00:03:25.459> I<00:03:25.610> was

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
with their foundation but I was

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.640 
with their foundation but I was
pleasantly<00:03:26.240> surprised<00:03:26.959> with<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:27.320> I<00:03:27.500> would

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
pleasantly surprised with this I would

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.350 
pleasantly surprised with this I would
definitely<00:03:28.040> say<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.520> gives<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.820> kind<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.090> medium

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
definitely say it gives a kind of medium

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.690 
definitely say it gives a kind of medium
to<00:03:29.690> buildable<00:03:30.050> coverage<00:03:30.560> still<00:03:31.190> maybe<00:03:31.430> on<00:03:31.610> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
to buildable coverage still maybe on the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.220 
to buildable coverage still maybe on the
light<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.209> medium<00:03:32.390> side<00:03:32.810> but<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.200> is

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
light to medium side but it is

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.050 
light to medium side but it is
definitely<00:03:33.500> buildable<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.730> build<00:03:34.940> it

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
definitely buildable and I build it

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.220 
definitely buildable and I build it
around<00:03:35.330> my<00:03:35.450> cheeks<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:37.160> terms<00:03:37.490> of<00:03:37.930> hydration<00:03:38.930> I

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
around my cheeks in terms of hydration I

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.960 
around my cheeks in terms of hydration I
mean<00:03:39.410> I've<00:03:39.590> been<00:03:39.620> using<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.250> for<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:40.490> over<00:03:40.940> a

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
mean I've been using it for just over a

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.060 
mean I've been using it for just over a
week<00:03:41.030> now<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.540> I've<00:03:41.630> used<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.989> every<00:03:42.230> day<00:03:42.440> but

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
week now and I've used it every day but

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.710 
week now and I've used it every day but
because<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.520> is<00:03:43.580> so<00:03:43.640> light<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.300> tend<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.660> use

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
because it is so light I tend to use

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.540 
because it is so light I tend to use
quite<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.140> lot<00:03:45.380> of<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.530> product<00:03:45.860> so<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.010> do<00:03:46.130> think

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
quite a lot of the product so I do think

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.220 
quite a lot of the product so I do think
that<00:03:46.610> I<00:03:46.700> am<00:03:46.940> going<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.360> use<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:47.780> up<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> lot

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
that I am going to use it up a lot

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.699 
that I am going to use it up a lot
faster<00:03:48.890> then<00:03:49.550> I<00:03:49.610> did<00:03:50.030> or<00:03:50.330> I<00:03:50.630> do<00:03:50.870> with<00:03:51.290> like<00:03:51.470> my

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
faster then I did or I do with like my

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.400 
faster then I did or I do with like my
other<00:03:51.920> foundations<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.570> saying<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.200> it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
other foundations and in saying that it

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.350 
other foundations and in saying that it
wears<00:03:54.739> really<00:03:55.070> well<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.370> mean<00:03:55.640> I've<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:56.090> put<00:03:56.270> it

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
wears really well I mean I've I put it

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.080 
wears really well I mean I've I put it
on<00:03:56.510> about<00:03:56.870> 8:30<00:03:57.530> in<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.770> morning<00:03:57.940> come<00:03:58.940> back

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
on about 8:30 in the morning come back

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.330 
on about 8:30 in the morning come back
from<00:03:59.300> work<00:03:59.570> it's<00:04:00.380> probably<00:04:00.590> about<00:04:01.070> 8<00:04:01.310> o'clock

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
from work it's probably about 8 o'clock

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.910 
from work it's probably about 8 o'clock
ish<00:04:01.910> when<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.450> starts<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.050> maybe<00:04:03.290> shift<00:04:03.560> around

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
ish when it starts to maybe shift around

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.970 
ish when it starts to maybe shift around
so<00:04:04.310> about<00:04:04.520> between<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.600> 11<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.200> 12<00:04:06.410> hour<00:04:06.650> mark

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
so about between the 11 to 12 hour mark

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.850 
so about between the 11 to 12 hour mark
obviously<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.459> do<00:04:07.640> prime<00:04:08.120> my<00:04:08.360> skin<00:04:08.750> then<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.470> put

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
obviously I do prime my skin then I put

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.030 
obviously I do prime my skin then I put
this<00:04:10.070> on<00:04:10.340> then<00:04:10.580> I<00:04:10.610> conceal<00:04:11.270> then<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.890> set<00:04:12.890> with

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
this on then I conceal then I set with

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.979 
this on then I conceal then I set with
powder<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:13.610> I<00:04:13.640> do<00:04:13.790> do<00:04:14.120> all<00:04:14.330> of<00:04:14.360> these<00:04:14.630> kind<00:04:14.930> of

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
powder so I do do all of these kind of

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.840 
powder so I do do all of these kind of
things<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:15.350> can't<00:04:15.860> really<00:04:16.010> say<00:04:16.310> how<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:16.730> would

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
things I can't really say how it would

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.909 
things I can't really say how it would
perform<00:04:17.270> on<00:04:17.480> its<00:04:17.690> own<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.230> think<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:18.709> is

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
perform on its own I think it is

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.949 
perform on its own I think it is
generally<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.459> really<00:04:19.940> really<00:04:20.180> good<00:04:20.390> product<00:04:20.810> a

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
generally a really really good product a

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.650 
generally a really really good product a
really<00:04:21.229> good<00:04:21.410> alternative<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:22.479> foundation<00:04:23.479> I

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
really good alternative to foundation I

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.050 
really good alternative to foundation I
think<00:04:23.900> it's<00:04:24.289> good<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:25.130> like<00:04:25.400> take<00:04:25.700> away<00:04:25.729> on

like it can breathe as well it's not as

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.020 
like it can breathe as well it's not as
well<00:04:39.830> when<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.100> wear<00:04:40.280> foundation<00:04:40.490> if<00:04:40.970> you

well when you wear foundation if you

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.640 
well when you wear foundation if you
touch<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.449> skin<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:41.810> can<00:04:41.960> kind<00:04:42.260> of<00:04:42.380> feel<00:04:42.620> the
