00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
it on the camera lens the back texture
is<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> bit<00:01:25.229> hit<00:01:25.500> or<00:01:25.650> miss<00:01:25.680> though<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
is a bit hit or miss though it's a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
is a bit hit or miss though it's a
brushed<00:01:26.670> plastic<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:27.930> feels<00:01:28.170> quite

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
brushed plastic that really feels quite

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710 
brushed plastic that really feels quite
cheap<00:01:28.770> sometimes<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.579> even<00:01:29.610> sticky<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> don't

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
cheap sometimes and even sticky I don't

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.719 
cheap sometimes and even sticky I don't
know<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.320> possible<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.430> upside

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
know how that's possible but the upside

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.249 
know how that's possible but the upside
is<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.150> doesn't<00:01:33.479> hold<00:01:33.600> fingerprints<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
is that it doesn't hold fingerprints and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.929 
is that it doesn't hold fingerprints and
actually<00:01:34.590> offers<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.009> pretty<00:01:35.250> good<00:01:35.460> grip<00:01:35.759> on

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
actually offers a pretty good grip on

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.730 
actually offers a pretty good grip on
the<00:01:36.119> phone<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.750> doesn't<00:01:37.049> feel<00:01:37.140> slippery<00:01:37.530> at

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the phone it doesn't feel slippery at

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
the phone it doesn't feel slippery at
all<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.549> why<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:38.880> went<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
all so we can see why they went with it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.819 
all so we can see why they went with it
now<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.020> power<00:01:40.350> button<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
now because the power button is on the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649 
now because the power button is on the
top<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> phone<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.180> hard<00:01:42.509> to
