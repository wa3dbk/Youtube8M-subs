scratches here from playing around with

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.000 
scratches here from playing around with
it<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.900> wasn't<00:00:27.900> actually<00:00:28.260> able<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.800> this

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it I wasn't actually able to get this

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.690 
it I wasn't actually able to get this
bracket<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.570> at<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> same<00:00:30.960> time<00:00:31.700> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
bracket and this one at the same time so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.139 
bracket and this one at the same time so
I<00:00:32.730> hadn't<00:00:33.090> take<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.390> bracket<00:00:33.660> off<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:35.149> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
I hadn't take this bracket off on here I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.880 
I hadn't take this bracket off on here I
don't<00:00:36.780> know<00:00:37.020> why<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> don't<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.530> screw<00:00:37.800> in

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
don't know why I don't have a screw in

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
don't know why I don't have a screw in
it<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.579> there's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.850> reason<00:00:39.239> maybe<00:00:39.360> because

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
it I know there's a reason maybe because

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.190 
it I know there's a reason maybe because
it<00:00:39.899> doesn't<00:00:40.140> line<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.320> perfectly

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
it doesn't line up perfectly

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.569 
it doesn't line up perfectly
it's<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.500> hot<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> can't<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.399> mess

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it's a little hot so I can't really mess

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.389 
it's a little hot so I can't really mess
with<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.940> um<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.989> did<00:00:46.140> hack<00:00:46.350> down<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.890> there<00:00:47.129> I

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
with it um we did hack down in there I

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.819 
with it um we did hack down in there I
believe<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.809> pipe<00:00:49.079> right<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.649> did

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
believe for this pipe right here we did

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.630 
believe for this pipe right here we did
have<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.160> cut<00:00:50.449> some<00:00:51.449> metal<00:00:52.370> just<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
have to cut some metal just because it

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:09.000 
have to cut some metal just because it
was<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.120> tight<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.780> believe

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:24.039 

you<00:01:09.580> find<00:01:10.000> get<00:01:10.180> some<00:01:10.360> light

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.690 

the<00:01:24.409> biggest<00:01:24.590> problem<00:01:24.979> we<00:01:25.070> had<00:01:25.220> was<00:01:25.400> fitting

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the biggest problem we had was fitting

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.399 
the biggest problem we had was fitting
this<00:01:25.850> was<00:01:26.090> this<00:01:26.479> guy<00:01:26.689> right<00:01:26.990> here<00:01:28.810> on<00:01:29.810> Saturday

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
this was this guy right here on Saturday

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.109 
this was this guy right here on Saturday
he<00:01:30.740> spent<00:01:30.950> about<00:01:31.009> 14<00:01:31.460> hours<00:01:31.610> granted<00:01:32.030> we

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
he spent about 14 hours granted we

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.499 
he spent about 14 hours granted we
notched<00:01:32.299> out<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.659> crash<00:01:32.900> bar<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.380> everything

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
notched out the crash bar and everything

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.539 
notched out the crash bar and everything
but<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:35.659> was<00:01:35.840> pushing<00:01:36.200> my<00:01:36.350> my<00:01:36.710> intakes<00:01:37.070> down

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
one PVC elbow going into the intake pipe

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.880 
one PVC elbow going into the intake pipe
this<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:35.680> believe<00:02:37.720> two<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.019> three-quarter
