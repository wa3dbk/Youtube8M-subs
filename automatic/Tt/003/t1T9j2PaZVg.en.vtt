00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.720 

this<00:01:17.810> is<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.080> field<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.650> found<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.610> go

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
this is the field that I found to go

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.150 
this is the field that I found to go
hunting<00:01:20.120> in<00:01:20.320> when<00:01:21.320> I<00:01:21.350> first<00:01:21.650> came<00:01:21.890> here<00:01:22.130> there

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
hunting in when I first came here there

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.980 
hunting in when I first came here there
was<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.400> hunter<00:01:22.790> over<00:01:23.240> in<00:01:23.330> that<00:01:23.450> corner<00:01:23.510> of<00:01:23.900> the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
was a hunter over in that corner of the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.030 
was a hunter over in that corner of the
field<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.540> Sun<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:26.840> setting<00:01:27.380> in<00:01:27.650> our<00:01:27.800> West

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
field and the Sun is setting in our West

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.520 
field and the Sun is setting in our West
so<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:28.520> going<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.700> be<00:01:29.000> blinding<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.170> all<00:01:30.320> of

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
so it's going to be blinding but all of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.800 
so it's going to be blinding but all of
this<00:01:30.650> place<00:01:31.010> was<00:01:31.250> open<00:01:31.430> right<00:01:31.729> here<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:32.690> go

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
this place was open right here and go

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.430 
this place was open right here and go
fast<00:01:33.080> by<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.380> Sun<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.990> there<00:01:35.990> was<00:01:36.110> another

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
fast by the Sun and there was another

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.210 
fast by the Sun and there was another
hunter<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:38.540> I<00:01:38.630> believe<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:38.960> was<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.410> part<00:01:40.190> of

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
hunter and I believe it was that part of

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.500 
hunter and I believe it was that part of
the<00:01:40.310> field<00:01:40.720> they<00:01:41.720> showed<00:01:41.990> up<00:01:42.200> late<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.910> there

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
the field they showed up late and there

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.550 
the field they showed up late and there
was<00:01:44.690> also<00:01:44.930> another<00:01:45.200> hunter<00:01:45.680> down<00:01:45.860> over<00:01:46.130> there

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
was also another hunter down over there

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.170 
was also another hunter down over there
what<00:01:48.560> makes<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:48.920> such<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.190> good<00:01:49.430> spot<00:01:49.729> besides

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
what makes this such a good spot besides

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.350 
what makes this such a good spot besides
the<00:01:50.330> fact<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:50.660> it's<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.960> big<00:01:51.830> open<00:01:52.190> field<00:01:52.460> is

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
the fact that it's a big open field is

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.990 
the fact that it's a big open field is
this<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.170> all<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.770> trees<00:01:55.070> over<00:01:55.670> here<00:01:55.820> that
