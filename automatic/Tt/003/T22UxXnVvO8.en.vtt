00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
there's a lot of stuff taught a lot of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.200 
there's a lot of stuff taught a lot of
builds<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.070> make<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.670> stay<00:00:26.789> tuned<00:00:27.000> for

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

into<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.460> core<00:00:38.790> cpu<00:00:39.450> two<00:00:40.110> hundred<00:00:40.410> dollars<00:00:40.649> for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
into a core cpu two hundred dollars for

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.220 
into a core cpu two hundred dollars for
the<00:00:40.950> cpu<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.570> ten<00:00:42.809> dollars<00:00:43.050> shipping

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the cpu and about ten dollars shipping

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.569 
the cpu and about ten dollars shipping
so<00:00:43.559> you're<00:00:43.739> paying<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.160> two<00:00:44.280> hundred<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
so you're paying about two hundred and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.639 
so you're paying about two hundred and
ten<00:00:44.850> dollars<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> cpu<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.500> really

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
ten dollars for the cpu it's a really

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.040 
ten dollars for the cpu it's a really
solid<00:00:46.950> cpu<00:00:47.399> unfortunately<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> could<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.510> fit

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
solid cpu unfortunately I could not fit

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.560 
solid cpu unfortunately I could not fit
a<00:00:49.079> cpu<00:00:49.680> cooler<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.460> build<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.420> guys

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
a cpu cooler in this build if you guys

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240 
a cpu cooler in this build if you guys
want<00:00:51.960> down<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.800> pick<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.129> a

want down the one you can pick up a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
want down the one you can pick up a
cooler<00:00:53.489> master<00:00:53.850> hyper<00:00:53.879> 212<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.780> about

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
cooler master hyper 212 that's about

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.810 
cooler master hyper 212 that's about
twenty<00:00:55.289> five<00:00:55.410> dollars<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.039> that's<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.699> going

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
twenty five dollars so that's not going

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.610 
twenty five dollars so that's not going
to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.390> eat<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.899> guys<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.379> want

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to go a little bit over the thousand

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.029 
to go a little bit over the thousand
dollar<00:01:00.239> budget<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.109> pick<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.710> which

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
dollar budget you can pick that up which

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.310 
dollar budget you can pick that up which
I<00:01:02.160> would<00:01:02.370> highly<00:01:02.760> recommend<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.570> Andy

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
I would highly recommend because Andy

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.350 
I would highly recommend because Andy
has<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> tendency<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.070> stock<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.700> very<00:01:05.970> mediocre

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
has a tendency to stock in very mediocre

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.109 
has a tendency to stock in very mediocre
cpu<00:01:07.049> cooler<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.500> having<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> hyper<00:01:08.130> 212<00:01:08.400> well

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
cpu cooler so having a hyper 212 well

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.609 
cpu cooler so having a hyper 212 well
not<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.200> great<00:01:10.439> for

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
not it's not going to be great for

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.530 
not it's not going to be great for
overclocking<00:01:11.189> necessarily<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.390> going

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
overclocking necessarily it's just going

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.200 
overclocking necessarily it's just going
to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.630> good<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.170> keep<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> fx-8350<00:01:14.640> cool<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to be good to keep the fx-8350 cool that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.340 
to be good to keep the fx-8350 cool that
stocks<00:01:15.570> stocks<00:01:16.560> speeds<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.030> yeah<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> fx-8350

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350

I<00:03:03.560> mean<00:03:03.890> four<00:03:04.160> gigabytes<00:03:04.610> really<00:03:04.940> gets<00:03:05.120> the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
I mean four gigabytes really gets the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.090 
I mean four gigabytes really gets the
job<00:03:05.510> done<00:03:05.570> now<00:03:06.020> it's<00:03:06.260> more<00:03:06.560> than<00:03:06.740> enough<00:03:06.860> a

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
job done now it's more than enough a

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
naked good bikes well it is gonna start

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.450 
naked good bikes well it is gonna start

don't see 16 year ago bikes are taking
over<00:03:13.490> that<00:03:13.820> quickly<00:03:14.210> maybe<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.960> two<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.290> three

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350

over that quickly maybe in two to three
years<00:03:15.800> 16<00:03:16.220> gigabytes<00:03:16.670> will<00:03:16.850> be<00:03:16.970> something

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
years 16 gigabytes will be something

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.240 
years 16 gigabytes will be something
that<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.480> lot<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.720> more<00:03:18.080> people<00:03:18.260> look<00:03:18.530> at<00:03:18.739> right

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
that a lot of more people look at right

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.770 
that a lot of more people look at right
now<00:03:19.280> 8<00:03:19.700> gigabytes<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.300> something<00:03:20.690> that's

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
now 8 gigabytes is something that's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.930 
now 8 gigabytes is something that's
gonna<00:03:20.959> work<00:03:21.230> perfectly<00:03:21.709> fine<00:03:22.010> for<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.520> build

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
gonna work perfectly fine for a build

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.449 
gonna work perfectly fine for a build
like<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.390> hell<00:03:24.140> even<00:03:24.170> in<00:03:24.620> higher-end<00:03:25.130> builds

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
like this hell even in higher-end builds

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.310 
like this hell even in higher-end builds
I<00:03:25.550> still<00:03:25.940> recommend<00:03:26.300> a<00:03:26.540> gigabytes<00:03:27.020> of<00:03:27.110> RAM

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
I still recommend a gigabytes of RAM

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.170 
I still recommend a gigabytes of RAM
just<00:03:27.560> because<00:03:27.860> 16<00:03:28.280> gigs<00:03:28.520> of<00:03:28.670> RAM<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:28.970> so

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
just because 16 gigs of RAM is so

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.300 
just because 16 gigs of RAM is so
useless<00:03:29.570> in<00:03:29.870> gaming<00:03:30.230> yes<00:03:30.380> it's<00:03:30.650> helpful<00:03:31.040> and

useless in gaming yes it's helpful and

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.949 
useless in gaming yes it's helpful and
