the Lumix G f1 the reason I'm talking
about<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.689> amount<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.079> people<00:00:31.230> that

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
about it is is the amount of people that

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.700 
about it is is the amount of people that
emailed<00:00:32.070> me<00:00:32.279> after<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> put<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.270> my<00:00:33.720> first<00:00:34.350> post

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
emailed me after I put up my first post

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.240 
emailed me after I put up my first post
with<00:00:34.950> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
with it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.959 
with it
asking<00:00:35.940> me<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.960> camera<00:00:37.260> was

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
asking me what what the camera was

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.010 
asking me what what the camera was
obviously<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> video<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.930> was

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
obviously that the video that it was

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.529 
obviously that the video that it was
producing<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:41.010> bit<00:00:41.100> clearer<00:00:41.539> and

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
producing was a little bit clearer and

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:43.910 
producing was a little bit clearer and
the<00:00:42.719> thing<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.050> people<00:00:43.199> were<00:00:43.410> commenting

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the thing that people were commenting

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.369 
the thing that people were commenting
about<00:00:44.070> particularly<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.899> video<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
about particularly with the video and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.599 
about particularly with the video and
I'll<00:00:46.500> link<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.180> was<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> depth<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.929> field

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
I'll link to it was the depth of field

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.270 
I'll link to it was the depth of field
what<00:00:50.609> you'll<00:00:50.820> notice<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.929> this<00:00:52.170> camera<00:00:52.559> on

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
what you'll notice with this camera on

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.160 
what you'll notice with this camera on
the<00:00:53.429> video<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.879> I'll<00:00:54.179> perhaps<00:00:54.420> I'll<00:00:54.600> insert<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the video and I'll perhaps I'll insert a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.919 
the video and I'll perhaps I'll insert a
little<00:00:55.320> bit<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.589> it<00:00:55.710> into<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.550> clip<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.120> that

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
little bit of it into this clip is that

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.229 
little bit of it into this clip is that
the<00:00:58.440> background<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.640> out<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> focus

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the background was really out of focus

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.599 
the background was really out of focus
in<00:01:00.690> comparison<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.739> video<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.339> at<00:01:02.429> least

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
in comparison to this video or at least

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.570 
in comparison to this video or at least
on<00:01:02.820> assuming<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.870> video<00:01:04.470> will<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
on assuming this video will be the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.520 
on assuming this video will be the
reason<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.480> that<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.840> camera

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
reason for that is that this camera

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.060 
reason for that is that this camera
comes<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:09.030> lens<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.799> prime<00:01:10.799> lens

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
comes with this lens it's a prime lens

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.120 
comes with this lens it's a prime lens
in<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> doesn't<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> zoom<00:01:12.560> it's<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.680> 20

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
in that it doesn't have a zoom it's a 20

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
in that it doesn't have a zoom it's a 20
millimeter<00:01:14.670> lens<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> reasonably

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
millimeter lens so it's a reasonably

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.920 
millimeter lens so it's a reasonably
wide<00:01:16.500> open<00:01:17.070> lens<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:18.240> quite<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> wide

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
wide open lens so you get quite a wide

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.719 
wide open lens so you get quite a wide
angle<00:01:19.280> on<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.149> aperture<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.979> 1.7<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
angle on it but it's aperture is 1.7 the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.450 
angle on it but it's aperture is 1.7 the
aperture<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> how<00:01:24.509> big<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.470> lens<00:01:25.710> opens<00:01:26.250> up

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
aperture is how big the lens opens up

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.030 
aperture is how big the lens opens up
and<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.869> lens<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> very<00:01:28.619> fast

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and really this lens is a very fast

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
and really this lens is a very fast
lance<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:29.820> call<00:01:30.000> fast<00:01:30.299> lens<00:01:30.600> because

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
lance what they call fast lens because

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.770 
lance what they call fast lens because
it<00:01:31.110> allows<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> lot<00:01:31.649> of<00:01:32.040> lighting<00:01:32.310> at<00:01:32.670> once<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it allows a lot of lighting at once and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.859 
it allows a lot of lighting at once and
when<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.079> open<00:01:34.469> up<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> lens<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.280> big<00:01:35.869> it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
when you open up the lens that big it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.160 
when you open up the lens that big it
actually<00:01:37.680> makes<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.729> depth<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.210> field<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.780> lot

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
actually makes the depth of field a lot

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.580 
actually makes the depth of field a lot
shallower<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.210> what<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.479> am<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.439> in

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
shallower so what I am here I'm in

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
shallower so what I am here I'm in
focused<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.159> what's<00:01:44.399> back<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:45.149> be

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
focused but what's back there will be

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.550 
focused but what's back there will be
out<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.509> focus<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:46.110> you're<00:01:46.229> shooting<00:01:46.530> with

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
out of focus when you're shooting with

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740 
out of focus when you're shooting with
this<00:01:46.799> lens<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.729> lens<00:01:47.789> i'm<00:01:48.090> shooting<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.450> now

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
this lens the lens i'm shooting with now

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899 
this lens the lens i'm shooting with now
this<00:01:49.110> camera<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.950> you're<00:01:50.369> viewing<00:01:50.549> me<00:01:50.820> on

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
this camera that you're viewing me on

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.440 
this camera that you're viewing me on
now<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> canon<00:01:51.780> s<00:01:52.049> 90<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.969> aperture<00:01:54.360> i

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
now is a canon s 90 and it's aperture i

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.080 
now is a canon s 90 and it's aperture i
think<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.369> let<00:01:56.369> me<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> look<00:01:56.820> here

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
think is let me have a look here

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.420 
think is let me have a look here
I<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.869> ranges<00:01:58.500> from<00:01:58.619> two<00:01:59.039> to<00:01:59.250> four

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
I think it's ranges from two to four

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.039 
I think it's ranges from two to four
point<00:01:59.700> nine<00:01:59.909> depending<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> focal<00:02:01.020> length

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
point nine depending on the focal length

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.399 
point nine depending on the focal length
so<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.219> not<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:02.609> fast<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> result<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
so it's not as fast and as a result you

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.740 
so it's not as fast and as a result you
find<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> depth<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.340> field<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:06.210> less

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
find that the depth of field is less

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.570 
find that the depth of field is less
shallow<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.649> get<00:02:07.950> more<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.399> focus

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
shallow and so you get more in focus

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.760 
shallow and so you get more in focus
back<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.330> which<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.960> fine<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.470> want<00:02:10.710> to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
back there which is fine if you want to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
back there which is fine if you want to
keep<00:02:10.890> everything<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.400> focus<00:02:11.850> but<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.510> get

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
keep everything in focus but to get

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.000 
keep everything in focus but to get
everything<00:02:12.959> out<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.319> focus<00:02:13.530> back<00:02:13.830> there

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
everything out of focus back there

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.850 
everything out of focus back there
actually<00:02:14.310> makes

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
actually makes

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.680 
actually makes
you<00:02:15.860> as<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.489> subject<00:02:16.940> stand<00:02:17.239> out<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> little

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
you as the subject stand out a little

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.839 
you as the subject stand out a little
bit<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:18.200> I'm<00:02:18.530> now<00:02:18.739> shooting<00:02:19.190> on<00:02:19.550> the

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
bit like I'm now shooting on the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.150 
bit like I'm now shooting on the
Panasonic<00:02:20.420> gf1<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.349> is<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.590> camera<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:21.980> I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
Panasonic gf1 this is the camera that I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.580 
Panasonic gf1 this is the camera that I
was<00:02:22.430> shooting<00:02:22.640> with<00:02:22.910> before<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.590> much

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
was shooting with before the much

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.430 
was shooting with before the much
smaller<00:02:24.980> camera<00:02:25.540> Canon<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.690> really<00:02:27.230> does

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
smaller camera Canon and really does

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.800 
smaller camera Canon and really does
take<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.709> reasonable<00:02:28.010> quality<00:02:28.550> video<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
take a reasonable quality video but the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.050 
take a reasonable quality video but the
other<00:02:29.959> thing<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.349> like<00:02:30.620> about<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
other thing that I like about the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.339 
other thing that I like about the
Panasonic<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.330> because<00:02:32.780> you've<00:02:32.989> got<00:02:33.170> this

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
Panasonic is because you've got this

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.949 
Panasonic is because you've got this
really<00:02:34.190> wide<00:02:34.459> aperture<00:02:35.030> it'll<00:02:35.390> lets<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.660> lot<00:02:35.900> of

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
really wide aperture it'll lets a lot of

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.190 
really wide aperture it'll lets a lot of
light<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:37.340> can<00:02:37.489> actually<00:02:37.610> shoot<00:02:38.180> video<00:02:38.840> in

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
light in you can actually shoot video in

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.920 
light in you can actually shoot video in
a<00:02:39.680> darker<00:02:40.129> room<00:02:40.340> without<00:02:41.150> quite<00:02:41.599> as<00:02:41.750> much

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
a darker room without quite as much

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.380 
a darker room without quite as much
light<00:02:42.290> at<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.680> moment<00:02:42.709> I'm<00:02:43.160> shooting<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.760> sunny

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
light at the moment I'm shooting a sunny

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.119 
light at the moment I'm shooting a sunny
outside<00:02:44.629> so<00:02:44.989> I've<00:02:45.319> got<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.500> fair<00:02:45.739> bit<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:45.950> light

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
outside so I've got a fair bit of light

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.400 
outside so I've got a fair bit of light
coming<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.670> but<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.480> video<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.049> first

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
coming in but the video that I first

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.289 
coming in but the video that I first
shot<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.829> on<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.280> was<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.519> quite<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.790> gloomy

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
shot this on it was on a quite a gloomy

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.930 
shot this on it was on a quite a gloomy
day<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.780> wasn't<00:02:51.140> sitting<00:02:51.319> in<00:02:51.950> really<00:02:52.549> open

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
day and I wasn't sitting in really open

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.330 
day and I wasn't sitting in really open
light<00:02:53.150> situation<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.380> yet<00:02:54.650> because<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:55.069> that

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
light situation and yet because of that

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.910 
light situation and yet because of that
nice<00:02:55.640> wide<00:02:56.180> open<00:02:56.840> lens<00:02:57.079> it<00:02:57.319> let<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.590> lot<00:02:57.860> of

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
nice wide open lens it let a lot of

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.280 
nice wide open lens it let a lot of
light<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:59.209> hopefully<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.720> can<00:02:59.780> see<00:03:00.079> a<00:03:00.110> bit

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
light in so hopefully you can see a bit

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.140 
light in so hopefully you can see a bit
of<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.440> difference<00:03:00.829> between<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.489> video<00:03:01.849> and

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
of a difference between this video and

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.780 
of a difference between this video and
the<00:03:02.329> one<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.629> I<00:03:02.690> shot<00:03:02.930> before<00:03:03.349> on<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.790> both

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
the one that I shot before on this both

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.000 
the one that I shot before on this both
personally<00:03:05.569> I<00:03:05.599> could<00:03:06.200> go<00:03:06.349> with<00:03:06.560> either<00:03:06.709> one

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
personally I could go with either one

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.430 
personally I could go with either one
this<00:03:07.790> one<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.239> me<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.690> just<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.110> little<00:03:09.349> bit

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
this one to me is just a little bit

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.410 
this one to me is just a little bit
nicer<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:10.160> like<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.760> said<00:03:10.819> before<00:03:10.970> it's<00:03:11.360> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
nicer and like I said before it's a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.199 
nicer and like I said before it's a
little<00:03:11.629> bit<00:03:11.750> sharper<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.379> and<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:13.760> depth<00:03:14.030> of

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
little bit sharper and and that depth of

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.940 
little bit sharper and and that depth of
field<00:03:14.450> gives<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.870> nice<00:03:15.049> effect<00:03:15.079> as<00:03:15.620> well<00:03:15.769> so

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
field gives it a nice effect as well so

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.990 
field gives it a nice effect as well so
I<00:03:15.980> hope<00:03:16.129> you<00:03:16.250> can<00:03:16.370> see<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:16.610> bit<00:03:16.819> of<00:03:16.849> the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
I hope you can see a bit of the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.729 
I hope you can see a bit of the
difference<00:03:17.390> now<00:03:17.629> so<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.900> might<00:03:18.140> just<00:03:18.170> go<00:03:18.410> back

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
difference now so I might just go back

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.680 
difference now so I might just go back
to<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.069> other<00:03:19.190> video<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:19.880> anyway<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.600> a

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
to the other video so anyway it's a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.140 
to the other video so anyway it's a
Panasonic<00:03:20.959> Lumix<00:03:22.870> DMC<00:03:23.870> gf1<00:03:24.790> it's<00:03:25.790> not<00:03:26.030> the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
Panasonic Lumix DMC gf1 it's not the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.640 
Panasonic Lumix DMC gf1 it's not the
cheapest<00:03:26.540> camera<00:03:26.900> out<00:03:26.989> there<00:03:27.049> it's<00:03:27.380> what<00:03:27.530> they

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
cheapest camera out there it's what they

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.430 
cheapest camera out there it's what they
call<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.920> Micro<00:03:28.549> Four<00:03:28.880> Thirds<00:03:29.049> camera<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:30.290> it's

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
call a Micro Four Thirds camera so it's

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.770 
call a Micro Four Thirds camera so it's
a<00:03:30.530> new<00:03:30.799> type<00:03:31.099> of<00:03:31.130> camera<00:03:32.030> sort<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.329> in<00:03:32.420> between

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
a new type of camera sort of in between

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.140 
a new type of camera sort of in between
the<00:03:32.900> point-and-shoot<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:34.280> digital<00:03:34.670> SLR

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
the point-and-shoot and the digital SLR

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.300 
the point-and-shoot and the digital SLR
it<00:03:35.599> takes<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.989> really<00:03:36.260> nice<00:03:36.410> still<00:03:36.769> shot<00:03:37.040> as

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
it takes a really nice still shot as

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.300 
it takes a really nice still shot as
well<00:03:37.489> it's<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.329> little<00:03:38.569> bit<00:03:38.690> smaller<00:03:39.109> than<00:03:39.470> a

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
well it's a little bit smaller than a

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.759 
well it's a little bit smaller than a
full<00:03:40.790> size<00:03:40.970> digital<00:03:41.510> SLR<00:03:42.019> but<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.440> has<00:03:42.739> a

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
full size digital SLR but it has a

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.559 
full size digital SLR but it has a
little<00:03:43.040> bit<00:03:43.220> more<00:03:43.370> power<00:03:43.639> than<00:03:44.090> something

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
little bit more power than something

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.690 
little bit more power than something
like<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.380> Canon<00:03:45.769> that<00:03:45.799> I<00:03:46.010> mean<00:03:46.250> shooting

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
this on at the moment I personally

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.610 
this on at the moment I personally
prefer<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.459> have<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:50.269> still<00:03:50.810> camera<00:03:51.049> that<00:03:51.470> takes

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
prefer to have a still camera that takes

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.670 
prefer to have a still camera that takes
good<00:03:51.950> quality<00:03:52.430> video<00:03:52.760> over<00:03:53.569> having<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.930> good

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680

good quality video over having a good
still<00:03:55.609> camera<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.389> good<00:03:56.569> video<00:03:56.720> camera

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
separate I like to have them in the one

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.089 
separate I like to have them in the one
thing<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.239> can<00:03:59.569> just<00:04:00.139> just<00:04:00.500> carry<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.950> one

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
thing so I can just just carry the one

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.949 
thing so I can just just carry the one
thing<00:04:01.370> around<00:04:01.609> yeah<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.510> good<00:04:02.690> thing<00:04:02.870> about

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
thing around yeah the good thing about

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.289 
thing around yeah the good thing about
this<00:04:03.290> camera<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.769> that<00:04:03.799> it's<00:04:04.099> got<00:04:04.730> detachable

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
this camera is that it's got detachable

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.089 
this camera is that it's got detachable
lenses<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:05.989> can<00:04:06.290> add<00:04:06.500> other<00:04:06.739> ones

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
lenses so you can add other ones

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.309 
lenses so you can add other ones
the<00:04:08.090> reason<00:04:08.359> I've<00:04:08.480> got<00:04:08.660> this<00:04:08.810> one<00:04:09.019> on<00:04:09.139> is

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
the reason I've got this one on is

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.710 
the reason I've got this one on is
because<00:04:09.859> it<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.099> so<00:04:10.280> fast<00:04:10.609> and<00:04:10.940> really<00:04:11.269> all<00:04:11.569> the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
because it is so fast and really all the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.240 
because it is so fast and really all the
reviews<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.109> I've<00:04:12.380> read<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.799> all<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.130> other

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
reviews that I've read of all the other

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.670 
reviews that I've read of all the other
lenses<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:13.910> fit<00:04:14.090> on<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:14.359> this<00:04:15.260> one<00:04:15.440> leaves

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
lenses that fit on this this one leaves

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.990 
lenses that fit on this this one leaves
them<00:04:15.829> for<00:04:16.220> dead<00:04:16.400> it's<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.849> 20<00:04:17.180> millimeter<00:04:17.979> 1.7

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
them for dead it's the 20 millimeter 1.7

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.270 
them for dead it's the 20 millimeter 1.7
so<00:04:20.000> you<00:04:20.060> can<00:04:20.329> get<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:20.840> as<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.590> kit<00:04:21.950> and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
so you can get this as a kit and

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.130 
so you can get this as a kit and
together<00:04:22.760> it's<00:04:23.210> not<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.450> cheapest<00:04:23.780> camera<00:04:24.050> in

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
together it's not the cheapest camera in

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.870 
together it's not the cheapest camera in
the<00:04:24.229> world<00:04:24.349> but<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:25.070> quality<00:04:25.490> of<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.760> is

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
the world but the quality of it is

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.430 
the world but the quality of it is
really

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
really

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.290 
really
anyway<00:04:27.130> that's<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.430> camera<00:04:27.760> I'm<00:04:27.910> using<00:04:28.090> at
