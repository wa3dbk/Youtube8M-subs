00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.970 

now<00:02:26.820> we've<00:02:27.030> been<00:02:27.330> over<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> last<00:02:28.350> couple<00:02:28.800> of

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
now we've been over the last couple of

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.580 
now we've been over the last couple of
years<00:02:29.040> kind<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.610> an<00:02:29.730> up-tempo<00:02:30.060> team<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.720> not

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
years kind of an up-tempo team with not

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.230 
years kind of an up-tempo team with not

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
doing a world cup of sugar huddle with

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.310 
doing a world cup of sugar huddle with
the<00:02:34.980> linemen<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:35.790> forth<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.450> so

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
the linemen and so forth and and so

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.910 
the linemen and so forth and and so
we've<00:02:38.160> practiced<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.970> lot<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.920> 42nd

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
we've practiced a lot with the 42nd

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.560 
we've practiced a lot with the 42nd
clock<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.310> really<00:02:41.520> only<00:02:41.640> running<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.300> 35

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
clock and really only running it for 35

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.470 
clock and really only running it for 35
seconds<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:44.340> hasn't<00:02:44.700> really<00:02:44.880> changed<00:02:44.910> too

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
seconds and it hasn't really changed too

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.050 
seconds and it hasn't really changed too
much<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:46.290> know<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.590> what<00:02:46.770> we've<00:02:47.040> done<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.670> think

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
much you know of what we've done I think

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.490 
much you know of what we've done I think
the<00:02:48.210> difference<00:02:48.450> will<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:48.900> when<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.230> get<00:02:49.350> into

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
the difference will be when you get into

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.080 
the difference will be when you get into
a<00:02:49.590> game<00:02:49.830> situation<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.580> ball<00:02:50.760> goes<00:02:50.940> out<00:02:51.030> of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
a game situation the ball goes out of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.230 
a game situation the ball goes out of
bounds<00:02:51.210> we're<00:02:52.080> used<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.620> all<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.520> sudden<00:02:53.550> 25

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
bounds we're used to all of a sudden 25

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.920 
bounds we're used to all of a sudden 25
seconds<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:55.080> know<00:02:55.730> being<00:02:56.730> saved<00:02:57.120> by<00:02:57.570> you

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
seconds you know being saved by you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.750 
seconds you know being saved by you
being<00:02:58.230> out<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.470> bounds<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.250> know<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.490> soon<00:02:59.610> as

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
being out of bounds you know as soon as

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.700 
being out of bounds you know as soon as
the<00:02:59.880> ball<00:03:00.000> gets<00:03:00.210> spotted<00:03:00.480> an<00:03:01.110> hour<00:03:01.230> clock<00:03:01.440> gets

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
the ball gets spotted an hour clock gets

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
the ball gets spotted an hour clock gets
going<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.130> think<00:03:02.310> we're<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.580> see<00:03:02.640> a

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
going so I think we're going to see a

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.370 
going so I think we're going to see a
few<00:03:02.940> less<00:03:03.090> place

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.190 

you<00:03:09.220> know<00:03:09.310> someone<00:03:09.550> asked<00:03:09.970> earlier<00:03:10.420> today<00:03:10.720> if

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
you know someone asked earlier today if

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.960 
you know someone asked earlier today if
you<00:03:11.320> had<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.530> pick<00:03:11.710> one<00:03:11.770> guy<00:03:12.160> that's<00:03:12.430> jumped<00:03:12.850> up

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
you had to pick one guy that's jumped up

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.180 
you had to pick one guy that's jumped up
and<00:03:13.210> really<00:03:13.840> caught<00:03:14.050> your<00:03:14.230> attention<00:03:14.290> in<00:03:14.800> this

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
and really caught your attention in this

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.640 
and really caught your attention in this
camp<00:03:15.520> who<00:03:16.180> would<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.450> be<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:17.260> guy<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.470> would

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
camp who would it be and the guy I would

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.740 
camp who would it be and the guy I would
say<00:03:17.980> would<00:03:18.130> be<00:03:18.190> dane<00:03:18.490> sanzenbacher<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:19.480> mean

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
say would be dane sanzenbacher I mean

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.130 
say would be dane sanzenbacher I mean
Dana's<00:03:20.170> really<00:03:20.740> from<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:22.140> functional

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
Dana's really from a functional

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.950 
Dana's really from a functional
standpoint<00:03:23.440> technique-wise<00:03:24.780> studied<00:03:25.780> the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
standpoint technique-wise studied the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.230 
standpoint technique-wise studied the
game<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.590> mean<00:03:26.860> he's<00:03:27.070> no<00:03:27.310> longer<00:03:27.520> a<00:03:27.760> guy<00:03:27.940> trying

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
game I mean he's no longer a guy trying

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.520 
game I mean he's no longer a guy trying
to<00:03:28.300> learn<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.600> plays<00:03:28.810> he's<00:03:29.080> trying<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.380> learn

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
to learn the plays he's trying to learn

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.520 
to learn the plays he's trying to learn
you<00:03:30.100> know<00:03:30.190> how<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.340> beat<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.170> he's<00:03:32.170> jumped

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
you know how to beat you and he's jumped

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.910 
you know how to beat you and he's jumped
up<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:33.330> really<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.750> overall<00:03:35.290> learning<00:03:35.590> has

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
up and really the overall learning has

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.680 
up and really the overall learning has
been<00:03:36.130> pleasing<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.730> us<00:03:36.760> as<00:03:37.090> far<00:03:37.330> as<00:03:37.420> anything

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
been pleasing to us as far as anything

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.830 
been pleasing to us as far as anything
that<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.680> hasn't<00:03:39.130> been<00:03:39.690> something<00:03:40.690> we'd

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
that that hasn't been something we'd

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.570 
that that hasn't been something we'd
want<00:03:41.110> probably<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.800> only<00:03:41.920> thing<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.460> know

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
want probably the only thing is you know

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.400 
want probably the only thing is you know
we<00:03:42.700> had<00:03:43.090> some<00:03:43.300> guys<00:03:43.480> missed<00:03:43.780> some<00:03:43.930> time<00:03:44.170> with<00:03:44.380> a
