6,000<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.469> nice<00:01:37.710> little<00:01:37.890> addition<00:01:38.219> for

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
6,000 now was a nice little addition for

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.120 
6,000 now was a nice little addition for
us<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.359> see<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.859> when<00:01:40.859> we<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.100> out

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
us because we see that when we go out

8,000 it's only it's only like 8 pounds
but<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.659> feel<00:01:49.109> that<00:01:49.289> little<00:01:49.469> bit<00:01:49.679> of<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.859> weight

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
but you feel that little bit of a weight

but you feel that little bit of a weight
your<00:01:50.369> your<00:01:50.670> lower<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.210> horsepower<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.049> but

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
your your lower on horsepower but but

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.219 
your your lower on horsepower but but
actually<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.909> such<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> snappy<00:01:54.509> motor<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
actually it's such a snappy motor that

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.980 
actually it's such a snappy motor that
it's<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.850> talking<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> guys<00:01:57.659> like

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
it's you know talking to the guys like

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.560 
it's you know talking to the guys like
Rob<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.530> Dave<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.460> spend<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:00.359> their<00:02:00.509> time

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570

on<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.079> backcountry<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:02.219> know<00:02:02.340> they<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.700> do

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
on the backcountry you know they can do

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.660 
on the backcountry you know they can do
things<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> 600<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.979> they<00:02:05.429> didn't

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
things on that 600 that that they didn't

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.130 
things on that 600 that that they didn't
think<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:05.999> would<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.390> able<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:07.020> it

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
think they would be able to but it

out<00:03:00.439> there<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.680> little<00:03:00.829> bit<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.340> know<00:03:01.700> I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
out there a little bit you know I

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.220 
out there a little bit you know I
thought<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.060> our<00:03:02.359> rails<00:03:02.569> could<00:03:02.810> be<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:02.989> little

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
thought that our rails could be a little

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.750 
thought that our rails could be a little
stronger<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.799> I<00:03:03.829> made<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.159> guys<00:03:04.310> put<00:03:04.579> rail

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
stronger so I made the guys put rail

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.050 
stronger so I made the guys put rail
braces<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.359> all<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.569> small<00:03:05.750> pro<00:03:05.989> packages<00:03:06.590> so

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
braces and all the small pro packages so

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.490 
braces and all the small pro packages so
that's<00:03:08.060> one<00:03:08.299> thing<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.689> we<00:03:08.780> did<00:03:08.930> improve<00:03:09.260> to

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
that's one thing that we did improve to

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.199 
that's one thing that we did improve to
make<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.769> a<00:03:09.799> little<00:03:09.889> better<00:03:10.099> for<00:03:10.489> for<00:03:10.969> the<00:03:11.060> guys

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
make it a little better for for the guys

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.119 
make it a little better for for the guys

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
to go to the top so we made sure

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.300 
to go to the top so we made sure
everything<00:04:12.760> on<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.510> stop<00:04:13.810> with<00:04:14.019> a<00:04:14.049> line

with the sled as it's designed right now

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.050 
with the sled as it's designed right now
we<00:04:17.109> felt<00:04:17.470> that<00:04:17.590> we<00:04:17.919> could<00:04:17.949> give<00:04:18.430> up<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.760> little

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
we felt that we could give up a little

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.270 
we felt that we could give up a little
more<00:04:19.269> ski<00:04:19.599> stance<00:04:19.959> and<00:04:20.260> make<00:04:20.889> it<00:04:21.039> a<00:04:21.099> better

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
more ski stance and make it a better

we<00:04:25.599> went<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.840> 40<00:04:26.259> inches<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:27.039> as<00:04:27.220> well<00:04:27.460> so

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
we went to 40 inches on that as well so

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.580 
we went to 40 inches on that as well so
really<00:04:28.120> just<00:04:28.599> make<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.960> more<00:04:29.110> manageable

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590
