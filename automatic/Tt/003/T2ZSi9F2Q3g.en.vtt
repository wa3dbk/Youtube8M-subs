and let's get started with the

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.040 
and let's get started with the
transforming<00:01:08.550> brick<00:01:08.850> bravenwolf

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
transforming brick bravenwolf

so this is pretty cool this is what

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380 
so this is pretty cool this is what
excites<00:01:13.470> me<00:01:13.620> most<00:01:13.860> about<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.640> product<00:01:15.180> line

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390

and that is their little minifigures

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.590 
and that is their little minifigures
transform<00:01:19.140> into<00:01:20.040> 2<00:01:20.340> by<00:01:20.550> 4<00:01:20.910> bricks<00:01:21.300> that<00:01:21.540> are

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
transform into 2 by 4 bricks that are

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.680 
transform into 2 by 4 bricks that are
compatible<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.980> existing<00:01:23.450> building<00:01:24.450> block

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
compatible with existing building block

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.350 
compatible with existing building block
systems<00:01:25.230> and<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:26.010> you<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:27.150> building

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
systems and as you know I like building

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.190 
systems and as you know I like building
blocks<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.320> love<00:01:28.680> transformers<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.200> this

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
blocks and I love transformers so this

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200 
blocks and I love transformers so this
is<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.620> product<00:01:32.190> after<00:01:32.400> my<00:01:32.670> own<00:01:32.820> heart

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
is a product after my own heart

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080 
is a product after my own heart
so<00:01:33.780> let's<00:01:34.260> crack<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.740> open<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.310> how<00:01:35.940> they

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
so let's crack it open and see how they

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.090 
so let's crack it open and see how they
work<00:01:37.670> all<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:38.760> so<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.330> open<00:01:39.360> up

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
work all right so when you open up

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.400 
work all right so when you open up
bravenwolf<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:42.110> transforming<00:01:43.110> brick

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
bravenwolf here the transforming brick

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.010 
bravenwolf here the transforming brick
you<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.430> instructions<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.360> transforming

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you get instructions a transforming

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.280 
you get instructions a transforming
brick<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.830> accessories<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.940> cape<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.080> then

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
brick the accessories a cape and then

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.010 
brick the accessories a cape and then
you<00:01:49.410> get<00:01:49.620> these<00:01:50.100> four<00:01:50.460> extra<00:01:51.000> pieces<00:01:51.240> which<00:01:51.840> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you get these four extra pieces which I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.840 
you get these four extra pieces which I
guess<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.530> combine<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.280> other<00:01:53.610> things

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
guess you can combine with other things

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.300 
guess you can combine with other things
they<00:01:54.150> are<00:01:54.200> look<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.410> familiar<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.980> you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
they are look very familiar to you

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.350 
they are look very familiar to you
probably<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:59.000> looks<00:02:00.000> kind<00:02:00.330> of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
probably and then this looks kind of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.180 
probably and then this looks kind of
like<00:02:00.480> a<00:02:00.590> rifle<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.620> loozy<00:02:02.100> kind<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> weapon<00:02:03.300> so

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
like a rifle or loozy kind of weapon so

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.610 
like a rifle or loozy kind of weapon so
such<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.880> they<00:02:06.150> say<00:02:06.480> on<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> box<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.440> are

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
such the as they say on the box they are

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.130 
such the as they say on the box they are
correct<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.910> compatible<00:02:09.540> with<00:02:09.810> your

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
correct it is compatible with your

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.040 
correct it is compatible with your
existing<00:02:10.619> product<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.760> actually<00:02:12.570> very<00:02:12.810> good

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
existing product and actually very good

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.650 
existing product and actually very good
it's<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.320> very<00:02:13.500> tight<00:02:13.770> fit<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.970> side<00:02:15.300> because

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
it's a very tight fit this side because

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.120 
it's a very tight fit this side because
of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> transformation<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.739> can<00:02:16.770> hear<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
of the transformation you can hear the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.350 
of the transformation you can hear the
click<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.730> make<00:02:17.850> sure<00:02:17.970> everything

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
click you have to make sure everything

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.330 
click you have to make sure everything
is<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.540> position<00:02:18.720> properly<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:19.890> there<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.190> go

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
is in position properly but there you go

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.810 
is in position properly but there you go
it's<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:20.880> it's<00:02:21.390> compatible<00:02:21.810> indeed<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.760> you

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
it's it's it's compatible indeed so you

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.250 
it's it's it's compatible indeed so you
can<00:02:24.000> hear<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.239> click<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.989> pretty

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
can hear that click so it is pretty

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.400 
can hear that click so it is pretty
tight<00:02:25.560> compared<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.130> some<00:02:26.310> other<00:02:26.489> brands<00:02:26.940> so

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
tight compared to some other brands so

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.380 
tight compared to some other brands so

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
similar to the Cape which I already did

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.660 
similar to the Cape which I already did
with<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.360> there's<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.930> clear<00:04:03.370> plate<00:04:04.370> two<00:04:04.520> head

actually I think you clip it in the top
part<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:11.650> then<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:12.830> just<00:04:13.040> snap<00:04:13.250> everything

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610
