00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
that is something is worth like fifty

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.070 
that is something is worth like fifty
dollars<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.120> in<00:04:58.210> reality<00:04:58.419> i'm<00:04:58.720> like<00:04:58.840> i<00:04:58.930> would

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
dollars and in reality i'm like i would

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.510 
dollars and in reality i'm like i would
never<00:04:59.380> spend<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.860> much<00:05:00.039> for<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.340> but

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
never spend that much for that but

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.310 
never spend that much for that but
twelve<00:05:00.970> dollars<00:05:01.300> for<00:05:01.509> the<00:05:01.600> scarf<00:05:01.870> i<00:05:02.020> think<00:05:02.199> is

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
twelve dollars for the scarf i think is

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.950 
twelve dollars for the scarf i think is
reasonable<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:03.009> then<00:05:03.789> we<00:05:03.880> got<00:05:04.060> those<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.720> lot

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
reasonable and then we got those a lot

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.540 
reasonable and then we got those a lot
of<00:05:05.050> wadding<00:05:05.320> sheets<00:05:05.530> for<00:05:05.740> six<00:05:05.979> dollars<00:05:06.160> so

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
of wadding sheets for six dollars so

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.689 
of wadding sheets for six dollars so
we're<00:05:06.699> already<00:05:06.940> at<00:05:07.150> $18<00:05:07.930> those<00:05:08.560> nose<00:05:09.190> strips

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
we're already at $18 those nose strips

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.010 
we're already at $18 those nose strips
are<00:05:10.620> 525<00:05:11.620> so<00:05:11.889> that<00:05:12.009> brings<00:05:12.160> us<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.449> 23<00:05:13.449> 25<00:05:13.780> so

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
are 525 so that brings us to 23 25 so

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.540 
are 525 so that brings us to 23 25 so
those<00:05:14.169> three<00:05:14.289> products<00:05:14.650> alone<00:05:14.830> have<00:05:15.280> already

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
those three products alone have already

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.920 
those three products alone have already
paid<00:05:15.699> for<00:05:15.759> the<00:05:15.940> bag<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.300> then<00:05:16.449> we<00:05:16.539> have<00:05:16.720> a

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
paid for the bag and then we have a

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.600 
paid for the bag and then we have a
couple<00:05:17.470> more<00:05:17.590> things<00:05:17.650> in<00:05:17.949> here<00:05:18.130> as<00:05:18.220> well<00:05:18.400> so

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
couple more things in here as well so

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.260 
couple more things in here as well so
this<00:05:19.090> retails<00:05:19.539> for<00:05:20.310> 1350<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:21.699> that<00:05:21.849> brings<00:05:22.060> us

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
this retails for 1350 so that brings us

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.060 
this retails for 1350 so that brings us
to<00:05:22.300> 26<00:05:23.699> 2675<00:05:24.699> I<00:05:24.759> think<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:25.800> these<00:05:26.800> small

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
to 26 2675 I think and these small

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.430 
to 26 2675 I think and these small
really<00:05:27.729> clean<00:05:28.060> you<00:05:28.419> don't<00:05:28.990> get<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.139> whole<00:05:29.380> lot

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
really clean you don't get a whole lot

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.870 
really clean you don't get a whole lot
in<00:05:29.800> here<00:05:29.949> so<00:05:30.099> you<00:05:30.190> can<00:05:30.310> see<00:05:30.340> it's<00:05:30.550> not<00:05:30.729> like

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
in here so you can see it's not like

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.760 
in here so you can see it's not like
completely<00:05:31.360> full<00:05:31.780> but<00:05:31.810> let's<00:05:32.199> see<00:05:32.440> how<00:05:32.560> big

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
completely full but let's see how big

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.589 
completely full but let's see how big
these<00:05:32.949> are<00:05:33.099> these<00:05:33.580> are<00:05:33.639> just<00:05:34.060> supposed<00:05:34.360> to<00:05:34.449> be

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
these are these are just supposed to be

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.120 
these are these are just supposed to be
for<00:05:34.780> your<00:05:34.840> eyes<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.320> for<00:05:35.440> your<00:05:35.530> lips<00:05:35.710> so<00:05:35.949> it's

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
for your eyes and for your lips so it's

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.980 
for your eyes and for your lips so it's
not<00:05:36.280> meant<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:36.669> like<00:05:36.940> take<00:05:37.419> off<00:05:37.570> your<00:05:37.810> whole

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
not meant to like take off your whole

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.830 
not meant to like take off your whole
full<00:05:38.349> face<00:05:38.590> of<00:05:38.620> makeup<00:05:39.000> but<00:05:40.000> this<00:05:40.270> is<00:05:40.509> what<00:05:40.720> the

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
full face of makeup but this is what the

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.040 
full face of makeup but this is what the
little<00:05:41.080> pad<00:05:41.349> looks<00:05:41.770> like<00:05:42.039> it's<00:05:42.280> really<00:05:42.669> small

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
little pad looks like it's really small

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.180 
little pad looks like it's really small
there's<00:05:44.050> a<00:05:44.110> good<00:05:44.289> amount<00:05:44.440> of<00:05:44.620> product<00:05:44.979> in<00:05:45.070> here

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
there's a good amount of product in here

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.550 
there's a good amount of product in here
these<00:05:45.340> are<00:05:45.400> really<00:05:45.669> nicely<00:05:46.410> saturated<00:05:47.410> it's

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.020 
these are really nicely saturated it's
very<00:05:47.830> very<00:05:48.099> soft<00:05:48.370> so<00:05:48.550> I<00:05:48.610> think<00:05:48.669> it'll<00:05:48.970> be

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
very very soft so I think it'll be

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.600 
very very soft so I think it'll be
really<00:05:49.090> gentle<00:05:49.479> for<00:05:49.870> the<00:05:49.900> eye<00:05:50.099> and<00:05:51.099> lip<00:05:51.340> area

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
quickly into the skin I'm sure this is

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.520 
quickly into the skin I'm sure this is
going<00:07:12.370> to<00:07:12.490> feel<00:07:12.640> really<00:07:12.850> nice<00:07:13.420> under<00:07:14.200> my<00:07:14.350> eyes

going to feel really nice under my eyes

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.190 
going to feel really nice under my eyes
and<00:07:14.800> that<00:07:15.220> is<00:07:15.400> it<00:07:15.580> for<00:07:15.610> the<00:07:16.180> boutique<00:07:16.690> beauty

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.200

bag<00:07:17.350> number<00:07:17.800> three<00:07:18.250> again<00:07:18.430> it<00:07:18.760> is<00:07:18.910> $22<00:07:19.840> but<00:07:20.320> I

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.350 
bag number three again it is $22 but I

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.440 
bag number three again it is $22 but I
think<00:07:20.710> the<00:07:20.890> value<00:07:21.250> definitely<00:07:21.790> outweighs<00:07:22.180> the

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450 
think the value definitely outweighs the

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.080 
think the value definitely outweighs the
cost<00:07:22.650> you<00:07:23.650> can<00:07:23.800> see<00:07:23.980> they<00:07:24.250> were<00:07:24.310> all<00:07:24.580> full-size
