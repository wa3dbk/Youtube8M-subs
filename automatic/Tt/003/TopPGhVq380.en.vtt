00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880
 hi guys girls how are we because 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:11.190
 I know reality very well today and it is here 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.070
 to put your pencils your colors or what 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.570
 that you want and because he is very father is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 very possible to do so let's see 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.980
 how it is done and good to do our 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.800
 pencil holders are going to need sheets of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.529
 review scissors 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.079
 a tube of toilet paper a piece of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.840
 paper shell that is larger than 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.360
 base of our paper tube and a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.070
 pen or something with what brand and you 're also going 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.510
 to need glue 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.960
 and we're going to start cutting out a lot 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.000
 leaves in our magazine and we're going to 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.060
 cut for example 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.770
 for example I have this sheet I 'm going 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.850
 to cut in half and I'm just going to use 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.850
 one half ok 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.700
 it does not have to be the same size as 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.160
 our paper tube since in the end what 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.470
 let's be able to cut back we're going to 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.570
 start to roll up so the next thing 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.900
 it's going to start rolling from here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.900
 until the end 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.870
 once we are going to finish this we are going 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.000
 to take our glue and let's 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.850
 put on the edge a little bit there's no 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 to put so much because then we are 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.500
 can then leave the glue 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.470
 and we close our roll 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.390
 and so let's do let's see 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.160
 enough rolls when we already have 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.340
 many rolls we're going to start 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.340
 stick them in our paper tube 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.270
 once they have finished putting all 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.500
 his tricks he has to do or something like that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.200
 remember, it's down, you do not have to 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.030
 excel not a little tube but above 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.160
 it does not matter because right now we're going to 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.800
 cut ok let's wait until it 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.980
 dry very well while going to 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.540
 drink 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.690
 the shell what we have to do is 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.840
 be a circle of the size that is a 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.940
 little bigger than the door down 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.920
 in our role eva remember that it is 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.720
 better to make it bigger than it has 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.030
 to be so that the end nothing more 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.510
 we cut it out and nothing happens and we're going to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.540
 cut out our circle 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.939
 once this is dry we will 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.489
 remember all the leftovers ok as 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:33.440
 make it possible to put the scissors and cut 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:37.040
 What I did was remove a tube 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.840
 and trim all excess efe 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.239
 and good once we have trimmed 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.989
 our leftovers we will stick with 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.480
 resisted our capita and a tree if 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.760
