00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Look at the terror eike the expectation was 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.810
 great 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.090
 only when it arrived not by the lines of the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.110
 that in the hatch version are not 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:18.960
 reference on the other hand does not displease 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:21.119
 but when you open the door and enter it is a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.070
 simplicity both in finishing and in 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.560
 design that surprises 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.330
 to start the panel is composed of three 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.699
 different plastics 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.679
 liu zhenmin very simple and the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.410
 core instruments are difficult to 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.350
 view to see a level of 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.750
 then you need to have a magnifying glass 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.860
 and even this xls like this one 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.899
 sophisticated 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.629
 does not come with several common 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.090
 other brands 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.670
 the doors for example do not lock 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.129
 automatically when the car goes the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.309
 seat belts have no adjustment 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.710
 tall and hindus electric windows have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.290
 One Touch Drive System 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.070
 When the ignition is switched off, the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.200
 lit and did not hear sound 53 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.220
 points and head support for those who sit 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 in the middle nor an optional screws of the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.479
 consoles and door handles are 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.240
 shows loudspeakers only in front 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.000
 if you think it 's made by toyota 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.220
 same brand that produces the corolla does not 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.950
 enthusiasm at least tries to redeem itself 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.770
 in some points they have a sophisticated 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.200
 pantographic windshield wiper or 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.000
 despite the bare feeling is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.670
 made with good materials 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.310
 the space thanks to the low central tunnel 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.729
 allows three adults to sit behind 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.130
 with comfort and the trunk of 270 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.899
 liters of capacity is on the average of 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.530
 compact reds 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.840
 the mechanics pleases if it were not for the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.740
 noisy start the set win and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.189
 note 10 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.869
 the 1.5 engine is not one of the most powerful 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.000
 had four and a half horses with ethanol 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.229
 but the torque is equal with both 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.899
 fuels 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.140
 how good already at low revs the Etios 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.880
 accelerate fast 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.459
 requires so much gear change in the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.080
 another reason for good performance 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.080
 it's the low weight 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.260
 this version xls is the heaviest 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.690
 only 900 and 65 kilos 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.150
 a detail that does not only benefit the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.330
 performance but also and especially the 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.480
 consumption, the highlight of the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.530
 good 7.8 kilometers per liter of ethanol 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.400
 and 11.2 kilometers per liter of gasoline 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.489
 that is despite having 1.5 engine of this 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.209
 uncommon compact with 1.0 engine 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.980
 another legal detail is stability at 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.950
 suspension with torsion axle at the rear 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.800
 It allows the curves make a good Etios 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.690
 and has a comfortable ride just not 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.120
 can prevent the interior from 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.220
 noise that bothers when passing floors 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.100
 because of the excess of 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.830
 Future Plastic Coating Brakes 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.410
 abs are efficient and the steering 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.570
 Electrical is accurate but the regulation 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.180
 depth of the steering wheel is 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.700
 the driver's seat only move away 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.380
 say that the eyes do not see the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.049
 Heart does not feel 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.820
 This is the case of the ETHI that needs to 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.820
 much what we see 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.209
 It could be but kept the same for 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.400
 inside right 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.129
 but let's go to our domains performance 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.579
 8 in consumption received a good grade 9 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:48.519
 8 and stability also eight 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.579
 finishing 6 inner space 8 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.269
 trunk 7 cost-effective 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.480
 7 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.209
 the toyota etios cheaper is the 1.3 that 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.959
 costs thirty thousand five hundred and ninety reais 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:06.129
 xls version 1.5 ethical but what we are is 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.819
 the most expensive and costs 43,590 or more 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.069
 Details 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.969
 then enter there on our site brum dot 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.949
 com tv bar march arrived and this 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.969
 means that the Geneva 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.799
 next 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:21.509
 this year the factories are preparing 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.509
 to announce amazing models 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.190
 as usual geneva is synonymous with 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.740
 luxury and exclusivity 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.080
 seventy-seven brands from around the world 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.020
 will be in Switzerland showing what they have to 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.730
 best in an area of five thousand and four hundred 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.490
 square meters 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.950
 more than 100 innovations are expected in 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.800
 ten days of the most important event 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.200
 it still does and does not appear for 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.930
 complete but have already been confirmed 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.390
 new super ferrari the Russian more more 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.330
 of all time and a new 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.060
 mclaren p11 of course we'll be 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.400
 there and next week we will show you all 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.770
 news mainly those that 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.460
 Are you interested in Brazil here? 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.460
 stay tuned
