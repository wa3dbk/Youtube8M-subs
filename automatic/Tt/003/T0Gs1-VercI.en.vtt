00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.770 
I'm a bad parent you know I can't blame
them<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.610> have<00:01:49.730> to<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:50.300> know<00:01:50.360> when<00:01:50.480> a<00:01:50.510> kid<00:01:50.750> is

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
them you have to you know when a kid is

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.360 
them you have to you know when a kid is
bad<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.500> always<00:01:51.770> have<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.010> look<00:01:52.130> at<00:01:52.250> the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
bad you always have to look at the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.670 
bad you always have to look at the
parent<00:01:52.790> it's<00:01:52.909> not<00:01:53.030> necessarily<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.510> kid<00:01:53.750> so

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
parent it's not necessarily the kid so

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.410 
parent it's not necessarily the kid so
now<00:01:54.950> I'm<00:01:55.250> looking<00:01:55.640> at<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.850> man<00:01:56.030> in<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.240> mirror

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
now I'm looking at the man in the mirror

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420 
now I'm looking at the man in the mirror
and<00:01:56.750> I'm<00:01:56.960> thinking<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:57.530> felt<00:01:57.890> somewhere

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
and I'm thinking that I felt somewhere

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.820 
and I'm thinking that I felt somewhere
along<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.760> line<00:01:58.909> because<00:01:59.390> it<00:02:00.380> doesn't<00:02:00.770> make

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
along the line because it doesn't make

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.990 
along the line because it doesn't make
sense<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.130> they're<00:02:01.340> still<00:02:01.550> not<00:02:01.729> potty

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
sense that they're still not potty

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.200 
sense that they're still not potty
trained<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:02.750> there<00:02:03.680> about<00:02:03.950> six<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.060> the
