see an entirely different story line

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.010 
see an entirely different story line
that<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.370> actually<00:00:35.670> haven't<00:00:35.820> seen<00:00:36.090> before<00:00:36.480> but

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that we actually haven't seen before but

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.060 
that we actually haven't seen before but
we're<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> wait<00:00:37.710> until<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
we're going to have to wait until the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.549 
we're going to have to wait until the
actual<00:00:38.219> map<00:00:38.489> comes<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.149> find<00:00:39.359> out<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.499> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
actual map comes out to find out so the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.380 
actual map comes out to find out so the
next<00:00:40.620> picture<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.429> the<00:00:41.550> actual<00:00:41.699> cell<00:00:42.120> block

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
next picture is of the actual cell block

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.090 
next picture is of the actual cell block
in<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> prison<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.379> see<00:00:43.559> cells<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
in the prison so we can see cells on the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.009 
in the prison so we can see cells on the
left<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.609> right<00:00:44.699> and<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.600> believe<00:00:45.659> the

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
left and the right and I believe the

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.299 
left and the right and I believe the
zombies<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.589> come<00:00:46.769> out<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
zombies are going to come out of the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.399 
zombies are going to come out of the
actual<00:00:47.579> cells<00:00:47.909> which<00:00:48.420> will<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.659> pretty<00:00:48.870> epic<00:00:48.960> i

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
actual cells which will be pretty epic i

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:50.809 
actual cells which will be pretty epic i
believe<00:00:49.649> they<00:00:49.800> meant<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.100> inmates<00:00:50.609> of<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:50.819 
believe they meant to be inmates of the

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:52.849 
believe they meant to be inmates of the
actual<00:00:51.210> Jail<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.690> that'll<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.260> pretty<00:00:52.440> cool<00:00:52.710> we

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
actual Jail so that'll be pretty cool we

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:54.979 
actual Jail so that'll be pretty cool we
can<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.190> some<00:00:53.399> rafters<00:00:53.850> above<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:54.420> platforms

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
can see some rafters above and platforms

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.689 
can see some rafters above and platforms
which<00:00:55.379> may<00:00:55.589> mean<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.100> run<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.609> down

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
which may mean we can run up and down

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.799 
which may mean we can run up and down
and<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.149> building's<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.690> have

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.930 
and the building's going to have
multiple<00:00:58.109> platforms<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.069> so<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
multiple platforms in it so on to the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.549 
multiple platforms in it so on to the
next<00:01:00.089> picture<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.479> guys<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.199> two

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
windows I'm not sure what it's actually

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.469 
windows I'm not sure what it's actually
going<00:01:26.219> to<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:26.789> most<00:01:27.060> likely<00:01:27.210> going

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
going to be but it's most likely going

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.270 
going to be but it's most likely going
to<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.719> the<00:01:27.930> mystery<00:01:28.170> box<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.829> guys<00:01:29.039> can<00:01:29.250> see

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to be the mystery box you guys can see

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.889 
to be the mystery box you guys can see
the<00:01:29.520> full<00:01:29.729> map<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.149> this<00:01:30.270> picture<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.780> it's

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
the full map in this picture so it's

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.080 
the full map in this picture so it's
pretty<00:01:31.140> helpful<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.549> guys<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.939> see

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
pretty helpful and you guys can see

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.240 
pretty helpful and you guys can see
there's<00:01:33.329> two<00:01:33.570> main<00:01:34.110> buildings<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.890> then

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
there's two main buildings and then

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
there's two main buildings and then
we've<00:01:35.430> got<00:01:35.460> some<00:01:36.270> sort<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.810> building

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we've got some sort of little building

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.170 
we've got some sort of little building
here<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:38.039> water<00:01:38.310> towels<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> little

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
here with water towels and a little

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.819 
here with water towels and a little
house<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.469> a<00:01:40.500> pretty

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
house here so it's going to be a pretty

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.190 
house here so it's going to be a pretty
big<00:01:41.100> map<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.490> can't<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:42.060> any<00:01:42.210> easy<00:01:42.390> ways<00:01:42.719> up<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
big map I can't see any easy ways up to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
big map I can't see any easy ways up to
the<00:01:43.320> big<00:01:43.500> prison<00:01:43.799> where<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.189> actual<00:01:44.310> box<00:01:44.640> is

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the big prison where the actual box is

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.550 
the big prison where the actual box is
so<00:01:45.539> most<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.049> actually<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> be

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so most of it's actually going to be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.289 
so most of it's actually going to be
probably<00:01:46.890> underground<00:01:47.549> which<00:01:48.060> will<00:01:48.210> be

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
probably underground which will be

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.550 
probably underground which will be
pretty<00:01:48.539> epic<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.020> we're<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.469> have

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
pretty epic but we're just going to have

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.230 
pretty epic but we're just going to have
to<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.890> until<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> actual<00:01:50.369> map<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.820> released

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
to see until the actual map is released

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.149 
to see until the actual map is released
so<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:51.929> can<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.409> clip<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.859> actual

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
so we can see in this clip the actual

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.160 
so we can see in this clip the actual
riot<00:01:53.429> shield<00:01:53.789> is<00:01:54.030> back<00:01:54.329> which<00:01:54.570> may<00:01:54.750> mean<00:01:54.990> we

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
riot shield is back which may mean we

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
riot shield is back which may mean we
can<00:01:55.320> build<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.770> by<00:01:55.859> buildable<00:01:56.520> or<00:01:56.880> maybe<00:01:57.240> we

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
can build it by buildable or maybe we

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.760 
can build it by buildable or maybe we
might<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.750> able<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.929> buy<00:01:58.079> from<00:01:58.320> some<00:01:58.530> other

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
might be able to buy from some other

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.840 
might be able to buy from some other
source<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.189> we're<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.700> wait

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
source but we're going to have to wait

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.219 
source but we're going to have to wait
it<00:01:59.969> out<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.390> how<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.750> actually<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.109> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it out to see how it's actually going to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.050 
it out to see how it's actually going to
work<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.859> we<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.159> clearly<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.759> actual

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
work but we can clearly see the actual

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.489 
work but we can clearly see the actual
rice<00:02:03.420> shield<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> middle<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> screen

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
rice shield in the middle of the screen

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.499 
rice shield in the middle of the screen
so<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.520> next<00:02:05.700> picture<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.119> guys<00:02:06.299> can

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
so on to the next picture you guys can

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.060 
so on to the next picture you guys can
see<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.899> actually<00:02:06.929> have<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.439> new<00:02:07.649> weapon

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
see that we actually have a new weapon

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.950 
see that we actually have a new weapon
it<00:02:08.190> looks<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.520> thompson<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:09.570> a<00:02:09.600> round

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
it looks like a thompson with a round

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.480 
it looks like a thompson with a round
clip<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:10.710> that's<00:02:10.860> going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.070> be<00:02:11.160> pretty<00:02:11.340> epic

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
clip so that's going to be pretty epic

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.730 
clip so that's going to be pretty epic
i'm<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.210> enjoy<00:02:12.510> using<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.930> weapon<00:02:13.350> so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
i'm going to enjoy using that weapon so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.619 
i'm going to enjoy using that weapon so
on<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.069> next<00:02:14.250> one<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.879> see<00:02:15.090> that

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
on to the next one we can see that

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.449 
on to the next one we can see that
there's<00:02:15.870> four<00:02:16.170> new<00:02:16.530> characters<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.310> looks

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
there's four new characters and it looks

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.430 
there's four new characters and it looks
like<00:02:17.640> there's<00:02:17.849> some<00:02:18.030> cool<00:02:18.510> cinematic

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
like there's some cool cinematic

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
like there's some cool cinematic
so<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.590> looks<00:02:19.620> like<00:02:19.770> they<00:02:19.950> put<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.160> lot<00:02:20.430> of

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
so it looks like they put a lot of

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.490 
so it looks like they put a lot of
effort<00:02:20.910> into<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.210> actual<00:02:21.420> cinematic<00:02:22.050> it's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
effort into the actual cinematic it's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.050 
effort into the actual cinematic it's
going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.740> be<00:02:22.830> an<00:02:22.980> actual<00:02:23.220> proper<00:02:23.610> one<00:02:23.760> instead

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
going to be an actual proper one instead

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.790 
going to be an actual proper one instead
of<00:02:24.180> some<00:02:24.390> sort<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.630> cartoon<00:02:25.080> one<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.740> I'm

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
of some sort of cartoon one so I'm

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.010 
of some sort of cartoon one so I'm
looking<00:02:25.920> forward<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.490> seeing<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.020> so

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
looking forward to seeing that so

looking forward to seeing that so
there's<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.260> few<00:02:28.470> things<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.830> actually<00:02:29.250> saw<00:02:29.670> in

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940

but now we have it in more of the Dead
which<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:37.830> going<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.070> be<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:38.370> good<00:02:38.520> because

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700
