we've<00:00:06.180> completed<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.990> first<00:00:07.290> design<00:00:07.770> as<00:00:08.130> you

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
we've completed the first design as you

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.629 
we've completed the first design as you
saw<00:00:08.820> last<00:00:08.849> update<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.070> this<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.219> kind<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.490> what

saw last update and this is kind of what

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.470 
saw last update and this is kind of what
it<00:00:11.730> looks<00:00:11.940> like<00:00:12.179> we're<00:00:12.480> using<00:00:12.690> 4<00:00:13.320> x<00:00:13.620> 6<00:00:13.650> x<00:00:14.480> 36

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
it looks like we're using 4 x 6 x 36

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
into the 55-gallon barrel we've got a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.279 
into the 55-gallon barrel we've got a
couple<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.609> air<00:00:24.210> jets<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.930> threw<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
couple of air jets that we threw in the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.779 
couple of air jets that we threw in the
bottom<00:00:25.590> there<00:00:25.710> not<00:00:25.890> sure<00:00:26.160> if<00:00:26.279> they're<00:00:26.460> helping

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
bottom there not sure if they're helping

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.240 
bottom there not sure if they're helping
or<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.470> seemed<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.680> good<00:00:28.710> idea<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
or not but seemed like good idea at the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.110 
or not but seemed like good idea at the
time<00:00:29.510> then<00:00:30.510> we<00:00:30.720> fitted<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.230> J<00:00:31.619> tube<00:00:31.949> into<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
time then we fitted that J tube into the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.180 
time then we fitted that J tube into the
55-gallon<00:00:33.870> barrel<00:00:34.710> that's<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.040> you're

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
55-gallon barrel that's what you're

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.270 
55-gallon barrel that's what you're
seeing<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.820> being<00:00:36.059> fit<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.129> on<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
seeing here that being fit in and on the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.940 
seeing here that being fit in and on the
outside<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> input<00:00:39.450> port<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.680> would

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
outside is the input port for they would

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.450 
outside is the input port for they would
and<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> inside<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> internal<00:00:42.780> stack

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
and on the inside is the internal stack

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.110 
and on the inside is the internal stack
that<00:00:44.460> heats<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.940> engine<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:47.370> air<00:00:47.579> comes<00:00:47.910> in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that heats the engine the air comes in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.709 
that heats the engine the air comes in
that<00:00:48.360> front<00:00:49.140> port<00:00:49.590> goes<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.030> stack<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that front port goes up that stack and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.319 
that front port goes up that stack and
then<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> released<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.280> barrel<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> heat

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
then is released into the barrel to heat

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.150 
then is released into the barrel to heat
the<00:00:54.480> engine<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> goes<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> exhaust

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the engine and goes out the exhaust

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.779 
the engine and goes out the exhaust
stack<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.420> back<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> engine<00:00:58.789> we've

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
stack in the back of the engine we've

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
stack in the back of the engine we've
got<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> couple<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.539> slides<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.289> will

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
got a couple of slides here that will

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.840 
got a couple of slides here that will
show<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> burning<00:01:02.340> taking

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
show you some of the burning taking

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.990 
show you some of the burning taking
place<00:01:03.530> here<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.129> flames<00:01:05.519> coming

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
place here you can see the flames coming

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.969 
place here you can see the flames coming
through<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> j<00:01:06.570> tube<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.049> actual<00:01:07.439> fire<00:01:07.740> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
through the j tube the actual fire is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.820 
through the j tube the actual fire is
originated<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.869> input<00:01:09.869> port<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
originated on the input port not on the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.039 
originated on the input port not on the
the<00:01:13.830> internal<00:01:14.400> stack<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> flames<00:01:15.840> then

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the internal stack and the flames then

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.719 
the internal stack and the flames then
go<00:01:16.259> sideways<00:01:16.560> towards<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.820> internal<00:01:18.299> stack

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
go sideways towards that internal stack

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.630 
go sideways towards that internal stack
here's<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.090> picture<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> size<00:01:21.930> and
