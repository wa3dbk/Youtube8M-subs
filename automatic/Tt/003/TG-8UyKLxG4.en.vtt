have to worry about the paracord

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.829 
have to worry about the paracord
slipping<00:00:57.039> through<00:00:57.219> now<00:00:58.059> what<00:00:58.210> I<00:00:58.269> do<00:00:58.389> have<00:00:58.690> to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
slipping through now what I do have to

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.529 
slipping through now what I do have to
worry<00:00:58.989> about<00:00:59.109> is<00:00:59.469> the<00:00:59.739> hanger<00:01:00.299> coming<00:01:01.299> through

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
worry about is the hanger coming through

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.239 
worry about is the hanger coming through
the<00:01:01.690> pair<00:01:01.899> coming<00:01:02.440> out<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.679> back<00:01:02.829> side<00:01:03.039> of<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.310 
the pair coming out the back side of the
paracord<00:01:03.609> but<00:01:04.299> as<00:01:04.390> long<00:01:04.540> as<00:01:04.600> you<00:01:04.750> keep<00:01:04.900> forward

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
paracord but as long as you keep forward

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.160 
paracord but as long as you keep forward
pressure<00:01:05.590> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:07.270> paracord<00:01:07.750> or<00:01:07.990> on<00:01:08.080> the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
pressure on the paracord or on the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.899 
pressure on the paracord or on the
hanger<00:01:08.470> then<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.250> don't<00:01:09.399> really<00:01:09.520> have<00:01:09.759> to

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
hanger then you don't really have to

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.149 
hanger then you don't really have to
worry<00:01:10.090> about<00:01:10.180> it<00:01:10.479> coming<00:01:10.600> off<00:01:10.810> there<00:01:11.079> but<00:01:12.039> this

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
worry about it coming off there but this

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.830 
worry about it coming off there but this
is<00:01:12.219> real<00:01:12.460> simple<00:01:12.759> just<00:01:13.119> go<00:01:13.270> through<00:01:13.479> through

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
is real simple just go through through

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.010 
is real simple just go through through
the<00:01:13.869> hole<00:01:14.110> there<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.390> then<00:01:16.780> you're<00:01:16.930> just

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
the hole there and then you're just

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.800 
the hole there and then you're just
gonna<00:01:17.200> basically<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:19.240> long<00:01:19.299> as<00:01:19.539> you<00:01:19.659> keep

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
gonna basically as long as you keep

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.120 
gonna basically as long as you keep
pressure<00:01:20.109> on<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.469> pair<00:01:20.649> cord<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.070> that

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
pressure on the pair cord so that

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.849 
pressure on the pair cord so that
doesn't<00:01:21.340> come<00:01:21.609> off<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.880> hanger<00:01:22.210> you<00:01:22.859> should

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
doesn't come off the hanger you should

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:29.630 
doesn't come off the hanger you should
be<00:01:23.979> able<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.159> get<00:01:24.310> this<00:01:24.460> all<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.670> way<00:01:24.880> through

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.700 

and<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.729> can<00:01:30.909> bend<00:01:31.149> this<00:01:31.329> as<00:01:31.570> you<00:01:31.689> go<00:01:31.869> just<00:01:32.590> so

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
and you can bend this as you go just so

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:44.660 
and you can bend this as you go just so
that<00:01:32.829> it<00:01:32.979> makes<00:01:33.159> its<00:01:33.340> way<00:01:33.429> around<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.850> loop

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.490 

not<00:01:45.360> too<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:45.660> of<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.900> bend<00:01:46.080> in<00:01:46.200> there<00:01:46.350> though

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
not too much of a bend in there though

00:01:46.500 --> 00:02:04.380 
not too much of a bend in there though
so<00:01:50.780> we're<00:01:51.780> about<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.260> now

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.760 

first<00:02:05.390> time<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:05.660> did<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.840> was<00:02:06.020> pretty<00:02:06.260> simple<00:02:06.680> to

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
first time I did it was pretty simple to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.650 
first time I did it was pretty simple to
do<00:02:06.920> now<00:02:07.610> it's<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:07.880> wanting<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.149> struggle<00:02:08.540> with

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
do now it's a wanting to struggle with

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:19.479 
do now it's a wanting to struggle with
me<00:02:09.369> there<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:14.770> I'm<00:02:15.770> just<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:16.100> to

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.910 

slide<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.359> through<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.840> doing<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.739> this<00:02:21.859> way

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
slide it through and doing it this way

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.470 
slide it through and doing it this way
you<00:02:22.069> can<00:02:22.340> also<00:02:22.459> keep<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.939> pressure<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.329> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
you can also keep the pressure on the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.390 
you can also keep the pressure on the
paracord<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.019> can<00:02:24.170> feel<00:02:24.379> I<00:02:24.680> can<00:02:24.769> feel<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.250> end

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
paracord I can feel I can feel the end

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.729 
paracord I can feel I can feel the end
of<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.579> paracord<00:02:25.969> and<00:02:26.260> you're<00:02:27.260> just<00:02:27.379> you're

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
of the paracord and you're just you're

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.580 
of the paracord and you're just you're
basically<00:02:28.069> just<00:02:28.129> pushing<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.760> through<00:02:29.590> until

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
basically just pushing it through until

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.140 
basically just pushing it through until
you<00:02:30.650> get<00:02:30.799> to<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> end<00:02:31.159> there<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.670> there<00:02:31.939> it<00:02:32.030> is

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
you get to the end there and there it is

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.319 
you get to the end there and there it is
that<00:02:32.480> comes<00:02:32.689> out<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.989> other<00:02:33.079> end<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:35.269> can

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
that comes out the other end you can

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.099 
that comes out the other end you can
take<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:37.120> paracord<00:02:38.120> off<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:38.510> hanger<00:02:38.870> at<00:02:38.959> this

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
take the paracord off the hanger at this

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.920 
take the paracord off the hanger at this
point<00:02:39.439> and<00:02:39.920> pull<00:02:40.099> your<00:02:40.250> paracord<00:02:40.639> through<00:02:40.939> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
point and pull your paracord through and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.599 
point and pull your paracord through and
then<00:02:42.139> retract<00:02:42.620> your<00:02:42.790> hanger<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.750> now<00:02:45.609> we've

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
then retract your hanger and now we've

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.190 
then retract your hanger and now we've
got<00:02:46.819> a<00:02:46.849> new<00:02:47.120> hoody<00:02:47.469> well<00:02:48.469> we<00:02:48.709> got<00:02:48.829> used<00:02:49.040> Tony

got a new hoody well we got used Tony

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.360 
got a new hoody well we got used Tony
this<00:02:51.459> light<00:02:52.459> here<00:02:52.849> there<00:02:53.269> we<00:02:53.359> go<00:02:53.859> alright<00:02:54.859> so

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
this light here there we go alright so

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.649 
this light here there we go alright so
now<00:02:55.549> I'm<00:02:55.730> going<00:02:55.879> to<00:02:55.939> show<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.120> how<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.359> do<00:02:56.540> the

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
now I'm going to show you how to do the

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.479 
now I'm going to show you how to do the
single<00:02:56.989> strand<00:02:57.260> knot<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.129> one<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.370> I've

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
single strand knot and the one that I've

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.149 
single strand knot and the one that I've
chosen<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:58.939> this<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.510> the<00:03:00.470> figure<00:03:00.859> 8<00:03:00.980> knot

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
chosen for this is the figure 8 knot

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.460 
chosen for this is the figure 8 knot
just<00:03:01.909> because<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:02.329> super<00:03:02.629> simple<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:03.019> do<00:03:03.230> and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
just because it's super simple to do and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.809 
just because it's super simple to do and
it<00:03:04.129> looks<00:03:04.159> good<00:03:04.639> and<00:03:04.969> it<00:03:05.090> will<00:03:05.209> hold<00:03:05.389> up<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:06.819> any

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
it looks good and it will hold up to any

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.629 
it looks good and it will hold up to any
of<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.180> tugging<00:03:08.569> that<00:03:08.719> you've<00:03:08.810> got<00:03:09.639> so

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
of the tugging that you've got so

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.470 
of the tugging that you've got so
basically<00:03:11.329> create<00:03:11.719> a<00:03:11.750> loop<00:03:12.019> like<00:03:12.379> this<00:03:13.480> so

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
basically create a loop like this so

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.979 
basically create a loop like this so
you're<00:03:14.569> gonna<00:03:14.659> create<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.989> loop<00:03:15.609> go<00:03:16.609> around<00:03:17.000> the

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
you're gonna create a loop go around the

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.890 
you're gonna create a loop go around the
backside<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.469> the<00:03:18.919> of<00:03:19.219> the<00:03:19.310> strand<00:03:19.639> and<00:03:19.909> then

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
backside of the of the strand and then

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.460 
backside of the of the strand and then
just<00:03:21.139> go<00:03:21.230> down<00:03:21.439> through<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:21.889> loop<00:03:23.470> and

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
just go down through this loop and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.839 
just go down through this loop and
that's<00:03:24.709> what<00:03:24.949> you're<00:03:25.099> going<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.280> come<00:03:25.579> up<00:03:25.729> with

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
that's what you're going to come up with

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.830 
that's what you're going to come up with
and<00:03:28.849> then<00:03:29.000> just<00:03:29.269> go<00:03:29.359> ahead<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:29.659> pull<00:03:29.810> that

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
and then just go ahead and pull that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.740 
and then just go ahead and pull that
tight<00:03:30.169> now<00:03:30.409> make<00:03:30.590> sure<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:31.239> your<00:03:32.239> distance

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
tight now make sure that your distance

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.009 
tight now make sure that your distance
from<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.379> from<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:34.040> eyelet<00:03:34.669> here<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.629> far

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
from the from the eyelet here is far

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.390 
from the from the eyelet here is far
enough<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.530> where<00:03:36.590> you'll<00:03:36.769> have<00:03:36.919> enough<00:03:37.159> room

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
enough to where you'll have enough room

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.089 
enough to where you'll have enough room
to<00:03:37.430> tie<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:39.019> then<00:03:39.049> just<00:03:39.739> go<00:03:39.829> ahead<00:03:39.859> and

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
to tie it and then just go ahead and

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.280 
to tie it and then just go ahead and
pull<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.370> tight<00:03:40.609> and<00:03:41.090> that's<00:03:41.599> that's<00:03:42.139> what

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
pull this tight and that's that's what

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.469 
pull this tight and that's that's what
they<00:03:42.409> call<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.799> figure<00:03:43.099> 8<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.280> single<00:03:44.209> strand

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.479 
they call the figure 8 and single strand

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.860 
they call the figure 8 and single strand
that<00:03:45.639> just<00:03:46.639> go<00:03:46.879> ahead<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.209> tighten<00:03:47.419> this<00:03:47.659> up

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
that just go ahead and tighten this up

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.929 
that just go ahead and tighten this up
nice<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.139> tight<00:03:50.889> clip<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.069> end<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:52.609> below

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
nice and tight clip the end just below

00:03:52.939 --> 00:04:00.969 
nice and tight clip the end just below
the<00:03:53.180> knot<00:03:55.930> use<00:03:56.930> your<00:03:57.109> lighter<00:03:59.019> to<00:04:00.019> singe<00:04:00.799> the

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
the knot use your lighter to singe the

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:07.530 
the knot use your lighter to singe the
ends<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.579> doesn't<00:04:01.849> fray

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.420 

and<00:04:08.540> then<00:04:08.830> sometimes<00:04:09.830> just<00:04:10.040> because<00:04:10.310> I've

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
and then sometimes just because I've

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.100 
and then sometimes just because I've
lost<00:04:10.610> all<00:04:10.849> feeling<00:04:10.879> in<00:04:11.330> my<00:04:11.360> finger<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:11.900> thumb

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
lost all feeling in my finger and thumb

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.039 
lost all feeling in my finger and thumb
from<00:04:12.890> doing<00:04:13.190> this<00:04:13.420> I'll<00:04:14.420> just<00:04:14.450> kind<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:14.870> press

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
from doing this I'll just kind of press

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.330 
from doing this I'll just kind of press
that<00:04:15.230> all<00:04:15.379> together<00:04:15.530> just<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.280> don't

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
that all together just so that I don't

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.710 
that all together just so that I don't
have<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.639> worry<00:04:16.820> about<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.150> fraying<00:04:17.449> at<00:04:17.570> all

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
have to worry about it fraying at all

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.439 
have to worry about it fraying at all
and<00:04:18.010> make<00:04:19.010> sure<00:04:19.160> this<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.459> nice<00:04:19.669> and<00:04:19.940> tight<00:04:20.150> so

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
and make sure this is nice and tight so

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.409 
and make sure this is nice and tight so
that<00:04:20.720> doesn't<00:04:20.900> unravel<00:04:21.109> on<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:22.120> if<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.240> does

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
that doesn't unravel on you if it does

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.430 
that doesn't unravel on you if it does
unravel<00:04:23.930> on<00:04:24.050> you

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
unravel on you

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.330 
unravel on you
super<00:04:25.100> easy<00:04:25.160> not<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.729> tie<00:04:26.199> so<00:04:27.199> there's<00:04:27.410> one<00:04:27.680> I'm

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
super easy not to tie so there's one I'm

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.879 
super easy not to tie so there's one I'm
just<00:04:28.400> gonna<00:04:28.669> do<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.090> other<00:04:29.240> end<00:04:29.479> here

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
just gonna do it to the other end here

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.320 
just gonna do it to the other end here
I'm<00:04:30.889> gonna<00:04:30.979> try<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.280> do<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:31.669> as<00:04:31.790> close<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.180> this

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
I'm gonna try to do it as close to this

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.510 
I'm gonna try to do it as close to this
this<00:04:33.139> end<00:04:33.410> as<00:04:33.560> possible<00:04:34.100> because<00:04:34.250> it's

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
this end as possible because it's

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.140 
this end as possible because it's
already<00:04:35.290> it's<00:04:36.290> already<00:04:36.440> melted<00:04:36.770> all<00:04:37.699> right<00:04:37.910> so

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
already it's already melted all right so

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.920 
already it's already melted all right so
create<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.660> loop<00:04:39.070> like<00:04:40.070> so<00:04:40.449> cross<00:04:41.449> the<00:04:41.720> loop

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
create a loop like so cross the loop

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.250 
create a loop like so cross the loop
across<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:43.100> strand<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.490> should<00:04:43.639> say<00:04:43.820> go<00:04:44.810> behind

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
across the strand I should say go behind

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.300 
across the strand I should say go behind
the<00:04:46.130> strand<00:04:46.430> over<00:04:47.380> top<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.740> then<00:04:49.280> down

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
the strand over top and then down

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.779 
the strand over top and then down
through<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:52.400> super<00:04:52.820> super<00:04:53.000> easy<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:54.490> if<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.610> get

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
through so super super easy and if I get

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.460 
through so super super easy and if I get
it<00:04:55.880> close<00:04:56.090> enough<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.479> the<00:04:56.600> end<00:04:56.720> here<00:04:56.960> I<00:04:57.289> don't

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
it close enough to the end here I don't

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.010 
it close enough to the end here I don't
have<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.650> worry<00:04:57.800> about<00:04:57.830> cutting<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.370> end<00:04:59.020> and

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
have to worry about cutting the end and
