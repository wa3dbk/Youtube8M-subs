00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.630 
rushing toward us the United States I
don't<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.110> man<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.590> know<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.130> okay<00:01:50.610> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
don't know man I don't know that okay I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.859 
don't know man I don't know that okay I
think<00:01:50.909> they're<00:01:51.000> trying<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.299> kill<00:01:51.509> us<00:01:51.570> man

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
think they're trying to kill us man

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.859 
think they're trying to kill us man

luckily relief is in sight for parts but
not<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> country<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.810> very
