00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.910
 helping people get rid of fears 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.180
 anxious states of insecurity 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.480
 I remove internal barriers to 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550
 big money and in this video I want 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.150
 tell about one mistake which 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.539
 admits 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.080
 90 percent of people who want a lot 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.210
 money people who do not want to have money 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.260
 more than they have now very much and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.550
 very few they are but few 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 if you watch this video then rather 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.920
 total topic of financial stability you 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.840
 interesting and you would not give up 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.570
 to the amount of money in your life 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.360
 increased several times i 'm sure a 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 also what do you know about how much 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:01.649
 want to get money a month a year in 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.739
 life but if i ask you now 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.590
 why do you need this money or what exactly 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.540
 you need money then many of you those 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.939
 who watches this video this question 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.280
 stumped 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.100
 I am sure that it will be so because 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.420
 when I ask this question to my clients 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.759
 in coaching I ask this question also on 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.509
 my training and seminars I always 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.180
 always see confusion yes we all 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.409
 want a lot of money but only a small part 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.770
 of us know why they want it 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.820
 why is it important why is it important to know 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.310
 why do you need money but the fact is 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 money has one specific quality 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.460
 they come to who knows what he is 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.950
 spend them to who knows how much 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.790
 specifically he needs money and for what 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.640
 specifically, you probably noticed that when 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.159
 just want to get some 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.000
 a tidy sum usually when you ask 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.869
 people say well I want 10,000 I want 50,000 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.050
 I want 100 thousand someone says a million 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.860
 usually 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.520
 money comes before 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.340
 this is less and the most interesting thing is money 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.370
 always comes exactly as much as 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.120
 you really need at the moment 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.190
 for example, you really wanted a new one 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.870
 washing machine and unexpectedly through 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.690
 a few days after you started 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.880
 think about it or a week money for her 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.110
 appeared 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.730
 You really want to buy a new car and 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.270
 after a few months you appear 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.680
 the right amount to buy it or you 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.290
 really want to fly somewhere 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.540
 relax and in a few days you 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.330
 the necessary amount of money appears 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.680
 just that much as you need 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:00.910
 but this is a real event 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.180
 paradox randomness devilry no this 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.940
 laws of money about which not even 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.989
 guess 90 percent of people are one 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.730
 case the simple law of money works on 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.720
 true desire is money always 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.269
 all appear and if you something 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.489
 really want money to appear and 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.489
 totally unexpected places 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.850
 from where you're from them never 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.070
 waited to get well how can you 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.560
 use this law in their own 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.239
 interest 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.819
 I now offer you to do 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.370
 simple exercise 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.019
 and it is called a pull list 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.829
 money 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.079
 what do you need for that calm 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.689
 a place where no one bothers you 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.780
 for 15-20 minutes if you are long 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:58.060
 think it means half an hour take clean 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.579
 a sheet of paper and a pen and your hand on 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.129
 write this sheet of paper with this pen 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:07.450
 I need money for 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:10.959
 and then write a list of all that 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.469
 you need and feel free to add to your list 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:17.500
 all that your soul wishes all that you 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:21.630
 find it important to machine and 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.979
 apartment decoration 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.259
 travel and travel 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:31.660
 all you want to hold yourself 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:34.270
 shackle your desires for this list 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.389
 highly undesirable even if you 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.690
 absolutely do not believe you can do it all 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.900
 get anyway write everybody everything 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.590
 what you want is not something you can get 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.650
 and what you want write a list 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.470
 without limitation without thinking from where at all 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.210
 it will be money 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.599
 write it next to each item 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.940
 value in the currency convenient for you and 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.729
 the result of your actions you have 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.570
 get a wish list with specified 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.490
 worth at the end you can 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.310
 sum up for clarity and so 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:17.949
 you will understand how much money you really 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:20.860
 need and this is all this exercise need 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:24.039
 do 2-3 times a week for 15 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.080
 minutes and your unconscious will start 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:30.969
 look for you money itself 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:34.449
 and be sure to find them every time 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.960
 you urgently need a large amount 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.259
 of money 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:42.070
 sit down and write your list every time 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:45.159
 do not re- list the one that you already have 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.000
 I had looked up a piece of paper and copied 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.920
 no, sit down and write again 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.590
 and you will also notice that the list 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.800
 so simple is beginning to change 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.380
 exercise is such a small technique 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.690
 which I use for a long time and now 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.790
 All my clients already use everything 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.010
