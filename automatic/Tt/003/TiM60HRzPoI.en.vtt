00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.620
 from the next show we'll get to a giant photo right away it shows that 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.960
 largest in the world and shows 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.059
 a panoramic view of Dresden consisting of 1000 600 single people 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.570
 so far, the Americans held the pixel record but now have the Dresdner 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.019
 broken only drawback 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.669
 the photo is so big that it could not be printed 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.539
 Wieger pixel density ITB is currently the hottest addresses under the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.130
 Funkturm professionals 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.250
 because this page shows the currently largest photo in the world 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.660
 a panorama view over Dresden the size what unimaginable compare 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.390
 can one approximate the size 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.520
 meyer-wÃ¶lden normal human has basically no digital camera in 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.540
 the pocket 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.760
 and the ideal about 3500 photos with this old digital camera 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.790
 which would be placed next to each other on this size of this image 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.400
 come 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.440
 Percent printed per parish to mature would give about one hundred 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.480
 five times 35 meters so much as in soccer much too big 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.680
 The photo was taken on the roof of the press house in Dresden 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.460
 a camera is mounted on a tripod and over a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.960
 computer-aided engine, the individual images are shot 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.510
 that takes hours 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.800
 If I'm honest, I must confess that I've been doing stovepipe twice 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.870
 At the first ad I miscalculated a bit in the planning fire 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.850
 Percent I was trying to correct the mistake Rome 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.560
 Baumbauer has taken too long the end of the week should now by the municipalities 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380
 accused 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.450
 Never before has such a picture been taken with such a large amount of data 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.790
 processed 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 the challenge but Aben human and computer 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.040
 Of course we want to explore our technical possibilities 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.960
 one to the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.110
 high-resolution photography in the documentation can ever do 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.840
 currently 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.720
 the clou in this picture 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.200
 until the level of detail 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.320
 you look in the photo and that will not be and sheep 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.249
 and the Paris AXA and 20 gigabytes are 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.959
 means world record 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.759
 for Dresden
