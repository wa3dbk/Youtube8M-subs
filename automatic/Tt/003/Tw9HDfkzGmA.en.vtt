00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello people now quilt again from 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.990
 trading square i wanted you here 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.889
 again the 12 100 technology of mine 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.080
 show again and maybe you here 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.089
 Let me know 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.880
 or injured see that 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.810
 just like me, why professionals really 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.750
 earn money 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.019
 while that's not because they 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.240
 maybe better or or more points 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.939
 live out of the market than others is lying 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.019
 Really that they are accordingly 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.640
 can use high 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.410
 And that's enough even if the one 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.200
 or maybe two trades a day maybe 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.079
 also make three other people 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.000
 october trading with 15 20 trades a day 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.510
 that's what happens to me every now and then 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.120
 again 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.460
 yes but I'll show you on the basis of 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.129
 Two Share Videos Why That Is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.170
 why also at qs there really money 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.160
 can earn 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.320
 I have a little here once 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.239
 video cutouts or two small ones 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.930
 video excerpts from the movie day 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.489
 trader 2 the dream of quick money there 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.559
 So it's not chaos and giovanni 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.420
 cicivelli they that a little bit of 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.070
 give any price if you are more specific 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.900
 you can also see something there 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 that's exactly what I've done and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.590
 I would like to show you this here is one 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.590
 make video cutout 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.880
 so it can look down I 've got there 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.880
 times a screenshot to be here 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.649
 hopefully can recognize 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.360
 here we have this candle as lawn 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.390
 I'm assuming that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.009
 in five of six points that was it 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.170
 why countries the lawn yes depends on it 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.630
 how high I enter gate counts 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.009
 with a contract 156 euro so can 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
 I do not finance one life 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.340
 Clear thing I go with 100 euros 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.039
 purely 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.140
 then that will be more interesting and 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:24.510
 That's exactly what I'm showing you a video 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:27.209
 example number two that's 750 here 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.250
 and 800 in five minutes we go from 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.950
 800 from the said I show you 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.350
 now a screenshot here to me 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:41.730
 I hope you will be good too 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:44.160
 andrÃ¤ was at 6561 is 6500 54.6 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.760
 that is, made 64 points if I 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.959
 this 800 euro by 64 parts then am 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.700
 I at 125 euro the point with it 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.250
 of course you earn money if you pro 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.950
 point can use 125 euro area in 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.350
 One Monday also the six points and 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.609
 you are in the front 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.440
 Of course you can only do that with us 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.450
 two euros go in the point or with 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.850
 three euros the point I think from five 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.980
 to ten euros as five to ten cfd 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.109
 Contracts, this or one pays off 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.440
 you should have saved enough money then 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.700
 change in the future area 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.380
 yes and that's why I'm showing you 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.140
 here again my trading day 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.959
 one has seen that 16 4 points 7 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.069
 points 5 points times 10 15 20 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.879
 the professionals also camp out like this 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.489
 others i also know the code cook 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.829
 at the house also a training made 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.150
 I can also do that on the internet 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.170
 I do not know if I'm on it 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.689
 but the next time you look at it 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.549
 simply my strategy 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.500
 worked wonderfully that all 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.689
 early in the morning that was too early in the morning 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.340
 630 because I'm obviously not the market 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.370
 but I'll just say that here 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.909
 today if we have the time to gemÃ¼t 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.319
 to lead 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.180
 I had something hours basis the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.489
 definitely still know one thing 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.310
 intact upward trend on a daily basis 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.799
 we too are overheated but that 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.120
 does not mean that we have one 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.769
 We can also stop sideways 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.549
 continue to consolidate and then it works 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.260
 further up 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.709
 we have the 1000 already 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.250
 now triggered and I'll show you 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.449
 Now here's a piece of me today 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.610
 I'm not the market everywhere 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.900
 I just did not get that 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.090
 clearly enough 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.099
 But here I was in the market 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.810
 Here underneath I see here is 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.460
 a little red candle i do something 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.820
 bigger that you can really see that 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.520
 can 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.949
 which has stopped under twelve times 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.750
 this is this one and then we had it 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.320
 I'm buying again since I'm long 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.650
 went 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.840
 I show you one with red 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.130
 lines received a stop loss 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.409
 down here that was a stop loss from 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.930
 five points exactly when I got there 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:54.139
 so i'm mindful of 70 and i'm 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.509
 at 73 I saw my stop loss 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:03.199
 we get a bit higher lower one 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:04.460
 at 73, I was so about after 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.240
 I had this chain I speak 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.979
 moved 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.690
 this candle is still the same and me 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.000
 I took my profit here 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.530
 not at the very bottom but here 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:22.400
 I took it with me at 685 as well 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:27.199
 exactly that is not even an eighth 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.120
 5 and 86 that has exactly one so 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:34.340
 entree was one point at the 78 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.740
 maybe I have 79 86 5 there 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.139
 I did the same as some 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.540
 professionals do exactly the same 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.180
 nothing else I have but there with 2 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.580
 what two euros traded the point 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.810
 makes professionals turn century or 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.400
 125 euro the point or accordingly 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.770
 it comes from other professionals know 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.990
 they are with two contacts in futures 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.180
 area on the way and 50 euro the point 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.210
 Still, that would have been great trade 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.850
 including euro taken out 67 points 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.820
 seven points 350 euros a short wire 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:11.510
 painless within fifteen or 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.170
 or here because you wait 35 minutes 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.720
 have to 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:18.500
 break even zero set the thing going 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.840
 further shoots high as it then others 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.660
 I would say that is one 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.120
 shot good but that's enough 67 points 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.410
 enough from the market if you 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.120
 can estimate accordingly high 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.920
 I would now in the future with times 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.310
 five or even ten contracts in it 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.710
 his 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.750
 the position maybe after the first one 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.550
 five minutes behind the candle 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.260
 position the other fires 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.210
 that arise in our looking if that 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.160
 I 'll keep you posted on the 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.720
 keep me up to date 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.520
 So you know as I said my art and 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.790
 Wise as I am the twelfth and 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.610
 100 times I'm of the opinion am 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.290
 definitely enough three trades a day 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.760
 to scalp out six to eight points 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.400
 if you 're lucky and meet like that 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.260
 a trade then you hang there 15 times 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.820
 with one and then you can 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.920
 Actually as a professional to make the book 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.130
 if I'm with 100 euro in here and 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.900
 with 15 points with well well 1500 too 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.310
 euro within five minutes after I 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.010
 the book too 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.490
 Something nice to eat somewhere and then 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:20.120
 I read the good god a good man 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.830
 So we say that we are fine with us 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.470
 I am happy that he has watched again 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.730
 and hope I have you there again 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.950
 to enlighten a little 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.230
 the thing with the market technology is indeed 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.990
 a very nice thing but that 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.370
 Camping is at the certain area 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.250
 of course, accordingly 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.980
 more interesting if you have the capital 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.630
 in order to get in really big 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.600
 Of course the calf is a great thing 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:47.480
 same three points 5 points 10 points 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:50.960
 if I come with 100 euro three points 

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.930
 100 euros made that in the month 6000 euro 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:58.090
 yes what do I want more then okay thanks 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.090
 for listening and see you next time
