00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.730
 helmet versions 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.470
 the only thing that has two versions is the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.619
 helmet as you can see this idea 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.289
 the white display and has the black 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.570
 So how are you guys going to see from here? 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 little when to change 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 Come on, how did I get these? 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.410
 secret is very simple 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.340
 maybe there are people who already have them 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.800
 have released is in the galley campaign that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.510
 have to do in the campaign when you 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 start a match 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.219
 You'll see how I will explain stadium. 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 See you have type but shaolin said 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.629
 has one that is so low that 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.440
 acquired another grenade is headshot 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.590
 and another is intelligence what each one 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.129
 of these screens is the first low is only 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.820
 You kill very simple is the second network 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.740
 shot is also very easy to grenade 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.869
 the only one I had a bit of that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.590
 It took me a while to realize it was 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.990
 intelligence guys this is the sinest 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.880
 folks who have us in the coffee of the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.619
 secret items that are hidden 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.759
 this was what gave a little more 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.189
 Work is for tea, but it's very simple. 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.040
 also to search the internet sasha 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.270
 and what do you have to do this? 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.159
 challenge 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.350
 when you complete one of those chances 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.890
 You'll earn a point to do. 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.680
 improve their ex 1 and this is what gives the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.759
 clothes to get clothes on mode 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.189
 multiplayer 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.979
 when you will see the image button to 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.110
 You're going now when you finish a 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.140
 cyclical campaign mission or she's 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.659
 leaving for edson improvements and there 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.700
 you can see that there are several improvements 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.210
 each improvement has two balls like 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.240
 You can tell when you 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.610
 complete these two improvements are you 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.229
 get a piece of that outfit and 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.130
 the first ball costs a 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.170
 point so if you make a 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.810
 but charles of those there and there gives 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.490
 play to buy the second costs two 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.710
 then you have to make two screens of 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.440
 to get the second 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.060
 and only and only when you complete two 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.940
 polka dots that you win a part 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.560
 of clothing and only to complete had a 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.360
 asked if he was 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.800
 multiplayer offline mode 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.060
 I think he meant that it was in the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.250
 system link mode does not work in 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.160
 system link all the clothes of the mode 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.070
 center link is nothing to do with a 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.120
 online multiplayer mode then 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.100
 it works 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.780
 beauty people and that's it I'm staying 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.780
 This way I said go 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.530
 it is true
