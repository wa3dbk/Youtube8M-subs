00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
this line in here on this plug that came

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.310 
this line in here on this plug that came
with<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> card<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:55.739> microphone<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.399> broken

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
with the card the microphone is broken

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.660 
with the card the microphone is broken
but<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.469> got<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> spot<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.129> plug<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.520> an

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670

camera<00:01:27.479> came<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:28.020> two<00:01:28.320> battery<00:01:28.829> packs<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
camera came with two battery packs and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.870 
camera came with two battery packs and
what<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.960> typical<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.590> cameras<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.310> old<00:01:32.610> is

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
what is typical with cameras this old is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.200 
what is typical with cameras this old is
batteries<00:01:33.659> were<00:01:33.900> dead<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:35.340> what<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> did<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.150> I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
batteries were dead so what I did is I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.920 
batteries were dead so what I did is I
cut<00:01:36.810> them<00:01:36.930> apart<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> saw<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.540> took<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
cut them apart with a saw and I took the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.840 
cut them apart with a saw and I took the
old<00:01:40.110> cells<00:01:40.470> out<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.979> recycle<00:01:41.490> them<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
old cells out and recycle them and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.090 
old cells out and recycle them and
inside<00:01:42.780> you'll<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.200> there's<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> bunch<00:01:43.979> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
inside you'll see there's a bunch of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.340 
inside you'll see there's a bunch of
wires<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:47.390> this<00:01:48.390> little<00:01:48.750> doohickey<00:01:48.960> here

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
wires and this little doohickey here

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.530 
wires and this little doohickey here
that<00:01:49.799> little<00:01:50.070> device<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> thermometer<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that little device is a thermometer and

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.179 
that little device is a thermometer and
it<00:01:51.899> shuts<00:01:52.170> off<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.799> battery<00:01:53.159> is

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it shuts off if the battery is

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.450 
it shuts off if the battery is
overheating<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> did<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.310> took<00:01:56.369> some

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
overheating so what I did is I took some

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.810 
overheating so what I did is I took some
double<00:01:59.460> a<00:02:01.040> nickel<00:02:02.040> metal<00:02:02.399> hydride<00:02:02.630> batteries

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
double a nickel metal hydride batteries

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.040 
double a nickel metal hydride batteries
that<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> bought<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.149> eBay<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.990> five<00:02:07.590> dollars

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
that I bought on eBay for five dollars

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.660 
that I bought on eBay for five dollars
never<00:02:10.050> spend<00:02:10.410> more<00:02:10.619> than<00:02:10.770> five<00:02:11.039> dollars<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
never spend more than five dollars on a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.100 
never spend more than five dollars on a
project<00:02:12.300> I

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
project I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.050 
project I
what<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.380> say<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.780> these<00:02:15.780> were<00:02:15.990> original

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
what I say and these were original

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
what I say and these were original
nickel<00:02:18.060> cadmium<00:02:18.560> battery<00:02:19.560> packs<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.900> these

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
nickel cadmium battery packs but these

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.530 
nickel cadmium battery packs but these
nickel<00:02:22.410> metal<00:02:22.710> hydrides<00:02:23.190> are<00:02:23.550> twice<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.360> amp

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
nickel metal hydrides are twice the amp

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.170 
nickel metal hydrides are twice the amp
hours<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.000> lovely

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
hours and you can see the lovely

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.050 
hours and you can see the lovely
soldering<00:02:27.720> job<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.380> did<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.070> was<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.880> big

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
soldering job I did there I was in a big

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.540 
soldering job I did there I was in a big
hurry<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.510> put<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.840> together<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:32.310> didn't

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
hurry to put this together and I didn't

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.670 
hurry to put this together and I didn't
even<00:02:32.640> repair<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.300> broken<00:02:33.480> spot<00:02:34.380> where<00:02:34.650> I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
even repair that broken spot where I

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.400 
even repair that broken spot where I
busted<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.280> taking<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.700> apart<00:02:36.050> with<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.110> hammer

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
busted it taking it apart with a hammer

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.380 
busted it taking it apart with a hammer
and<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:39.209> uh<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.430> use<00:02:41.730> hot<00:02:41.940> glue<00:02:42.000> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
and so uh and I just use hot glue to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.510 
and so uh and I just use hot glue to
glue<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.690> back<00:02:42.720> together<00:02:46.370> nickel<00:02:47.370> metal

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
glue it back together nickel metal

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.199 
glue it back together nickel metal
hydride<00:02:47.720> batteries<00:02:48.720> will<00:02:48.990> typically<00:02:49.380> charge

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
hydride batteries will typically charge

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.340 
hydride batteries will typically charge
just<00:02:51.209> fine<00:02:51.450> using<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.800> old<00:02:52.950> Nike<00:02:53.190> ad<00:02:53.459> charger

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
just fine using the old Nike ad charger

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.690 
just fine using the old Nike ad charger
but<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.500> probably<00:02:55.680> takes<00:02:56.160> twice<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:56.489> long

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
but it probably takes twice as long

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.720 
but it probably takes twice as long
we're<00:02:57.270> gonna<00:02:57.330> find<00:02:57.720> out<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.459> get<00:02:59.550> this

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
we're gonna find out so I can get this

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.820 
we're gonna find out so I can get this
