00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.210
 hello love stood spectator my name 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.440
 is alexander power i am knowledgeable 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.760
 editor at the star I am writing since 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.130
 ten years ago for stern 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.880
 run and fitness stories themselves 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.880
 enthusiastic runs 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.470
 There are many like running shoes here 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.520
 Turning wise, partly absurd 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.650
 For years we were promised that 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.450
 protects us from injury heals ours 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.750
 kink senk spread feet and run with it 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.670
 we better know now that 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.960
 Runner despite all this in the last 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.160
 not less frequently injured 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.690
 was and it is assumed that it 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.950
 not really now but 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.229
 rather harms if you in the 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.430
 movement sequence engages so sound 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.680
 the development in the meantime 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.920
 passed over to relieve the shoes 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.810
 the first pioneer at the nike free he 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.460
 has a fully movable so it allows 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.979
 that one feels the living and comes the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.060
 walk barefoot the next from so 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.670
 normal running already 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.910
 the advantage of these shoes like nike free 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.910
 is they considerably cheaper than one 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.910
 high gerÃ¼stetes 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.720
 then there is the trailer has that 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.370
 barefoot running it will be more and more 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.390
 or that in the city on asphalt always 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.280
 It's a bit difficult , too 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.590
 which has already developed the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.270
 millimeter thin soles have the full 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.610
 are mobile and actually only 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.220
 protect granules and stones 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.440
 they have a similar concept 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.330
 cowards where the ten single place 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.220
 have been able to move freely and 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.820
 supposedly barefoot running perfect 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.410
 imitate 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.060
 the problem is that we 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.259
 for decades, as a rule, with already 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.780
 have walked and our feet 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.430
 accordingly degenerated muscular 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.170
 are and you are completely at it 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.820
 slowly you have to get used to it in small 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.440
 start and then slowly 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.300
 otherwise you are the same 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.180
 hurt quickly like with the others 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:19.490
 already what you should not do in the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.770
 buy sports entrance because one 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.290
 a seller that advises are deposits 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.760
 always an intervention in the gesamtkunstwerk 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.960
 Body if I change something below 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.060
 Does that mean that maybe suddenly above? 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.110
 a little bit hurt because the statics themselves 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.390
 have changed an imbalance 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.890
 Guess is a long needed 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.550
 anyway only if you really 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.550
 complaints 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.819
 if you run with the start on 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.020
 the beginning of normal running clothes 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.420
 everyone at home has normal 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.620
 sportswear a pants and t-shirt and 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.510
 four after temperature maybe one more 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.980
 sweater if you discover someday 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.270
 this is my sport if possible 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.770
 do in the long run if more 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.959
 stretch then it makes sense 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.500
 appropriate functional clothing 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.420
 to buy 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.160
 the one helps the body temperature too 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.090
 keep the cold temperatures even 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.090
 but also the sweat to the outside 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.739
 what ever good is transported one 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.840
 lightweight windproof jacket 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.099
 one can put on at the beginning of the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.840
 running when others were with 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.650
 easy to stow away and take with you 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.060
 Also useful are those pants the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.060
 partially windstopper have 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.159
 Many runners make the error-win in the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.319
 start too fast 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.389
 you can avoid this mistake 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.650
 since setting a heart rate monitor helps you 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.930
 while running a strap under the 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.040
 clothes just send the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.569
 pulse at the clock 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.400
 you can then his individual 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.290
 adjust area and not so 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.150
 quickly fall into this trap totally out of breath 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.739
 and to be frustrated 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.299
 that is very simple models 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.889
 really just show the pulse 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.060
 This is safe for the beginner 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.469
 enough to get a bit 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.120
 ambitious and also technically 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:47.370
 interested one can consider whether one 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.799
 perhaps a watch bought on 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.120
 gps has the one then but still with 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.560
 his cellphone and the corresponding app 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.209
 then you can then link 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.840
 Understand what paths you run 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.400
 and with which 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.599
 average speed and so on 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.250
 but that's really for then 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.750
 the ambitious runner for the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.359
 normal sifter reaches a normal 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.069
 Pulse out and evolved over time 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.540
 you also feel like yourself 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.219
 fast one is on the way and how it is 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.569
 you can do it well in the end 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.290
 maybe also on the heart rate monitor 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.290
 renounce
