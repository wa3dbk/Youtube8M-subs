00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
a big roll of nonsense going on back

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.709 
a big roll of nonsense going on back
here<00:04:27.139> I<00:04:27.379> don't<00:04:28.370> think<00:04:28.639> that<00:04:28.729> this<00:04:28.879> looks<00:04:29.180> that

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:29.719 
here I don't think that this looks that

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:34.300 
here I don't think that this looks that
bad<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.020> think<00:04:30.439> that<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.680> top<00:04:30.979> is<00:04:31.900> cute<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.439> I

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
bad I think that the top is cute and I

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.159 
bad I think that the top is cute and I
think<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.729> back<00:04:34.969> is<00:04:35.270> where<00:04:35.569> it<00:04:35.780> kind<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.110> looks

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
think the back is where it kind of looks

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.909 
think the back is where it kind of looks
a<00:04:36.620> little<00:04:36.919> bit<00:04:37.219> messy<00:04:38.139> don't<00:04:39.139> you<00:04:39.379> agree

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
a little bit messy don't you agree

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.189 
a little bit messy don't you agree
the<00:04:40.430> sides<00:04:40.729> kind<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.210> smooth<00:04:41.479> out<00:04:41.689> once<00:04:42.020> you

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
the sides kind of smooth out once you

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.450 
the sides kind of smooth out once you
tie<00:04:42.469> it<00:04:42.530> back<00:04:43.219> in<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.639> front<00:04:43.909> I<00:04:44.180> wish<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:46.400> I

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
tie it back in the front I wish that I

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.990 
tie it back in the front I wish that I
could<00:04:46.699> make<00:04:46.849> a<00:04:46.879> cute<00:04:47.330> little<00:04:47.509> bow<00:04:48.039> but<00:04:49.039> alas

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
could make a cute little bow but alas

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.170 
could make a cute little bow but alas
the<00:04:50.990> sleeves<00:04:51.710> are<00:04:51.979> not<00:04:52.129> long<00:04:52.340> enough<00:04:52.729> this<00:04:53.000> is

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
the sleeves are not long enough this is

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.749 
the sleeves are not long enough this is
just<00:04:53.449> a<00:04:53.569> medium<00:04:54.050> so<00:04:54.379> it<00:04:55.099> would<00:04:55.250> probably<00:04:55.279> work

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
just a medium so it would probably work

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.790 
just a medium so it would probably work
a<00:04:55.879> lot<00:04:56.029> better<00:04:56.210> if<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.539> had<00:04:56.779> an<00:04:57.080> extra<00:04:57.560> large

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
a lot better if I had an extra large

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.689 
a lot better if I had an extra large
shirt

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
shirt

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.490 
shirt
oh<00:04:58.729> okay<00:04:59.300> never<00:04:59.509> mind<00:04:59.569> hers<00:04:59.990> doesn't<00:05:00.379> have<00:05:00.469> a

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
oh okay never mind hers doesn't have a

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.790 
oh okay never mind hers doesn't have a
bow<00:05:00.740> either<00:05:01.069> it<00:05:01.610> just<00:05:01.879> has<00:05:02.389> it's<00:05:03.020> just<00:05:03.139> tied<00:05:03.529> in

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
bow either it just has it's just tied in

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.920 
bow either it just has it's just tied in
the<00:05:03.889> front<00:05:04.159> so<00:05:04.699> I<00:05:04.729> guess<00:05:05.210> this<00:05:05.479> didn't<00:05:05.870> turn

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
the front so I guess this didn't turn

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.490 
the front so I guess this didn't turn
out<00:05:06.319> as<00:05:06.590> bad<00:05:07.250> as<00:05:07.849> I<00:05:08.419> was<00:05:08.599> thinking<00:05:08.779> that<00:05:09.020> it<00:05:09.289> did

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
out as bad as I was thinking that it did

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.469 
out as bad as I was thinking that it did
if<00:05:09.949> you<00:05:10.009> just<00:05:10.340> want<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.580> tie<00:05:10.759> it<00:05:10.819> in<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.180> front

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
if you just want to tie it in the front

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.110 
if you just want to tie it in the front
then<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:12.139> totally<00:05:12.620> think<00:05:13.009> any<00:05:13.279> size<00:05:13.610> shirt<00:05:13.939> is

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
then I totally think any size shirt is

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.119 
then I totally think any size shirt is
fine<00:05:14.360> if<00:05:14.779> you<00:05:15.139> want<00:05:15.319> to<00:05:15.379> make<00:05:15.500> it<00:05:15.620> into<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.830> bow

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 
fine if you want to make it into a bow

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.219 
fine if you want to make it into a bow
which<00:05:16.699> I<00:05:16.849> swear<00:05:17.090> I've<00:05:17.240> seen<00:05:17.270> some<00:05:17.900> of<00:05:18.050> these

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
which I swear I've seen some of these

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.559 
which I swear I've seen some of these
with<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.590> bow<00:05:18.830> in<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.159> front<00:05:19.310> then<00:05:19.969> I<00:05:20.000> would<00:05:20.449> go

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
with a bow in the front then I would go

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.249 
with a bow in the front then I would go
ahead<00:05:20.659> and<00:05:20.870> step<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.979> up<00:05:22.069> probably<00:05:22.729> two<00:05:23.539> sizes

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
ahead and step it up probably two sizes

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.709 
ahead and step it up probably two sizes
larger<00:05:24.860> than<00:05:25.129> you<00:05:25.250> normally<00:05:25.430> wear<00:05:25.940> I<00:05:26.300> don't

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
larger than you normally wear I don't

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.890 
larger than you normally wear I don't
know<00:05:26.810> this<00:05:26.990> is<00:05:27.050> kind<00:05:27.409> of<00:05:27.529> tightly<00:05:28.900> squeezing

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
know this is kind of tightly squeezing

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.100 
know this is kind of tightly squeezing
like<00:05:30.860> a<00:05:30.889> corset<00:05:31.610> or<00:05:31.819> something<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:32.509> I<00:05:32.810> would

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
like a corset or something so I would

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.420 
like a corset or something so I would
probably<00:05:33.289> if<00:05:33.620> I<00:05:33.710> was<00:05:33.740> going<00:05:33.979> to<00:05:34.039> like<00:05:34.190> wear

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
probably if I was going to like wear

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.850 
probably if I was going to like wear
