first there is tons and tons of cameras
and<00:00:23.189> also<00:00:23.939> pricing<00:00:24.390> comes<00:00:24.570> into<00:00:24.750> mind<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
and also pricing comes into mind I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.050 
and also pricing comes into mind I
couldn't<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.710> go<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.160> cannons<00:00:26.609> website

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060

couldn't just go to like cannons website
go<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> most<00:00:27.840> expensive<00:00:28.410> DSLR<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
go to the most expensive DSLR like the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.359 
go to the most expensive DSLR like the
canon<00:00:29.880> eos<00:00:30.240> 5d<00:00:30.570> mark<00:00:30.779> 3<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> call<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> best

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
canon eos 5d mark 3 and call it the best

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.250 
canon eos 5d mark 3 and call it the best
camera<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:33.149> i<00:00:33.360> mean<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.110> great

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
camera because i mean it's a great

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.959 
camera because i mean it's a great
camera<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:35.130> that's<00:00:35.280> not<00:00:35.430> exactly<00:00:35.640> practical

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
camera but that's not exactly practical

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.030 
camera but that's not exactly practical
for<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> guys<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.440> did<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.829> took

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
for you guys so what I did is I took

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.280 
for you guys so what I did is I took
everything<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:38.969> categories<00:00:39.180> maybe<00:00:40.050> like

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
everything in two categories maybe like

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.410 
everything in two categories maybe like
the<00:00:40.440> DSLRs<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.670> went<00:00:41.879> through<00:00:42.090> them<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the DSLRs and it went through them and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.900 
the DSLRs and it went through them and
figured<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> best<00:00:43.980> DSLR<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
figured out which is the best DSLR that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.819 
figured out which is the best DSLR that
stuck<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.629> year<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.379> good<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
stuck out this year and is good for the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.350 
stuck out this year and is good for the
pricing<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.610> said<00:00:47.789> our<00:00:48.000> first

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
pricing and with that said our first

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.549 
pricing and with that said our first
camera<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> I'm<00:00:48.930> gonna<00:00:49.050> mention<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
camera that I'm gonna mention is

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.400 
camera that I'm gonna mention is
actually<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> DSLR<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> Canon<00:00:51.960> 70d

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
actually a DSLR and that's the Canon 70d

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.770 
actually a DSLR and that's the Canon 70d
the<00:00:52.980> Canon<00:00:53.250> 70d<00:00:53.520> has<00:00:53.879> pretty<00:00:54.120> nice<00:00:54.329> quality

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the Canon 70d has pretty nice quality

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.470 
the Canon 70d has pretty nice quality
it's<00:00:54.930> very<00:00:55.110> similar<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.620> 35<00:00:56.100> by<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> 60d<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it's very similar to a 35 by the 60d it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
it's very similar to a 35 by the 60d it
does<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> feature<00:00:57.930> similar<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> 5d

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
does a feature similar to like the 5d

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.000 
does a feature similar to like the 5d
mark<00:00:59.550> 3<00:00:59.940> maybe<00:01:00.420> even<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> 70<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> one

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
mark 3 maybe even the 70 but the one

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.229 
mark 3 maybe even the 70 but the one
thing<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.219> actually<00:01:02.430> makes<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.879> camera

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
thing that actually makes this camera

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.420 
thing that actually makes this camera
stand<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> cans<00:01:04.290> new<00:01:04.530> technology<00:01:05.100> called

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
stand out is cans new technology called

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.130 
stand out is cans new technology called
dual<00:01:05.760> pixel<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> dual<00:01:06.600> pixel<00:01:06.990> technology

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
dual pixel the dual pixel technology

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.980 
dual pixel the dual pixel technology
gives<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> Canon<00:01:08.430> 70d<00:01:08.840> extremely<00:01:09.840> better

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
gives the Canon 70d extremely better

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.440 
gives the Canon 70d extremely better

autofocusing compared to other DSLRs for

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.090 
autofocusing compared to other DSLRs for
the<00:01:12.510> most<00:01:12.659> part<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.049> DSLRs<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.890> bad

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the most part all DSLRs have bad

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
the most part all DSLRs have bad
autofocusing<00:01:14.850> problems<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.420> comes<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
autofocusing problems when it comes to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.179 
autofocusing problems when it comes to
video<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.200> well<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:16.950> most

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
video is well not all of them but most

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
video is well not all of them but most
of<00:01:17.369> them<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.610> least<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.570> do<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> pixel

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
of them at least and they do a pixel

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630 
of them at least and they do a pixel
technology<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.040> has<00:01:20.280> come<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.610> with

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
technology that can has come out with

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
technology that can has come out with
really<00:01:21.390> does<00:01:21.540> improve<00:01:21.810> auto<00:01:22.049> focusing<00:01:22.500> in

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
really does improve auto focusing in

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.649 
really does improve auto focusing in
video<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.189> those<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.640> perfect<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
video it's those in perfect but it is a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
video it's those in perfect but it is a
lot<00:01:24.960> better<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> hopefully<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.040> be

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
lot better and hopefully it can be

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.800 
lot better and hopefully it can be
improved<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.820> little<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.090> more<00:01:27.240> anyway

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
improved just a little bit more anyway

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.270 
improved just a little bit more anyway
