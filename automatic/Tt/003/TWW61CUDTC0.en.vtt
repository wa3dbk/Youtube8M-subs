00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.450
 delicious fresh rolls is what 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.599
 to pack myself I show you how it is 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.599
 going 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.760
 I like it the most when the grain 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.430
 freshly ground is why I get 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.090
 think of demeter or another 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.240
 bio combined and paint this at home 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.669
 that took about ten minutes though 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.640
 it's handy while the bread is painting 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.059
 I can already do the Vorteig 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.520
 I just make fresh yeast for that 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:46.370
 packet crumbly small there then do two 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.879
 spoonful of sugar on it and some flour 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.480
 234 spoons and a little lukewarm water 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.760
 and this advantage is very very 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.359
 important have experimented a lot and the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.370
 advantage of it just by the 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:08.720
 that the wholemeal flour is also fluffy 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:11.400
 that will have to be just 89 minutes 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.460
 stand up to that then a bit 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.650
 I'm just waiting for this 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.830
 Play this container is full with up 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.630
 the worked up yes is the finished mail 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.340
 I feel in the bowl again 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.580
 already happens then comes 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.799
 shot olive oil in there and some salt 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.780
 I already touch that to the advantage 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.000
 not directly in this high salzkotten 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.939
 the high salt concentration hits because 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.939
 the yeast does not like that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.570
 there you see, the help is beautiful now 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.810
 went 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.110
 in time that I feel in with then 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.110
 the bowl and then let it stir 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.820
 because it is one more time I leave 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.380
 About three minutes four minutes 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.210
 stir well knead it says I think 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.100
 I just let it knead vigorously 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.780
 I always go music now and then 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.460
 See if I can refill some flour 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.900
 because I have too much moisture in it 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.930
 have or a little bit 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:16.170
 in that is always depending on one 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.780
 Time lapse running like that and then is 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.990
 the pond is actually perfect 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.400
 I 'm just doing that a bit 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.320
 still bring you in shape like me to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.750
 want to have and I have such a way 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.910
 come up with it with a little 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.720
 work and fast to a result 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.170
 come 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:40.650
 that's why I take it so kneaded and 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:45.120
 then cut it into pieces like me 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.280
 it wants something unusual 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.320
 is you will if you will, and of course 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.140
 I would do it in the oven 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.600
 To do the form you would have bread exactly and there 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.040
 do you see it snowing in pieces and that 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.570
 It was usually my kneading 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.640
 but individual bread is just more 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.470
 work thought quite efficient 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.770
 I just cut the pond like that 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.080
 determined that the simple snow only dirt 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.430
 Can and can do on the baking sheet 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.370
 Then do it in the oven 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.220
 that was very tricky at the time 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.290
 saves time and I do not see any 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.620
 disadvantage of that I do a cloth 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.690
 The cloth makes it wet with it 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.920
 optimum humidity is under the cloth 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.940
 and after about 40 minutes 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.540
 definitely like that 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.700
 I'm just always watching and watching 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.380
 if they left and if so 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.690
 a lot have gone by says jo now 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.570
 then it will be enough in the oven 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.459
 I have to admit in this video 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.810
 the pond did not succeed perfectly normal 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.820
 he gets a little more fluid 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.810
 that was just because of the circumstances of the 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.970
 videos happens the stove heats up 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.850
 not imagine at 200 degrees and then 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.470
 I wait about 20 minutes to the 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.910
 buns rausholt there I watch too 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.580
 Everytime I do not like her so much 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.320
 cross because I'm freezing the 1 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.180
 I take a frozen one every morning 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.290
 roll out and take that to the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.760
 You know how to work on that toaster 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.580
 already three hours is divided 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.910
 two hours and and also a toaster 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.359
 gets a nice crisp consistent 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.609
 and then 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.830
 I have a wonderful as I think 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.599
 fresh organic wholemeal roll yes me 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.610
 I wish you much fun baking 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.110
 and if you have more tips or 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.490
 Suggestions for me then show me 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.490
 but with hitherto Zschau
