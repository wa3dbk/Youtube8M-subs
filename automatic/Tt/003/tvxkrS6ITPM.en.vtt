00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.840
 Hello to all 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.890
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.289
 new video following queries and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 comments so firstly for 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 get this police vehicle behind 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.580
 me the van of the month how 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.769
 get it rather how to put them in 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.510
 his garage 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:35.030
 lg not film how to get it 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:39.090
 and then the famous shielded forum of the swat 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 then you will do the year of the swac and to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.219
 reindeer difficult what had seen the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.789
 video on the armored van of the bank 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.390
 is low gold will be understood and one does 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.579
 similarly so the method is exactly 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.059
 but the same good as it was 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.379
 request 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.829
 I will show you how it will be 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.289
 made 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.210
 irini I could have purposes of 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.350
 comments that ask us neither but 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.360
 for that as we do so the first 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.830
 thing to do when we got this 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.170
 vehicle the spawn is to tear off the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.020
 door then why tear off the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.119
 doors to the limit would almost 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.180
 to do on all vehicles 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.810
 it can avoid different manip but 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.500
 in the case of these vehicles, that's it 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.299
 take away the time that loses it our carso 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.640
 open the door which makes it 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.280
 makes handling easier and it can 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.960
 walk the first time but it's not 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.259
 necessarily it always marks the first 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.920
 stroke 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.710
 I do not stop to repeat it must always 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.850
 persevere and then try again for this 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.689
 type of vehicle must be put 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.120
 parallel to the garage door common sense 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.610
 we aim 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.410
 and there you'll see I'm not going 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.860
 to be in my car door 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.570
 I'm doing it so that's why he 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.640
 must be sure that we are well in the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.080
 xsara doors because the time that 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.180
 we put to ride in the vehicle is 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.680
 very important for this manipulation 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.870
 love but tends to rise in the 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.670
 vehicle 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.740
 then a little easier we succeed in 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.370
 the shackle that's why when 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.640
 pulls out the door already to facilitate 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.640
 the thing 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.760
 so as I said you really have to be 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.050
 in the act of the doorkeeper so we aim 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.410
 we check know well in lax in 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.410
 the door 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.590
 we aim in front of us we recule 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.050
 as for the video at the level of the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.060
 door in the vehicle 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.130
 and as there is fast good it work 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.330
 first time 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.360
 So this is what to make of either 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.720
 say objective it's now let's go to 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.530
 the famous truck then the famous 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.380
 van 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.640
 when I made the video I was not sure 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.350
 I remembered more if we could 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.770
 go back like a normal vehicle like 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.050
 police or other vehicles or if 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.700
 had to put it parallel or at the 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.620
 garage door 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.450
 So that's why I have it all 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.790
 way does my steps as i do 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.820
 always I blow up the door of the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.820
 vehicle 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.989
 so this vehicle it is easy to 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.880
 have a c it's the vehicles that in 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.260
 general rule are on the road when 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.680
 you have three four stars for you 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.680
 block the path 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.630
 I'm doing it so we're going backwards 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.370
 skip the door yesterday so in every 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.620
 case even to enter garage 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.120
 normally it's always useful because 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.920
 that sometimes with bugs 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.239
 when you come home the first time 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.100
 it is to open the vehicle door 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.130
 as we went out there everything is closed to 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.330
 the time 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.640
 so tearing him off at least 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.430
 we're sure so here I went out in 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.970
 current 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.790
 I aim I stick to the vehicles I 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.930
 back to the level of the door and 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.280
 I go inside 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.530
 and that's the vehicle we put in the 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.750
 garage so to insure his vehicles 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.180
 go see my video I say thank you for 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.320
 to have followed me a little green thumb 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.450
 do not hurt a little comment 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.270
 is always a pleasure and I tell you 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.940
