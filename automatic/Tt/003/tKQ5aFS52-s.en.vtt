00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 our expectation is to start playing 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.259
 then the coach is no different from the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.690
 players is that soon comes to the game 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.429
 to play, I guess after the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 we are all anxious for that 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.890
 resume the selection again play and then 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.380
 now it's a lot of study work 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.480
 accompanying European football 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.490
 the newly started now pre season in 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.869
 what conditions for players 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.150
 if any player is feeling any 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.939
 thing is not at its best 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.070
 conditioning with few games like 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.380
 people will be able to merge this 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.809
 team how we will be able to train 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.489
 a team despite being at the beginning but 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.620
 knows the responsibility that Brazil 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.899
 has in the play to win have to 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 play a good football a good performance 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 so be it is this anxiety that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.390
 challenge of getting a team together 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.239
 competitive 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.460
 I think our expectation is great, right? 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.280
 the difficulty of the games against both 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.620
 colombia against the equator to colombia 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.340
 mainly because it made a great 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.979
 world cup have the scorer of the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.810
 world has top players 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.510
 has grown a lot in recent times with the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.820
 Argentine coach is not a discipline 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.560
 tactical team that technically 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 We know it's very strong. 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.960
 physically but with many players 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.810
 playing in europe made colombia 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.970
 improve as a team and this 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 demonstrated during the world cup then 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.560
 12 friendly we are going to have a lot 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.939
 difficulty but that is good too 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.009
 the equator is a very strong team 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.020
 physically with large players 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.780
 who are also playing a lot 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.700
 na na na europe so i think two 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.520
 friends we'll have to have 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.799
 a notion of what will be the tie 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.380
 mainly and for us it is good to start 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.479
 play soon never take away this anxiety 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.790
 after the world cup we 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.970
 You begin to put together a working group 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.250
 group of players is all we know 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.219
 we have to win the fans 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 Brazilian is to demonstrate a good 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.810
 I work a good commitment and regain 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.729
 again our space within the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.649
 world football and mainly 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.759
 demonstrate the quality of football 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.009
 Brazilian 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.550
 I think every Brazilian dreams of being 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.100
 soccer player and we are 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.750
 a privileged group to be in the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.020
 Brazilian selection and mainly 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.700
 I'm returning as a player as 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.310
 coach now returning then we 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.490
 You can not measure effort, you can not here. 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.550
 work very hard with dedication 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.860
 in our work and I think that 's what 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.200
 more important to have a sense that 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.960
 This is not an end point like me. 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.990
 I talked to the boys of the U-20 that this 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.610
 it is a starting point that is the dream not 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.710
 It is for us hope it is for us 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.640
 conquer and it is not a dream to play in 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.050
 Brazilian Team 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.700
 we have to be the dream of being 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.680
 champions with the Brazilian team we 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.870
 we have to leave our mark then 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.910
 how we feel privileged 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.720
 We have to do this because we deserve it. 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.550
 every day at every moment and we are the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.530
 people come to the Brazilian team for 1 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.420
 for a quality but has how to prove 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.010
 this every day has to demonstrate the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.530
 our capacity is not 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.810
 highlight the importance of representing the country 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.280
 millions of Brazilians would like to 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.650
 to be in our place we are 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.550
 then chosen then to correspond in 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.550
 field our work
