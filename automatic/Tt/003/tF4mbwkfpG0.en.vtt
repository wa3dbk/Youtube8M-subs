00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
here and we'll show you how a copter so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.390 
here and we'll show you how a copter so
this<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> Chronos<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> FP<00:01:07.979> 1<00:01:08.159> 10

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
this is the Chronos this is the FP 1 10

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.300 
this is the Chronos this is the FP 1 10
so<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> fixed<00:01:09.180> pitch<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:10.200> does<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.680> your

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so it is a fixed pitch it does have your

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.330 
so it is a fixed pitch it does have your
traditional<00:01:11.490> fly<00:01:12.030> bar<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.900> mechanical

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
traditional fly bar so it's a mechanical

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.249 
traditional fly bar so it's a mechanical
stabilization<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.509> has<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> separate

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
stabilization on it that has a separate

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.359 
stabilization on it that has a separate
tail<00:01:16.590> motor<00:01:17.210> for<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.380> body<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.560> removable<00:01:20.159> very

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
tail motor for it body is removable very

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
tail motor for it body is removable very
easy<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:20.970> pop<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> two<00:01:21.689> tabs<00:01:22.350> off

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
easy to do just pop the two tabs off

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.300 
easy to do just pop the two tabs off
here<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.619> motor<00:01:25.799> for

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
here and you can see then the motor for

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.819 
here and you can see then the motor for
the<00:01:26.640> main<00:01:26.790> motor<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.780> circuit<00:01:28.590> board<00:01:28.740> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the main motor the circuit board that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.890 
the main motor the circuit board that
has<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> controls<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.659> here's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
has all the controls and then here's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300 
has all the controls and then here's
your<00:01:31.049> connector<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.680> battery<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
your connector for your battery so the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.609 
your connector for your battery so the
battery<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.210> kind<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.900> unique<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
battery on this one kind of unique it

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.640 
battery on this one kind of unique it
goes<00:01:35.329> vertically<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.619> this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
goes vertically so you put it like this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.740 
goes vertically so you put it like this
and<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.850> sits<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.390> way<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> little

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and it sits up this way just a little

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.719 
and it sits up this way just a little
tray<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> Velcro<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> sits<00:01:41.579> in

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
tray for it and a Velcro so it sits in

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.039 
tray for it and a Velcro so it sits in
there<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.210> connect<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> batteries

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
there like that connect the batteries

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.639 
there like that connect the batteries
together<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.700> that<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.500> basics<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> how

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
together and that is the basics of how

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.130 
together and that is the basics of how
to<00:01:46.740> connect<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.390> very<00:01:48.390> stable<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.930> fly

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
to connect it up very stable to fly

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.060 
to connect it up very stable to fly
we're<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> show<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> little<00:01:49.829> bit<00:01:49.920> in

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
we're going to show you a little bit in

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.490 
we're going to show you a little bit in
video<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:51.299> several<00:01:51.780> people<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.079> our<00:01:52.200> store<00:01:52.409> of
