00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.010
 While 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.010
 for me 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.380
 cartoon network has been a channel that 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.450
 brought hundreds of memorable characters 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.490
 both heroes with skills 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.500
 superhuman as ordinary people and 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.720
 currents but pretty charismatic 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.570
 but what would these be without a good 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.040
 villain antagonist those who are for 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.470
 do wrong or just to 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.180
 complicate life to the protagonist by 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.250
 so we do the following 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.710

 who is the most evil or by whom 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.190
 stronger but because of how it is like 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.280
 character so think twice 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.310

 villain who appeared for the first and only

 middle age was so joker that he did not know 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.800
 when to stop the jokes came 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.480
 to such an extent that the villagers 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.640
 They fed up and played a joke on the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.739

 jacques happened this received a visit 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.030
 of pure bone but this one stole his voice and 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.580
 in return for returning the pure bone voice 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.430
 gave him eternal life but he decapitated 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.580
 to resentful jack jack looking for revenge 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.290

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.750
 Spent the time jack meets 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.940
 Billy and he steals the sickle easily to 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.890
 steal the sickle it creates an army of 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.870
 pumpkins to master everything in build 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.510
 do every halloween night and 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.250
 of course revenge on pure bone to 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.230
 despite having been defeated by his 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.450
 mania of not knowing when to stop with 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.220
 his jokes is sent to hell where 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.970
 he's still playing pranks on the 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.370
 got damn 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.709
 who live there a great character 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.650
 pity that it only appeared once in the 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.020
 brain series or man dark is the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.760
 villain antagonist and biggest rival of 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.520
 dexter in the series the lab 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.500
 Brain dexter appears as a very boy 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.380
 smart which goes to it 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.750
 school and same course that dexter brain 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.330
 having a great intelligence achieves 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.550
 let's say steal the position of genius boy 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.200
 to dexter at school considering that 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.080
 in what most stands out dexter is his 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.000
 intelligence by passing this these two 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.790
 they form a great rivalry until they arrive 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.920
 to the point of being enemies your enmity is 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.680
 so big that even your pets 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.540
 lab they fought each other brain 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.880
 just like dexter has a huge 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.380
 laboratory which performs all kinds of 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.210
 scientific experiments 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.460
 unlike dexter that has a 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.130
 hidden laboratory the brain is 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.050
 in the sight of everyone there is something 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.850
 what to highlight about the brain is that it achieved 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.950
 dominate the world once with the power 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.380
 of the neuro- tomiko nucleus belonging to 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.630
 dexter going completely idiot to 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.780
 all humanity except him and for a 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.470
 strange reason to dexter neither this happened 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.660
 in the film 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.880
 the laboratory dexter the journey of 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.940
 dexter which obviously brain is 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.890
 detained not necessarily by dexter in 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.110
 this movie there is even a fight between 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.750
 the adult teen versions and 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.580
 old ladies of dexter and brain I think what 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.260
 The only thing that hurts him is being 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.410
 in love with her older sister 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.150
 enemy diddy really brain is a 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.120
 true villain who knew how to make it 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.920
 life impossible to our child genius 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.810
 said all this is up to you 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.910
 choose which of these two villains and 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.220
 antagonists deserve to move to quarters 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.250
 final the way they have to choose 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.680
 the character is through a video or 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.420
 I'm going to put two videos on screen 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.430
 and you should go to the video of 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.890
 character they want to go to rooms 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.530
 at the end of that way it will be easier 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.050
 count votes there will be time until the 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.120
