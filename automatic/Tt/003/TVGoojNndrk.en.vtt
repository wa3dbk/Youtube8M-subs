 Welcome to the channel dedicated to the world 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.470
 apple today we are going to show you how 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.330
 turn off the sound to the camera or because 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 could also say how to mute 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.549
 the camera the procedure is very easy 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.680
 of doing they look for different 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.600
 methods I went around the camera a lot 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.230
 to all functions and almost not 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.960
 he managed to find the joke can be done 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.189
 but first we invite you to subscribe to

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.570
 of the new tutorial videos of the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.270
 japan devices and iphone phone 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.440
 where it says subscribe that are red 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.570
 I subscribe subscription is completely 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.480
 free and that can give us questions 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.700
 comments suggestions to silence 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.590
 shutter the camera or mute the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.629
 camera you do not have to download any 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.969
 program or any application is very 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.770
 easy let's see how it is first that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.860
 I'm going to show you what the sound is 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.860
 of the camera normally listen well 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.870
 and if the dream we want to silence the 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.940
 more common and more normal is that the 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.170
 people try to lower the volume to 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.760
 phone making us leave here and 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.540
 the volume is caved in this way by 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.340
 entering through it the options of 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.520
 notification that are below 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.620
 and sliding all this down and 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.260
 this way 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.990
 although you do not believe it, that is not the 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.590
 way to do it because if we go down 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.070
 of the volume there the sound does not 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.080
 will disappear is still there that is not the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.530
 way to do it 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.940
 let's go out again we're going to see 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.190
 another thing that also people like that 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.840
 nor is it effective is to lower the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.140
 phone up to the volume with the button 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.140
 sideways 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.850
 that way it does not work here either 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.850
 we go down is just a little bit 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.370
 to the end is heard in the idea for 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.170
 mute the camera is not to lower these 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.710
 volumes so let's go back be the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.540
 will go up again for you to see 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.810
 we think again more raise the volume 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.530
 over here and we're going to increase the volume by 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.510
 here 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.850
 the procedure is very simple is 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.280
 too easy so do not hit the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.580
 is just here next to the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.880
 This solution has iphone5 s the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.209
 here a little button that can slide 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.860
 is on top of the volume buttons if 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.830
 you move it down in this case 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.890
 on the iphone 5 it is and immediately it comes out 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.569
 this says a notice that the phone is left 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.230
 completely silenced we can 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.480
 return it moved up to team 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.420
 the phone remained with sound and if 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.650
 world down was left by telephone 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.970
 completely silenced 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.160
 simply moving this case quoted 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.420
 which is physical at this moment here 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.580
 with red means that the phone 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.590
 it was almost silenced we can silence 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.520
 the shutter of the camera we are going to do 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.320
 the proof 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.160
 let's enter the camera again and 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.160
 let's do several shots 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.680
 how can you see that none of these 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.159
 shots 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.890
 the camera sounds so easy and simple without 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.370
 no application without any adjustment of 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.769
 configuration or without giving it so many laps 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.019
 we can mute the shutter of the 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.519
 camera or sound the camera that was 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.440
