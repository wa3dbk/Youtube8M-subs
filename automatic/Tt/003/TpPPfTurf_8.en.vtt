00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.540
 dear minecraft friends yes i am on 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.120
 another server in one 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.759
 server notorious server muffy force 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.299
 will not know each other now 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.039
 wonder what this is here and indeed 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:22.400
 I wanted to think of something else and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:26.010
 though players and a round jumpen that 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.990
 What I am good at, I say 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.470
 I'm not that professional now 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.740
 but you can quite like them all 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.740
 I should say 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.129
 I've done less in video technology 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.780
 That's why on the last time 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.219
 jump'n'run the main thing is coming 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.539
 again what comes again something and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.620
 then quickly to jordan we do 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.539
 now a round jump run now 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.739
 but I still have and yes why 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.649
 Should not I play again? 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:02.160
 I say now hey babe everything 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:05.030
 well so yes they say so little 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.340
 currently come in my server now 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.130
 Channel comes to me I thought I'll do it now 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
 as I said even if it is only short 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.049
 follow I will probably just from 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.280
 I think nudged slightly full heard 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.060
 I thought so let's do one 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 round ran that makes course so 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.020
 from fun, I say now and I have 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.460
 the first one made equal when I am 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.460
 versah or shortly before the end dirty 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.080
 this jump'n'run I make myself sometimes 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.430
 justifies it both done and that 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.710
 I knew that's before the end yet 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.710
 I'm trying my best job 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.250
 master but in my something and 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.330
 There is not much going on right now 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.980
 server that's why you can here as 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.410
 record very well because it is fun too 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.200
 If less is going on then you have 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.100
 also his peace and you will not get away from it 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.810
 disturbed the other 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.770
 Now I have the first claim already 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:11.220
 packed profi jump nothing for me honestly 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.220
 not an elite 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.240
 I'm not an elite, not a hero, not even me 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.790
 was here like youtube but it 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.530
 I do not care because it does 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.630
 That's why I'm doing so well 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.090
 Now a jump'n'run wants to show how 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.730
 the server is like that too 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.340
 muffy kress.de means the ip it goes 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.410
 Of course not only that but the tcs 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.330
 notorious for his chips that have that 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.690
 now the sleeves changed a lot as well 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.310
 other things than sams but that is 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.020
 something as I said notorious for his 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.780
 jumps and yes why should you? 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.980
 not only dreaming round and my round 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.470
 make jump'n'run like me now 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.850
 but just try somehow therefore 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.590
 also has a lot as you can see and he 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.340
 Very good what was going on with 17 players on 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.390
 the whole server and 13 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.010
 falls just in the jump you have to 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.520
 Imagine though he is right now 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.080
 right now 11 o'clock have something to me 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.489
 very much amazed that so much still on 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.489
 this server is going on at 11 o'clock 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.930
 and I like the server very well 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.930
 even 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.879
 It compared the next jobs when I was 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.790
 I can show you that now 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.819
 even a jump'n'run if I times 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.080
 manage to tackle the year 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.410
 I also like the battlefield 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.310
 But then show it with the one 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.950
 Dude together 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.380
 I will not know how much before that 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.790
 because players no longer play alone 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.500
 Battlefield only if I have the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.640
 mission again, I'll start doing 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.910
 maybe not again from the beginning 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.510
 with the missions and then can you 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:58.840
 Round the mission also show 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:02.769
 I just can not stand it anymore 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.880
 always shit this top event earlier 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.170
 has almost made it to the end 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.989
 but I can not even do it now 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.370
 The beginning is full of fun now 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.200
 but currently my mouse is also running 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.549
 not so good at recording what me 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.579
 also very surprised because you have to go through 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.510
 Do not jump and do not get the job 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.300
 Here you can relax a bit 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.539
 Rest was not completely here this time 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.539
 down 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.190
 unrolled horny already funny I want 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.470
 to create this top event 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.630
 I'm right right now 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.140
 glad that this cabinet necessarily 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.040
 I want to create what do I do for 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.670
 this job ever this top event 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.830
 create 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.940
 then i can show you that 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.410
 Next year we will show first 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.300
 fully flawless this top event 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.590
 break up 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.010
 but I'll tell you I'll do it now 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.990
 that the last something before this 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.420
 video takes three years because I yes 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.710
 we've started already 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.860
 just now if I go down now 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.660
 fall so if I fall down then 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.190
 I hear what suits me today, of course 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.710
 very suspicious because I necessarily 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.030
 I want to do this jump 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.520
 be careful that no one now 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.620
 comes because we have 23 clock right now 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.510
 well I would have like two would 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.919
 like to make the end but still 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.960
 Unfortunately, I can not do it anymore 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:44.100
 Once packaged you're shitting because of me 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.950
 yes so rare on muffy power games is 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.890
 it mostly so Hejl all recent 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.380
 jump before the a mafia not stand 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.090
 get 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.250
 Well, we'll see you next time 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.870
 at germany.de and the fancy 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.310
 is a thumbs up and writes it 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:07.410
 then I 'll do something again 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:09.419
 should such a jump'n'run again that in 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.580
 jump'n'run that was the one now 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.690
 actually more jump'n runs if 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.370
 you can even like it on the 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.120
 server fences and yes to the next 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.120
 times people skin out
