because<00:00:09.120> last<00:00:09.360> night<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.660> walked<00:00:10.139> up<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.709> it<00:00:10.740> and

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:11.129 
because last night I walked up to it and

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.909 
because last night I walked up to it and
there<00:00:11.910> was<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> little<00:00:12.389> bubble<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.559> paint

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:13.919 
there was a little bubble in the paint

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.850 
there was a little bubble in the paint
and<00:00:14.249> I<00:00:14.369> picked<00:00:14.789> it<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.530> came<00:00:16.530> off

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
and I picked it and it just came off

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.040 
and I picked it and it just came off
like<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.430> was<00:00:17.460> nothing<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.320> because

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
like it was nothing and it's because

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.540 
like it was nothing and it's because
oil-based<00:00:22.050> paint<00:00:22.530> was<00:00:24.470> added<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.650> latex<00:00:26.190> paint

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
oil-based paint was added to latex paint

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.050 
oil-based paint was added to latex paint
and<00:00:26.790> it<00:00:26.880> doesn't<00:00:27.270> stick<00:00:27.690> so<00:00:28.680> I'm<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.850> to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and it doesn't stick so I'm going to

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.560 
and it doesn't stick so I'm going to
peel<00:00:30.360> this<00:00:30.600> off<00:00:31.430> when<00:00:32.430> Kevin<00:00:32.820> gets<00:00:33.030> home<00:00:33.270> he

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570

leaving<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.540> wood<00:02:45.100> like<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.280> was<00:02:46.600> but<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:48.440> will

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
leaving the wood like it was but it will

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.390 
leaving the wood like it was but it will
make<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.920> hallway<00:02:49.370> really<00:02:49.850> dark<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.510> there's

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
make the hallway really dark and there's

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.440 
make the hallway really dark and there's
three<00:02:52.400> other<00:02:52.640> doors<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.890> they<00:02:55.160> would<00:02:56.060> need<00:02:56.420> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
three other doors and they would need to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.270 
three other doors and they would need to
be<00:02:56.660> refinished<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.470> they<00:02:57.560> would<00:02:57.709> be<00:02:57.860> just<00:02:58.130> as

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
be refinished and they would be just as

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.949 
be refinished and they would be just as
dark<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.730> would<00:02:58.820> make<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.269> hallway<00:02:59.600> really

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
dark it would make it the hallway really

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.620 
dark it would make it the hallway really
dark<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:00.950> we're<00:03:01.250> just<00:03:01.489> going<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.790> repaint<00:03:02.450> to

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.119 
is smaller than the one that was on here
before<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.560> we<00:03:47.680> have<00:03:47.859> to<00:03:48.069> cover<00:03:48.400> in<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:48.730> holes

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.449 
okay I have started priming the door and
it<00:03:54.579> looks<00:03:54.849> really<00:03:55.540> ugly<00:03:55.780> when<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:56.260> Prem<00:03:56.680> and

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
it looks really ugly when you Prem and

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.229 
it looks really ugly when you Prem and
you<00:03:57.760> can<00:03:57.969> see<00:03:58.209> through<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.790> just<00:04:01.060> looks

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
you can see through it and it just looks

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.970 
you can see through it and it just looks
like<00:04:01.329> it's<00:04:01.599> gonna<00:04:01.719> be<00:04:01.959> terrible<00:04:02.469> but<00:04:02.829> then

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
like it's gonna be terrible but then

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.369 
like it's gonna be terrible but then
once<00:04:03.189> you<00:04:03.370> paint<00:04:03.670> you'll<00:04:04.359> cover<00:04:04.629> all<00:04:04.900> this<00:04:05.109> up

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.949 
once you paint you'll cover all this up
and<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.769> won't<00:04:05.889> even<00:04:06.099> know<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:06.370> it's<00:04:06.670> there

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
and you won't even know that it's there

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.039 
and you won't even know that it's there
but<00:04:07.959> this<00:04:08.109> will<00:04:08.319> help<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.829> paint<00:04:09.189> to<00:04:10.049> be

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
but this will help the paint to be

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.649 
but this will help the paint to be
darker<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.889> stick<00:04:12.549> better<00:04:12.790> stick<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.419> the<00:04:13.510> old

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
darker and stick better stick to the old

darker and stick better stick to the old
paint<00:04:14.669> this<00:04:15.669> is<00:04:15.849> the<00:04:16.000> door<00:04:16.209> after<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.810> primer

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
paint this is the door after the primer

paint this is the door after the primer
has<00:04:17.320> dried<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.870> have<00:04:20.169> gone<00:04:20.410> over<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:21.009> with

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
has dried and I have gone over it with

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.180 
has dried and I have gone over it with
the<00:04:21.910> white<00:04:22.150> on<00:04:22.509> the<00:04:22.690> edge<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.410> up<00:04:23.710> at<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.919> top

the white on the edge and up at the top

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.180 
the white on the edge and up at the top
and<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:25.660> can<00:04:25.870> tell<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.139> it's<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:26.740> covering

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
and you can tell that it's it's covering

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.820 
and you can tell that it's it's covering
that<00:04:27.490> primer<00:04:28.330> right<00:04:28.660> up<00:04:28.900> covering<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:29.590> door

that primer right up covering that door

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.249 
that primer right up covering that door
up<00:04:30.039> so<00:04:30.849> it<00:04:31.060> doesn't<00:04:31.090> have<00:04:31.599> to<00:04:31.750> look<00:04:31.900> perfect

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
up so it doesn't have to look perfect

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.520 

and<00:06:13.990> this<00:06:14.530> is<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:15.009> finished<00:06:15.400> bathroom<00:06:15.669> door

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530

the<00:06:17.530> paint<00:06:17.860> is<00:06:18.069> a<00:06:18.099> little<00:06:18.250> different<00:06:18.849> from

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
the paint is a little different from

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.600 
the paint is a little different from
this<00:06:19.180> from<00:06:20.020> in<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.259> hallway<00:06:20.650> but<00:06:20.860> that's<00:06:21.009> okay

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
this from in the hallway but that's okay

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.450 
this from in the hallway but that's okay
I'll<00:06:21.789> worry<00:06:22.030> about<00:06:22.150> that<00:06:22.479> later<00:06:22.750> but<00:06:23.590> I<00:06:23.979> love

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
I'll worry about that later but I love

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.870 
I'll worry about that later but I love
the<00:06:24.639> new<00:06:24.789> knob<00:06:25.090> and<00:06:25.509> the<00:06:25.930> plate<00:06:26.229> and<00:06:26.710> I<00:06:27.639> think

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
the new knob and the plate and I think

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.640 
the new knob and the plate and I think
the<00:06:28.060> door<00:06:28.300> looks<00:06:28.690> much<00:06:29.110> better<00:06:29.410> than<00:06:29.860> it<00:06:30.009> did

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
the door looks much better than it did

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.699 
the door looks much better than it did
no<00:06:32.650> more<00:06:32.919> bubbled<00:06:33.370> paint
