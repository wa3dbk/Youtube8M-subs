00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:25.090
 hello friends at the moment today's feb we 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.250
 we are emphasizing a theme of 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.109
 extremely important for the movement 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.030
 Brazilian spiritist 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:36.430
 the agenda of the ordinary meeting of the council 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.809
 federation national federation 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:46.030
 spiritist for this year the month 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:49.750
 of November 2014 was defined and already 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.760
 we have informed since the month of February the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:58.809
 27 state federative entities that the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.370
 main theme of the cfm agenda will be the 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:08.500
 child and family in the spiritist center 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:12.789
 However, for the purpose of drawing up 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:17.080
 for this cfn staff we are 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:20.500
 suggesting that the level of 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.459
 participation so that there is good 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.860
 collective elaboration of a project that is 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:29.470
 necessary for our movement 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.149
 our suggestion is that entities 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.759
 States in elaborating 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.849
 subsidies proposed for this issue not 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.119
 if circumscribe go to the departments of 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:47.349
 childhood and youth because children and 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.200
 family are themes that permeate the 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:52.989
 various actions of the spiritist center 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.660
 in these conditions what we are 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:58.660
 requesting and suggesting is that 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.739
 states or are 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:06.310
 the various departments that 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:07.810
 the theme of the child and the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.170
 family theme 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.330
 we can not forget that a family 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.880
 when you search when you reach the center 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.220
 spiritist printed by some 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.510
 need for support and guidance 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.390
 can be inclusive 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.439
 with the child with childhood 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.950
 she may need the care 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:32.950
 spirit of fraternal attention can 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.819
 need psychic support may 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.269
 need guidance on topics of 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.750
 conversation may need to 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:47.260
 guidance including support for the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.370
 own process of evangelization of the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.370
 childhood without talking about the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.609
 Differences that are all over Brazil 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.090
 according to the regions and we have to 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.280
 begin to understand the diversity of 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.900
 our country 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.819
 under these conditions we have children who 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:15.250
 they attend the spiritist movement of a 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:19.599
 social band that needs larger 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.629
 educational attention partner as we have 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.129
 children in other tracks 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.889
 social 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.730
 So we have to know what the 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.780
 target audience what is the need 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.480
 of those children 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.419
 all this means that we can not 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.609
 have a single proposal for the 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.870
 care for children and the 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.019
 family care 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.010
 we have to have broad proposals with 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.239
 doctrinal basis more appropriate to these 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.049
 realities 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.930
 hence the reason for this request 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:04:00.870
 these subsidies reach the council 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:05.500
 national federation based on 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:08.709
 discussions under discussion and integrated 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.319
 we talk a lot about being integral 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.169
 we have to start thinking about 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.599
 proposals in the spiritist movement that 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:19.510
 support your integral service 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.539
 since childhood and today we already have 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.400
 even in brazil 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.190
 such as the evangelization of the 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.030
 baby that started in the federation 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.140
 spiritist of the state of goiÃ¡s 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.720
 I therefore see the diversity that exists 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:39.530
 we therefore have these proposals 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.560
 until July 31 sent to 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.820
 the national federative council of 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.820
 Brazilian Spiritist Federation
