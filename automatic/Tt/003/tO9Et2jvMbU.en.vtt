00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
to keep them covered with plastic while

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.729 
to keep them covered with plastic while
you're<00:00:48.690> working<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> piece<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you're working on a piece on the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.680 
you're working on a piece on the
potter's<00:00:49.980> wheel<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.210> does<00:00:51.480> this

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
potter's wheel so what this does this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479 
potter's wheel so what this does this
will<00:00:51.840> keep<00:00:51.989> moisture<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.649> because<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> only

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
will keep moisture in because it only

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.250 
will keep moisture in because it only
takes<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.910> little<00:00:53.940> bit<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.690> little<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.039> air

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
takes a little bit a little bit of air

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.630 
takes a little bit a little bit of air
to<00:00:58.760> put<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.629> puts<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.340> hard

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I like to I wedge this out I like to use

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.940 
I like to I wedge this out I like to use
the<00:01:21.600> cone<00:01:21.810> shape<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:22.619> what<00:01:22.799> we're

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the cone shape because that's what we're

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.030 
the cone shape because that's what we're
going<00:01:23.159> after<00:01:23.310> anyways<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.590> step<00:01:25.860> we're

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
going after anyways so this step we're

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.590 
going after anyways so this step we're
going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> learn<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.580> seal<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.270> clay

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
going to learn how to seal your clay

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
going to learn how to seal your clay
onto<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.560> bat<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:29.040> already<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.549> wheel

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
onto the bat that's already on the wheel

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.810 
onto the bat that's already on the wheel
head<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> clay<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> try<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.670> in

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
head so I take the clay I try to get in

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.429 
head so I take the clay I try to get in
the<00:01:32.970> center<00:01:33.299> someplace<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.750> give<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> wop

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the center someplace just give it a wop

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.130 
the center someplace just give it a wop
down<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> second<00:01:35.579> thing<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.790> doo<00:01:35.960> wop<00:01:36.960> it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
down like that second thing I doo wop it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.249 
down like that second thing I doo wop it
down<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.759> now<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.750> clay<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.020> pretty

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
down like that now the clay is pretty

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.219 
down like that now the clay is pretty
sticky<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.610> Formica<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.750> sure<00:01:43.200> enough

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
sticky on this Formica but sure enough

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.050 
sticky on this Formica but sure enough
if<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.710> don't<00:01:43.890> seal<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> clay<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:45.000> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
if I don't seal it the clay is going to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.940 
if I don't seal it the clay is going to
come<00:01:45.420> off<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:45.990> putting<00:01:46.200> pressure<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
come off as I'm putting pressure on it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.950

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
water get the clay wet a little bit hold

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.249 
water get the clay wet a little bit hold
my<00:01:53.310> hands<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:54.119> slick<00:01:54.420> hold<00:01:55.170> my

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
my hands can be really slick hold my

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
my hands can be really slick hold my
hand<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.619> top<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> little<00:01:56.070> bit<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.369> pressure<00:01:56.579> not

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
hand on top a little bit of pressure not

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.789 
hand on top a little bit of pressure not
a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> my<00:01:58.200> fingers<00:01:58.590> from<00:01:58.740> my

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
a lot but take one of my fingers from my

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.630 
a lot but take one of my fingers from my

the<00:02:02.759> bat<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.979> helps<00:02:05.369> seal<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the bat and in and this helps seal the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.520 
the bat and in and this helps seal the
clay<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:07.190> your<00:02:08.190> bat
