00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
so I guess what you guys have to do is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 
so I guess what you guys have to do is
look<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.630> location<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.140> know<00:01:13.380> exactly

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
look for the location or know exactly

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.200 
look for the location or know exactly
where<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> location<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> island<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
where the location is on the island and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
where the location is on the island and
then<00:01:15.960> let<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.710> comments<00:01:17.189> on
