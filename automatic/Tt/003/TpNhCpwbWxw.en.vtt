00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
played like I said I played on this map

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.740 
played like I said I played on this map
twice<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:50.340> two<00:00:50.579> hours<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:51.239> people

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
twice in like two hours because people

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.869 
twice in like two hours because people
would<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.230> vote<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> only

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
would not vote for it and the only

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
would not vote for it and the only
reason<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.270> played<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.840> twice<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.260> because

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
reason I played on it twice is because

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.430 
reason I played on it twice is because
actually<00:00:56.039> kept<00:00:56.699> leaving<00:00:56.969> games<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.350> i

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
actually kept leaving games just so i

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.369 
actually kept leaving games just so i
could<00:00:58.500> find<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> game<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.670> was<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:01.350> know

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
could find the game that was you know

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.349 
could find the game that was you know
was<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> play<00:01:02.010> course<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.760> hopefully

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359

and<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:23.070> kept<00:01:23.369> getting<00:01:23.520> killed<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.210> kept<00:01:24.659> not

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and I kept getting killed I kept not

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
and I kept getting killed I kept not
finding<00:01:25.860> anyone<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> did<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.390> in

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
finding anyone and when I did it was in

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.149 
finding anyone and when I did it was in
my<00:01:27.689> close<00:01:27.900> quarters<00:01:28.229> situation<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:28.950> that's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
my close quarters situation so that's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.200 
my close quarters situation so that's
definitely<00:01:29.340> not<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> want<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> play

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
definitely not the way you want to play

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.340 
definitely not the way you want to play
it<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.659> want<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.869> play<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it the way you want to play it is the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.550 
it the way you want to play it is the
way<00:01:31.470> I'm<00:01:31.560> playing<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.909> staying<00:01:33.119> on

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
way I'm playing it here just staying on

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
way I'm playing it here just staying on
pretty<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.009> right<00:01:35.280> side<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> map<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
pretty much the right side of the map is

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.850 
pretty much the right side of the map is
where<00:01:36.420> all<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> action<00:01:37.079> happens<00:01:37.320> that's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
where all the action happens that's
