to release this and jump yourself up a

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.170 
to release this and jump yourself up a
little<00:02:27.170> bit<00:02:27.290> higher<00:02:27.760> possibly<00:02:28.760> doing<00:02:29.060> a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
little bit higher possibly doing a

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.510 
little bit higher possibly doing a
double<00:02:29.510> jump<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.230> jump<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:31.190> will<00:02:31.340> need<00:02:31.490> to

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
double jump to the jump you will need to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.000 
double jump to the jump you will need to
learn<00:02:31.760> how<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.090> do<00:02:32.390> these<00:02:32.600> abilities<00:02:32.990> as<00:02:33.590> you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
learn how to do these abilities as you

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.370 
learn how to do these abilities as you
go<00:02:34.220> along<00:02:34.340> in<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:34.940> game<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.540> these<00:02:35.960> sea

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
go along in this game and these sea

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.170 
go along in this game and these sea
power<00:02:36.620> ups<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.280> will<00:02:37.430> need<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.730> learn<00:02:37.850> how<00:02:38.030> to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
power ups you will need to learn how to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.960 
power ups you will need to learn how to
use<00:02:38.240> these<00:02:38.570> properly<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.620> wish<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:39.970> forget

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
use these properly you wish to forget

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.480 
use these properly you wish to forget
the<00:02:41.420> more<00:02:41.690> difficult<00:02:41.870> higher<00:02:42.500> intermediate

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
the more difficult higher intermediate

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:52.020 
the more difficult higher intermediate
and<00:02:43.640> advanced<00:02:44.390> levels

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.830 

so<00:02:53.030> we'll<00:02:53.269> go<00:02:53.480> ahead<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:54.190> go<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:56.000> much

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
so we'll go ahead and go to a much

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.119 
so we'll go ahead and go to a much
easier<00:02:57.700> or<00:02:59.170> much<00:03:00.170> more<00:03:00.200> difficult<00:03:00.709> level<00:03:03.129> so

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
easier or much more difficult level so

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.580 
easier or much more difficult level so
you<00:03:04.220> can<00:03:04.519> see<00:03:04.819> just<00:03:05.540> how<00:03:05.690> hard<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.170> can<00:03:06.200> get

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
you can see just how hard it can get

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.979 
you can see just how hard it can get
this<00:03:07.129> is<00:03:07.310> still<00:03:07.549> on<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.909> beginner<00:03:08.269> course<00:03:08.569> and

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
this is still on the beginner course and

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.289 
this is still on the beginner course and
it<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.590> still<00:03:09.829> warming<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.549> up<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> game

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
it is still warming you up to the game

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.050 
it is still warming you up to the game
but<00:03:12.230> some<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.040> these<00:03:13.190> courses<00:03:13.819> can<00:03:14.000> be

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
but some of these courses can be

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:23.710 
but some of these courses can be
difficult<00:03:14.480> i<00:03:15.019> will<00:03:15.409> show<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:15.680> why<00:03:21.099> as<00:03:22.599> you<00:03:23.599> can

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
difficult i will show you why as you can

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.110 
difficult i will show you why as you can
see<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.079> timer<00:03:24.379> is<00:03:24.620> ticking<00:03:24.650> up<00:03:25.579> higher<00:03:26.090> and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
see that timer is ticking up higher and

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
see that timer is ticking up higher and
higher<00:03:26.569> as<00:03:27.109> you<00:03:27.349> go<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.970> your<00:03:28.970> job<00:03:29.299> is<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.870> get

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
higher as you go and your job is to get

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.050 
higher as you go and your job is to get
through<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:30.950> as<00:03:31.250> quick<00:03:31.640> as<00:03:31.819> possible

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
through this as quick as possible

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.569 
through this as quick as possible
without<00:03:32.569> falling<00:03:33.349> if<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:33.680> fall<00:03:33.980> your<00:03:34.310> timer

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
without falling if you fall your timer

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.899 
without falling if you fall your timer
continues<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.420> your<00:03:35.450> reset<00:03:36.489> making<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.640> almost

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
continues in your reset making it almost

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:48.580 
continues in your reset making it almost
impossible<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.989> get<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.260> gold<00:03:39.530> ring

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:04:17.310 

let's<00:03:49.590> do<00:03:49.769> an<00:03:49.890> intermediate<00:03:50.519> level<00:03:50.849> here

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.290 

super<00:04:18.320> jump<00:04:20.200> as<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:22.160> can<00:04:22.520> see<00:04:22.670> this<00:04:22.850> combines

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
super jump as you can see this combines

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.450 
super jump as you can see this combines
a<00:04:23.600> lot<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:23.990> things<00:04:24.320> you've<00:04:24.590> learned<00:04:24.740> in<00:04:25.280> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
a lot of things you've learned in the

a lot of things you've learned in the
beginner<00:04:25.820> levels<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.600> throws<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:26.930> into<00:04:27.290> a

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
beginner levels and throws you into a

super<00:04:43.790> jump<00:04:44.620> still<00:04:45.620> cleared<00:04:47.260> very<00:04:48.260> well<00:04:48.530> even

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
super jump still cleared very well even

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.410 
super jump still cleared very well even
though<00:04:49.070> i<00:04:49.100> have<00:04:49.430> already<00:04:49.700> cleared<00:04:50.120> these

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
though i have already cleared these

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:58.450 
though i have already cleared these
levels<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.470> much<00:04:51.680> higher<00:04:51.950> time<00:04:57.010> i'll<00:04:58.010> do<00:04:58.220> one

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
levels in a much higher time i'll do one

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.200 
levels in a much higher time i'll do one
more<00:04:58.700> quick<00:04:59.030> level<00:05:00.310> many<00:05:01.310> levels<00:05:01.640> have<00:05:02.030> you

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
more quick level many levels have you

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.270 
more quick level many levels have you
collecting<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:02.870> certain<00:05:03.230> amount<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.710> something

collecting a certain amount of something

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.750 
collecting a certain amount of something
before<00:05:04.730> you<00:05:04.760> can<00:05:05.060> progress<00:05:05.830> on<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.460> next

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
tackle hill without any speed it will

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.200 
tackle hill without any speed it will
not<00:06:19.169> work<00:06:19.470> you<00:06:19.770> need<00:06:19.979> a<00:06:20.009> negative<00:06:21.979> and<00:06:23.210> then

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
not work you need a negative and then

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.540 
not work you need a negative and then
once<00:06:24.539> you<00:06:24.690> have<00:06:24.870> all<00:06:24.900> these<00:06:25.320> gems<00:06:25.680> it's<00:06:26.039> your
