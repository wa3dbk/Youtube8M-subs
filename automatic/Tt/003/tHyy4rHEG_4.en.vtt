this actually helps you clean the device

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.929 
this actually helps you clean the device
first<00:01:06.540> before<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.280> put<00:01:08.280> everything<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.729> it

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.300 
and that is I guess what it had come in
and<00:01:11.549> must<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.880> fallen<00:01:12.030> out

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and oh look at that I think this is yeah

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.870 
and oh look at that I think this is yeah
there<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.710> there's<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> coup<00:01:20.490> de<00:01:20.610> Gras
