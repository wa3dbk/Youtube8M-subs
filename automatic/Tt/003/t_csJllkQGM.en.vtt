Hello fellow pianists

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:07.390
Today's topic is unions

00:00:07.565 --> 00:00:10.107
not LGBT unions, cause we're not there yet!

00:00:10.238 --> 00:00:12.657
but we'll be bringing together the bass line 

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.774
from Stevie Wonder's "I Wish"

00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:20.973
and the George Gerschwin melody 
"It Ain't Necessarily So"

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:24.261
from his Opera Porgy and Bess

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.616
Here's what we're gonna do

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.420
Firstly, let's play the bass line 
from the Stevie Wonder song

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.382
It goes like this

00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:53.734
Make sure you repeat the bass line long enough 
so that you're relaxed when you play it

00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:56.085
and now we're going to add a riff,

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:58.378
just like a guitar riff or a trombone riff

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.017
with the right hand, it's made of two chords

00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:10.435
Here's both of them together

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:29.562
That's the accompaniment, 
you'll have to play it over for a while to feel comfortable with it.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:34.181
Now I'll adapt Gerschwin's melody 

00:01:34.263 --> 00:01:37.679
rhythmically using a Habanera rhythm, 
it sounds like this:

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:54.740
And now, I'm going to fill in the spaces

00:01:54.812 --> 00:01:58.579
with my accompanying figure, 
so we'll be mixing melody, accompaniment and bass

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.283
as if there were three pianists

00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:02.787
don't forget, the piano is an orchestra!

00:03:03.548 --> 00:03:06.988
Afterwards, you can open up and improvise, 
which isn't easy,

00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:09.715
but there's always the blues scale:

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:15.090
C# D F G Bb G F D

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:22.163
Here's what it sounds like slower

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.179
and now

00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:32.842
Now it's your turn!

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:39.702
You're filling for both Stevie Wonder and 
George Gerschwin, so don't forget to swing!
