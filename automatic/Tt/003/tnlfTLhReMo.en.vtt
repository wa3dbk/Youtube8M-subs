to the next largest body part for

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
to the next largest body part for
example<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.830> want<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> attach<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:08.640> ends<00:01:09.060> to

the neck to the spine or the torso you
can<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.310> final<00:01:23.549> hierarchy<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.479> with

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
can see the final hierarchy here with

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.880 
can see the final hierarchy here with
limbs<00:01:25.260> and<00:01:25.470> spine<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:26.130> attached<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> hip

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.290 

lastly<00:01:33.890> I'm<00:01:34.130> going<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.430> add<00:01:34.550> a<00:01:34.580> dummy<00:01:34.910> sphere

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
lastly I'm going to add a dummy sphere

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.120 
lastly I'm going to add a dummy sphere
prop<00:01:35.570> at<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.870> axis<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.620> world<00:01:36.650> plane

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
prop at the axis of the world plane

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.100 
prop at the axis of the world plane
where<00:01:37.520> I<00:01:37.550> want<00:01:37.820> my<00:01:37.880> characters<00:01:38.420> center<00:01:38.720> axes

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
where I want my characters center axes

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.260 
where I want my characters center axes
to<00:01:39.260> be<00:01:41.950> I'm<00:01:42.950> just<00:01:43.070> going<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.520> rename<00:01:43.790> it<00:01:43.850> stone

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
to be I'm just going to rename it stone

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.150 
to be I'm just going to rename it stone
because<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.050> will<00:01:45.200> act<00:01:45.350> as<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.530> parent<00:01:45.950> prop

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
because it will act as the parent prop

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.890 
because it will act as the parent prop
for<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:46.460> whole<00:01:46.640> structure<00:01:52.420> I'll<00:01:53.420> make<00:01:53.750> sure

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
for the whole structure I'll make sure

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.660 
for the whole structure I'll make sure
that<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:54.080> attach<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.680> hips<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.160> sphere<00:01:55.550> as

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
that I attach the hips to the sphere as

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.820 
that I attach the hips to the sphere as
well<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.810> can<00:01:56.960> see<00:01:57.140> now<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.350> it's<00:01:57.710> the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
well and you can see now that it's the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:06.430 
well and you can see now that it's the
parent<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:58.460> entire<00:01:58.760> hierarchy<00:02:05.440> once

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
parent of the entire hierarchy once

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.050 
parent of the entire hierarchy once
that's<00:02:06.680> all<00:02:06.890> set<00:02:07.130> up<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.490> can<00:02:07.520> simply<00:02:08.030> press

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
that's all set up I can simply press

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.880 
that's all set up I can simply press
merge<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.170> whole<00:02:09.350> thing<00:02:09.560> will<00:02:09.679> merge

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
merge and the whole thing will merge

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:19.330 
merge and the whole thing will merge
into<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.250> single<00:02:10.340> prop<00:02:17.560> then<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.740> can<00:02:18.920> select<00:02:19.040> the
