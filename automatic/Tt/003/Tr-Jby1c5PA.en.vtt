00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
I listen to all the bolts off home made

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.509 
I listen to all the bolts off home made

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
our old eight five millimeter socket

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.720 
our old eight five millimeter socket
with<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.910> cut-down<00:00:17.240> allen<00:00:18.240> key<00:00:19.400> makes<00:00:20.400> life<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
with a cut-down allen key makes life a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.230 
with a cut-down allen key makes life a
lot<00:00:21.000> easier

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:38.260 

removing<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> bulbs<00:00:27.529> loosen<00:00:28.529> everything<00:00:28.920> off

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.220 

this<00:00:39.270> bolt<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.410> bolt<00:00:40.710> should<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.520> loose

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
this bolt and this bolt should be loose

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:54.580 
this bolt and this bolt should be loose
because<00:00:43.230> you've<00:00:43.379> taken<00:00:43.620> me<00:00:45.469> watch<00:00:46.469> cable<00:00:46.739> I'm

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.920 

now<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> first<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> did<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
now the first time I did this I have a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.740 
now the first time I did this I have a
piece<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> polystyrene<00:00:59.210> but<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> place<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
piece of polystyrene but I place the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.280 
piece of polystyrene but I place the
ball<00:01:00.899> team<00:01:02.059> in<00:01:03.059> order<00:01:03.890> all<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.220> way<00:01:05.339> around

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
ball team in order all the way around

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.660 
ball team in order all the way around
obviously<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.520> now

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
obviously I know the way it's going now

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.760 
obviously I know the way it's going now
so<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.619> don't<00:01:10.619> need<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:13.500> I'm<00:01:13.619> going

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
so I don't need to do that and I'm going

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.310 
so I don't need to do that and I'm going
to<00:01:13.860> leave<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> bolts<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> casings

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.630 

this<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> didn't<00:01:20.250> listen

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
this is the one that I didn't listen

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.690 
this is the one that I didn't listen
obviously<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.320> inside<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:23.430> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
obviously because it's inside if you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.770 
obviously because it's inside if you
have<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.090> e<00:01:24.330> model<00:01:26.270> this<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> where<00:01:27.600> your

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
have this e model this is where your

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.920 
have this e model this is where your
electric<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:30.180> electric<00:01:30.630> start<00:01:31.729> bolts<00:01:32.729> into

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.410 

actually<00:01:36.930> starts<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> back<00:01:38.420> comes

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
actually starts it's on the back comes

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
actually starts it's on the back comes
in<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:39.840> obviously<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.590> kicks<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
in but obviously it kicks out on the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:02:37.240 
in but obviously it kicks out on the
model<00:01:44.180> doesn't<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.479> it

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.030 

now<00:02:38.250> we've<00:02:38.850> got<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> neutral<00:02:39.450> cable<00:02:39.840> down<00:02:40.020> here

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.130 

crosshead<00:02:47.630> Phillips<00:02:48.650> Phillips<00:02:49.650> eyes<00:02:50.070> three

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
crosshead Phillips Phillips eyes three

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.490 
crosshead Phillips Phillips eyes three
undo<00:02:52.140> it

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:38.850 

just<00:02:55.500> pull<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.709> cable

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:53.910

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.120 

worth<00:03:54.920> its<00:03:55.130> weight<00:03:55.370> in<00:03:55.400> gold<00:03:55.989> for<00:03:56.989> this<00:03:57.140> job<00:04:00.130> if

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
worth its weight in gold for this job if

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.979 
worth its weight in gold for this job if
you<00:04:01.340> look<00:04:01.519> at<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.730> manual<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.420> tells<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:02.870> to

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
you look at the manual it tells you to

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.240 
you look at the manual it tells you to
take<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:04.640> top<00:04:04.880> end<00:04:05.090> apart<00:04:05.450> first<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:06.230> found<00:04:07.040> it

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
take the top end apart first I found it

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.930 
take the top end apart first I found it
easier

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
easier

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.479 
easier
leaving<00:04:08.660> it<00:04:08.780> together<00:04:09.109> you<00:04:09.769> I've<00:04:09.920> got<00:04:10.190> some<00:04:10.370> of

leaving it together you I've got some of

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.690 
leaving it together you I've got some of
the<00:04:10.549> compression<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.209> keep<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.569> going<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:15.700> to

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
the compression to keep you going and to

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:29.110 
the compression to keep you going and to

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
give you some bit of 19 mil socket into

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:41.140 
give you some bit of 19 mil socket into
the<00:04:29.210> wind<00:04:29.389> Eagle<00:04:31.900> connector<00:04:34.660> standard<00:04:40.150> it

the wind Eagle connector standard it

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.620 
the wind Eagle connector standard it
will<00:04:41.330> not<00:04:41.660> come<00:04:42.020> off<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.200> easy<00:04:42.650> first<00:04:43.039> time

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
will not come off that easy first time

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.690 
will not come off that easy first time
it<00:04:44.630> will<00:04:44.870> be<00:04:45.020> an<00:04:45.169> absolutely<00:04:45.650> swagging<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.520> get

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
it will be an absolutely swagging to get

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.680 
it will be an absolutely swagging to get
off<00:04:48.099> you<00:04:49.099> might<00:04:49.280> even<00:04:49.460> find<00:04:49.849> that<00:04:50.270> you're

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
off you might even find that you're

using<00:04:50.900> heat<00:04:51.260> on<00:04:51.470> it<00:04:51.789> just<00:04:52.789> to<00:04:52.940> get<00:04:53.060> it<00:04:53.210> off<00:04:53.330> now

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.940 

the<00:04:59.539> flywheel<00:04:59.990> is<00:05:00.080> going<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.260> be<00:05:00.410> an<00:05:00.500> absolute

the flywheel is going to be an absolute
Pig<00:05:01.310> again

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.439 

you<00:05:08.419> need<00:05:08.690> a<00:05:08.720> puller<00:05:10.690> ideally<00:05:11.690> -<00:05:12.380> like<00:05:12.590> Paula
