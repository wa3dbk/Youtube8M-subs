00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello this program is kr cool 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.769
 fishing and I'm sled 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.600
 today I will catch a crucian on such 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.980
 I will not catch a spot in the barley and 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.619
 the roots 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.800
 such small grandees here are three 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.890
 fishing rods this is 5 meters four with 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.150
 half 5 and 1 up bracke I took 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.570
 try on top 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.160
 like that of course it is still possible to catch 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.350
 carp but it is unlikely unlikely carp 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.890
 here is found so decomposed 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.890
 start catching 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.979
 so for a few minutes I was kicking hard 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.199
 in a row not the mafia get hooked up what kind of fish 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:49.249
 caught such a crucian saw there such 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:53.010
 just walk along the shore then we type here 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:54.929
 only such pecks just started just 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.959
 immediately abandoned immediately began and 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.670
 pecking such karasik crayons at all 

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:04.770
 now let go 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:08.400
 She's on here and moved on to another 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:14.070
 the place was first put on here 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.640
 place to option is to sing a lot 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.620
 little things for some reason I do not know 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.750
 here to you after bait small 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.790
 fed us a little roach 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.880
 Monica 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:32.040
 let such a small plotter catch 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.410
 still one little small date 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.980
 became the final point I will go now 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:42.000
 change the place of others and I will go then 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.100
 crucian hour of course I comin look for others 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.760
 stage may be bigger from going 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.430
 put a big crucian unfortunately 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.580
 such small ones do not give anything 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.490
 the ice almost immediately showing the radio on 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.650
 Donkey, too, like that, I had to eat through 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.530
 cool on and catching now on barley 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.780
 on the bait we will change the location 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.730
 so I arrived at a new place 20 years later 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.130
 minutes about here sprawling tackle on 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.460

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.000
 This day on the worm is now pecked 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.770

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 love here a lot of depth here 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.650

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.530

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.560

 there was also a bite not caught there 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.560
