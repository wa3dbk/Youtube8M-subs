00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hi, I'm a pastor, sweetheart, and I'm 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.339
 here with the challenge of responding 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.560
 questions 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.929
 I already have some here hand and we already 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.820
 Let's start straight then by listening to 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.519
 It's the question that Guilherme has to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.130
 people today more crazy with answer 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.039
 talk lightly and tied the crowd at the end 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.689
 my name is in mine carmopolis 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.970
 I would like to know how we 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.859
 I was pretending with gabriel that you're talking 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.810
 when the one where it is very 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.630
 easy to fool people through 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 words are people today have course 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.890
 to speak well of head and coast 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.719
 argued that the person and when I know 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 that one day I will attack in the voice of man 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.160
 and when the voice of God when the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 mine is talking with God's in the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.600
 heart I explained are people he is 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.539
 Thank you for your question, my challenge. 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.770
 here besides beak is to be fast because 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.170
 I have to say a lot in little 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.109
 time just to try to clarify 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.559
 Do you want to read what's here? 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.659
 Matthew 7 from well 18 which says 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.210
 tree can not bear fruit in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.979
 nor a bad tree can bear good fruit 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.280
 yet does not produce good fruit is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.900
 cut thrown fire so by the fruits 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.409
 they will know you approached and something very 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 serious the voice a man the voice of the devil and the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.409
 God 's own voice, the son recognizes the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.780
 Your father's voice 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.579
 who has the spirit of god is going 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.479
 recognize the spirit of God where he 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.670
 you are 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.460
 and you will also be able to recognize what 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.720
 it is not the spirit of god which is the rule 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.020
 golden 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.600
 the only biblical rule for us to know if 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.180
 one thing is for god or not if one thing 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.869
 comes from the Holy Spirit or is not the text 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.740
 I just read from mateus 78 good tree gives 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.290
 good or bad fruit brings bad fruit open 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.799
 none that produces nothing and fruitful 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.270
 does not bear fruit of one then you who have 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.329
 this doubt in the heart 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.789
 many people will say many things to 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.229
 man 's voice is interesting because 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.229
 when the man speaks 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.280
 two much more than an emotion but when 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.819
 God speaks, do not forget. 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.920
 When God speaks, it 's as if he had 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.060
 his words in the heart of the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.959
 people and when God speaks mainly 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.829
 if you really blame yourself 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.150
 Guilherme will not know very often if 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.970
 It is God speaking not 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.680
 immediately because we have today as 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.310
 You said people who know how to talk. 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.410
 good 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.370
 Then there will be people who will come and go. 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.920
 speak so beautiful so says go 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.040
 Talk what you have to do 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.470
 You have to look at the fruits. 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.510
 what happened has happened and you have to 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.930
 look at the bible 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.209
 The other day I saw a person with life. 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.790
 completely out of biblical standards 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.010
 and delivering prophecy to everyone 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.769
 I did not even need to hear what she had 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.799
 to say why the prophet's life has already 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.769
 was completely out of the 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.440
 You did not need to 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.540
 see you let me see if it will work 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.049
 was a person that his life already 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.200
 I condemned his speech so I was 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.379
 we have to know the following the outbreak 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.190
 will show and the bible will show now 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:38.319
 there's another secret from him we're going 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.250
 knowing the voice of people that people 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.500
 love for intimacy and with time you 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.900
 knows the story of samuel that despite 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.760
 He is born in the church and have been the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.859
 whole life inside the church he was a 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.440
 teenager inside church a child 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.930
 who did not know the voice of the Lord 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.690
 we used were pass by and the bible says 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.060
 Samuel was already close to the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.819
 sir and I knew your voice 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.049
 then knowing the voice of God is also a 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.209
 gradual process is a walk you 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.209
 read your Bible you hear 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.370
 Sermons, you're going to come, sir. 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.979
 a time that the person opens his mouth day 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.190
 you say so you have nothing to do 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.229
 this spirit is the spirit of the Bible 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.570
 she even finished speaking but why 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.710
 Why are you intimate with the voice of God? 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.450
 You know it's not you, are you? 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.680
 talking there and the opposite is also 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.290
 truth 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.170
 you see someone say you speak says 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.550
 so my god looks what god is 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.700
 talking to me 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.810
 Another day God spoke to me, strong. 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.820
 through fit of a small child 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.940
 a child was on mom's lap 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.490
 That's when the child made it to my side. 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.460
 Then I picked it up and she said it on my 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.510
 ear does not stop doing what you are 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.840
 doing now is normal a child of 4 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.780
 years to speak this is not only 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.810
 touched so moved that I saw that it was 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.650
 the man who used that life and 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:15.070
 unfortunately you have seen the opposite people 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:19.270
 quoting verse machine gun people 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.420
 voice-over feature is long and does not 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.000
 if what the person said to life was fulfilled 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.820
 of that person fell into disrepute 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.400
 then two that intimacy with him and look 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.030
 the fruits so you will know 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.560
 the voice of who is speaking 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.870

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.110
