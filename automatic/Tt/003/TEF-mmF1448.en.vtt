00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:38.080
 Today I was caught by Fever 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.080
 Thank you for visiting the press conference 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:50.600
 2015 started, but it is good 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:53.700
 Reduction of meaning population that the industry is not applied add eyes as one of are the major problems faced now 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 I can say that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.600
 Considering the future of the pachinko industry 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.560
 There are various factors 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:11.440
 Hall and throughout the manufacturer and industry 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.510
 Is it not a situation where you can not read what you are trying to do? 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.810
 During that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:26.770
 How do we go about this situation as our company 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.770
 The answer we reached after thinking about what we can do will be the bullet we will announce this time 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.560
 What is the user asking for a patin husband 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.110
 It is definitely from the large-figure wood sales expectation 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.670
 Hmm 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.670
 What is Ajiko's most enjoyable time ? 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.600
 It's definitely a jackpot moment 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.640
 It is time to hit the jackpot 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.910
 To win , No. 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.580
 There are many people who smoke 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:06.790
 In order to do that, it can not be imposed unless the jackpot is drawn 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:09.770
 It may not be the origin of the 15th rad to be easy to lose 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.210
 At the current ee Hall 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.880
 The user is crowned 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.450
 1 win 9 losses 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.460
 Here are some fans who love pachinko 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.870
 The number of visits will decrease 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.870
 3 wins 7 losses 1 minute 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.090
 4 wins 6 losses 1 minute 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:37.450
 Sometimes I need a draw 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:41.290
 It was this time What is also to be announced in order to make it happen 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.870
 This is a semi-tickets of the ground the best protection 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.870
 I decided to do it in Gundam
