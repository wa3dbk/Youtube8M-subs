it was really cool one to share it with

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.210 
it was really cool one to share it with
you<00:00:15.059> guys<00:00:15.179> because<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.690> several<00:00:16.680> reasons<00:00:16.859> one

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
you guys because of several reasons one

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.070 
you guys because of several reasons one
it<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.550> an<00:00:17.699> ice<00:00:17.910> server<00:00:18.270> hub<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:18.930> see

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
it is an ice server hub as you can see

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.109 
it is an ice server hub as you can see
but<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.350> looks<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.070> cool<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.730> love

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
but it looks really really cool I love

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.029 
but it looks really really cool I love
the<00:00:21.330> design<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.960> ice<00:00:22.080> there<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.859> also

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
the design of the ice there and I also

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.650 
the design of the ice there and I also
love<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.490> patterns<00:00:23.939> here<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.420> kind<00:00:24.630> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
love the patterns here and they kind of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.779 
love the patterns here and they kind of
like<00:00:24.810> cross<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> middle<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
like cross in the middle of this the a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.790 
like cross in the middle of this the a
little<00:00:27.480> ice<00:00:27.660> cross<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.230> kind<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.439> shoots<00:00:28.650> off

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
little ice cross that kind of shoots off

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.589 
little ice cross that kind of shoots off
and<00:00:29.010> after<00:00:29.189> these<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:29.609> cool<00:00:29.849> arms<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.539> I

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and after these really cool arms to it I

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.659 
and after these really cool arms to it I
think<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.900> looks<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:32.189> awesome<00:00:32.610> but

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
think that looks just really awesome but

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.860 
think that looks just really awesome but
the<00:00:32.759> other<00:00:32.969> reason<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.300> want<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> share<00:00:33.750> this

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the other reason I want to share this

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.200 
the other reason I want to share this
one<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.260> because<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> has<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.460> customization

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
one is because it has some customization

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.729 
one is because it has some customization
to<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.630> again<00:00:36.899> since<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> server

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
to it so again since it is a server

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.250 
to it so again since it is a server
responder<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.340> download<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:38.940> use<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
responder you can download it and use it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
responder you can download it and use it
like<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.640> here

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
like you see here with this one here

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.670 
like you see here with this one here
it's<00:00:41.940> very<00:00:42.000> easy<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.660> customize<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.200> has<00:00:43.530> these

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
it's very easy to customize it has these

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.729 
it's very easy to customize it has these
signs<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.059> float<00:00:45.300> above<00:00:45.690> each<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
signs that just float above each of the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.619 
signs that just float above each of the
doorways<00:00:47.160> here<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.000> easy<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.420> just

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
doorways here so it's very easy to just

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
doorways here so it's very easy to just
hop<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.289> put<00:00:49.500> your<00:00:49.680> own<00:00:49.910> text<00:00:50.910> up

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
hop in here and put your own text up

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.400 
hop in here and put your own text up
there<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.390> whatever<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> can

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
there and whatever you want as you can

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.930 
there and whatever you want as you can
see<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:52.860> did<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
see like they did with this here and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.310 
see like they did with this here and
there's<00:00:54.270> two<00:00:54.300> blank<00:00:54.719> ones<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.230> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
there's two blank ones and then of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
there's two blank ones and then of
course<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.620> could<00:00:55.739> probably<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.129> change

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
course you could probably just change

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.029 
course you could probably just change
all<00:00:56.550> these<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.000> still<00:00:57.719> very<00:00:57.750> cool<00:00:58.379> map<00:00:58.590> wanted

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
all these but still very cool map wanted

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
all these but still very cool map wanted
to<00:00:59.129> showcase<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.020> this

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to showcase it to you I really like this

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
to showcase it to you I really like this
now<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.590> thing<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.770> caught<00:01:01.980> my<00:01:02.070> eye<00:01:02.100> was

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
now one thing that caught my eye was

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.939 
now one thing that caught my eye was
this<00:01:02.609> there's<00:01:03.329> glass<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> icicles<00:01:04.739> kind

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
this there's glass as the icicles kind

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.560 
this there's glass as the icicles kind
of<00:01:05.010> coming<00:01:05.250> off<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> trees<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.450> was

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
of coming off the trees here it was

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.820 
of coming off the trees here it was
pretty<00:01:06.810> clever<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.260> haven't<00:01:07.650> actually

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
pretty clever I haven't actually

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.039 
pretty clever I haven't actually
personally<00:01:08.520> ever<00:01:08.700> seen<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> done<00:01:09.299> before<00:01:09.450> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
personally ever seen that done before so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.570 
personally ever seen that done before so
I<00:01:10.080> thought<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.830> interesting<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I thought that was really interesting I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.219 
I thought that was really interesting I
love<00:01:12.030> these<00:01:12.210> little<00:01:12.299> towers<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.080> again

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
love these little towers here and again

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.690 
love these little towers here and again
I<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.350> love<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> patterns<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.549> like

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I just love the patterns like this like

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.899 
I just love the patterns like this like
purple<00:01:15.420> diamond<00:01:16.380> sword<00:01:16.830> looking<00:01:17.280> thing<00:01:17.580> yeah

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
purple diamond sword looking thing yeah

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
purple diamond sword looking thing yeah
I<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.330> know<00:01:18.540> how<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> explain<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.320> really

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
I don't know how to explain it really

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
I don't know how to explain it really
but<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.100> thought<00:01:20.250> again<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> looks<00:01:21.150> really

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
but I just thought again it looks really

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.510 
but I just thought again it looks really
really<00:01:21.930> cool<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> server

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
really cool so if you do have a server

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.859 
really cool so if you do have a server
and<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.700> need<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> hub<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> good<00:01:24.750> one

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and you need a hub this is a good one

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
and you need a hub this is a good one
for<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.259> again<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.580> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
for it again you can see kind of the
