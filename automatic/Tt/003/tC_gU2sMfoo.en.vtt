00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
on well but then comes the most

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.060 
on well but then comes the most
important<00:01:57.970> step<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.750> double<00:01:59.200> pants<00:01:59.650> that's

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
important step the double pants that's

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.420 
important step the double pants that's
right<00:02:00.690> it's<00:02:01.690> time<00:02:01.930> for<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.410> double<00:02:02.830> pants<00:02:03.100> so

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
right it's time for the double pants so

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.750 
right it's time for the double pants so
I<00:02:03.700> have<00:02:03.880> one<00:02:04.060> on<00:02:04.180> already<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:06.340> takes<00:02:06.640> a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
I have one on already this takes a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.520 
I have one on already this takes a
little<00:02:06.910> bit<00:02:07.390> of<00:02:07.480> practice<00:02:07.690> believe<00:02:08.320> me

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
little bit of practice believe me

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.160 
little bit of practice believe me
because<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:09.130> gotta<00:02:09.310> get<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.760> pant<00:02:10.390> leg<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.960> go

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
because you gotta get the pant leg to go

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.480 
because you gotta get the pant leg to go
down<00:02:11.440> as<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.820> pull<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.300> other<00:02:13.540> pant<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.310> then

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
down as you pull the other pant and then

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:26.460 
down as you pull the other pant and then
you<00:02:15.640> gotta<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.920> other<00:02:24.130> pet<00:02:24.990> there<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.170> is

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
you gotta get the other pet there it is

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
you gotta get the other pet there it is
