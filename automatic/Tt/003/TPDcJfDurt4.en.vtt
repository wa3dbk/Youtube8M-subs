looking at some of the things we did the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.229 
looking at some of the things we did the
turnovers<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.579> tough<00:00:48.420> shots<00:00:49.760> you<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.910> I

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
love my team and I i love the fact that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.540 
love my team and I i love the fact that
they<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:56.789> wanted<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> win<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.780> bad<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
they they wanted to win so bad that I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270 
they they wanted to win so bad that I
thought<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.359> opinion<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:01.680> almost<00:01:01.920> couldn't

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
thought in my opinion we almost couldn't

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.440 
thought in my opinion we almost couldn't
win<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> fix<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.729> part<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.330> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
win so we have to fix that part of it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.750 
win so we have to fix that part of it
because<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.560> still<00:01:08.090> requires<00:01:09.110> great<00:01:10.110> trust<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
because it still requires great trust in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.899 
because it still requires great trust in
the<00:01:11.760> system<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.510> each<00:01:12.630> other<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.490> you<00:01:14.490> can

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the system and in each other and you can

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.399 
the system and in each other and you can
see<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> outset<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:16.020> some<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
Game five you know I thought they were

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.010 
Game five you know I thought they were
ready<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.540> go<00:01:47.690> on<00:01:48.400> if<00:01:49.400> we<00:01:49.610> if<00:01:49.880> we<00:01:49.909> supply<00:01:50.360> the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
ready to go on if we if we supply the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.889 
ready to go on if we if we supply the
pressure<00:01:51.290> we<00:01:51.619> did<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:53.210> then<00:01:53.420> after<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:53.750> I

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
pressure we did and then after that I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.690 
pressure we did and then after that I
thought<00:01:54.229> they<00:01:54.409> looked<00:01:54.649> at<00:01:54.799> it<00:01:54.950> like<00:01:55.220> hey

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700
