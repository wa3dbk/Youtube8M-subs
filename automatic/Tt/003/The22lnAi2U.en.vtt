00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
there Twila take wasn't filling up and

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.099 
there Twila take wasn't filling up and
they<00:00:04.589> said<00:00:05.400> that<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.150> valve<00:00:06.390> was<00:00:06.629> allowing<00:00:07.080> a

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
they said that the valve was allowing a

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.740 
they said that the valve was allowing a
little<00:00:07.319> bit<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.470> water<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:07.950> but<00:00:08.160> not<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> lot<00:00:09.240> and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
little bit of water in but not a lot and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.660 
little bit of water in but not a lot and
they<00:00:10.320> weren't<00:00:10.500> quite<00:00:10.769> sure<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:11.070> what<00:00:11.519> was

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
they weren't quite sure of what was

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.150 
they weren't quite sure of what was
taking<00:00:11.820> place<00:00:12.000> but<00:00:12.540> when<00:00:13.290> actually<00:00:13.710> was<00:00:13.889> was

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
taking place but when actually was was

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.010 
taking place but when actually was was
the<00:00:14.280> flapper<00:00:14.610> down<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:16.250> handle<00:00:18.020> there's

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the flapper down here the handle there's

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.540 
the flapper down here the handle there's
to<00:00:19.140> push<00:00:19.320> down<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:20.039> bit<00:00:20.160> too<00:00:20.279> hard

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
to push down and a little bit too hard

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.470 
to push down and a little bit too hard
and<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:22.100> tilted<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> up<00:00:23.369> too<00:00:23.580> far<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.390> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and it tilted it up too far so that it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.120 
and it tilted it up too far so that it
wouldn't<00:00:24.660> allow<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.930> flapper<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.619> drop<00:00:25.859> down

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
wouldn't allow the flapper to drop down

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.859 
wouldn't allow the flapper to drop down
as<00:00:26.640> soon<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.060> got<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.420> could<00:00:27.599> tell<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
as soon as I got here I could tell the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.990 
as soon as I got here I could tell the
chain<00:00:28.250> was<00:00:29.250> fairly<00:00:30.439> snug<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.160> there<00:00:32.820> should

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
chain was fairly snug and there should

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.209 
chain was fairly snug and there should
be<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> little<00:00:33.390> bit<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.660> slack<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.070> could

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
be a little bit of slack if you could

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.160 
be a little bit of slack if you could

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.670 
ballcock now as i get close to Milano
just<00:02:37.450> put<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.170> pills<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.650> back<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:40.680> down

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
just put the pills out back on the down

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.360 
just put the pills out back on the down
stand<00:02:42.130> by

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.360 

and<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:49.420> shouldn't<00:02:49.870> be<00:02:50.110> shutting<00:02:50.799> off<00:02:50.950> by

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
and that shouldn't be shutting off by

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.490 
and that shouldn't be shutting off by
now<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:53.440> actually<00:02:53.709> not<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:55.750> was<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> screw<00:02:56.379> on

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
now is actually not it was a screw on

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.820 
now is actually not it was a screw on
top<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:57.040> the<00:03:00.120> no<00:03:01.120> chest<00:03:01.450> operated<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.170> rim

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.140 
top of the no chest operated the rim
which<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.400> little<00:03:03.940> too<00:03:04.120> high<00:03:04.360> for<00:03:04.720> me

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
which is a little too high for me

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.369 
which is a little too high for me
there's<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.209> screw<00:03:07.599> rate<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:07.989> top<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.319> the

there's a screw rate of the top of the

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.619 
there's a screw rate of the top of the
ball<00:03:08.829> so<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:09.730> actually<00:03:09.819> two<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.209> them<00:03:10.390> the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
little brass screw that's when i was

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.350 
little brass screw that's when i was
talking<00:04:15.290> about<00:04:15.740> that<00:04:16.100> prevents<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.880> flappers

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
talking about that prevents the flappers

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.210 
talking about that prevents the flappers
and<00:04:17.510> he<00:04:17.630> dropped<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.200> ball<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.890> dropping

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
and he dropped the ball and dropping

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.830 
and he dropped the ball and dropping
down<00:04:19.340> too<00:04:19.580> far<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.090> stopping<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.570> flapper

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
from actually receding and it's this

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.300 
from actually receding and it's this
larger<00:04:25.250> white<00:04:25.490> one<00:04:26.140> that<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:27.350> use<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.620> adjust

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
larger white one that you use to adjust
