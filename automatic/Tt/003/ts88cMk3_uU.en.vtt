00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.490
 when Easter comes is the time of 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.520
 making the monas always had made them 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.490
 with the traditional formula the same as 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.560
 I had my mother and my mother-in-law but this time 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.289
 you made it with sourdough this is the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.480
 appearance of the dough first of all 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.179
 we put the milk on the fire with a 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.539
 lemon rind and cinnamon me in this 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:31.050
 I have put youtube 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.329
 Then he added the sugar to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 dissolve it with hot milk because 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.600
 so it's easier to incorporate it later 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.719
 to the mass once we give it enough 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.190
 turns and we have dissolved him we will beat him 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.940
 well the eggs and we will also add them 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.940
 to this liquid 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.190
 Once the milk and add diaz 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.250
 the yeast in this case are 50 grams 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.290
 well undone once we have it 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.750
 incorporated into warm milk is the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.600
 time to also add the eggs 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.909
 shakes and then we will throw everything 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.330
 about the sourdough that rests in the 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.330
 cambuche 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.329
 we also add the oil to the eggs 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.329
 that I had forgotten to tell you 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.540
 until all the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.850
 ingredients when we see that everything is 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.270
 perfectly mixed is when 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.479
 we started adding flour 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.820
 the quantity is kilo and a half but I 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.880
 I begin by adding it little by little until 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.670
 see that the dough accepts the flour 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.860
 necessary if we see that you need more then 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.620
 it is added but with a kilo and a half it will be 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.020
 enough 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.530
 once we have it for 20 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.950
 minutes kneading this is the aspect that 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.070
 must have the mass 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.740
 Oiling our hands will come out 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.899
 the mass of the bowl and now comes the part 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.590
 that I like the most is when 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:12.050
 you really touch the mass you feel alive 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.050
 and it's a real delight to knead it 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.280
 we should not knead it too much because that 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.500
 Work has already been done by the machine 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.110
 just give it a few touches to be able to 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.810
 Give it a round shape leave it 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.120
 rest on a tray especially good 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.420
 covered to avoid currents of 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.640
 air we will have to wait at least hour 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.150
 and half to two hours you must double your 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.150
 volume 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.300
 Sprinkle the coca a little over 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.430
 I put a rag and put it in the oven 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.700
 cold so that it is sheltered from 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.730
 drafts when an hour passes 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.920
 and half open the lid of the oven and fix 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.490
 wonderful 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.880
 of reaction 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.880
 this is the second fermentation 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.880
 let's say 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.650
 Now I take the plastic shovel and the 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.739
 divided into two parts of one of the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.099
 parts I will extract three monkeys and the other the 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.700
 divide in two to take two a little 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.700
 bigger 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.939
 when you have already the mass in your 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.330
 hands of the piece that you are going to form the 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:48.040
 fleeting eta or la mona 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.140
 press it well on the inside 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.320
 down as I am 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.320
 doing 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.740
 this operation here in elche is called 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.480
 is cuÃ©llar es mones means something 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.280
 as well as serving them although it is not 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.530
 really the word serve them 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.090
 I have to shave my hands a little 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.090
 to be able to handle them well 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.540
 you must return them to leave plugged in 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.540
 least another hour 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.139
 once this time passes we put the 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:44.669
 first in the oven 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.930
 we have them at 180 degrees 25 minutes this 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.930
 It's the first round 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.070
 I opened it so I could see it 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.950
 sponginess of the dough and now helped 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:05.230
 by the head of the house we put the 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.230
 second round that are the two big 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.810
 after another 25 minutes 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.110
 we take it out of the oven 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.220
 and we proceed to paint them like the others 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.669
 same with raw egg and sugar for 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.669
 over 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.860
 this is the final aspect and I am 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.889
 delighted to have used the dough 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.590
 mother on the advice of my friend pour and that 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.289
 It is also a great genius ever 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.620
 in my life they had left me so beautiful 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.259
 and so hollow they weigh absolutely nothing 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.340
 thanks to the indications of pury 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.340
 thank you 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.750
 so I pass the ingredients
