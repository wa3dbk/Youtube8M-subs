specializes in staying on for a long

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.670 
specializes in staying on for a long
time<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.420> double<00:02:03.780> wear<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.409> Estee

Lauder<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.070> great<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.490> reason<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.850> really

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
Lauder is great and the reason I really

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.719 
Lauder is great and the reason I really
like<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.550> long

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
like this is because it is a long

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.279 
like this is because it is a long
lasting<00:02:08.910> foundation<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.780> really<00:02:09.959> light

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
lasting foundation but it's really light

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.199 
lasting foundation but it's really light
in<00:02:10.649> texture<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.459> doesn't<00:02:11.730> give<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
in texture and it doesn't give you a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.400 
in texture and it doesn't give you a
full<00:02:12.750> kind<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.140> cake

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270

the assumption has been that if you use
a<00:03:30.300> cream<00:03:30.660> eyeshadow<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:31.320> won't<00:03:31.530> stay<00:03:31.800> there

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
and that they falls into creases and so

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.470 
and that they falls into creases and so
on<00:03:34.740> that's<00:03:35.010> just<00:03:35.100> not<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.610> case<00:03:35.640> anymore<00:03:36.180> it's

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
on that's just not the case anymore it's
