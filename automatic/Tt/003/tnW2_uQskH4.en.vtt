00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.540
 and I think the first time were a lot 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.820
 clearer with the ball than we 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.770
 we were not the intense team that 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.750
 is used to make respect 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.330
 our house and the costs with your family 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.920
 a much better time ago we had 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.000
 good goal options pitifully 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.430
 today we did not all enter and that's why the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.410
 tie 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.410
 one of the general rival teams 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.899
 yes I think they also like football 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.309
 they all study the teams that have 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.530
 come to play hand in hand they have 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.050
 led a good amount of goals and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.540
 Well, in that study you already know what is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.489
 better shelter and try to 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.409
 against the counter because today we 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.540
 convert we lacked to be a little more 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.600
 attentive in the first you're in the bounce 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.300
 and then in killing the play away from 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.280
 our arch convert us from that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.019
 way now 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.700
 by treating the positive things they asked 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.510
 good things because he had good quantity 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.510
 of goal options 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.790
 to start improving the point 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.130
 flaws we had on this night 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.130
 chairs no doubt the semester is put 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.370
 We're going to be playing here 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.110
 forward a Sunday run 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.180
 Wednesday Sunday in which the team 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.159
 Well, he's thinking about doing very good 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.310
 participation and ask the three fronts 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.310
 as we have proposed so far 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.690
 if it is undoubtedly for us it will be 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.250
 complex get to a week where 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.370
 had we had to face four 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.020
 matches for bad payroll you have is going 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.720
 to then feel the fact 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.210
 overtake and continue with a single match 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.160
 within three weeks ago Wednesday to Sunday 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.880
 that the teacher has available in all 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.880
 the group of the boys 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.869
 So far we have not had to 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.970
 travel the same way last semester 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.409
 touched the inverse start with many of 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.630
 visits 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.520
 but if it's good the wear has been 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.519
 less but I think it 's already the other 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.360
 week will start more moved because 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.360
 we started to move 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.700
 Colombian soccer is very even 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.270
 side showed that it has arguments 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.950
 football for something was of 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.230
 collier 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.489
 to study it well to give the respect that 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.129
 it deserves all rivals as it is 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.220
 we give to raise well the meeting and the 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.230
 idea makes respect our house for 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.390
 that way get a good margin for 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.390
 then go to tula
