00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
his site as well as mine I kept that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.970 
his site as well as mine I kept that
grading<00:00:37.980> out<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:39.379> because<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:40.680> was

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
grading out of there because it just was

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.479 
grading out of there because it just was
a<00:00:42.110> just<00:00:43.110> inhibited<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> flow<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> smoke

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
a just inhibited to flow or the smoke

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.920 
a just inhibited to flow or the smoke
and<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.700> was<00:00:44.730> horrible<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.660> he<00:00:45.840> had

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and it was horrible but what he had

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.380 
and it was horrible but what he had
maybe<00:00:46.890> already<00:00:47.160> said<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.730> he<00:00:48.300> had

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
maybe already said this but he had

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.209 
maybe already said this but he had
talked<00:00:48.600> about<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:49.469> he'd<00:00:49.620> done<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.890> his<00:00:50.070> has

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
talked about what he'd done on his has

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.189 
talked about what he'd done on his has
taken<00:00:50.579> some<00:00:50.760> industrial-strength<00:00:51.449> screen

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
taken some industrial-strength screen

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.200 
taken some industrial-strength screen
and<00:00:52.530> wrapped<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.430> around<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and wrapped it around here and then that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
and wrapped it around here and then that
would<00:00:54.449> inhibit<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.289> sparkster<00:00:55.739> arrest<00:00:56.309> them

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
would inhibit the sparkster arrest them

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
would inhibit the sparkster arrest them
and<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.480> very<00:00:57.570> important

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and I think that's a very important

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.560 
and I think that's a very important
thing<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.469> also<00:00:59.010> put<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> damper<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.000> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
thing I also put a damper on this I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
thing I also put a damper on this I
don't<00:01:01.109> know<00:01:01.230> why<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.410> company<00:01:01.829> did<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.250> do

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
don't know why the company did not do

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.789 
don't know why the company did not do
that<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> first<00:01:03.030> place

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
that in the first place

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.320 
that in the first place
this<00:01:04.799> rod<00:01:05.070> was<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.519> something<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.939> had<00:01:05.970> around

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
this rod was just something I had around

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.060 
this rod was just something I had around
the<00:01:06.450> house<00:01:06.600> piece<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.290> scrap<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.770> don't<00:01:07.950> know

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the house piece of scrap I don't know

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.850 
the house piece of scrap I don't know
the<00:01:08.220> size<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:09.020> I'm<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.619> stuff

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the size I I'm not good with that stuff

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
the size I I'm not good with that stuff
but<00:01:11.600> there's<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> disc<00:01:12.990> inside<00:01:13.850> this<00:01:14.850> side<00:01:15.390> here

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
but there's a disc inside this side here

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.810 
but there's a disc inside this side here
that<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> damper<00:01:16.409> when<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.580> down

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that is the damper when this is down

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.300 
that is the damper when this is down
like<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:19.320> weight<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.770> holds<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.189> at

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
like this the weight of this holds it at

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.880 
like this the weight of this holds it at
a<00:01:20.369> 45<00:01:20.820> degree<00:01:20.850> angle<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> reason<00:01:22.500> why<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> did

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
a 45 degree angle the reason why I did

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410 
a 45 degree angle the reason why I did
that<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.729> were<00:01:23.850> sleeping<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that is so if we were sleeping and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.060 
that is so if we were sleeping and
there's<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.630> fire<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.200> accidentally

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
there's a fire and this accidentally

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.609 
there's a fire and this accidentally
closes<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.820> falls<00:01:27.479> down<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.380> not

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
closes it's not falls down it's not

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.039 
closes it's not falls down it's not
going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> close<00:01:29.070> off<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:30.540> fire<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.020> we

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
going to close off the fire then we

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.190 
going to close off the fire then we
potentially<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.740> smoke<00:01:32.009> filling<00:01:32.369> or<00:01:32.490> tent

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
potentially get smoke filling or tent

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.319 
potentially get smoke filling or tent
I've<00:01:34.200> got<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.530> coat<00:01:34.829> hanger<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.119> was

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
I've got this coat hanger it just was

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.890 
I've got this coat hanger it just was
something<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.780> had<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.520> or<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.670> piece<00:01:38.909> and

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
in early March I lived in the northwest

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.719 
in early March I lived in the northwest
it<00:05:13.050> was<00:05:13.139> pretty<00:05:13.349> cold<00:05:13.560> up<00:05:13.740> here<00:05:13.800> heated<00:05:14.580> up

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
it was pretty cold up here heated up

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.010 
it was pretty cold up here heated up
nice<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:17.550> tent<00:05:17.819> has<00:05:17.969> a<00:05:18.000> like<00:05:18.389> a<00:05:18.419> six<00:05:18.779> inch

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
nice the tent has a like a six inch

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.159 
nice the tent has a like a six inch
diameter<00:05:19.889> hole<00:05:20.479> this<00:05:21.479> fits<00:05:21.750> in<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:21.930> middle

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
diameter hole this fits in the middle

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.659 
diameter hole this fits in the middle
that<00:05:22.289> kind<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.560> floats<00:05:22.800> around<00:05:22.949> I<00:05:23.279> took<00:05:23.340> some

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
that kind of floats around I took some

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.959 
that kind of floats around I took some
concrete<00:05:24.509> board<00:05:24.719> cut<00:05:25.259> it<00:05:25.409> out<00:05:25.529> cut<00:05:26.400> a<00:05:26.430> circle

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
concrete board cut it out cut a circle

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:28.909 
concrete board cut it out cut a circle
made<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.419> oblong<00:05:27.840> because<00:05:28.469> it's<00:05:28.620> going<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.800> be

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
made it oblong because it's going to be

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.999 
made it oblong because it's going to be
at<00:05:29.009> an<00:05:29.129> angle<00:05:29.250> this<00:05:29.729> sits<00:05:30.029> in<00:05:30.180> there<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.509> then

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
at an angle this sits in there and then

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.829 
at an angle this sits in there and then
settles<00:05:32.009> down<00:05:32.190> into<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.580> area<00:05:32.729> on<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.150> roof

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
settles down into the area on the roof

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.610 
settles down into the area on the roof
of<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.050> tent<00:05:34.259> so<00:05:34.889> this<00:05:35.039> will<00:05:35.219> not<00:05:35.339> touch

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
of the tent so this will not touch

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.570 
of the tent so this will not touch
around<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.710> hole<00:05:37.889> which<00:05:38.129> there's<00:05:38.339> a<00:05:38.400> rubber

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
around the hole which there's a rubber

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.100 
around the hole which there's a rubber
seal<00:05:38.909> I<00:05:38.969> just<00:05:39.240> don't<00:05:39.419> want<00:05:39.629> it<00:05:39.659> to<00:05:39.719> mess<00:05:39.960> with

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
seal I just don't want it to mess with

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.450 
seal I just don't want it to mess with
it<00:05:40.169> if<00:05:40.319> it<00:05:40.409> doesn't<00:05:40.680> work<00:05:40.770> but<00:05:40.979> it<00:05:41.190> seemed<00:05:41.370> to

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
it if it doesn't work but it seemed to

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.129 
it if it doesn't work but it seemed to
work<00:05:41.520> well<00:05:41.759> I've<00:05:41.909> haven't<00:05:42.089> had<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.419> out<00:05:42.539> when

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
work well I've haven't had it out when

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.540 
work well I've haven't had it out when
it<00:05:43.229> was<00:05:43.319> real<00:05:43.500> cold<00:05:43.680> or<00:05:43.830> any<00:05:43.949> of<00:05:44.039> that<00:05:44.159> but<00:05:44.370> I

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
it was real cold or any of that but I

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.519 
it was real cold or any of that but I
think<00:05:44.819> it'll<00:05:44.969> work<00:05:46.339> and<00:05:47.339> it's<00:05:47.550> pretty<00:05:47.879> cool<00:05:48.529> so

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
think it'll work and it's pretty cool so

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:51.170 
think it'll work and it's pretty cool so
if<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:49.860> have<00:05:50.009> the<00:05:50.159> ability<00:05:50.610> to<00:05:50.639> do<00:05:50.879> all<00:05:50.909> that

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180
