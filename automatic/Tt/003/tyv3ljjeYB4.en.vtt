what<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> usually<00:01:28.499> do<00:01:28.859> is<00:01:28.889> go<00:01:29.310> check<00:01:29.639> it<00:01:29.819> out<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
what I usually do is go check it out and

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.639 
what I usually do is go check it out and
see<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.509> there's<00:01:30.779> any<00:01:30.929> way<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.200> try<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> take

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.460 
get killed usually there's going to be
one<00:02:10.739> or<00:02:11.009> two<00:02:11.039> or<00:02:11.819> more<00:02:12.120> than<00:02:12.329> that<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.110> I'd

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
one or two or more than that so I'd

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.120 
one or two or more than that so I'd
suggest<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.189> you<00:02:14.310> guys<00:02:14.579> just

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
suggest that you guys just

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.300 
suggest that you guys just
watch<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.400> care<00:02:15.610> packages<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:17.310> watch

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
watch the care packages and then watch

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.130 
watch the care packages and then watch
the<00:02:18.520> enemies<00:02:18.790> really<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.630> next<00:02:19.840> thing<00:02:20.080> is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
the enemies really and the next thing is

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.710 
the enemies really and the next thing is
knowing<00:02:20.890> your<00:02:21.070> maps<00:02:21.400> if<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.060> know<00:02:22.270> your<00:02:22.480> maps

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
knowing your maps if you know your maps

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.150 
knowing your maps if you know your maps
and<00:02:23.760> know<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.910> way<00:02:25.060> around<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.010> over<00:02:27.010> the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
and know the way around it and over the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.430 
and know the way around it and over the
spawn<00:02:27.460> of<00:02:27.490> where<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.390> enemy<00:02:28.690> spawn<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.200> stuff

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
spawn of where the enemy spawn and stuff

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.330 
spawn of where the enemy spawn and stuff
you'll<00:02:30.010> be<00:02:30.130> able<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.550> just<00:02:30.930> get<00:02:31.930> high<00:02:32.650> k<00:02:33.040> ds<00:02:33.310> and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
you'll be able to just get high k ds and

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.080 
you'll be able to just get high k ds and
like<00:02:33.910> just<00:02:34.210> get<00:02:35.020> better<00:02:35.230> matches<00:02:35.710> really<00:02:36.090> why

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
like just get better matches really why

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.420 
like just get better matches really why
I'm<00:02:37.240> saying<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.540> because<00:02:38.220> usually<00:02:39.220> people

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
I'm saying that because usually people

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.060 
I'm saying that because usually people
tend<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.180> stick<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.450> their<00:02:40.720> spawn<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.260> I

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
tend to stick to their spawn and I

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.920 
tend to stick to their spawn and I
suggest<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:42.970> guys<00:02:43.210> come<00:02:43.540> out<00:02:43.570> your

kills<00:03:15.130> really<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.660> next<00:03:16.900> thing<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.140> guns

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
kills really and the next thing is guns

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.600 
kills really and the next thing is guns
and<00:03:18.310> ammo<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.210> perk<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.750> seen<00:03:20.710> people<00:03:21.280> just

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
and ammo and perk I seen people just

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.170 
and ammo and perk I seen people just
keeping<00:03:22.480> their<00:03:22.630> gun<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:23.710> I<00:03:23.940> halfway<00:03:24.940> through

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
keeping their gun for I halfway through

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.210 
keeping their gun for I halfway through
the<00:03:25.300> map<00:03:25.480> even<00:03:25.750> halfway<00:03:26.320> through<00:03:26.470> them<00:03:26.770> match

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
the map even halfway through them match

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.910 
the map even halfway through them match
even<00:03:27.940> though<00:03:28.150> they're<00:03:28.540> out<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.750> ammo<00:03:29.080> like

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
even though they're out of ammo like

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.160 
even though they're out of ammo like
they<00:03:30.250> tend<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.760> keep<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.330> because<00:03:32.020> they

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
they tend to keep it because they

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.320 
they tend to keep it because they
strongly<00:03:32.560> in<00:03:32.800> that<00:03:32.980> gun<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.790> suggest<00:03:34.270> that

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
strongly in that gun but I suggest that

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.350 
strongly in that gun but I suggest that
you<00:03:34.450> swap<00:03:34.930> your<00:03:35.140> gun<00:03:35.910> swapping<00:03:36.910> means<00:03:37.150> that

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
you swap your gun swapping means that

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.470 
you swap your gun swapping means that
you<00:03:37.540> get<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:38.050> gun<00:03:38.710> and<00:03:38.980> more<00:03:39.610> ammo<00:03:39.790> even<00:03:40.270> if<00:03:40.330> the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
you get a gun and more ammo even if the

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.810 
you get a gun and more ammo even if the
shit's<00:03:40.720> gone<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.080> pick<00:03:41.320> up<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:42.130> will<00:03:42.280> be<00:03:42.430> all
