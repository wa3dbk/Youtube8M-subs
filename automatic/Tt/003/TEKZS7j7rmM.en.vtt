00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
 to my fine gmt and dynamic and nights 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.850
 Free escaped on Saturday and tender 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.900
 track one dispatches 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.759
 the waves guys that are so many 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.710
 Welcome to I do not remember how many 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.840
 videos but if the third episode of us 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.480
 we go to the world where you see almost 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.640
 all the signings are done and we 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.890
 missing neymar and as you see we still have 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.570
 grandpa but the rest of the team is already 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.360
 whole that you have it down in the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.130
 description a link of futsal so already 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.350
 we go to the first game there is a 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.390
 very good team but without rapport 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.310
 some where we were going to put anything 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.690
 more and nothing less than nine goals already 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.790
 you have seen the perimeter of thiago 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.830
 silva you see this welliton vaseline 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.960
 I'm going to put them very closely because if 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.240
 they would give us this very long this is like 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.190
 welliton leaves goalie diego alves and 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.019
 define what to do but then what 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.570
 they make a penalty and we are going to continue putting 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.270
 goals here we see no one else william 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 and we're going to have the 45th minute another one 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.439
 like oscar a little I keep that pass 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.909
 He cited but he had to score goals 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.010
 to earn coins so we're going to 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.530
 throw with quality for what 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.330
 will be nice and head so 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.720
 we are going to put many goals here you have 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.120
 this returned a precious to the rejects 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.610
 from david luiz head that we're going to 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.130
 have another more of oscar a good pull 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.110
 quite powerful another head more than 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.400
 you see another reject that the network more towards 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.800
 oasis you go twice I was going to poke 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.040
 So this is going to end the game nothing 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.210
 more and nothing less than 9 goals that are 45 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.430
 thousand coins and a match that came out 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.860
 great the rival Monday that was very good 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.860
 but well we're going to the second 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.620
 match and this time it was a team of the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 Liga BBVA with a very good players 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.440
 like a modric had marcelo had diego 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.680
 coast here we're going to start here and 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.709
 William since from the beginning he was going to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.570
 stick that gallop for the band sgl to 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.670
 hell and will continue to gallop about 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.160
 the ball rewards how it is thrown by the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.640
 center and welliton about to finish 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.910
 that rejects oscar and gets the first goal 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.880
 of the minute 2 party but here we go to 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.880
 have with marcelo head as the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.000
 puts david luiz so they give their faith yes 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.730
 Mr. David Luiz amazing another center 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.550
 more marcelo puts another with him and another 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.070
 goal more than david very head and so it goes 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.200
 to finish the game on this team is 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.720
 bestial in the corners 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.400
 is that I do not know how many will take david luiz 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.190
 and thiago silva but they carry a 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.470
 outrageous yes or yes because in each 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.470
 party they put me in the head yes or yes 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.040
 so now we 're going to the third and last 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.870
 match of this episode and here you see 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.060
 this equipazo that I had I expected 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.860
 the worst that is said of all tour 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.750
 lite now here we have with marcelo that 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.120
 nice roulette that is played for 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.849
 Welliton who wanted to play it for Oscar 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.250
 but here again we reject and goal 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.560
 from welliton to fade for in good 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.290
 chut with reject fortune that gets 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.120
 to dance to and a sambita that treats us 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.220
 like and as you can see he has taken away the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.680
 repetition because look that saved us 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.440
 was going to do we was going to touch the and a case 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.530
 and that he was going to score a great goal with 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.270
 its raid but something pork this rival 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.360
 that also annoyed us a lot 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.280
 so I took with welliton and the best 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.860
 player of the team for me I put it and 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.640
 look hulk is chilean apply pretty 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.160
 center that beautiful chilean incredible 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.260
 humiliating the 11th minute after that 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.390
 case and very angry I decided to do 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.069
 that and now with paulinho look will like 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.290
 throws the defense and that shot with blue 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.720
 my mother what point beast fuck male and 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.400
 we already take this virus here and I do not 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.769
 is going to fuck her with william is she going 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.290
 touch absurd has made a punt and another 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.840
 goal more than luck I think what has 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.030
 fact is to give the circle and the fall 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.980
 but well here we are going to 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.570
 joel made to look like how it goes 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.570
 defense looks at how the goalie comes out and 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.180
 a whiplash with that force that signs his 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.430
 first hat-trick hub and in point 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.740
 golazo and here we have wellington 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.780
 touching her with william of first has 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.150
 returned to what he does above 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.270
 gatekeepers I accidentally hit the button 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.760
 center and it was male inside so he went to 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.800
 post and yes more then the match will end 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.639
 and we will notice in nothing else 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.970
 nothing less in this episode than 17 goals 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.919
 I think something like that so here you are 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.610
 seeing the coins now on screen 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:53.190
 what happened to me that is 95 thousand coins 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.720
 by episode unbeaten and so and here it 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.849
 end the episode today I leave you with the 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.159
 question of the day which is your player 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.110
 favorite within ultimate team and the 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.190
 reality does not have to be Brazilian 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.610
 and until next time 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.610
 goodbye
