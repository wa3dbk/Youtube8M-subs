 please seriously the truth is that it was 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.410
 thing that I'm going to teach is pretty 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.019
 strange and I think that many people 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.960
 you will like pokemon emulator xy 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.509
 pokemon and and you know of the sixth 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.489
 generation for the game boy and it's very 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.679
 strange so the first thing we will have 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.930
 what to do and the first step would be to open 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.400
 a new tab as it is here and paste 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.370
 and we have the link that I have put so I'm going 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.199
 to leave the link a link this serial of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.910
 and here is the link of the two but I'm going 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.250
 to leave the emulator link and the link of the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.190
 game open the two link and first thing if 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.750
 you have some blog pause and aix and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.010
 reload and it's the page but if not already 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.829
 would charge directly if you do not have 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.760
 no blog or anything then you wait 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.609
 the time it is that it is a fli 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.260
 you see him continue when he appears 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.940
 of some kind stands like this 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.660
 do not worry now it's keep up 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.490
 let's see the script and submit 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.260
 half affair where I put the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.240

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.300

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.210
 that gave me faith is downloaded very fast 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.140
 as you see here 19 16 9 seconds 5 4 3 2 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.530
 one 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.630
 and when that is downloaded you will have what 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.390
 first you will see here would be if you 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.100

 if you want to see more strange things like 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.890

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.140
 your help and the contrary are many 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.020
 strange things I take it a lot 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.369
 Currando time but not by the branches 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.610
 so let's go to both 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.159
 we have that the last step would be to pass 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.430
 this to the desktop if you want good what 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.240
 you pass by desk and I would be here the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.520
 game and the emulator and then I already what 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.000
 I have so I go to pc games I get 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.120
 in game boy and here if you have the yes 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.950
 you already have the game boy emulator what 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.430
 only you have to do is click 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.480
 in the pokemon where the pokemon are 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.480
 x here pokemon x 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.760
 I would assume that to charge the battery what 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.120
 charges 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.319
 and a new game this would seem as if 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.829
 out of emeralds that has a bit of 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.379
 emerald and a touch of pokemon and a 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.950
 touch pokemon x and as you will have seen 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.150
 when commenting says xyy good what the only 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.120
 inconvenience is that there is English but 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.440
 good if I find any for 16 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.720
 like is enjoying the music so 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.370
 I feel if you are listening to music 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.819
 if you are listening to good, it is something 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.010
 it is worth and you will find at 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.379
 tepic and all the pokemon if you want to see 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.870
 all because they are in the xl and the 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.900

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.950
