00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.580 
here finally okay so another one would
be<00:02:08.920> another<00:02:09.920> good<00:02:10.160> option<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:12.730> it's<00:02:13.730> called<00:02:14.590> it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
be another good option is it's called it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.490 
be another good option is it's called it
changes<00:02:15.950> your<00:02:16.130> status<00:02:16.519> bar<00:02:16.730> like<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.870> signals

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
changes your status bar like the signals

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.259 
changes your status bar like the signals
widget<00:02:20.739> here<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.160> alternate<00:02:23.060> signal

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
widget here it is so alternate signal

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.390 
widget here it is so alternate signal
display<00:02:23.870> know<00:02:24.110> what<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.560> means<00:02:24.769> is<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.250> can

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
display know what that means is you can

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.920 
display know what that means is you can
either<00:02:25.489> do<00:02:25.819> signal<00:02:26.209> bars<00:02:26.420> which<00:02:26.569> is<00:02:26.720> what

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
either do signal bars which is what

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.390 
either do signal bars which is what
stock<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.410> but<00:02:27.650> regular<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.130> have<00:02:28.250> your

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
stock is but regular is you have your

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.460 
stock is but regular is you have your
signal<00:02:28.670> strength<00:02:28.940> obviously<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.080> last<00:02:30.260> bar

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
signal strength obviously the last bar

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.370 
signal strength obviously the last bar
is<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.769> last<00:02:30.950> thing<00:02:31.130> we<00:02:31.310> have<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:32.810> choose<00:02:33.110> text

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
is the last thing we have in choose text

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.210 
is the last thing we have in choose text
which<00:02:33.799> is<00:02:33.950> negative<00:02:34.280> 97<00:02:35.260> now<00:02:36.260> what<00:02:36.470> negative<00:02:36.860> 7

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
which is negative 97 now what negative 7

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.009 
which is negative 97 now what negative 7
means<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:38.480> latest<00:02:39.140> dbm<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:41.420> think

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
means is I latest dbm and I think

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.949 
means is I latest dbm and I think
between<00:02:42.260> 90-100<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.400> average<00:02:44.209> anything<00:02:44.810> over

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
between 90-100 is average anything over

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.479 
between 90-100 is average anything over
100<00:02:45.349> you're<00:02:45.650> pretty<00:02:46.099> much<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.810> very<00:02:47.810> very<00:02:48.049> low

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
100 you're pretty much and very very low

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.910 
100 you're pretty much and very very low
signals<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.760> anything<00:02:50.090> below<00:02:50.510> 90<00:02:50.870> e<00:02:51.140> like<00:02:51.560> 70

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
signals and anything below 90 e like 70

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.800 
signals and anything below 90 e like 70
to<00:02:52.040> 80<00:02:52.160> s<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:53.180> means<00:02:53.209> you're<00:02:53.480> really<00:02:53.690> good

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
to 80 s that means you're really good

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.330 
to 80 s that means you're really good
signal<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.290> there's<00:02:54.470> more<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.769> cure<00:02:55.040> display

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
signal so there's more of a cure display

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.680 
signal so there's more of a cure display
around<00:02:55.579> look<00:02:55.760> at<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:55.970> bars<00:02:56.150> because<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.510> bars

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
around look at the bars because the bars

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.930 
around look at the bars because the bars
can<00:02:56.900> be<00:02:56.930> kind<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.260> an<00:02:57.380> actor<00:02:57.650> sometimes<00:02:58.040> but

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
can be kind of an actor sometimes but

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.699 
can be kind of an actor sometimes but
that<00:02:59.150> gives<00:02:59.299> you<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.510> good<00:02:59.630> one<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.170> signal

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
that gives you a good one and signal

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.759 
that gives you a good one and signal
text<00:03:01.040> with<00:03:01.190> dbm<00:03:01.670> there's<00:03:02.569> uh<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:03.410> did<00:03:03.590> mean
