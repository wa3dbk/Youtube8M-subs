controller puts a 11 mere artifact
creature<00:02:13.459> into<00:02:13.910> play<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:15.440> slap<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> Genesis

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
creature into play so you slap a Genesis

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.300 
creature into play so you slap a Genesis
chamber<00:02:16.790> down<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.480> then<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.800> slap<00:02:19.100> these

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
chamber down and then you can slap these

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.280 
chamber down and then you can slap these
guys<00:02:19.550> down<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.940> get<00:02:20.060> an<00:02:20.150> extra<00:02:20.330> 11<00:02:20.930> art

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
guys down you get an extra 11 art

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.720 
guys down you get an extra 11 art
I<00:02:21.319> guess<00:02:21.680> that's<00:02:21.829> how<00:02:22.040> he<00:02:22.099> gets<00:02:22.340> enough<00:02:22.579> out

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
I guess that's how he gets enough out

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.699 
I guess that's how he gets enough out
for<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:22.969> mere<00:02:23.180> enforcers<00:02:23.719> but<00:02:24.349> I'm<00:02:24.439> telling

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
for the mere enforcers but I'm telling

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.080 
for the mere enforcers but I'm telling
you<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:24.799> think<00:02:25.010> spring<00:02:25.280> leitrim<00:02:25.670> might<00:02:25.909> be<00:02:26.060> a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
you I think spring leitrim might be a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.170 
you I think spring leitrim might be a
very<00:02:26.540> good<00:02:26.799> card<00:02:27.799> in<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.040> as<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.670> works<00:02:28.879> so

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
very good card in this as it works so

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.240 
very good card in this as it works so

owner's hand so what you do on the on
basically<00:02:34.819> either<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.299> wonder<00:02:35.719> how<00:02:35.840> fast<00:02:36.200> this

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
basically either I wonder how fast this

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.559 
basically either I wonder how fast this
could<00:02:36.650> actually<00:02:36.879> actually<00:02:37.879> go<00:02:38.090> off<00:02:38.299> I'm

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
could actually actually go off I'm

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.479 
could actually actually go off I'm
thinking<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:39.079> could<00:02:39.349> be<00:02:39.409> like<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.680> second

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
thinking this could be like a second

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.119 
thinking this could be like a second
term<00:02:40.670> first<00:02:41.030> turn<00:02:41.329> kill<00:02:42.079> with<00:02:42.319> grapeshot<00:02:42.620> we'd

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
term first turn kill with grapeshot we'd

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.339 
term first turn kill with grapeshot we'd
have<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.430> see<00:02:43.689> thought<00:02:44.689> cast<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.079> course<00:02:45.260> to

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
have to see thought cast of course to

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.839 
have to see thought cast of course to
draw<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> few<00:02:45.859> more<00:02:45.980> cars<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.519> get<00:02:46.609> card

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
draw a few more cars to get card

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.940 
draw a few more cars to get card
advantage<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.750> good<00:02:48.049> ignore<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:48.709> glimpse

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
advantage but good ignore this glimpse

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.649 
advantage but good ignore this glimpse
of<00:02:49.040> nature<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.459> is<00:02:49.609> actually<00:02:50.060> beck<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.510> call

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
of nature this is actually beck and call

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.539 
of nature this is actually beck and call
so<00:02:51.319> basically<00:02:51.709> what<00:02:51.829> you<00:02:51.920> do<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.219> slam<00:02:52.519> the

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
so basically what you do is you slam the

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.330 
so basically what you do is you slam the
beck<00:02:52.909> and<00:02:52.939> call<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.599> then<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.560> slam<00:02:54.889> all<00:02:55.159> of

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
beck and call and then you slam all of

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.390 
beck and call and then you slam all of
these<00:02:55.489> 01<00:02:56.329> stuff<00:02:56.689> down<00:02:57.560> are<00:02:57.829> all<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.069> zero

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
trying to see how chromatic star works

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.940 
trying to see how chromatic star works
in<00:03:10.250> here<00:03:10.549> I'm<00:03:11.359> thinking<00:03:11.989> chromatic<00:03:12.319> star<00:03:12.530> star

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
in here I'm thinking chromatic star star

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.149 
in here I'm thinking chromatic star star
would<00:03:13.099> actually<00:03:13.639> be<00:03:13.790> better<00:03:14.200> with<00:03:15.200> better<00:03:15.859> as

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
would actually be better with better as

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.949 
would actually be better with better as
a<00:03:16.189> spring<00:03:16.760> leaf<00:03:16.909> drum<00:03:17.269> so<00:03:17.569> that's<00:03:17.750> definitely

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
a spring leaf drum so that's definitely

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.369 
a spring leaf drum so that's definitely
a<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.680> suggestion<00:03:19.669> I<00:03:19.879> would<00:03:19.909> make<00:03:20.200> change<00:03:21.200> those

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
a a suggestion I would make change those

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.409 
a a suggestion I would make change those
chromatic<00:03:21.799> stars<00:03:22.069> into<00:03:22.370> spring<00:03:22.939> leaf<00:03:23.060> jumps<00:03:23.329> I

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
chromatic stars into spring leaf jumps I

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.149 
chromatic stars into spring leaf jumps I
do<00:03:23.659> understand<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.470> actually<00:03:24.620> does<00:03:24.980> help

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
do understand that it actually does help

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.420 
do understand that it actually does help
you<00:03:25.370> or<00:03:25.579> grapeshot<00:03:26.739> your<00:03:27.739> grape<00:03:27.949> shot<00:03:28.129> count

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
you or grapeshot your grape shot count

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.129 
you or grapeshot your grape shot count
but<00:03:29.030> i'm<00:03:29.120> thinking<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.449> spring<00:03:29.810> leitrim

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
but i'm thinking that spring leitrim

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.569 
but i'm thinking that spring leitrim
with<00:03:30.260> retrack<00:03:30.769> might<00:03:31.069> be<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> little<00:03:31.400> bit

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
with retrack might be a little bit

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.030 
with retrack might be a little bit
better<00:03:31.760> as<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.359> can<00:03:32.540> basically<00:03:32.840> keep<00:03:33.739> getting

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
better as it can basically keep getting

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.339 
better as it can basically keep getting
you<00:03:34.159> unlimited<00:03:34.699> like<00:03:35.030> unlimited<00:03:35.389> mana

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
you unlimited like unlimited mana

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.899 
you unlimited like unlimited mana
through<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.799> mocks<00:03:36.979> opals<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.459> spring<00:03:37.760> leaf

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
through the mocks opals and spring leaf

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.009 
through the mocks opals and spring leaf
drums<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.919> you<00:03:39.919> can<00:03:40.069> still<00:03:40.359> i'm<00:03:41.359> pretty<00:03:41.900> sure

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
drums and you can still i'm pretty sure

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.990 
drums and you can still i'm pretty sure
go<00:03:42.470> through<00:03:42.859> your<00:03:42.979> deck<00:03:43.190> quite<00:03:43.489> quickly<00:03:43.760> maybe

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
go through your deck quite quickly maybe

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.490 
go through your deck quite quickly maybe
that's<00:03:44.239> why<00:03:44.419> they<00:03:44.540> want<00:03:44.629> the<00:03:44.810> chromatic<00:03:45.229> stars

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
that's why they want the chromatic stars

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.680 
that's why they want the chromatic stars
because<00:03:45.739> when<00:03:45.859> it<00:03:45.949> does<00:03:46.099> oh<00:03:46.370> no<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.419> put<00:03:47.599> to

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
because when it does oh no it's put to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.569 
because when it does oh no it's put to
the<00:03:47.780> graveyard<00:03:48.229> from<00:03:48.319> play<00:03:48.409> if<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.129> came<00:03:49.340> into

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
the graveyard from play if it came into

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.949 
the graveyard from play if it came into
play<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.000> draw<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.239> card<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.659> would<00:03:50.720> be<00:03:50.810> a<00:03:50.840> lot

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
play and draw a card that would be a lot

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.349 
play and draw a card that would be a lot
better<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.379> maybe<00:03:51.500> there's<00:03:51.799> another<00:03:52.359> card

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
better so maybe there's another card

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.300 
better so maybe there's another card
that<00:03:53.750> would<00:03:54.019> actually<00:03:54.260> be<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.590> little<00:03:55.069> bit

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
that would actually be a little bit

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.920 
that would actually be a little bit
better<00:03:55.519> that<00:03:55.879> when<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.239> comes<00:03:56.419> into<00:03:56.690> play<00:03:56.870> you

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
better that when it comes into play you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.050 
better that when it comes into play you
draw<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.319> card<00:03:57.650> off<00:03:57.829> to<00:03:58.040> off<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.400> check<00:03:58.579> check

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
draw a card off to off to check check

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.969 
draw a card off to off to check check
and<00:03:59.090> see<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.840> eggs<00:04:00.019> list<00:04:00.349> to<00:04:00.500> see<00:04:00.650> what<00:04:00.829> type

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
and see the eggs list to see what type

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.710 
and see the eggs list to see what type
of<00:04:01.010> artifacts<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.760> eggs<00:04:01.909> use<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.269> know<00:04:02.329> most<00:04:02.629> of

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
of artifacts the eggs use I know most of

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.000 
of artifacts the eggs use I know most of
the<00:04:02.810> eggs<00:04:02.989> list<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:03.470> when<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.709> goes<00:04:03.859> to<00:04:03.979> the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
the eggs list is when it goes to the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.619 
the eggs list is when it goes to the
graveyard<00:04:04.430> as<00:04:04.549> well<00:04:04.699> so<00:04:05.209> I'm<00:04:05.299> what<00:04:05.419> if<00:04:05.510> there's

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
graveyard as well so I'm what if there's

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.129 
graveyard as well so I'm what if there's
a<00:04:05.689> good<00:04:05.780> comes<00:04:06.109> into<00:04:06.349> play<00:04:06.620> draw<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.310> card<00:04:08.139> type

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
a good comes into play draw a card type

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.770 
a good comes into play draw a card type
artifact<00:04:09.829> that<00:04:10.069> you<00:04:10.189> can<00:04:10.430> kind<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.150> abuse<00:04:11.599> with

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
artifact that you can kind of abuse with

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.289

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
you can go off quite click with this

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.550 
you can go off quite click with this
grapeshot<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.669> course<00:04:29.050> another<00:04:30.050> option

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
grapeshot and of course another option

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.219 
grapeshot and of course another option
besides<00:04:30.830> grapeshot<00:04:31.450> or<00:04:32.450> in<00:04:32.690> addition<00:04:33.080> to

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
besides grapeshot or in addition to

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.170 
besides grapeshot or in addition to
grapeshot<00:04:33.529> would<00:04:33.950> definitely<00:04:34.400> be

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
grapeshot would definitely be

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.749 
grapeshot would definitely be
empty<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.900> warrens<00:04:36.080> as<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:37.310> will<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.639> next

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
empty the warrens as that will the next

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.460 
empty the warrens as that will the next
turn<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.120> could<00:04:38.240> swing<00:04:38.449> in<00:04:38.570> for<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.810> win<00:04:38.990> so

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
turn you could swing in for the win so

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.960 
turn you could swing in for the win so
yeah<00:04:39.979> I<00:04:40.009> wonder<00:04:40.520> there's<00:04:40.669> any<00:04:40.820> other

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970

yeah I wonder there's any other
suggestions<00:04:41.600> we're<00:04:41.750> trying<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.050> build<00:04:42.199> the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
suggestions we're trying to build the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.200 
suggestions we're trying to build the
stack<00:04:42.500> for<00:04:42.680> modern<00:04:43.070> kind<00:04:43.850> of<00:04:43.910> like<00:04:44.060> the

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
stack for modern kind of like the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.469 
stack for modern kind of like the
glimpse<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:44.900> mean<00:04:45.320> they<00:04:46.090> glisten<00:04:47.090> nature<00:04:47.330> was

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
glimpse I mean they glisten nature was

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.590 
glimpse I mean they glisten nature was
otto<00:04:47.750> band<00:04:48.370> when<00:04:49.370> modern<00:04:49.639> came<00:04:50.090> out<00:04:50.240> was<00:04:50.449> one

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
otto band when modern came out was one

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.850 
otto band when modern came out was one
of<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.750> initial<00:04:50.840> cards<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.560> they<00:04:51.650> had

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
of the initial cards that they had

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.350 
of the initial cards that they had
banned<00:04:52.190> because<00:04:52.460> they<00:04:52.669> knew<00:04:52.910> that<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.270> would

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
banned because they knew that it would

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.900 
banned because they knew that it would
be<00:04:53.479> abused<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.650> now<00:04:54.889> they<00:04:55.400> basically<00:04:55.789> this

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
be abused and now they basically this

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.029 
be abused and now they basically this
reprinted<00:04:56.360> as<00:04:56.630> back<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:57.289> once<00:04:57.470> again<00:04:57.560> let's

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
reprinted as back so once again let's

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.230 
reprinted as back so once again let's
just<00:04:58.250> check<00:04:58.400> out<00:04:58.550> back<00:04:58.820> one<00:04:59.030> more<00:04:59.180> time

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
just check out back one more time

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.790 
just check out back one more time
whenever<00:05:00.080> creature<00:05:00.320> enters<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.650> battlefield

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
whenever creature enters the battlefield

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.040 
whenever creature enters the battlefield
this<00:05:01.130> turn<00:05:01.340> you<00:05:01.460> may<00:05:01.789> draw<00:05:02.060> card<00:05:02.330> s<00:05:02.449> whenever<00:05:02.810> a

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
this turn you may draw card s whenever a

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.779 
this turn you may draw card s whenever a
creature<00:05:03.410> any<00:05:03.710> creature<00:05:04.039> enters<00:05:04.669> the

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
creature any creature enters the

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.040 
creature any creature enters the
battlefield<00:05:04.910> not<00:05:05.270> when<00:05:05.360> you<00:05:05.449> cast<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.840> creature

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
battlefield not when you cast a creature

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.749 
battlefield not when you cast a creature
so<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:06.680> triggers<00:05:06.979> off<00:05:07.100> of<00:05:07.250> course<00:05:07.460> all<00:05:07.639> those

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
so it triggers off of course all those

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.779 
so it triggers off of course all those
11<00:05:08.030> mirror<00:05:08.479> tokens<00:05:08.900> too<00:05:09.139> so<00:05:09.860> anyway<00:05:10.310> yeah<00:05:10.520> just

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
11 mirror tokens too so anyway yeah just

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.219 
11 mirror tokens too so anyway yeah just
seems<00:05:11.120> like<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.270> sweet<00:05:11.419> deck<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:11.840> does<00:05:12.020> seem

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
seems like a sweet deck it does seem

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.960 
seems like a sweet deck it does seem
like<00:05:12.410> you<00:05:12.740> have<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:13.130> have<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.280> BEC<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:13.699> your<00:05:13.789> hand

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
like you have to have a BEC in your hand

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.600
