00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
it like completely dries um but um the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
it like completely dries um but um the
first<00:00:49.920> thing<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.190> wanted<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> say<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.090> when

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
should do a washing go because a washing

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.640 
should do a washing go because a washing
go<00:01:00.329> will<00:01:01.289> help<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.629> decipher<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.260> have

cut always the permed hair off because I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.490
