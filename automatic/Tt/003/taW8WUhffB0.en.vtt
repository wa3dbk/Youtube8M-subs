00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.580
 Today we are doing this cool clock 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:15.080
 Heimann pretty today there are 1 3 and 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.810
 while we have a diaby and I would 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.460
 say they needed her right away 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.829
 a clock in the case it is a very 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.230
 cheap from ikea and a box with 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.809
 small box and the bowel is natural 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.939
 once the whole clock 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:31.130
 disassemble and then just take 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.290
 the pointers and then you can do that 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.500
 then press this car 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.290
 Battery Tuesday then outside and 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.160
 So it's super simple you can not do anything 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.380
 do wrong 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.230
 as a next step I have the lid 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.400
 Taken from my box and had to 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.290
 then first in 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.079
 of course it comes from box like that 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.400
 box depends on what you whatever 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.829
 material that had to be confirmed 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.030
 Finally, but born short but in the end 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.920
 Normally, that should also be the case 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.130
 go with the scissors and then put that 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.320
 everything back together so also something 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.180
 very simple and if you do because 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.590
 you have put everything together 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.610
 ever a nice little clock 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.579
 she definitely looks 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.889
 better than before and I wanted it 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.780
 then a bit more individual 

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:17.990
 You have a corridor and that is the case 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.210
 a superhero mottola are there too 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.939
 already a few logos of the superheroes 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.950
 so framed and therefore have 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.459
 I decided to cut something out 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.289
 So boom and so and that should be 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:34.009
 The wall ran and then I have very 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:37.399
 very quickly wall stuck so one 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.899
 super simple thing and that's it 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.850
 Now mine show but there you can 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.979
 especially since they can flower hearts 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.409
 it lacked paint over it and 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.479
 you can do all the colors and 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.270
 So no matter what form you do it is 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.399
 to look good 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.549
 I think that's a very, very, very 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.200
 very cool idea so I do not know you 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.060
 Of course, pretty much everything 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.210
 possible uses you can heart and 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.920
 butterflies and or number 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.229
 of course, very know view 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 what still wants and I think there 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.590
 you can be creative as creatively 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.690
 you really let off steam there 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.209
 and that's why it's a very good one 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.940
 idea and now you can also become one 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.430
 Gewinnspiel yes because the team of some 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.660
 days inn has something very cool for me 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.190
 allows and indeed I will give away a kur 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.989
 what else, of course, to match 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.540
 of course , I also do myself a topic 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.400
 so that you can see it, yes the team 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.470
 was really great and I know 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.540
 I do not think it's really great 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.069
 I always find it very selfish 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.340
 from the whole day adaptive only 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.769
 unfortunately have something and therefore 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.730
 I always like to give something with and in 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:52.030
 In this case, this clock is a very very 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.950
 nice watch i think she is gold you 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.989
 are gold and density that it would be 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.639
 a friendship watch for me, so to speak 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.310
 have exactly the same then one 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:03.670
 other color but it would be one 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.380
 Friendship and you can win 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.829
 really really great 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.660
 she is in really sweet wrapping for 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.139
 of course you have to subscribe to her 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.780
