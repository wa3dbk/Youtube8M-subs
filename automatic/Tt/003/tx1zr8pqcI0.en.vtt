 nomination and triumph were highlighted 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.370
 by graphic and television media 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.560
 precisely international analysts 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.920
 they referred to their close relationship with 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.390
 the communication interests peña 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.640
 grandson arrives at the instance where he is 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.810
 now because it's a product of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.490
 television 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.890
 is a character manufactured by the 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.570
 television by television from mexico with 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.180
 who has established agreements and 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.260
 agreements paid especially with 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.780
 huge fortunes has already denounced 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.000
 even by several important newspapers to 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.850
 world level and grandson, it's that 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.790
 he is a is a television actor 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.980
 financed by televised and driven 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.870
 for them long ago the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.940
 elections in Mexico had a high 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.190
 Abstention rate close to 40 per 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.590
 percent related according to analysts 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.600
 with fear the threats and a wave of 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.090
 murders attributed to the cartels of 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.950
 the drug situation worrying for the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.950
 citizenship that does not see changes 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.860
 and also Peña Nieto is going to assume 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.260
 in December with which this is a 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.540
 long transition of government this is what 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.310
 they expect important challenges especially 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.720
 considering that it is a society 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.090
 traversed by the issue of drug trafficking 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.490
 how are you pedro good night good 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.540
 Sicilian nights good return 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.910
 effectively the issue of drug trafficking 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.950
 it is fundamental and in fact it is said that 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.560
 one of the reasons for the defeat of 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.240
 bread has to do with violence in the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.700
 last six years remember that the 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.170
 presidents there govern for six 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.940
 years let's remember some data 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.560
 elementals first of all that the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.709
 Most pollsters do not know 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.820
 they wrong they posed an advantage 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.890
 important for the pri maybe not so 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.989
 small as it was but they raised a 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.670
 important advantage in the data up 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.690
 now we have to wait for the officers 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.739
 course they are going to be on Wednesday 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.770
 the pri 38% dog and 31 percent 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.480
 bread the ruling party 25 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.730
 we remember that Mexico is not 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.400
 second round the difference of seven 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.160
 points between the first and the second are 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.739
 approximately 2,500,000 votes a 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.299
 big difference, let's think that 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.100
 the last elections six years ago 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.470
 manuel lópez obrador d 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.270
 a fraud because the official data 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.720
 They gave that he had lost by just 0 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.880
 6% returned the pri as they say the great 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.860
 question returns the old pri there is a 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.690
 new pri this is one of the questions 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.090
 a victory without a doubt 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.520
 overwhelming we remember again some 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.570
 data from mexico live close to 112 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.870
 million people the pri won in 20 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.090
 states the dog won in 8 included 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.950
 the federal district that is like our 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.480
 federal capital where almost nine live 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.250
 millions of people you will go 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.820
 important percentage yes but it does not reach 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.860
 with winning in the federal district and of 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.990
 made the victory to the district dog 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.380
 federal was very important overwhelming 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.260
 almost 63 percent of the votes a 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.850
 district remember the capital that the 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.010
 dog governs since 1997 15 years 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.140
 followed and that in fact the same Andrew 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.970
 lópez obrador came out of the 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.460
 federal district because it governed 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.000
 during a time that happened with the bread to 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.849
 national level won only in four 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.490
 states was left with 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.999
 in third place with 25 percent 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.369
 of the votes lost the presidency is left 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:16.520
 in a third place in the congress lost 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:18.379
 important governorates and indeed the 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.809
 own leaders of the bread say that 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.089
 this is a catastrophic defeat for a 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:25.999
 party that was 12 years in power 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:28.069
 who did not manage to build a leader 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:30.949
 important to beat peña grandson- of 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.110
 made josefina vásquez mota was not and 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.599
 that now is quite disjointed 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.319
 thinking that the party that handled that 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:41.389
 state for 70 years returns to power 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.189
 old pri new pri 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.349
 this is the great doubt if one thinks of the 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:47.929
 old pri the one who built a state 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.300
 important centralized that nationalized 

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:51.830
 for example oil in 70 that 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.809
 opened its doors to the exiles of the 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.939
 Spanish republic the exiles 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:58.029
 Latin Americans in the 70s very 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.309
 good relationship with Cuba but also 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:02.719
 deeply corrupt and authoritarian 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:04.849
 from the 97 that had no majority to 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.129
 congress the pri now apparently the 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.839
 will have very important because who 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.820
 has a majority will be able to govern with 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.830
 some slack 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.590
 pending as you wish to say in a 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.810
 first moment violence more than 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.850
 50,000 people killed in the last 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.820
 during the debates that took place between 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.370
 the candidates the subject practically not 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.560
 it was conspicuous by its absence and as 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.880
 well he said Juan they are six months until 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.500
 the delivery to power the first of 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.680
 December remembers this movement of 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.630
 young I am 132 already said they are going to 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.070
 leave others on the street today they left and 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.320
 they're not going to allow Peña grandson 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.630
 assume the presidency you have to see how it 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.310
 develops this movement strangely 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.310
 novelty of the last weeks
