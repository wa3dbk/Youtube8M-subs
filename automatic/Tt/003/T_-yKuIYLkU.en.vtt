4.3 inch screen but the resolutions

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.929 
4.3 inch screen but the resolutions
about<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> same<00:01:27.509> 480<00:01:27.960> by<00:01:28.200> 800<00:01:28.409> pixels<00:01:29.130> so

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
about the same 480 by 800 pixels so

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.300 
about the same 480 by 800 pixels so
let's<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.840> started<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.470> these<00:01:31.680> benchmarks

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
let's get started with these benchmarks

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.550 
let's get started with these benchmarks
and<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.270> phones<00:01:33.869> perform<00:01:34.350> like

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and see what the phones perform like

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.039 
and see what the phones perform like
running<00:01:35.009> side<00:01:35.250> by<00:01:35.280> side<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.570> I've<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:36.750> on

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
running side by side so here I've got on

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:37.550 
running side by side so here I've got on
the<00:01:37.140> left

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the left

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.700 
the left
that'll<00:01:37.979> novo<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.460> 850<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> right<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that'll novo a 850 and on the right the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.819 
that'll novo a 850 and on the right the
Samsung<00:01:41.130> Galaxy<00:01:41.520> s2<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.930> we're<00:01:43.470> gonna<00:01:43.619> let

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
Samsung Galaxy s2 and we're gonna let

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.800 
Samsung Galaxy s2 and we're gonna let
this<00:01:44.100> antutu<00:01:44.549> benchmark<00:01:44.729> run<00:01:45.390> through<00:01:45.659> its

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
this antutu benchmark run through its

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.310 
this antutu benchmark run through its
various<00:01:46.170> tests<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.729> perform

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
various tests to see how they perform

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.749 
various tests to see how they perform
now<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.649> very<00:01:49.860> clear<00:01:50.130> from<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> footage

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
now it's not very clear from the footage

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.289 
now it's not very clear from the footage
here<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.649> 5.5<00:01:53.460> inch<00:01:53.700> screen<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
here but with that 5.5 inch screen the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.389 
here but with that 5.5 inch screen the
Lenovo<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.960> much<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:55.890> bigger<00:01:56.100> than<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
Lenovo is much much bigger than the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.480 
Lenovo is much much bigger than the
Samsung<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:58.320> completely<00:01:58.890> dwarfed<00:01:59.250> sit

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
Samsung it's it completely dwarfed sit

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.810 
Samsung it's it completely dwarfed sit
in<00:01:59.610> size<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.920> also<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.040> weight<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.520> mean<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
in size and also in weight I mean it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.350 
in size and also in weight I mean it
completely<00:02:03.049> fills<00:02:04.049> my<00:02:04.290> hand<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.939> comes<00:02:06.180> in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
completely fills my hand and it comes in

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.889 
completely fills my hand and it comes in

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.830 
additional weights on the Lenovo but the
screen<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.560> much<00:02:20.070> bigger<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:21.420> one<00:02:21.600> thing

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.500 
screen is that much bigger the one thing
we're<00:02:22.050> quite<00:02:22.290> disappointed<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.120> upon<00:02:24.120> first

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
we're quite disappointed with upon first

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.630 
we're quite disappointed with upon first
impressions<00:02:25.020> about<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> 850<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.190> despite

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
impressions about the a 850 is despite

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.660 
impressions about the a 850 is despite
having<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.000> massive<00:02:27.500> 5.5<00:02:28.500> inch<00:02:28.680> screen<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
having that massive 5.5 inch screen the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.370 
having that massive 5.5 inch screen the
resolution<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.270> pretty<00:02:30.510> low<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.900> fact<00:02:31.170> it's

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
resolution is pretty low in fact it's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.070 
resolution is pretty low in fact it's
marginally<00:02:32.180> better<00:02:33.180> resolution<00:02:33.600> than<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
marginally better resolution than the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.410 
marginally better resolution than the
galaxy<00:02:34.620> s<00:02:34.740> 2<00:02:34.950> s<00:02:35.010> only<00:02:35.340> got<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.670> few<00:02:35.850> more<00:02:36.000> pixels

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
galaxy s 2 s only got a few more pixels

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.130 
galaxy s 2 s only got a few more pixels
so<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.740> actually<00:02:38.370> only<00:02:38.670> running<00:02:38.850> at<00:02:38.970> 960<00:02:39.780> by

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
so it's actually only running at 960 by

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.970 
so it's actually only running at 960 by
540<00:02:41.660> resolution<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.840> puts<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.710> with<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
540 resolution and that puts it with a

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.240 
540 resolution and that puts it with a
pixel<00:02:44.400> density<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.390> about<00:02:46.230> 200<00:02:46.890> pixels

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
pixel density of just about 200 pixels

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.920 
pixel density of just about 200 pixels
per<00:02:47.400> inch<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.910> there's<00:02:48.180> actually<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.690> lower

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
per inch so there's actually a lower

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.570 
per inch so there's actually a lower
pixel<00:02:49.320> density<00:02:49.680> than<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.890> two-year-old

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
pixel density than the two-year-old

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.770 
pixel density than the two-year-old
galaxy<00:02:51.480> s2<00:02:51.660> which<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.140> running<00:02:52.380> about<00:02:52.470> 218<00:02:53.780> so

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
galaxy s2 which is running about 218 so

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.660 
galaxy s2 which is running about 218 so
it's<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.960> little<00:02:55.170> bit<00:02:55.260> disappointing<00:02:55.800> for<00:02:56.130> a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
it's a little bit disappointing for a

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.970 
it's a little bit disappointing for a
new<00:02:57.210> phone<00:02:57.450> least<00:02:57.840> only<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.080> few<00:02:58.260> months<00:02:58.560> ago<00:02:58.830> in

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
new phone least only a few months ago in

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.880 
new phone least only a few months ago in
2013<00:02:59.840> but<00:03:00.840> despite<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.290> it's<00:03:01.470> got<00:03:01.620> pretty

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
2013 but despite this it's got pretty

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.350 
2013 but despite this it's got pretty
impressive<00:03:02.160> specs<00:03:02.580> elsewhere<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.940> what<00:03:06.180> else

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
impressive specs elsewhere so what else

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.210 
impressive specs elsewhere so what else
can<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.600> tell<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.900> about<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.170> Lenovo<00:03:07.740> a850

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
can we tell you about the Lenovo a850

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.440 
can we tell you about the Lenovo a850
well<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:09.090> running<00:03:10.040> 4.2.2<00:03:11.040> jelly<00:03:11.160> bean<00:03:11.580> that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
well it's running 4.2.2 jelly bean that

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.180 
well it's running 4.2.2 jelly bean that

version of Android which is pretty

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.240

though when it first originally ships
back<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.560> may<00:03:46.740> 2011<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.670> was<00:03:47.760> only<00:03:47.910> running<00:03:48.060> in

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
back in may 2011 it was only running in

version<00:03:48.630> 2.3<00:03:49.050> Gingerbread<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.790> we're<00:03:50.910> getting

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
version 2.3 Gingerbread so we're getting

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
towards the end of tests now and you can

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.170 
towards the end of tests now and you can
see<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.050> a850<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.740> running<00:03:56.070> slightly<00:03:56.670> ahead<00:03:56.760> I

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
see the a850 is running slightly ahead I

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.570 
see the a850 is running slightly ahead I
mean<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:57.870> quite<00:03:58.170> expected<00:03:58.680> it's<00:03:58.830> much<00:03:59.340> newer

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
mean it's quite expected it's much newer

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.820 
mean it's quite expected it's much newer
hardware<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:00.300> got<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.450> quad<00:04:00.720> core<00:04:00.990> faster

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
hardware it's got a quad core faster

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
gig in the Galaxy s2 so we're going to

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.140 
gig in the Galaxy s2 so we're going to
expect<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.200> be<00:04:07.320> doing<00:04:07.700> pretty<00:04:08.700> much<00:04:08.790> better

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
expect it to be doing pretty much better

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.699 
expect it to be doing pretty much better
at<00:04:09.390> everything<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.959> mean<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.320> graphical

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.050 
at everything I mean the graphical
performance<00:04:10.830> you<00:04:11.220> can<00:04:11.340> see<00:04:11.489> is<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.700> little<00:04:11.940> bit

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
performance you can see is a little bit

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.479 
performance you can see is a little bit
better<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.720> it's<00:04:13.410> definitely<00:04:13.860> with<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.190> quad

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
better and it's definitely with the quad

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.770 
better and it's definitely with the quad
core<00:04:14.700> it's<00:04:14.850> gonna<00:04:14.970> be<00:04:15.090> doing<00:04:15.300> so<00:04:15.600> much<00:04:15.720> better

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
core it's gonna be doing so much better

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.659 
core it's gonna be doing so much better
at<00:04:16.230> things<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.530> multitasking<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.520> just

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
at things like multitasking and just

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.710 
at things like multitasking and just
general<00:04:18.180> day-to-day<00:04:18.450> use<00:04:19.700> so<00:04:20.700> it's<00:04:21.419> kind<00:04:21.660> of

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
general day-to-day use so it's kind of

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.570 
general day-to-day use so it's kind of
hard<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.049> see<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.260> numbers<00:04:22.290> here<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.280> think

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
hard to see the numbers here but I think

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.909 
hard to see the numbers here but I think
you<00:04:23.790> can<00:04:24.090> tell<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.930> lenovo<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.650> doing

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
you can tell that the lenovo is doing

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.260 
you can tell that the lenovo is doing
slightly<00:04:26.340> better<00:04:26.520> in<00:04:26.669> this<00:04:26.820> 3d

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
slightly better in this 3d

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.779 
slightly better in this 3d
graphics<00:04:27.599> test<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.229> mean<00:04:28.949> again<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.310> hasn't<00:04:29.460> got

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
graphics test I mean again it hasn't got

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.150 
graphics test I mean again it hasn't got
that<00:04:29.819> powerful<00:04:30.330> screen<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:31.080> actually<00:04:31.919> power

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
that powerful screen to actually power

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.320 
that powerful screen to actually power
but<00:04:33.090> it's<00:04:33.960> still<00:04:34.490> much<00:04:35.490> new<00:04:35.669> hardware<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.090> much

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
but it's still much new hardware a much

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.629 
but it's still much new hardware a much
newer<00:04:36.539> phone<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.979> would<00:04:38.069> expect<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.610> to

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
newer phone and you would expect it to

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.860 
newer phone and you would expect it to
be<00:04:38.729> performing<00:04:39.180> much<00:04:39.330> better<00:04:39.360> than<00:04:39.780> these

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
be performing much better than these

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.390 
be performing much better than these
tests<00:04:40.259> so<00:04:40.349> what<00:04:40.530> are<00:04:40.590> we<00:04:40.680> actually<00:04:40.800> getting<00:04:41.009> so

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
tests so what are we actually getting so

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.159 
tests so what are we actually getting so
that<00:04:41.699> a<00:04:41.729> novos<00:04:42.090> got<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.330> school<00:04:42.599> of<00:04:42.659> sixteen

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
that a novos got a school of sixteen

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.659 
that a novos got a school of sixteen
thousand<00:04:43.740> eight<00:04:43.889> hundred<00:04:43.979> and<00:04:44.190> fifty<00:04:44.460> three

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
thousand eight hundred and fifty three

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.490 
thousand eight hundred and fifty three
that's<00:04:44.970> pretty<00:04:45.330> impressive<00:04:45.599> for<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.289> price

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
that's pretty impressive for the price

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.409 
that's pretty impressive for the price
you're<00:04:46.650> paying<00:04:46.710> for<00:04:47.009> that<00:04:47.159> and<00:04:47.370> much<00:04:48.000> older

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
you're paying for that and much older

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.990 
you're paying for that and much older
Samsung<00:04:48.780> Galaxy<00:04:49.110> s2<00:04:49.470> is<00:04:50.310> getting<00:04:50.789> a<00:04:50.879> much

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
Samsung Galaxy s2 is getting a much

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.110 
Samsung Galaxy s2 is getting a much
weaker<00:04:51.300> score<00:04:51.720> only<00:04:52.020> about<00:04:52.199> ten<00:04:52.590> thousands<00:04:53.129> so

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
weaker score only about ten thousands so

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.360 
weaker score only about ten thousands so
that's<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.479> benchmark<00:04:54.930> tests<00:04:55.440> comparison

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
that's the benchmark tests comparison

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.700 
that's the benchmark tests comparison
between<00:04:56.550> these<00:04:56.970> two<00:04:57.210> phones<00:04:57.509> I<00:04:57.930> mean<00:04:58.590> they're

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
between these two phones I mean they're

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.230 
between these two phones I mean they're
obviously<00:04:58.979> very<00:04:59.069> different<00:04:59.430> devices<00:04:59.819> and

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
obviously very different devices and

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.990 
obviously very different devices and
ones<00:05:00.960> much<00:05:01.199> older<00:05:01.590> than<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.009> other<00:05:02.130> one<00:05:02.370> but

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
ones much older than the other one but

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.279 
ones much older than the other one but
hopefully<00:05:03.479> this<00:05:03.630> gives<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.020> better<00:05:04.199> idea

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
hopefully this gives you a better idea

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:05.960 
hopefully this gives you a better idea
of<00:05:04.650> how<00:05:04.889> they<00:05:05.220> compare<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.580> each<00:05:05.729> other

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
of how they compare to each other

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.999 
of how they compare to each other
because<00:05:06.720> they're<00:05:06.900> not<00:05:07.139> too<00:05:07.500> dissimilar<00:05:07.710> in

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
because they're not too dissimilar in

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.010 
because they're not too dissimilar in
