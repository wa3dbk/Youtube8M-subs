00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
abilities one thing to note this is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.120 
abilities one thing to note this is
actually<00:01:08.700> superior<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.780> my<00:01:09.840> office<00:01:10.560> which

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
also shares a cool-down with so you

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.249 
also shares a cool-down with so you
can't<00:01:13.229> use<00:01:13.970> amorphous<00:01:15.229> whilst<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.680> sunshine

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
can't use amorphous whilst in sunshine

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.469 
can't use amorphous whilst in sunshine
as<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:20.220> does<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.549> share<00:01:20.909> its<00:01:21.060> cooldown

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
as it does actually share its cooldown

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.330 
as it does actually share its cooldown
with<00:01:21.840> each<00:01:21.960> other<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.439> that's<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> only

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
with each other so that's the only

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.609 
with each other so that's the only
downside<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.939> again<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.020> better<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> use

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
downside but again it is better to use

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.609 
downside but again it is better to use
them<00:01:25.920> amorphous<00:01:26.400> nowadays<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.500> it's<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
them amorphous nowadays and it's the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.870 
them amorphous nowadays and it's the
most<00:01:28.890> powerful<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.970> magic<00:01:30.780> ultimate<00:01:31.320> ability

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
most powerful and magic ultimate ability

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.969

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
okay so onto def swiftness this is a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.160 
okay so onto def swiftness this is a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
does compete against berserk mode now

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.969 
does compete against berserk mode now
finally<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.329> range<00:01:40.200> actually<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> decent

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.020 
Ultimates that's pure in my opinion
natural<00:02:42.110> instinct<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:43.040> ultimate<00:02:43.610> defense

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
natural instinct is a ultimate defense

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
doubled as you can see here and so it

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.630
