00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.229
 vitali rosales is a rising star in the corner of skating 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.919
 At age 13, she is the regional champion of the United States in freestyle 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:17.429
 behaves more like a star I saw what the young stars believe in the 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.320
 universe so inconstant to turn as British wanted more and faster 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.819
 being of its steps inwards 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.879
 when I wanted to scare it out I was delayed then little my arms towards 

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:31.879
 inside and I want more quickly 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.440
 the stars newly formed by gas and dust lands also rotate 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.290
 faster and faster as they collapse inwards 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.060
 some could even spin to pieces and at the back they were put 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.120
 Brake 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.640
 astronomers using NASA's spitzer space telescope have 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.200
 found evidence that yes something can make dusty discs 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.460
 planetary training materials I think some celebration 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.720
 we found that the stars with them 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.140
 pleasure rock also promised that the stars and two discs 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 the stars are slowly killing is much more likely to have a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 disco a star that is rapidly running out 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.580
 astronomers as ibiza attached that the magnetic field of a star 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 acts as a belt that closes on the powder disk 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.190
 what is happening in these young stars that have discs is 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.500
 that the magnetic field of these stars is really locked 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.890
 discs 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.229
 like the skater that arms and simple legs is clapping while 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.060
 is trying to throw fernando 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.360
 even when she is trying to pull faster 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.610
 because it's dumping stuff while it's spinning 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.880
 red bull and other scientists believed that team building 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.770
 it causes them discomfort 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.500
 but lack of evidence here I have spies 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.600
 the powerful infrared observatory 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.420
 to identify the heat 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.250
 they will go when here 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 in france we are trying to imagine how it will be 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.560
 and if around 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 stars similar to him planets are formed or just 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.550
 and if only one 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.050
 then by blanket that herb is dedicated that two stars of another form would be 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.849
 twins arencibia 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.849
 It could be that this magical ingredient is streamlined 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.369
 the relationship of those who live 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.399
 goes beyond the skating rink 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.399
 the astronomers this room 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.899
 last turns of the stars and plans 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:30.689
