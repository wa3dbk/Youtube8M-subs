not to use any of the seeds because

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.120 
not to use any of the seeds because
that's<00:01:32.640> usually<00:01:33.000> where<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:34.140> majority<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that's usually where the majority of the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.600 
that's usually where the majority of the
heat<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.690> wood<00:01:36.690> peppers<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.680> dr.<00:01:38.040> pepper<00:01:38.280> we've

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
heat is wood peppers so dr. pepper we've

add about I'm guessing about 3/4 cups of
water<00:05:11.789> to<00:05:12.149> this<00:05:12.349> bring<00:05:13.349> it<00:05:13.469> up<00:05:13.589> to<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:13.860> boil<00:05:14.339> and

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
water to this bring it up to a boil and

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.629 
water to this bring it up to a boil and
then<00:05:14.819> turn<00:05:15.089> it<00:05:15.360> down<00:05:15.389> to<00:05:15.539> a<00:05:15.719> gentle<00:05:16.169> simmer

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
then turn it down to a gentle simmer

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.439 
then turn it down to a gentle simmer
cover<00:05:17.639> the<00:05:17.819> pot<00:05:18.059> and<00:05:18.330> let<00:05:18.629> it<00:05:18.659> cook<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:21.300> as<00:05:21.360> you

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
cover the pot and let it cook so as you

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
can see it's it's come to a boil now so

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.489 
can see it's it's come to a boil now so
I'm<00:05:23.580> going<00:05:23.729> to<00:05:23.789> turn<00:05:23.969> the<00:05:24.120> heat<00:05:24.270> down<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.839> a

I'm going to turn the heat down to a

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.769 
I'm going to turn the heat down to a
gentle<00:05:25.979> simmer<00:05:26.189> put<00:05:26.759> the<00:05:26.879> lid<00:05:27.119> on<00:05:27.149> there<00:05:27.539> and

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:30.149 
allow that to cook until everything gets

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:32.659 
allow that to cook until everything gets
tender<00:05:30.990> it's<00:05:31.529> going<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.740> start<00:05:32.099> going<00:05:32.339> into<00:05:32.520> a

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
tender it's going to start going into a

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.459 
tender it's going to start going into a
sort<00:05:32.909> of<00:05:32.969> a<00:05:33.089> mush<00:05:33.360> but<00:05:33.599> that's<00:05:33.749> exactly<00:05:34.349> the

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
sort of a mush but that's exactly the

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.399 
sort of a mush but that's exactly the
consistency<00:05:35.189> we're<00:05:35.729> looking<00:05:36.089> for<00:05:36.360> it's<00:05:37.229> been

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
consistency we're looking for it's been

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.760 
consistency we're looking for it's been
cooking<00:05:37.800> now<00:05:37.949> for<00:05:37.979> about<00:05:38.779> 25<00:05:39.779> minutes<00:05:39.809> or<00:05:40.319> so<00:05:40.529> I

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
cooking now for about 25 minutes or so I

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.100 
cooking now for about 25 minutes or so I
just<00:05:41.430> removed<00:05:41.789> the<00:05:41.909> lid<00:05:42.089> off<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.509> there's

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
just removed the lid off it there's

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.809 
just removed the lid off it there's
still<00:05:43.199> a<00:05:43.439> little<00:05:43.649> bit<00:05:43.860> of<00:05:43.979> liquid<00:05:44.279> in<00:05:44.580> there

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:44.819 
still a little bit of liquid in there

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:47.389 
still a little bit of liquid in there
now<00:05:45.599> it's<00:05:45.779> not<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.110> most<00:05:46.289> attractive<00:05:46.559> looking

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:47.399 
now it's not the most attractive looking

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:49.639 
now it's not the most attractive looking
dish<00:05:47.610> simply<00:05:47.939> because<00:05:48.240> we've<00:05:49.080> allowed<00:05:49.379> the

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:49.649 
dish simply because we've allowed the
