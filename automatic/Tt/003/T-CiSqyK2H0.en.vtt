wonderful<00:00:58.739> car<00:00:59.089> we<00:01:00.089> started<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.659> thrust<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
wonderful car we started the thrust to

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.149 
wonderful car we started the thrust to
program<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.890> 1979<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.290> we<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.739> had<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.070> the

program in 1979 and we all we had in the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.510 
program in 1979 and we all we had in the
world<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.659> 175<00:01:06.659> pounds<00:01:07.260> okay<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.220> that's

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
world was 175 pounds okay so that's

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.679 
world was 175 pounds okay so that's
where<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.760> started

where we started

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.030 
where we started
we<00:01:09.960> built<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> car<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> Isle<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> Wight

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
we built the car on the Isle of Wight

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740 
we built the car on the Isle of Wight
the<00:01:11.520> designer<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> very<00:01:12.360> clever<00:01:12.510> guy

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the designer was a very clever guy

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.170 
the designer was a very clever guy
called<00:01:13.050> John<00:01:13.200> Aykroyd<00:01:13.620> we<00:01:14.580> couldn't<00:01:14.940> even

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
called John Aykroyd we couldn't even

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.800 
called John Aykroyd we couldn't even
afford<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:16.050> have<00:01:16.230> a<00:01:16.890> telephone<00:01:17.480> and<00:01:18.480> it<00:01:18.660> was<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
afford to have a telephone and it was a
huge<00:01:19.230> fight<00:01:19.530> he<00:01:19.710> took<00:01:19.920> four<00:01:20.130> years<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.370> get<00:01:20.550> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
huge fight he took four years to get the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.930 
huge fight he took four years to get the
car<00:01:20.910> built<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.220> basically<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.790> took

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
car built and and then basically we took

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.720 
car built and and then basically we took
it<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.090> Bonneville<00:01:24.480> in<00:01:25.110> 1981<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.340> got<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> all

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
it to Bonneville in 1981 we got it all

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.510 
it to Bonneville in 1981 we got it all
wrong<00:01:27.320> we<00:01:28.320> were<00:01:28.470> trying<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> run<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> car<00:01:29.340> with

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
wrong we were trying to run the car with

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.400 
wrong we were trying to run the car with
solder<00:01:29.820> wheels<00:01:30.000> Imus<00:01:30.420> Alton<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.140> didn't

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
solder wheels Imus Alton that didn't

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.770 
solder wheels Imus Alton that didn't
work<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.100> car<00:01:32.310> hammered<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.820> hell<00:01:33.090> but

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
work and the car hammered like hell but

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
work and the car hammered like hell but
what<00:01:34.230> we<00:01:34.380> did<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.710> was<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.370> five<00:01:35.670> hundred

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
what we did get was one five hundred

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
what we did get was one five hundred
mile<00:01:36.120> an<00:01:36.150> hour<00:01:36.300> run<00:01:36.510> and<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.350> was<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.890> was

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
mile an hour run and that was that was

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.440 
mile an hour run and that was that was
really<00:01:38.100> great<00:01:38.550> that<00:01:38.760> really<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.360> great

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
really great that really was great

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.880 
really great that really was great
because<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.020> could<00:01:40.200> show<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.740> we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
because then we could show you know we

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.910 
because then we could show you know we
really<00:01:41.070> could<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:42.230> but<00:01:43.230> then<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.650> desert

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
really could do it but then the desert

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.040 
really could do it but then the desert
flooded<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.580> we<00:01:44.670> had<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:44.970> home<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:45.450> when

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
flooded and we had to go home and when

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.750 
flooded and we had to go home and when
we<00:01:46.140> got<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.320> Bonneville<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.920> 1982<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.490> flooded

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
we got to Bonneville in 1982 it flooded

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.460 
we got to Bonneville in 1982 it flooded
immediately<00:01:48.300> so<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.870> hopeless<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.260> couldn't

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
immediately so it's hopeless we couldn't

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.320 
immediately so it's hopeless we couldn't
even<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> car<00:01:49.920> off<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.100> trailer<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.180> we

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
even get the car off the trailer so we

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.610 
even get the car off the trailer so we
searched<00:01:51.510> around<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.290> found<00:01:52.320> this

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
searched around and we found this

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.870 
searched around and we found this
wonderful<00:01:52.860> place<00:01:53.220> called<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.550> Black<00:01:53.700> Rock

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
wonderful place called the Black Rock

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.000 
wonderful place called the Black Rock
Desert<00:01:54.120> in<00:01:54.450> Nevada<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:55.050> this<00:01:55.710> has<00:01:55.860> got<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
Desert in Nevada and this has got a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.590 
Desert in Nevada and this has got a
different<00:01:56.220> surface<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.030> instead<00:01:57.330> of<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
different surface so instead of it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.440 
different surface so instead of it
actually<00:01:58.020> being<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.530> hard<00:01:59.100> hard<00:01:59.580> salt

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
actually being the hard hard salt

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.810 
actually being the hard hard salt
we<00:02:00.810> got<00:02:01.020> an<00:02:01.530> alkali<00:02:01.920> Playa<00:02:02.220> deficit<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:02.790> is

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
we got an alkali Playa deficit which is

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.390 
we got an alkali Playa deficit which is
more<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.330> as<00:02:03.479> I've<00:02:03.600> dried<00:02:03.810> mud<00:02:04.140> leak<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.950> we

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
more like as I've dried mud leak so we

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.490 
more like as I've dried mud leak so we
got<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.120> we<00:02:06.299> got<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> car<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.900> 600

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
got going and we got the car up to 600

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.820 
got going and we got the car up to 600
15<00:02:07.830> miles<00:02:08.039> an<00:02:08.190> hour<00:02:08.280> which<00:02:08.489> is

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
15 miles an hour which is

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.220 
15 miles an hour which is
good<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.490> it<00:02:09.729> was<00:02:09.820> all<00:02:09.970> going<00:02:10.180> well<00:02:10.420> but<00:02:11.020> then

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
good and it was all going well but then

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.870 
good and it was all going well but then
it<00:02:11.350> rained<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.770> was<00:02:11.980> too<00:02:12.220> late<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.670> was<00:02:12.760> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
it rained it was too late and it was the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.880 
it rained it was too late and it was the
end<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> season<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.630> everything<00:02:13.870> else<00:02:14.110> so

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
end of the season and everything else so

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.470 
end of the season and everything else so
we<00:02:15.070> then<00:02:15.220> had<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.490> go<00:02:15.580> back<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.970> England<00:02:16.090> again

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
we then had to go back to England again

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.110 
we then had to go back to England again
and<00:02:16.660> we<00:02:16.720> came<00:02:16.930> for<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.140> finally<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:17.920> 1983<00:02:18.700> and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
and we came for that finally in 1983 and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.640 
and we came for that finally in 1983 and
we<00:02:19.420> pushed<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:19.960> we<00:02:20.050> pushed<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.560> we

you get to 300 miles an hour then it

starts to settle down and then you think

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.030 
starts to settle down and then you think
about<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.580> is<00:03:27.700> 300<00:03:28.240> to<00:03:28.330> 550<00:03:28.900> s<00:03:28.960> boring<00:03:29.200> it's

about it is 300 to 550 s boring it's
really<00:03:30.310> boring<00:03:30.490> it's<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:30.820> more<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.750> same

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
really boring it's just more of the same

really boring it's just more of the same
but<00:03:32.170> faster<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.800> then<00:03:33.550> when<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.850> start

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
but faster and then when you start

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.390

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.640 
getting up to 550 and towards 600
something<00:03:36.910> happens<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.510> here<00:03:37.930> just<00:03:38.200> on<00:03:38.380> here

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
something happens and here just on here

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.040 
something happens and here just on here
you<00:03:39.010> see<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.370> shock<00:03:39.580> wave<00:03:39.760> build-up<00:03:40.300> as<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
you see the shock wave build-up as the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.110 
you see the shock wave build-up as the
air<00:03:41.170> flow<00:03:41.350> locally<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.280> shop<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.760> intake

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
air flow locally of the shop the intake

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.910 
air flow locally of the shop the intake
here<00:03:43.300> goes<00:03:43.540> supersonic<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:44.740> one

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
here goes supersonic and on one

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.160 
here goes supersonic and on one
particular<00:03:45.040> day<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.820> whole<00:03:46.030> car<00:03:46.330> was<00:03:46.360> clogged

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
particular day the whole car was clogged

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.610 
particular day the whole car was clogged
in<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.650> very<00:03:47.890> fierce<00:03:48.340> mist<00:03:48.820> from<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.840> the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
in a very fierce mist from the the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.960 
in a very fierce mist from the the
change<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:51.070> pressure<00:03:51.220> which<00:03:51.550> was<00:03:51.700> causing

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
change in pressure which was causing

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.140 
change in pressure which was causing
this<00:03:52.270> in<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.630> from<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.560> shockwaves<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:55.030> a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
this in the from the shockwaves it's a

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.670 
this in the from the shockwaves it's a
very<00:03:55.330> new<00:03:55.420> experience<00:03:55.570> because<00:03:56.410> of<00:03:56.440> your

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
very new experience because of your

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.640 
very new experience because of your
mental<00:03:56.860> processes<00:03:57.510> speed<00:03:58.510> right<00:03:58.720> up<00:03:58.900> so

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
mental processes speed right up so

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.310 
mental processes speed right up so
everything<00:04:00.160> happens<00:04:00.400> in<00:04:00.850> very<00:04:01.270> very<00:04:01.810> slow

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
everything happens in very very slow

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.580 
everything happens in very very slow
motion<00:04:02.920> at<00:04:03.570> 650<00:04:04.570> miles<00:04:04.750> an<00:04:04.959> hour<00:04:05.110> you<00:04:05.410> can<00:04:05.440> see

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
motion at 650 miles an hour you can see

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.100 
motion at 650 miles an hour you can see
every<00:04:06.100> single<00:04:06.490> detail<00:04:06.880> on<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.270> track<00:04:07.540> come

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
every single detail on that track come

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.910 
every single detail on that track come
up<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.380> go<00:04:08.530> under<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:08.950> car

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.290 

you<00:04:12.920> go<00:04:13.099> through<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.430> measured<00:04:13.730> mile<00:04:13.910> and

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
you go through the measured mile and

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.610 
you go through the measured mile and
then<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.629> fun<00:04:14.810> starts<00:04:14.840> because<00:04:15.379> you've<00:04:15.500> got

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
then the fun starts because you've got

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.690 
then the fun starts because you've got
to<00:04:15.709> think<00:04:15.800> about<00:04:16.010> stopping<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.579> that

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
to think about stopping and that

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.960 
to think about stopping and that
stopping<00:04:17.510> these<00:04:17.630> cars<00:04:17.930> is<00:04:18.169> not<00:04:18.200> easy<00:04:18.730> so<00:04:19.730> what

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
stopping these cars is not easy so what

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.330 
stopping these cars is not easy so what
we<00:04:20.090> do<00:04:20.299> is<00:04:20.419> rust<00:04:20.660> do<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.530> come<00:04:21.739> back<00:04:22.010> on<00:04:22.220> the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
we do is rust do is to come back on the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.070 
we do is rust do is to come back on the
throttle<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.880> cancel<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.389> afterburner<00:04:23.870> and

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
throttle to cancel the afterburner and

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.870 
throttle to cancel the afterburner and
then<00:04:24.710> we've<00:04:24.860> got<00:04:25.010> to<00:04:25.160> give<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.400> engine<00:04:25.520> three

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
then we've got to give the engine three

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.790 
then we've got to give the engine three
seconds<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.510> cool<00:04:26.750> which<00:04:27.320> seems<00:04:27.530> an<00:04:27.680> eternity

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
seconds to cool which seems an eternity

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.460 
seconds to cool which seems an eternity
at<00:04:28.340> these<00:04:28.490> speeds<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.970> then<00:04:29.870> at<00:04:30.050> that<00:04:30.200> point

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
at these speeds and then at that point

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.159 
at these speeds and then at that point
can<00:04:30.979> you<00:04:31.130> shut<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.970> fuel<00:04:32.630> off<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.900> engine

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
can you shut the fuel off the engine

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.629 
can you shut the fuel off the engine
which<00:04:33.290> is<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.680> do<00:04:33.800> with<00:04:33.919> your<00:04:34.070> right<00:04:34.220> foot<00:04:34.490> and

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
which is you do with your right foot and

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.850 
which is you do with your right foot and
with<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.300> oil<00:04:35.540> with<00:04:35.870> your<00:04:35.900> right<00:04:36.350> finger<00:04:36.740> you

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
with the oil with your right finger you

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.290 
with the oil with your right finger you
press<00:04:37.250> on<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.490> button<00:04:37.610> on<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.120> steering

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
press on the button on the steering

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.480 
press on the button on the steering
wheel<00:04:38.540> it's<00:04:38.660> far<00:04:38.870> as<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.080> parachute<00:04:39.470> bang<00:04:39.950> and

wheel it's far as the parachute bang and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.879 
wheel it's far as the parachute bang and
you've<00:04:40.760> got<00:04:40.910> 6g<00:04:41.540> deceleration<00:04:42.350> you're<00:04:42.530> losing

vertically<00:05:02.060> straight<00:05:02.300> down<00:05:02.540> into<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.020> middle

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
vertically straight down into the middle

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.440 
vertically straight down into the middle
of<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.380> earth<00:05:03.530> he<00:05:04.490> admitted<00:05:04.820> afterwards<00:05:05.360> he

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
of the earth he admitted afterwards he

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.909 
of the earth he admitted afterwards he
said<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.660> thought<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:05.990> was<00:05:06.200> going<00:05:06.410> mad<00:05:06.440> but<00:05:06.889> I

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
said I thought I was going mad but I

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.710 
said I thought I was going mad but I
didn't<00:05:07.160> dare<00:05:07.340> tell<00:05:07.580> anybody<00:05:07.790> what<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.479> earth

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
didn't dare tell anybody what the earth

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.240 
didn't dare tell anybody what the earth
is<00:05:08.930> going<00:05:09.110> wrong<00:05:09.320> with<00:05:09.440> me<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.950> eventually

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
is going wrong with me and eventually

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.740 
is going wrong with me and eventually
one<00:05:10.669> of<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:10.850> other<00:05:10.970> drivers<00:05:11.300> out<00:05:11.600> at

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
one of the other drivers out at

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.940 
one of the other drivers out at
Bonneville<00:05:12.050> said<00:05:12.229> yeah<00:05:12.350> when<00:05:12.650> you<00:05:12.740> put<00:05:12.889> the

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
Bonneville said yeah when you put the

Bonneville said yeah when you put the
parachutes<00:05:13.280> out<00:05:13.370> that<00:05:13.700> always<00:05:13.940> happens<00:05:14.270> then

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
hour four hundred miles an hour is so

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.990 
hour four hundred miles an hour is so
slow<00:05:18.770> that<00:05:19.039> you<00:05:19.100> want<00:05:19.340> to<00:05:19.430> open<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.700> door<00:05:19.880> and
