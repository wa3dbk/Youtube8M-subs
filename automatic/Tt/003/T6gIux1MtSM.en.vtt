00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.590
 hello let's reverse now 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.520
 attention to the brush that works 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.210
 an artist can say that for an artist 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.430
 there is never a lot of brushes always 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.430
 for different tasks 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.879
 there are different brushes and sometimes on 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.290
 the foreground some 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.770
 certain become loved but 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.680
 then they become useless or 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.379
 artistic task changes are written 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.340
 pictures of a different type and a different plan and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:01.649
 so others are beginning to be used 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.680
 brushes I work with brushes 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.759
 building this brush with 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:15.860
 building it may be used for 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:18.660
 Canvas cardboard primer can be 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.890
 use elastic with a brush like you 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.869
 see this brush is elastic that's more 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.119
 soft she can already participate 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:35.099
 writing pictures and color overlaps 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.440
 large areas with the softness of her 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:42.060
 the nap will be helps to reach 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.479
 use of those specific effects or 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.000
 other brushes in the picture of course 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.580
 is made up of experience gradually 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.690
 do you understand what is the task before you 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.860
 worth and what brush to take to perform 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:05.390
 I donâ€™t throw away a task 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.890
 old brushes here you see cysts which 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:15.530
 It was accidentally heard for what you can 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:20.000
 Now apply this Zaderey winnel brush 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.350
 maybe some more raw paint 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.390
 movements 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.390
 create the effect of grass stalks 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:35.489
 here's an old brush that many years 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:42.030
 used but at the same time I and and 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.660
 I save for some effects of my own 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:51.989
 works 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:53.760
 here's an old brush I had this one 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.280
 brush which I want to show you 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:03.480
 and this brush is specially cut she 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.720
 dipped in paint and then to some 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.459
 movements create the effect of grass and 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.959
 account that in this brush 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.410
 very rare hair blades of grass are created 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.410
 easy 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.200
 in my arsenal a lot for curing brushes 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.599
 of course they are more so 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.599
 used for watercolor painting 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:38.260
 big brushes for writing big 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.430
 plots to take a flat smaller brush 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.340
 smaller brushes 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.319
 already two prescription details for 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.349
 prescribing details of pollen over 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:58.150
 hard brushes they are more convenient to hold 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:04:01.930
 fine lines of course for writing 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:06.799
 watercolor works can be applied and 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.860
 nylon brushes but already more for small 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:17.209
 details because nylon brush 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:22.460
 tighter and elastic yes you can 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:28.430
 see I have a large supply not bosom on 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:31.940
 brushes are also called kapron brushes 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.880
 new generation they recently came on 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.810
 market but very fond of artists 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:43.479
 such brushes serve long 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:46.720
 well washed with solvents and 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.600
 successfully applied in watercolor 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.960
 oil painting and acrylan 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.200
 there are also such rounded brushes 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.610
 the stroke of this brush allows you to immediately create 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:04.810
 there are some far trees 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:10.729
 because there is some rounded moment 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.960
 who also peculiarly creates his 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.940
 charms 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.569
 the painted picture can also work 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:22.220
 edge of the brush and and but also helps 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.190
 almost on the print of this brush you 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.860
 already see that it could be some 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.710
 plant leaf 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.780
 well, pretty big it all depends on 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:38.930
 picture size if you need to show 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.099
 small foliage at small work then 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.360
 Ilona used my brushes and more 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:48.229
 small 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.270
 jerky movements i like to use 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.720
 just such 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:06:00.650
 a hair brush dipping it into paint 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:04.550
 can be carried long lines are lines 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:07.669
 tree trunks and twigs and this brush 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:14.630
 successfully creates such 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:19.880
 still such but it is necessary to mention 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:23.030
 about bristle brushes brushes now i have them 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.250
 I use less but I can say that 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.240
 artist's arsenal they still don't 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:35.780
 replaced them somewhere you need to create more 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:37.430
 rough surfaces some boards and for 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:43.159
 account that brush 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:49.210
 tough and rough she leaves her 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:50.330
 imprint on the surface of the picture and her 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.430
 using 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.860
 remains necessary for artists 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:07:01.020
 as I said brushes a lot does not happen 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:03.399
 I definitely exist 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.990
 a certain number of new brushes 

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:12.369
 which I currently do not use here 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:15.039
 such a small stock and large 

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:20.710
 number of brushes for everyday 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:25.319
 work for each job i can choose 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:30.539
 certain cysts that will create your 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:34.479
 unique imprint and will create 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:37.569
 certain texture that will help 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:42.490
 perform the tasks set in this or 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:44.740
 another job I finish my review 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.619
 I can say that a novice artist 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:51.339
 it is not necessary to have as many brushes 

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:55.389
 but promoted his work you 

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:58.899
 you will understand that a large number 

00:07:55.389 --> 00:08:02.409
 brushes helps solve problems and their 

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:05.610
 never thank you so much for 

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:05.610
 attention goodbye
