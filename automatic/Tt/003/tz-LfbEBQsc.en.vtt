00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
but here's my crank bearings and I

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.360 
but here's my crank bearings and I
should<00:03:08.209> have<00:03:08.300> cleaned<00:03:08.540> them<00:03:08.720> before<00:03:09.370> making

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
should have cleaned them before making

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.110 
should have cleaned them before making

the template everything all the main
bearings<00:03:24.530> are<00:03:25.209> it's<00:03:26.209> all<00:03:26.420> within<00:03:26.660> range

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
bearings are it's all within range

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.890 
bearings are it's all within range
according<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.519> book<00:03:29.319> so<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:31.569> just<00:03:32.569> wanted

have cleaned them before I pick the

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.650 
have cleaned them before I pick the
camera<00:03:41.720> but<00:03:42.790> maybe<00:03:43.790> just<00:03:44.030> give<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.329> a<00:03:44.360> general

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660

just wondering if those look okay to

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.580 
just wondering if those look okay to
reuse<00:03:59.310> now<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.670> know<00:03:59.850> I<00:04:00.300> should<00:04:00.840> what<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.170> should

kind<00:04:36.420> of<00:04:36.480> resorting<00:04:37.020> back<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:38.570> this<00:04:39.570> other

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
kind of resorting back to this other

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.900 
kind of resorting back to this other
block<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:43.370> hold<00:04:44.370> on<00:04:44.550> here<00:04:44.760> just<00:04:45.530> okay<00:04:46.790> want<00:04:47.790> to

block and hold on here just okay want to

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:59.260 
block and hold on here just okay want to
look<00:04:48.000> at<00:04:48.980> some<00:04:49.980> of<00:04:50.010> these<00:04:50.190> also

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.810 

what<00:04:59.930> are<00:05:00.140> my<00:05:00.320> chances<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:04.280> i<00:05:04.340> put<00:05:04.670> this

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
what are my chances that i put this

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.900 
what are my chances that i put this
motor<00:05:05.120> together<00:05:05.800> with<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:06.950> same<00:05:07.280> bearings

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
motor together with the same bearings

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.230 
motor together with the same bearings
that<00:05:09.010> are<00:05:10.010> in<00:05:10.130> here<00:05:12.820> what<00:05:13.820> are<00:05:13.910> my<00:05:14.000> chances

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
that are in here what are my chances

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.600 
that are in here what are my chances
that<00:05:14.630> it's<00:05:14.810> kind<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:15.020> run<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.890> know<00:05:16.010> it's

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
that it's kind of run you know it's

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.970 
that it's kind of run you know it's
going<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:16.850> last<00:05:17.320> with<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:20.260> boost<00:05:21.260> from<00:05:21.830> a

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
going to last with the boost from a

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.610 
going to last with the boost from a
whole<00:05:22.190> set<00:05:22.460> turbo<00:05:23.860> here's<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:26.440> bearings<00:05:27.440> on

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
whole set turbo here's the bearings on

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:36.770 
whole set turbo here's the bearings on
the<00:05:29.320> Pistons<00:05:31.030> or<00:05:32.030> rod<00:05:32.420> bearings

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.440 

and<00:05:37.350> they<00:05:37.650> are<00:05:37.830> they're<00:05:38.400> all<00:05:38.520> oily<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.180> dirty

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
and they are they're all oily and dirty

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.300 
and they are they're all oily and dirty
but<00:05:39.600> I<00:05:40.020> think<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:40.740> can<00:05:40.830> kind<00:05:41.040> of<00:05:41.130> get<00:05:41.280> the

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
but I think you can kind of get the

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:50.020 
but I think you can kind of get the
basic<00:05:41.820> idea

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.920 

are<00:05:50.600> those<00:05:50.780> wore<00:05:51.500> out<00:05:51.770> or<00:05:52.070> I<00:05:52.360> mean<00:05:53.360> according

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
are those wore out or I mean according

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:02.040 
are those wore out or I mean according
to<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:58.180> according<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.450> plastic<00:06:00.020> age

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
to the according to the plastic age

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.440 
to the according to the plastic age
they're<00:06:03.050> okay<00:06:03.410> but<00:06:04.090> like<00:06:05.090> where<00:06:05.330> the

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
they're okay but like where the

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:13.870 
they're okay but like where the
colorization<00:06:06.110> changes<00:06:06.980> right<00:06:07.100> there<00:06:07.630> is<00:06:08.630> that

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:21.100 

is<00:06:14.360> that<00:06:14.570> bad

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.810 

so<00:06:21.770> anyway<00:06:22.100> that<00:06:22.960> was<00:06:23.960> my<00:06:24.110> plan<00:06:24.560> as<00:06:24.920> once<00:06:25.550> I<00:06:25.670> get

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
so anyway that was my plan as once I get

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.370 
so anyway that was my plan as once I get
those<00:06:25.970> Pistons<00:06:26.480> I<00:06:26.600> was<00:06:26.720> going<00:06:26.840> to<00:06:26.900> put<00:06:27.140> them<00:06:27.200> on

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
those Pistons I was going to put them on

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.340 
those Pistons I was going to put them on
the<00:06:27.500> crank<00:06:28.180> mount<00:06:29.180> the<00:06:29.330> crank<00:06:29.630> to<00:06:29.810> this<00:06:29.960> block

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
the crank mount the crank to this block

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.410 
the crank mount the crank to this block
and<00:06:30.650> then<00:06:31.010> change<00:06:32.470> change<00:06:33.470> everything<00:06:33.740> over

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.420 
and then change change everything over

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.060 
and then change change everything over
you<00:06:35.420> know<00:06:35.540> start<00:06:35.990> taking<00:06:36.350> just<00:06:36.740> pull<00:06:36.920> this

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
you know start taking just pull this

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.060 
you know start taking just pull this
