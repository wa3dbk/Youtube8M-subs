most<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.770> images<00:00:05.160> we<00:00:05.370> work<00:00:05.640> with<00:00:05.910> use

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
most of the images we work with use

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.960 
most of the images we work with use

what's<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.750> deal<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:46.920> come<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.460> look<00:00:47.610> at

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
what's the deal if we come and look at

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.549 
what's the deal if we come and look at
our<00:00:48.180> mode<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:48.989> 8-bit<00:00:49.890> 16-bit<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.090> 32-bit

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
beyond the scope of this course but I am

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070 
beyond the scope of this course but I am
going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> discuss<00:01:05.610> 16<00:01:06.360> bits<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.900> let's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
going to discuss 16 bits so let's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.530 
going to discuss 16 bits so let's
compare<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> two<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.460> same<00:01:08.880> image<00:01:09.210> as

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
compare the two I have the same image as

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.770 
compare the two I have the same image as
an<00:01:09.689> 8<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:11.369> 16<00:01:11.909> bit<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.360> doesn't<00:01:12.600> look

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
an 8 bit and a 16 bit it doesn't look

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.850 
an 8 bit and a 16 bit it doesn't look
much<00:01:12.930> different<00:01:12.990> right

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
much different right

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.210 
much different right
well<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.390> look<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> document<00:01:16.290> sizes<00:01:16.799> we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
well if we look at the document sizes we

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.870 
well if we look at the document sizes we
can<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.000> 16<00:01:18.570> bit<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:19.880> literally

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
can see that this 16 bit is literally

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
can see that this 16 bit is literally
twice<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.049> size<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.310> 8<00:01:23.520> bit<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:25.080> look

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
twice the size of the 8 bit if we look

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.280 
twice the size of the 8 bit if we look
at<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> 16<00:01:26.159> bit<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.229> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
at the 16 bit we can see that not all of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.490 
at the 16 bit we can see that not all of
the<00:01:28.560> filters<00:01:29.040> are<00:01:29.369> available<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.210> us<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:31.259> what

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the filters are available to us but what

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.760 
the filters are available to us but what
we<00:01:31.710> gain<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> 16<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.229> ability

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
we gain with the 16 bit is the ability

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.969 
we gain with the 16 bit is the ability
to<00:01:35.070> pull<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:36.030> histograms<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.290> our<00:01:37.590> curves

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
to pull out histograms or our curves

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.730 
to pull out histograms or our curves
around<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.119> need<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> lot<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> editing

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
around if we need to do a lot of editing

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.460 
around if we need to do a lot of editing
to<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> image<00:01:41.579> maybe<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.659> need<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> lighten

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
to the image maybe we need to lighten

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.190 
to the image maybe we need to lighten
the<00:01:43.590> shadows<00:01:44.040> significantly<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:45.329> maybe<00:01:45.990> we

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the shadows significantly or maybe we

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
the shadows significantly or maybe we
need<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.590> mess<00:01:47.310> around<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> mid-tones<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
need to mess around with the mid-tones a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.679 
need to mess around with the mid-tones a
lot<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.049> which<00:01:49.740> case<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.970> away<00:01:51.149> with

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
lot in which case we can get away with

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.679 
lot in which case we can get away with
far<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.579> far<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.060> data

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
far more because we have far more data

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.660 
far more because we have far more data
to<00:01:54.869> work<00:01:55.259> with

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
to work with

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.240 
to work with
before<00:01:56.670> our<00:01:56.969> image<00:01:57.360> shows<00:01:57.930> visible<00:01:58.710> signs<00:01:59.040> of

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
before our image shows visible signs of

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.780 
before our image shows visible signs of
degradation<00:01:59.899> let's<00:02:00.899> see<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.290> mean<00:02:01.790> so

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
degradation let's see what I mean so

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.980 
degradation let's see what I mean so
what<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.689> I'm<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.059 
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
apply<00:02:04.110> some<00:02:05.600> adjustments<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.259> 8<00:02:07.740> bit

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
apply some adjustments to the 8 bit

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.219 
apply some adjustments to the 8 bit
version<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.789> I'm<00:02:08.879> not<00:02:09.060> really<00:02:09.300> looking<00:02:09.869> too

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
version and I'm not really looking too

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.750 
version and I'm not really looking too
carefully<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:10.770> what's<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
carefully at what's going on on the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400 
carefully at what's going on on the
screen<00:02:11.970> I'm<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.599> make<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> ver

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
screen I'm just going to make a ver

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.270 
screen I'm just going to make a ver
very<00:02:13.770> heavy-handed<00:02:14.700> adjustment<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:16.280> I'm

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
very heavy-handed adjustment here I'm

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.010 
very heavy-handed adjustment here I'm
gonna<00:02:17.460> get<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:17.760> midpoint<00:02:18.000> slider<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.780> bring

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
gonna get my midpoint slider and bring

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.270 
gonna get my midpoint slider and bring
it<00:02:19.140> over<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.310> right<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:21.140> then<00:02:22.140> I'm<00:02:23.070> going

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it over to the right and then I'm going

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.160 
it over to the right and then I'm going
to<00:02:23.370> imagine<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.820> I'm<00:02:23.940> doing<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.330> not<00:02:24.720> as<00:02:24.960> an

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
to imagine that I'm doing this not as an

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.720 
to imagine that I'm doing this not as an
adjustment<00:02:25.560> layer<00:02:25.710> but<00:02:26.040> as<00:02:26.190> an<00:02:26.430> image

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
adjustment layer but as an image

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.640 
adjustment layer but as an image
adjustment<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.510> been<00:02:27.630> burnt<00:02:27.990> directly

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
adjustment so it's been burnt directly

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.190 
adjustment so it's been burnt directly
onto<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.220> image<00:02:29.490> itself<00:02:29.900> I'm<00:02:30.900> going<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.080> make

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
onto the image itself I'm going to make

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170 
onto the image itself I'm going to make
another<00:02:31.590> levels<00:02:32.370> adjustment<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.000> just

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
another levels adjustment and just

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.840 
another levels adjustment and just
basically<00:02:33.780> reverse<00:02:34.350> why<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.650> did<00:02:34.950> get<00:02:35.640> my

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
basically reverse why I did get my

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.780 
basically reverse why I did get my
midpoint<00:02:36.150> slider<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.380> move<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.370> back<00:02:38.430> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
midpoint slider and move that back to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.230 
midpoint slider and move that back to
the<00:02:38.910> left

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
the left

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.590 
the left
I<00:02:39.710> know<00:02:40.710> I've<00:02:40.830> introduced<00:02:41.250> more<00:02:41.430> contrast<00:02:41.880> but

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
I know I've introduced more contrast but

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.220 
I know I've introduced more contrast but
what<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.470> want<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.100> show<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.910> that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
what I really want to show you is that

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.530 
what I really want to show you is that
I've<00:02:46.230> introduced<00:02:47.040> degradation<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:48.300> we<00:02:48.390> look

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
I've introduced degradation if we look

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.110 
I've introduced degradation if we look
at<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.720> shadow<00:02:48.990> areas<00:02:49.590> there<00:02:50.010> we<00:02:50.580> can<00:02:50.730> see<00:02:50.970> we

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
at the shadow areas there we can see we

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.390 
at the shadow areas there we can see we
now<00:02:51.270> have<00:02:51.300> banding<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.530> way<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.860> we<00:02:52.950> didn't

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
now have banding in a way that we didn't

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.490 
now have banding in a way that we didn't
have<00:02:53.580> before

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
have before

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.110 
have before
now<00:02:55.500> let's<00:02:55.710> see<00:02:55.920> what<00:02:56.100> happens<00:02:56.430> if<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.850> take

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
now let's see what happens if I take

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.840 
now let's see what happens if I take
these<00:02:57.390> exact<00:02:57.990> two<00:02:58.440> levels<00:02:59.070> adjustment<00:02:59.670> layers

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
these exact two levels adjustment layers

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.260 
these exact two levels adjustment layers
and<00:03:00.180> copy<00:03:00.930> them<00:03:01.170> over<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.010> 16-bit<00:03:02.580> version

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
and copy them over to the 16-bit version

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.690 
and copy them over to the 16-bit version
which<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.440> open<00:03:04.890> right<00:03:04.920> here<00:03:05.430> I'm<00:03:05.580> going

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
which I have open right here I'm going

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.510 
which I have open right here I'm going
to<00:03:05.760> split<00:03:06.240> my<00:03:06.390> screen<00:03:06.660> vertically<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.680> then

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
to split my screen vertically and then

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.120 
to split my screen vertically and then
I'm<00:03:08.700> just<00:03:08.820> going<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.120> drag<00:03:09.360> these<00:03:09.600> two<00:03:10.130> onto

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
I'm just going to drag these two onto

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.470 
I'm just going to drag these two onto
the<00:03:11.250> 16-bit<00:03:11.700> version<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:14.700> know<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.180> image

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the 16-bit version and I know the image

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.370 
the 16-bit version and I know the image
looks<00:03:15.720> terrible

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
looks terrible

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.840 
looks terrible
that's<00:03:16.650> not<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.070> point<00:03:17.280> I'm<00:03:17.490> trying<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.760> make

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
that's not the point I'm trying to make

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.430 
that's not the point I'm trying to make
here<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.300> just<00:03:18.330> want<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.690> show<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.020> what's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
here I just want to show you what's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.530 
here I just want to show you what's
gonna<00:03:19.680> happen<00:03:19.910> when<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.000> do<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> lot<00:03:21.510> of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
gonna happen when you do a lot of

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.320 
gonna happen when you do a lot of
editing<00:03:22.290> how<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.100> might<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.940> able<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.150> get

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
editing how you might be able to get

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.090 
editing how you might be able to get
away<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:24.720> more<00:03:25.020> if<00:03:25.500> you're<00:03:25.740> working<00:03:25.950> with

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
away with more if you're working with

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.940 
away with more if you're working with
16-bit<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.150> I'm<00:03:27.390> going<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.600> come<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.560> 8-bit

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
16-bit so I'm going to come to the 8-bit

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.180 
16-bit so I'm going to come to the 8-bit
version<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.580> then<00:03:30.420> choose<00:03:30.780> match<00:03:31.230> zoom<00:03:31.800> and

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
version and then choose match zoom and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.220 
version and then choose match zoom and
location<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.480> we've<00:03:33.600> got<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> direct

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
location so we've got a direct

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.500 
location so we've got a direct
comparison<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.640> left<00:03:35.970> we<00:03:36.180> have<00:03:36.209> the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
comparison there on the left we have the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.300 
comparison there on the left we have the
8-bit<00:03:36.930> version<00:03:37.290> look<00:03:37.500> at<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:37.740> posterization

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
8-bit version look at that posterization

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.310 
8-bit version look at that posterization
and<00:03:38.880> banding<00:03:39.330> that's<00:03:39.510> occurring<00:03:40.020> in<00:03:40.170> that

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
and banding that's occurring in that

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.430 
and banding that's occurring in that
shadow<00:03:40.680> area<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.360> 16-bit<00:03:42.840> version

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
shadow area and in the 16-bit version

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.590 
shadow area and in the 16-bit version
the<00:03:44.010> exact<00:03:44.459> same<00:03:44.700> adjustment<00:03:45.300> being<00:03:45.480> made<00:03:45.780> but

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
the exact same adjustment being made but

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.920 
the exact same adjustment being made but
with<00:03:48.600> far<00:03:49.140> less<00:03:49.250> degradation<00:03:50.270> so<00:03:51.270> that's<00:03:51.630> what

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
with far less degradation so that's what

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.470 
with far less degradation so that's what
a<00:03:51.959> 16-bit<00:03:52.950> file<00:03:53.370> can<00:03:53.760> do<00:03:53.940> for<00:03:54.180> you

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
a 16-bit file can do for you

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.890 
a 16-bit file can do for you
if<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:55.020> don't<00:03:55.230> mind<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.860> extra<00:03:56.550> weight<00:03:56.790> of

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
if you don't mind the extra weight of

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.090 
if you don't mind the extra weight of
increased<00:03:57.900> file<00:03:58.230> size<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.940> the<00:04:00.020> possible

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
increased file size and the possible

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.229 
increased file size and the possible
inconvenience<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.280> not<00:04:02.459> being<00:04:02.640> able<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.970> use

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
inconvenience of not being able to use

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.870
