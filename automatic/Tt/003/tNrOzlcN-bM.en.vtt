00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:12.600
 In my kitchen today, there are delicious 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.709
 puff apple big and though 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.119
 we need the doubt 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:22.960
 we were together here i got that 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:26.949
 brought nuclear house housing and now have 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.300
 I have a cutting board here as well 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.640
 always want to call her 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:42.730
 I will then try the apples too 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:45.450
 Write like that and I will now with 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.450
 to increase that 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:17.989
 be that with a first much sugar 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:19.400
 and a tablespoon of sugar and something 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.290
 I may still be earlier 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.709
 a bowl that maybe better of 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:29.480
 let the whole stand then about 15 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.010
 they will become that by now too 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.810
 in which poker applies and so we will 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.400
 also a bit softer and you can then 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.400
 better too 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:49.900
 the apples are too little through me now 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:54.650
 here is a role already laid out here 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.400
 I think that's better 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.510
 silicone 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:06.410
 but I still have one 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:10.600
 bit me not where we want to 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.600
 he does not care so much 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:22.250
 now we cut I would say so 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.250
 78 cm pieces 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:05:06.910
 okay, that's a bit of a walk away 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:11.440
 top out so that the one piece out 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:20.760
 may come should have to half 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:20.760
 were just under 2.4 ahead 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.049
 OK 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:48.020
 so we do not fold this now and 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.020
 I want to be careful here 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:08.740
 that's how it looks then it comes in 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:12.520
 put the box in and we'll do it 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.220
 now with all her life 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.190
 I 've introduced you all now 1 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:24.160
 in vain to a formal one 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.850
 culminates I have here which one 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.670
 able to see 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.110
 the day is a bit thicker so one 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.210
 a little wider cut 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.150
 Here I have something for the day 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.419
 narrow cut so 3 cm and then 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.560
 also rolled up you can do 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.090
 as you want it if you are a bit 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.400
 you can do it more like this one dough 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.720
 if you're a little bit more off the apple 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.230
 taste today he does it so 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.970
 like here 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.910
 You can also in this brown sugar 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.180
 and this sugar mixture is slightly cinnamon 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.070
 But do I connect pure cinnamon always 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.960
 a little bit with christmas and me 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.150
 think now is not necessarily 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.600
 So we want so you can too 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.810
 do 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.540
 The whole is now in the oven 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:13.120
 190 degrees for about 15-20 minutes depending on 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:18.940
 stove or hearth as you see 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:21.880
 I can finish that look great 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.410
 Great, really nice and I mean 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.150
 they were really hard 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.710
 not even the dough is already done 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:31.840
 really only the apples have to shop 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:34.000
 fine slices and just 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.130
 a turn so what so move away 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.479
 that was not it now i have here 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.690
 one more thing I have in a few 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:47.770
 Film Rhein is also a great idea 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:49.210
 they also make fun, I hope 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.250
 you liked the video 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.490
 try it out until next time 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.490
