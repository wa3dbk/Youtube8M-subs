00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.390 
then the prices of missing less I worked
out<00:00:21.730> a<00:00:21.789> a<00:00:22.529> more<00:00:23.529> efficient<00:00:23.950> way<00:00:24.070> of<00:00:24.099> holding

the yarn so I thought I'd show you okay
so<00:00:29.320> making<00:00:29.700> sure<00:00:30.700> that<00:00:30.969> we're<00:00:31.119> ready<00:00:31.270> to<00:00:31.509> knit

I'm going to assume you can all net
wrapping<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.620> yarn<00:00:35.649> around<00:00:35.890> my<00:00:36.280> little

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
finger and separating the end so I'm

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.340 
finger and separating the end so I'm
ready<00:00:39.910> to<00:00:40.000> try<00:00:40.210> notice<00:00:40.629> I'm<00:00:40.780> picking<00:00:41.109> up<00:00:41.170> the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
ready to try notice I'm picking up the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.250 
ready to try notice I'm picking up the
back<00:00:41.530> one<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.100> bringing<00:00:42.640> up<00:00:42.730> forward<00:00:43.179> to<00:00:44.079> make

the stitch and off first couple of

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.610 
the stitch and off first couple of
stitches<00:00:47.920> are<00:00:48.309> always<00:00:48.960> odd<00:00:49.960> because<00:00:50.440> you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
stitches are always odd because you

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.049 
stitches are always odd because you
haven't<00:00:50.800> got<00:00:50.949> enough<00:00:51.159> to<00:00:51.309> hold<00:00:51.399> needle<00:00:51.820> path

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.469 

and<00:01:08.860> notice<00:01:09.159> how<00:01:09.340> I've<00:01:09.490> got<00:01:09.700> my<00:01:09.820> finger<00:01:10.210> held

and notice how I've got my finger held
end<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:11.229> keep<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.530> hands<00:01:11.740> apart<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.370> makes

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
end to keep the hands apart that makes

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.090 
end to keep the hands apart that makes
it<00:01:12.759> easy<00:01:12.909> to<00:01:13.119> bring<00:01:13.329> it<00:01:13.540> bottom<00:01:14.439> yarn<00:01:14.590> up<00:01:14.860> and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
it easy to bring it bottom yarn up and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.300 
it easy to bring it bottom yarn up and
over<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.490> make<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.850> stitch<00:01:16.119> in<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:18.040> of<00:01:18.189> the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
over to make the stitch in one of the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.160 
over to make the stitch in one of the
books<00:01:18.579> I<00:01:18.880> think<00:01:19.299> it's<00:01:19.420> knitting<00:01:19.750> around<00:01:19.869> the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
books I think it's knitting around the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.780 
books I think it's knitting around the
world<00:01:20.380> where<00:01:20.619> they<00:01:20.740> talk<00:01:20.950> about<00:01:20.979> twine<00:01:21.610> to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
world where they talk about twine to

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.440 
world where they talk about twine to
nothing<00:01:23.579> they<00:01:24.579> say<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.090> can<00:01:25.270> tell

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
nothing they say that you can tell

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.420 
nothing they say that you can tell
whether<00:01:25.659> someone's<00:01:26.170> twining<00:01:26.710> from<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.189> hand

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
whether someone's twining from the hand

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.389 
whether someone's twining from the hand
position<00:01:27.909> in<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.119> photograph<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:29.469> I<00:01:30.159> keep

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
position in the photograph and I keep

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.920 
position in the photograph and I keep
looking<00:01:30.579> at<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.909> photographs<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.509> I<00:01:31.570> think

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
looking at the photographs and I think

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.800 
looking at the photographs and I think
what<00:01:32.110> they<00:01:32.259> mean<00:01:32.289> is<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.189> hands<00:01:33.460> are

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
what they mean is that the hands are

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.240 
what they mean is that the hands are
hunched<00:01:34.810> over<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:35.320> pulling<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.799> answer<00:01:36.100> that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
hunched over and pulling the answer that

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.149 
hunched over and pulling the answer that
I<00:01:36.430> did<00:01:36.670> so<00:01:37.630> finger<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.289> separate<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:38.859> the<00:01:38.979> end

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
I did so finger and separate in the end

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.219 
I did so finger and separate in the end
one<00:01:39.640> on<00:01:39.759> one<00:01:39.880> comes<00:01:40.180> over<00:01:40.329> around<00:01:40.719> and<00:01:40.990> makes

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
one on one comes over around and makes

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.160 
one on one comes over around and makes
the<00:01:41.469> stitch<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.680> can<00:01:44.829> get<00:01:45.009> quite<00:01:45.280> fast

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the stitch and you can get quite fast

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.170 
the stitch and you can get quite fast
working<00:01:47.170> this<00:01:47.320> way<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.920> lot<00:01:48.579> easier<00:01:48.939> than<00:01:49.030> what

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
working this way a lot easier than what

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.880 
working this way a lot easier than what
I<00:01:49.210> was<00:01:49.390> doing<00:01:49.450> before<00:01:49.869> which<00:01:50.289> was<00:01:50.439> picking

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
I was doing before which was picking

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.249 
I was doing before which was picking
them<00:01:51.009> up<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.310> keeps<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:54.850> twist<00:01:55.240> if<00:01:56.109> I

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
them up and it keeps the twist if I

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.190 
them up and it keeps the twist if I
don't<00:01:56.469> need<00:01:56.619> your<00:01:57.070> hip<00:01:57.359> keeps<00:01:58.359> the<00:01:58.570> twist<00:01:58.899> out
