back as a team so you don't you know

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.940 
back as a team so you don't you know
when<00:02:07.329> our<00:02:07.359> whole<00:02:07.630> team<00:02:07.840> is<00:02:08.019> together<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.830> a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
when our whole team is together in a

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.059 
when our whole team is together in a
very<00:02:09.250> deadly<00:02:09.819> as<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.149> team<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.690> know<00:02:11.230> but<00:02:11.440> one

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
very deadly as a team you know but one

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.220 
very deadly as a team you know but one
thing<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.280> think<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.970> huge<00:02:13.030> plus<00:02:13.690> for<00:02:13.750> us<00:02:13.959> is

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
thing I think is a huge plus for us is

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.839 
thing I think is a huge plus for us is
when<00:02:14.379> George<00:02:14.709> goes<00:02:14.860> again<00:02:15.099> in<00:02:15.160> foul<00:02:15.340> trouble<00:02:15.489> I

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
when George goes again in foul trouble I

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.930 
when George goes again in foul trouble I
mean<00:02:16.180> he<00:02:17.170> alters<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.010> blocks<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.549> many<00:02:18.760> shots

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
mean he alters and blocks so many shots

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.940 
mean he alters and blocks so many shots
down<00:02:19.120> there<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:19.720> lets<00:02:19.900> lets<00:02:20.290> us<00:02:20.470> wings<00:02:20.739> you
