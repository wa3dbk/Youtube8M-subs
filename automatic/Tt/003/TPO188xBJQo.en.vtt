going<00:00:19.350> toward<00:00:19.650> then<00:00:19.800> my<00:00:19.890> setup<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
going toward then my setup and the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.769 
going toward then my setup and the
results<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.910> then<00:00:21.000> at<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.359> end<00:00:21.390> I'm<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
do a slow mo of my best lap I think it's

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.340 
do a slow mo of my best lap I think it's
probably<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.269> better<00:00:24.359> way<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.539> do<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.199> once

so this love i'll try not to comment on
how<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> actually<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.790> i<00:00:32.910> thought<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
how to actually do it i thought a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.580 
how to actually do it i thought a
billion<00:00:33.420> last<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.780> bit<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.380> gonna<00:00:34.530> be

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
billion last as bit but it's gonna be

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.650 
billion last as bit but it's gonna be
tricky<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:34.890> me<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.790> analyze<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.570> I've

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
tricky for me just analyze what I've

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.940 
tricky for me just analyze what I've
actually<00:00:36.780> done<00:00:37.020> there<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:37.440> Robin<00:00:37.739> what

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
actually done there and then Robin what

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690 
I'm going to do so a little bit wide on
the<00:00:39.420> apex<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.680> too<00:00:40.860> bad<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.489> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
a lot of speed in and up taking this

a lot of speed in and up taking this
corner<00:01:16.980> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.100> break<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.820> late<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.240> take

that my speed in there and that was when
I<00:01:20.400> sit<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.970> close<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.510> barrier<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:21.900> wow

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I sit so close to the barrier there wow

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
I sit so close to the barrier there wow
how'd<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> lose<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:22.980> front<00:01:23.220> wing<00:01:23.370> then<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.700> was

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
how'd that lose my front wing then I was

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.740 
how'd that lose my front wing then I was
amazing<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.070> my<00:01:26.070> theoretical<00:01:26.880> personal<00:01:27.570> best

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
amazing and my theoretical personal best

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.090 
amazing and my theoretical personal best
on<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.080> track<00:01:28.440> in<00:01:28.620> practice<00:01:28.920> was<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
on this track in practice was a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.290 
on this track in practice was a
one-minute<00:01:29.550> 9.9<00:01:30.510> he<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:30.990> three

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
one-minute 9.9 he was a two or three

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.270 
one-minute 9.9 he was a two or three
which<00:01:33.300> is<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.510> quick<00:01:33.690> lap<00:01:33.870> I'm<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:34.830> very<00:01:35.040> quick

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
which is a quick lap I'm very very quick

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
which is a quick lap I'm very very quick
why<00:01:35.490> i<00:01:35.520> had<00:01:35.850> my<00:01:35.880> actual<00:01:36.390> best<00:01:36.570> i<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
why i had my actual best i think was a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.320 
why i had my actual best i think was a
point<00:01:37.410> for<00:01:37.740> maybe<00:01:38.490> point<00:01:38.670> five<00:01:38.970> something

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
point for maybe point five something

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.490 
point for maybe point five something
like<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.510> sitting<00:01:39.720> quite<00:01:40.050> my<00:01:40.200> scene<00:01:40.260> in<00:01:40.470> a

again nefeli gears up to seventh into

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.890 
again nefeli gears up to seventh into
the<00:02:05.490> first<00:02:05.700> corner<00:02:05.940> pushing<00:02:06.420> harder<00:02:06.810> this

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
the first corner pushing harder this

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.440 
the first corner pushing harder this
time<00:02:06.960> oh<00:02:07.260> look<00:02:07.710> at<00:02:08.070> that<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:08.970> start<00:02:09.210> lap<00:02:09.300> over

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
time oh look at that so I start lap over

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
time oh look at that so I start lap over
before<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:09.899> even<00:02:09.960> begun<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.979> again

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
before it's even begun really just again

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.230 
before it's even begun really just again
pushed<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.460> little<00:02:11.550> bit<00:02:11.730> too<00:02:11.790> hard<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.120> I've

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
pushed a little bit too hard so I've

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
pushed a little bit too hard so I've
quick<00:02:12.390> look<00:02:12.510> at<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.630> sector<00:02:12.900> times<00:02:13.080> in

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
quick look at the sector times in

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.410 
quick look at the sector times in
between<00:02:13.380> these<00:02:13.620> next<00:02:13.920> two<00:02:14.010> laps<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.970> that's<00:02:15.330> my

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
between these next two laps so that's my

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.420 
between these next two laps so that's my
current<00:02:15.660> best<00:02:15.780> 18.2<00:02:16.410> about<00:02:16.650> two-tenths<00:02:17.250> off

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
current best 18.2 about two-tenths off

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.920 
current best 18.2 about two-tenths off
my<00:02:17.550> person<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.940> first<00:02:18.150> sector<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.660> over<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
my person a first sector just over that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.770 
my person a first sector just over that
really<00:02:19.430> i'm<00:02:20.430> always<00:02:20.760> half<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.060> second<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.660> my

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
really i'm always half a second of my

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.780 
really i'm always half a second of my
best<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.140> middle<00:02:22.350> sector<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:23.700> I've

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
best in the middle sector I think I've

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.180 
best in the middle sector I think I've
done<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.910> point<00:02:24.180> definitely<00:02:24.720> no<00:02:24.810> point<00:02:24.989> eight

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
done a point definitely no point eight

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.800 
done a point definitely no point eight
as<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.430> ten<00:02:26.640> someone<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.120> bad<00:02:27.300> for<00:02:27.540> tents

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
as for ten someone that bad for tents

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.449 
as for ten someone that bad for tents
and<00:02:28.110> once<00:02:28.560> again<00:02:28.650> about<00:02:28.830> two<00:02:29.010> tenses<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.370> a

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
and once again about two tenses in a

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.130 
and once again about two tenses in a
point<00:02:29.670> five<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.150> final<00:02:30.510> sector<00:02:30.780> there<00:02:30.930> so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
point five in the final sector there so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.350 
point five in the final sector there so
quite<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> way<00:02:31.980> off<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.940> said<00:02:33.030> almost<00:02:33.180> a

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
quite a way off and like I said almost a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
quite a way off and like I said almost a
second<00:02:33.810> off<00:02:33.930> my<00:02:34.080> theoretical<00:02:34.380> best<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.890> quite

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
second off my theoretical best in quite

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.880 
second off my theoretical best in quite
a<00:02:35.070> long<00:02:35.100> way<00:02:35.340> poll<00:02:35.610> colonies<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.060> 9.7<00:02:36.890> many

female all set is that by Bubba
attempted<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.720> bit<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.310> yeah<00:02:41.730> hopefully<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.209> can

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
attempted a bit so yeah hopefully I can

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
best lap at the end because that's

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.319 
best lap at the end because that's
better<00:03:25.829> for<00:03:25.980> tire<00:03:26.160> where<00:03:26.370> you've<00:03:26.820> done<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.180> lap

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
better for tire where you've done in lap

on<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.510> tides<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.900> course<00:03:28.109> I<00:03:28.380> believe<00:03:29.040> as<00:03:29.160> how

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
on the tides of course I believe as how

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.890 
on the tides of course I believe as how
this<00:03:29.400> game<00:03:29.519> works<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.209> get<00:03:30.390> less<00:03:30.540> highway

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
this game works is you get less highway

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.520 
this game works is you get less highway
to<00:03:31.079> get<00:03:31.320> up<00:03:31.440> at<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.739> end<00:03:32.180> anyway<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.359> so<00:03:33.600> just

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
to get up at the end anyway then so just

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.220 
to get up at the end anyway then so just
to<00:03:34.739> rip<00:03:34.890> them<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.190> at<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.549> exit<00:03:35.790> tunnel

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
to rip them to at the exit tunnel

to rip them to at the exit tunnel
breaking<00:03:37.230> very<00:03:37.380> late<00:03:37.530> game<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.739> will<00:03:37.799> slow

they're all that just caused me to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.099 
they're all that just caused me to
almost<00:03:41.489> hit<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.760> barrier<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.150> normally

I'll<00:03:43.230> go<00:03:43.470> first<00:03:43.829> no<00:03:44.070> no<00:03:44.220> go<00:03:44.370> down<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.670> first<00:03:44.910> and

touch the wall there really scruffy

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.319 
touch the wall there really scruffy
doubt<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:46.829> has<00:03:46.889> been<00:03:47.100> pushed<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.120> bit<00:03:48.239> too

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329
