School of Arts and Sciences is about I

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.790 
School of Arts and Sciences is about I
learned<00:00:28.360> how<00:00:28.509> to<00:00:28.540> think<00:00:28.810> outside<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.169> box<00:00:29.439> and

learned how to think outside the box and

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.589 
learned how to think outside the box and
rather<00:00:29.980> than<00:00:30.220> learning<00:00:30.700> from<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.060> book<00:00:31.329> is

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
rather than learning from a book is

I can I started off through the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.599 
I can I started off through the
leadership<00:00:40.060> bus<00:00:40.510> program<00:00:40.989> that<00:00:41.609> sparks

School of Arts and Sciences you find

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.450 
School of Arts and Sciences you find
something<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.840> didn't<00:00:53.079> even<00:00:53.230> know<00:00:53.559> that<00:00:53.920> you

Cantonese in English and then when I
came<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.109> Rutgers<00:00:59.559> I<00:00:59.800> had<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.010> great

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
language and so I started learning

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.640 
language and so I started learning
French<00:01:03.879> in<00:01:04.269> terms<00:01:04.480> of<00:01:04.629> SAS<00:01:05.050> they<00:01:05.379> really

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
French in terms of SAS they really

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.650 
French in terms of SAS they really
stress<00:01:05.950> interdisciplinary<00:01:06.940> learning<00:01:07.000> reason

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
stress interdisciplinary learning reason

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.630 
stress interdisciplinary learning reason
why<00:01:07.780> I<00:01:08.140> wanted<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.740> double<00:01:09.010> majors<00:01:09.310> because<00:01:09.610> I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
why I wanted to double majors because I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.580 
why I wanted to double majors because I
like<00:01:09.880> knowing<00:01:10.060> how<00:01:10.240> things<00:01:10.390> work<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:11.470> like

know how the body works I like knowing
how<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.150> world<00:01:13.390> works<00:01:13.659> after<00:01:14.170> coming<00:01:14.500> back

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
how the world works after coming back

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.260 
how the world works after coming back
from<00:01:14.829> my<00:01:15.040> study<00:01:15.340> abroad<00:01:15.460> experience<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.180> had

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
from my study abroad experience I had

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.270 
from my study abroad experience I had
this<00:01:16.360> new<00:01:16.540> outlook<00:01:16.990> on<00:01:17.200> language<00:01:17.650> itself<00:01:17.979> and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
this new outlook on language itself and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.649 
this new outlook on language itself and
that's<00:01:18.579> how<00:01:18.729> I've<00:01:18.880> been<00:01:18.909> interested<00:01:19.420> in

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
that's how I've been interested in

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.030 
that's how I've been interested in
linguistics<00:01:19.810> when<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.500> enrolled<00:01:20.650> in<00:01:20.979> the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
School of Arts and Sciences I really

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.830 
School of Arts and Sciences I really
wanted<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.740> merge<00:01:24.070> between<00:01:24.479> science<00:01:25.479> education

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
wanted a merge between science education

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.389 
wanted a merge between science education
but<00:01:26.020> also<00:01:26.439> a<00:01:26.560> liberal<00:01:26.950> arts<00:01:27.340> education

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
but also a liberal arts education

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.539 
but also a liberal arts education
exercise<00:01:28.390> physiology<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.710> was<00:01:29.920> exactly<00:01:30.399> what

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
exercise physiology it was exactly what

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.789 
exercise physiology it was exactly what
I<00:01:30.579> was<00:01:30.729> looking<00:01:30.970> for<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.479> chose<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.409> School<00:01:32.770> of

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
I was looking for I chose the School of

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.490 
I was looking for I chose the School of
Arts<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.159> Sciences<00:01:33.250> because<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.689> was<00:01:35.020> a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
Arts and Sciences because it was a

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.289 
Arts and Sciences because it was a
strong<00:01:35.920> liberal<00:01:36.340> arts<00:01:36.579> program<00:01:37.030> can

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
strong liberal arts program can

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.120 
strong liberal arts program can
