00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 and we will do it because we need only this pass 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.720
 left on 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.539
 counterclockwise 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.079
 back 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.619
 schedule 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:13.619
 schedule 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.619
 behind counterclockwise to the left games 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:22.400
 our vlc we must therefore make us a form of the yellow cross plus 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:24.150
 we already have other parts 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 built but not interested 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.880
 as you see perfect attic 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.850
 that now that we have the cross 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.370
 let's get settled 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.670
 Diane woods 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.370
 let's see if the medians were already in place we have the orange and medians 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.180
 green 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.180
 and I'm already in place with the yellow edges 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.820
 so let's keep the song of the sun chords, for example 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.800
 which is right 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.240
 we execute this panda algorithm to arrange the other two on average are 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.790
 the red and blue that are not right 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.660
 like this problem 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.580
 to the right 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.570
 over it 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.400
 times right zu over time right up above time twice eldest reached 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.560
 and to fix these years we have to do 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.439
 another 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.850
 the simple algorithm that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.230
 ski for me 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.320
 d 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.370
 move them senses, let it all stop, let's go and get it if we already have it 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.840
 right one 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.080
 by fair we mean candy colors of the surroundings 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.440
 the three sides 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.440
 even if he voted, it's okay anyway 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.430
 we don't even have a skype user so let's start as we wish otherwise 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.200
 we would have gotten to the right 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050
 towards us the right one 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.900
 and let's proceed with this greeting 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.230
 above right time xoom above counterclockwise left sunutv above times 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.530
 best through above 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.980
 counterclockwise 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
 left down 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.079
 as you can see if it's settled 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.810
 that is, in its position 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.810
 yellow and red blue that I am 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.069
 the others are all wrong 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.649
 so let's keep this on the right 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.259
 the remake of the 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.539
 above times right up above counterclockwise 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.620
 sinistratosud 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.639
 above times 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.919
 right down 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.919
 above counterclockwise left down 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.969
 abi anam 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.969
 still just right so he has to do it again 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.889
 right on sopranzi was left on soprano 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.889
 coming down was left 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:54.659
 it's time for the network that we've made it, we have all the right angles 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.760
 for this it is orange and green and yellow which are the treatises and 10 24 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.159
 this video with yellow orange blue this red yellow dot 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.309
 and this with red yellow green so now we have to do the last operation 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.709
 which simply serves to rotate 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.829
 these corners 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.419
 we start with the first one because we have no one right 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.120
 we leave at random with this 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.399
 Giallorossi verdicts 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:23.169
 and we do so 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.469
 right down 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.129
 left 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.139
 right up 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.219
 below right 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:33.009
 it messed us up. did nothing 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.819
 we repeat it until this tube is right 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.639
 when I press this angle right we can proceed to 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.639
 right down a left 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.659
 ok you see the corner given its place 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.499
 green red pity that it has messed with all of us. 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.020
 it's not a problem because the oil we follow signs the part 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.120
 we have a cube 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.219
 right towards me 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.769
 we hold firm apart below illustrated below 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.349
 ewo i love only the part above 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.879
 let's solve it 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.969
 so to vote this too 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.889
 in this thing we will have the fact that the cube that it is is back in place 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.889
 messed up 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.749
 below left right up 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:18.889
 below right, right, down the left-right ceiling, to the right 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.990
 we also have this corner appended 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.699
 so these two are okay here we are always messed up has no problems 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.279
 let's vote only the part above 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.749
 and we arrange the tourist 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.139
 be down below left right on the right button 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.370
 maestro giuseppe sinistra left on petticoat in this case not me 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.370
 they were enough twice I have one even does travolta and olivia 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:44.639
 but 4 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.389
 do it until you tell me 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.159
 affixed 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.879
 as you can see how much I can too 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:54.159
 now all we need is the last one and this will magically make it go back to that 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.169
 that had messed up 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.289
 we turn it keeping it seems part of it we have only this and we have 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.289
 on our right towards us the market corner 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.620
 right down below left right up 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.830
 petticoat 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.080
 right down below left right up 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.280
 right site being burned left right up 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.069
 last time towards the resurrected left 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.360
 right up 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.360
 petticoat 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.419
 the last layer 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.210
