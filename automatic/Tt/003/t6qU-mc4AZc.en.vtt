00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.550
 Is it 19 from the beginning of the influence of a paperback book? 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.510
 It will be the practice menu painting of the influence which shows that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.509
 I guess he should have been the first update 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.690
 After this 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.039
 In Emerson Kanazawa 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.190
 Yes, it's a big first to climb up the mantle Perth 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.550
 I was treated 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.349
 The base world 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.460
 Morning control to tomorrow 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
 Mr. Yamashita has one to one 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.400
 Low points to watch out for today's one-on-one introduction 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.820
 Is it because 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.870
 Released as 8 media 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.870
 It was a spot before the goal 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.900
 Other players have an image up to a little shot 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.380
 Yeah 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.800
 I'm addicted and it's not like a mature knit hat 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.490
 I think 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.310
 It's late, but I brought it around myself at one time 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.870
 As well 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.910
 5 weeks to boot with this boot exactly 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.300
 First of all 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.440
 about it 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.990
 On the other hand, if you come next month from March to March 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.400
 I want to go inside and learn little by little 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.710
 Thoughts 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.380
 I'm sorry and when I naturally do one-on-one with my own short hair 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.070
 It is similar when you see the figure of the society that I think is Run 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 I will be in the Yamazaki Nabisco Cup final 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.280
 Please leave a message for the top team 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.980
 The president can not travel to Hawaii if Eguchi is put together 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.630
 Yes I want you to appeal I try to improve the loss and about five minutes 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.130
 I do not know the completed Middlesbrough, but I expect it 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.200
 It may come true while considering 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.160
 I think so 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.460
 On the 15th, I won the city battle victory
