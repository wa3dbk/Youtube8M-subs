later and they were sold out so I didn't
know<00:04:08.769> if<00:04:08.919> they<00:04:09.069> were<00:04:09.160> exclusive<00:04:09.849> to<00:04:09.879> kit<00:04:10.269> or

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
know if they were exclusive to kit or

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.020 
know if they were exclusive to kit or
not<00:04:10.599> I<00:04:10.949> looked<00:04:11.949> around<00:04:12.099> a<00:04:12.400> little<00:04:12.430> bit<00:04:12.819> and

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
not I looked around a little bit and

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.069 
not I looked around a little bit and
sure<00:04:13.480> enough<00:04:13.510> they<00:04:13.900> were<00:04:13.959> on<00:04:14.230> Pumas<00:04:14.859> website

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
sure enough they were on Pumas website

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.390 
sure enough they were on Pumas website
so<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.109> was<00:04:17.260> able<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.530> grab<00:04:17.769> them<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.159> don't<00:04:18.250> know

so I was able to grab them I don't know

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.940 
so I was able to grab them I don't know

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
if they're still on there or not I think

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.780 
if they're still on there or not I think
they<00:04:21.070> make<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.579> low<00:04:21.909> top<00:04:22.210> version
