 point as inside the package there 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.210
 has two amplifiers but for the 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:15.000
 moment i'm just going to present and neither 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.000

 order 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.520
 I followed the shipping process 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.470
 thanks to the tracking number that was 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.360
 provided once the purchase has been made for 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.400
 find my amplifier I used 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.680
 the application of a special help on my 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.270
 amp fries point com thanks to this help 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.800
 it is possible to choose a model 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.629
 appropriate in three steps 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.370
 you just have to choose the country the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.050
 mobile phone provider and the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.210
 coverage area where you need 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.610
 to improve the connection after having 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.989
 pressed the button found ugly offer 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.579
 amplifiers that respond to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.960
 selected settings every 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.300
 amplifiers listed on the list 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.110
 are / group depending on the type of signal 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.910
 jsmc dma 3g etc that they amplify each 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.559
 search parameters the country the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.719
 provider or coverage can be 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.739
 modified aid will therefore provide a 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.020
 new model list 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.280
 it is also possible to contact 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.840
 the managers of the two best 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.550
 more failed at points like and they you 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.550
 will help choose the right amplifier 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.700
 the package I received includes the 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.700
 manual 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.920
 the model and nikon 400 turbo 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.570
 an outdoor antenna 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.670
 indoor antenna with an adapter 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.670
 for European catches 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.020
 the support and the hooks for 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.760
 the outdoor antenna and the 9 m cap 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.470
 for the outdoor antenna 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.850
 now I have everything I need 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.210
 to be able to amplify the connection 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.340
 mobile 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.590
 here is the amplifier the antennas 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.180
 indoor outdoor an adapter the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.790
 cable for the outdoor antenna and a 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.409
 support for the outdoor antenna 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.800
 the amplifier is fast and easy to 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.890
 install 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.930
 let's start right now so 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.209
 connect the cable to the antenna 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.250
 outside it is necessary to fix 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.410
 outside lanta at a place where there is 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.239
 good reception of the mobile signal by 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.290
 example on the roof of the house or on 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.600
 the edge of a window 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.060
 once these effect we can 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.400
 now connect it to the amplifier 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.709
 then we have to connect the antenna 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.630
 indoor to the amplifier and finally 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.980
 with the help of the branches adapter and 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.090
 the amplifier in a standard socket 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.910
 220 volts 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.540
 that's all the amplifier is ready to 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.410
 to be used 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.640
 check 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.800
 as you can see here the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.930
 connection is rather weak until 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.580
 that I turn on the amplifier as soon as I 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.170
 the do it started to work and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.880
 the numbers from the base on the screen of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.550
 my mobile have started to increase 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.260
 wow i've reached the maximum it wants 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.850
 so say that the amplifier works 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.040
 and the connection in this room is 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.240
 become good the manufacturing company 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.250
 advises the purchase of the installation kit 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.960
 standard and given that 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.160
 specialists have established the length of the 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.750
 cable and settings 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.220
 the amplifier optimally 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.470
 my in place elsewhere this point as 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.540
 provided a 24-month warranty on the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.940
 produced during this period he 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.600
