00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
fighting them I kind of enjoy their

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.979 
fighting them I kind of enjoy their
services<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> set<00:00:45.239> boundaries<00:00:45.660> for

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
services and so I set boundaries for

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.500 
services and so I set boundaries for
them<00:00:46.200> first<00:00:46.890> off<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.430> don't<00:00:47.550> grow<00:00:47.940> any<00:00:48.180> flower

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
them first off I don't grow any flower

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290 
them first off I don't grow any flower
bulbs<00:00:49.110> directly<00:00:49.770> into<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> soil<00:00:50.610> I've<00:00:51.000> put

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
bulbs directly into the soil I've put

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.819 
bulbs directly into the soil I've put
them<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.600> raised<00:00:51.840> beds<00:00:52.129> with<00:00:53.129> some<00:00:53.550> cloth<00:00:53.910> that

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
them in raised beds with some cloth that

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.229 
them in raised beds with some cloth that
wrote<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.010> proof<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.489> can't<00:00:56.760> dig<00:00:56.969> through<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
wrote it proof they can't dig through it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
wrote it proof they can't dig through it
underneath<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.859> put<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
underneath it and then you put the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.889 
underneath it and then you put the
raised<00:00:59.340> bed<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.730> top<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.329> way<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
raised bed on top and that way the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
raised bed on top and that way the
rodents<00:01:01.320> won't<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.770> into<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:02.219> flower<00:01:02.460> bulb

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
rodents won't get into your flower bulb

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.780 
rodents won't get into your flower bulb
bulbs<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.870> dig<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.100> first<00:01:05.309> off<00:01:05.549> set

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
bulbs and dig them out so first off set

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.940 
bulbs and dig them out so first off set
boundaries<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.830> won't

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
boundaries and that way they won't

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.490 
boundaries and that way they won't
become<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> problem<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.000> area<00:01:09.500> secondly

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
become a problem in that area secondly

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.070 
become a problem in that area secondly
if<00:01:10.740> they're<00:01:10.979> messing<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:11.670> lawn<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.840> can

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
if they're messing in your lawn it can

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.190 
if they're messing in your lawn it can
become<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> problem<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.509> there's<00:01:15.509> only<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.869> few

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
become a problem and there's only a few

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
become a problem and there's only a few
things<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:17.130> naturally<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.909> help

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
things that you can do naturally to help

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570 
things that you can do naturally to help
what<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.750> found<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.590> soon<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.070> find<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
what I found is as soon as you find a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.410 
what I found is as soon as you find a
hole<00:01:20.850> put<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.110> hose<00:01:22.470> down<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.189> hole<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
hole put the hose down the hole and that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.710 
hole put the hose down the hole and that
way<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.439> water<00:01:25.770> will<00:01:26.549> flush<00:01:27.150> them<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.570> or

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
way the water will flush them out or

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.819 
way the water will flush them out or
drown<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.320> they'll<00:01:28.409> find<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.710> new

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
drown them out and they'll find a new

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.670 
drown them out and they'll find a new
area<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> go<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.600> another<00:01:30.600> trick<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.470> soon

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
area to go to another trick is as soon

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.200 
area to go to another trick is as soon
as<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> hole<00:01:32.460> put<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> bunch<00:01:33.090> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
as you have a hole put a bunch of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.090 
as you have a hole put a bunch of
cayenne<00:01:33.570> pepper<00:01:33.600> red<00:01:34.229> hot<00:01:34.380> chili<00:01:34.680> pepper

cinnamon<00:01:35.759> anything<00:01:36.509> into<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.780> hole<00:01:37.079> they

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
cinnamon anything into that hole they

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.469 
cinnamon anything into that hole they
hate<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> smell<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.280> they'll<00:01:38.729> move<00:01:38.909> on

hate the smell and they'll move on
so<00:01:39.930> another<00:01:40.259> easy<00:01:40.590> trick<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.159> I've<00:01:41.310> learned

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
so another easy trick that I've learned

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.600 
so another easy trick that I've learned
is<00:01:41.939> whenever<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.470> rodents<00:01:43.920> make<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> hole<00:01:44.430> in

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
is whenever the rodents make a hole in

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.060 
is whenever the rodents make a hole in
