not the similar to whether they added a
honeycomb<00:02:17.690> australian<00:02:18.690> like<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.970> can

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
honeycomb australian like so you can

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.800 
honeycomb australian like so you can
resize<00:02:21.420> them<00:02:22.099> long<00:02:23.099> press<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.400> relocate<00:02:24.269> its

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
resize them long press to relocate its

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.229 
resize them long press to relocate its
resizer<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:26.519> calendar<00:02:26.819> is<00:02:26.940> also<00:02:27.150> an

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
resizer so the calendar is also an

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.910 
resizer so the calendar is also an
interesting<00:02:27.330> your<00:02:27.690> application<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.860> a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
interesting your application is a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.580 
interesting your application is a
meeting<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:33.870> pinch<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.560> zoom

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
meeting here but you can pinch to zoom

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.589 
meeting here but you can pinch to zoom
so<00:02:35.280> essentially<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.849> affects<00:02:36.209> how<00:02:36.420> many

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
so essentially this affects how many

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.809 
so essentially this affects how many
