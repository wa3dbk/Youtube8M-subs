00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.440
 Welcome to our review 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.360
 from the kindle fire 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.540
 it is the one understandable 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.300
 Simple kindle fire and the review 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.289
 ticks synonymous times the construction of this 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.720
 Tablets show because Amazon has become 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.180
 a very own menu guide considered 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.369
 the main categories are here 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.929
 listed above and can be viewed by the user 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.430
 be dialed directly 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.460
 This is especially for beginners 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.380
 interesting on these big symbols 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.730
 we come here still there you can see 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.930
 namely the last used 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.469
 application program at amazon goes 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.690
 Of course, everything starts with the purchase 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.329
 You will find yourself under shopping 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.420
 different stores for books for 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.739
 games for videos and the like and 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.690
 there you can browse and digital 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.470
 content but also the normal 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.830
 Amazon store call the next 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.659
 category are games respectively 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.570
 an eps we are actually very 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.759
 similar category because games are there 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.729
 Ultimately nothing else but apps 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.520
 that are on the device as in others 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.280
 categories here amazon differs 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.289
 the kindle fire between cloud and device 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.960
 So what games do I have with mine 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.640
 Amazon account sometime bought and 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.130
 which games are on the device 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.299
 actually downloaded from the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.409
 autumn there is a kind of modified 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.940
 Android store 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.819
 that means in the kindle shop are very many 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.170
 the most important android apps available 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.170
 but not all 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.120
 you can already see the kindle has also from 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.630
 to the small break to insert again 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.330
 load 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.350
 The processor speed is now 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.110
 Of course not fast but if 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.940
 you switch between categories because it 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.970
 yes, we already heard we are still 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.810
 no books that's what you get from 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.010
 Kindle is off the normal 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.500
 kindle with electronic ink 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.530
 You can also see the difference 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.870
 is of course very bright and on 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.060
 sunlight would reflect it now and 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.989
 not too readable on one 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.000
 Faible for it sync the devices 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.060
 of course, so wonderful if I am now 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.880
 here for example books then buy 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.920
 they would be too 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.920
 available on my pc 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.570
 next there is music and videos 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.800
 here you can buy Amazon mp3 and just 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:57.000
 also his own collection you wonderful 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:00.710
 Listen and then there is actually one 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.760
 very nice who drove the whole thing here 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.060
 or of course it goes to the shop 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.080
 again to buy the price 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.920
 everything always wonderful 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.920
 synchronized 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.629
 the videos will be here too 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.510
 again exciting 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:21.840
 there is the kindle with the dena film 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.220
 Amazon's video library also links 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.220
 a very large selection of current ones 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.870
 filming offers 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.920
 now have to talk to a test 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.020
 Quantum comfort from James Bond 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.930
 downloaded and look at us 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.820
 like this movie now actually on 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.820
 a kindle fire looks like 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.170
 What we really liked is that 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.550
 the movie available immediately and that one 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.680
 also quite simply in the film 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.800
 can make time jump without that 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.510
 entire movie is downloaded 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.590
 you can see the device reacts to this 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.590
 jump very nice 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.069
 then of course the web is a whole 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.069
 normal application 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.139
 I demonstrated here how to 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.359
 on the volkswagen page a brochure 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.360
 highlighted because then directly the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.470
 next possibility shows the man 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.730
 namely read pdfs on the kindle 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:36.980
 I 'll take a look at the new VW Golf 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:39.740
 a catalog that all in 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.980
 real time, so to speak download will 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.990
 started and then it does not last 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.680
 especially long until the catalog 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.410
 downloaded is via the menu call 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.360
 From above you can see the golf catalog here 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.960
 call and you see that too 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:01.160
 previously done before and then 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.690
 we come to the pdf viewer where you too 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.750
 with a very good performance here 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.120
 can view pdfs 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.120
 the weakness of this simple kindle 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.700
 Of course, fire will be added here 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.810
 the detaildarstellung there is from my 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.070
 I do not see writing now 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.650
 very easy to read 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.090
 So you have to have such content on everyone 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.460
 enlarge the case 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.750
 to be around them they remember well 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.810
 to be able to read 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:31.340
 there would be the investment in 40 euros expensive 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:34.520
 kindle fire hd maybe a good one 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:39.260
 thing yes then there is also one 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.600
 fotoalbum also solved very nice 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.940
 There is a very nice arranged here 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.940
 to look at your own photographs 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.320
 we also leave this page again 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.480
 by this sometimes not enough 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.310
 is easy to call and now 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.560
 you can see this beautiful in this bar 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.870
 the apps and programs and functions 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.100
 which we last called everyone 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:09.370
 who are here now available again 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:12.700
 Last but not least, the advertising function 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:16.030
 the amazon ensures that the 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.770
 kindle the cheaper is here so it looks 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.440
 I keep the children back in 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.170
 and then here comes a commercial I 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.890
 Either screen to block the 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:29.639
 then I have the advertising easy 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:33.509
 hidden or me 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:37.289
 choose the other button and then with 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:41.099
 corresponding advertising content loaded yes so 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:43.830
 much to this kindle fire at 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:46.259
 Amazon is available from 159 euro and 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.419
 actually a very good price 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.680
 performance ratio provides with the device 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:53.189
 you can already start a lot 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.689
 one should not expect a device of 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:57.300
 to get top class 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:59.610
 but for the price certainly a good one 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.720
 to buy 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.440
 Last but not least a few technical 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.380
 data of kindle fire 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.190
 smock has a 7 inch display in the 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:14.310
 diagonal 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:17.710
 17 cm resolution is 1024 x 600 pixels 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:20.510
 It is an ips display with gorilla glass 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.930
 and at least that gets a lot 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:25.430
 stable impression because there is one more 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.960
 Optimization has its requirements 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:31.730
 so that you are actually made of glass 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.000
 to protect it from the higher 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:37.070
 weight is 400 grams annually and 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.910
 the model with eight gigabytes of memory 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:42.910
 and a term of about nine hours 

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.050
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.180
 and will help you in the selection 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.920
 the right tablet i would like 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.690
 happy if you 're on my channel again 

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.640
 stop by if I maybe once 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.500
 more tablets or smartphones 

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.520
 rate digital content 

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.520
 Many Thanks
