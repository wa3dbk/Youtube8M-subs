00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.409
 folder the journal now it is devoted to the problems of prostheses 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:07.160
 dental is expensive it is often talked about it is badly reimbursed by the 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.940
 social security the spa premiums and yet these words are more and more 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.799
 often manufactured at low prices abroad the French prosthetists have 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.280
 Moreover, it is difficult to resist this new competition between 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.490
 romania and france in search of slurry and jean-philippe and kate 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.360
 obviously 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.409
 the most painful is probably this project 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.929
 but just after the arrival the bill 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.860
 sir belhadj chose rather than pay his share 1 806 euros in France he has 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.840
 favorite go to morocco last year 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.840
 result we will already launch at least two more 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.340
 I think I have my bubble to reach the 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.700
 the broker for me 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.470
 he did not speak Arabic 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.470
 the ora will be armed with meetings the people the people 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 and why are these six little things so expensive 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.300
 sometimes dental technicians are accused, but how do you explain 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.690
 as more and more dentists ag buy their dentures to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.040
 abroad sometimes ten times cheaper than in France and at the same time 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.050
 prices do not drop 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.280
 here we are at the new book in the dental prosthesis laboratory fight 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.300
 classical 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.710
 artisanal like a lot 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.570
 three years ago dentist monday who were working with pierrick not drop 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.960
 decided to go to China to provide no judgment at least 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.270
 do not inform 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.730
 disappeared overnight 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.310
 since then three dismissals 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.280
 it's a different story 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 further details 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.170
 private channels 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.280
 effectively 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.180
 the competition seems unfair 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.150
 here we are in romania in what is known as a factory adores a hundred 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.360
 thousand are manufactured each year thanks to these sounds dental prosthetist 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.510
 who work so much rotation 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.480
 7 hours 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.480
 from 9 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.260
 specialized 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.680
 some books up to 40 years a day 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.150
 6% of all production by us or dentists a doc or split 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.880
 average two times cheaper than in France 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.290
 and the laboratory of the same name 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.650
 extremely strong 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.069
 250 million 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.989
 it allows to manufacture in 20 minutes 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.200
 the dental technician doctor your program 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.609
 currently on mission 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.169
 the laboratory or sick 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.399
 at the 80th 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.009
 the french dentist for sale 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.919
 accordingly, 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.779
 if the quality here while according to the laboratory manager no 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.139
 problem 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.289
 pathé and in case of defeat at laval stl laval and prefer heroes 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:31.779
 the second time a day late 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.229
 what she's talking about she had to redo 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:36.609
 it's scary 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.290
 back to France precisely 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.670
 thierry debès conducted his little investigation these two doctors for example 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.090
 are mostly used in Romania the difference in quality 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.130
 seems blatant even to the naked eye mandela become products that are very 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.039
 little music 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.629
 we can have united energy problems 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.659
 therefore not subject to medef guidelines and other shocking issues according to the 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.709
 dental prosthetist finally these prostheses are reimbursed by the state 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.729
 of sonora are quite different 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.969
 as if it's a promise that we are in France gold these prostheses imports do not 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:05.899
 generates 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:07.339
 nor is it looking for the

 annie taxes nick nuyens 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:13.389
 since last July a law requires dentists indicated on their quotes 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.459
 the source of the products they use 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.199
 many do not do it yet 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.519
 to the consumer
