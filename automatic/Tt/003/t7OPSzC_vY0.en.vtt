00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.469
 hello my name is gabriel lopez 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.490
 our team Nokia Lumia that is added 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.830
 to the family because I wanted to show them 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.220
 a little bit is the interface of our Nokia 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.470
 Lumia 920 with windows with 8 really 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.099
 we have added in addition to having a 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.310
 100% customization targeted towards 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.750
 person to be able to have a lot 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.189
 more practical and simple to our 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.530
 contacts and all the information 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.450
 related to social networks have 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.480
 also the possibility for the boys 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.280
 to have the child corner that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.860
 just running to the side 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.719
 I will have the possibility to access 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.430
 only to games or to 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.820
 applications that I want my 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.449
 guys this one use and do not wear 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.340
 directly to play with my cinemas not 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:00.850
 then to get out of here surely 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.920
 I put my password and thus have and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.880
 show them also a little about the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.620
 different caps the hubs are sections in 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.330
 which we are going to have for example in 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.280
 the cap of photography all the 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.990
 applications related to photographs 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.400
 one of the characteristics of the 920 is 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.680
 like here is the wireless charge 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.050
 that we do it through the part 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.850
 back we have a coil that allows 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.280
 Wireless charging we have a camera 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.260
 of very good sensitivity and with a 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.229
 optical stabilizer that allows me 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.520
 take pictures almost like a 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.550
 condition with light conditions 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.680
 really very challenging always 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.640
 we talk about what is a challenge the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.320
 Photography 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.770
 cellular in environments with low 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.210
 luminosity here for example an example 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.880
 without any kind of processes 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.590
 processing without the use of flash power 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.180
 have really natural photos and 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.180
 good quality on a cell phone 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.700
 also with the 99 20 what we are 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.740
 integrating are different applications of 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.070
 maps through our division that 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.380
 spears our applications in the case 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.850
 of the 920 it's nokia maps we're going to have 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.550
 also what to drive and not what to 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.410
 urban view where I will be able to 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.600
 visualize the directions I will be able to 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.690
 have also a traffic layer of 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.300
 public transport the satellite view and 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.140
 the map itself with the possibility of 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.519
 start browsing directly 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.530
 obviously i'm going to have to synchronize 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.900
 the compass and once you have it 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.430
 synchronized I will be able to go from a point 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.310
 to the ottt from one point to the other 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.590
 completely offline through a one 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.830
 voice guided gps we have also 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.780
 incorporated an application that is the one of 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.780
 urban view or txiki lens 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.310
 and what allows us to have reality 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.380
 increased 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.440
 just lifting our phone 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.160
 and pointing the camera we will be able to see 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.600
 or be able to receive information from 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.920
 various locations that are 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.920
 near where I place me
