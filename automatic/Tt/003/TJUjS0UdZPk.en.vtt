00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.019
 Hello, in this video I want 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.550
 compare two medium alco elite nipples 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.760
 level 1 tank t-34 85 and Sarov and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.019
 second tank type 58 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.439
 Chinese I want to offer you three 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:35.309
 Comparison Phase Starting with Phase One 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:40.590
 This is its information on the tanks here 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:45.960
 we look at the tank t-34 85 strength less 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:51.090
 than tank tank 8th damage and but not 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.020
 penetrability he is stronger about booking 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.590
 their hulls and towers are the same and 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:03.320
 tank survey 485 by 10 meters less than 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.129
 tank from 8 long distance ones are the same 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.290
 information carriers 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.950
 tank t-34 85 and wins it was the first 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.850
 now the second stage is finding the researcher 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.869
 we look at the tank t-34 85 famous guns 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.030
 This is the first 122 millimeters and 2 tapas 85 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.320
 millimeters 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.159
 First, of course, you can ride on 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.850
 120 millimeter well then of course you 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.170
 I advise you to put this slide 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:40.560
 a doer in this tank has a capacity of 600 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.570
 now look at type 58 tank 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.800
 Chinese 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:53.130
 he has only one such gun 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.640
 85 millimeters and the 520 engine already you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.619
 play 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.970
 tank t-34 85 and the last stage comparison 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.820
 I want to offer to watch videos 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.369
 with the participation of these tanks, look what is not 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.750
 how can they see themselves in battle 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.709
 damage and and so on all these videos 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.040
 You can look at the links that 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.840
 see on see on this video and then 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.420
 same of course you decide what 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.930
 more he like the tank for me 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.300
 these two tanks are the same day only 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.830
