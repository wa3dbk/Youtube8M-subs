the light bank you'll see there are
seven<00:00:51.589> bulbs<00:00:52.220> each<00:00:52.879> bulb<00:00:53.239> is<00:00:53.449> a<00:00:53.510> low<00:00:53.930> energy

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
seven bulbs each bulb is a low energy

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.920 
seven bulbs each bulb is a low energy
light<00:00:54.559> bulb<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:55.040> 50<00:00:55.519> watts<00:00:55.699> power<00:00:56.030> but<00:00:56.659> being

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
light bulb of 50 watts power but being

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.299 
light bulb of 50 watts power but being
low<00:00:57.110> energy<00:00:57.470> it<00:00:57.650> means<00:00:57.800> they<00:00:57.979> actually

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
low energy it means they actually

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.689 
low energy it means they actually
produce<00:00:58.540> 250<00:00:59.540> watts<00:00:59.900> of<00:01:00.110> light<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:01.370> all<00:01:01.489> in<00:01:01.610> all

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
produce 250 watts of light so all in all

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.520 
produce 250 watts of light so all in all
is<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.970> very<00:01:02.269> powerful<00:01:02.720> piece<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:02.900> equipment

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
out as a silhouette and if you expose

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.270 
out as a silhouette and if you expose
for<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.840> subject<00:01:54.259> your<00:01:54.619> window<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.009> gonna<00:01:55.099> go

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
for the subject your window is gonna go

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.370 
for the subject your window is gonna go
very<00:01:55.490> very<00:01:55.819> bright<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.359> look<00:01:56.630> pretty<00:01:56.869> awful

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
very very bright and look pretty awful

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.410 
very very bright and look pretty awful
so<00:01:58.039> that's<00:01:58.219> where<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.429> light<00:01:58.640> bank<00:01:58.939> comes

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
so that's where the light bank comes

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.279 
so that's where the light bank comes
into<00:01:59.750> its<00:01:59.899> own

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
into its own

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.169 
into its own
it's<00:02:00.740> an<00:02:00.890> incredibly<00:02:01.399> bright<00:02:01.700> source<00:02:02.030> of

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
it's an incredibly bright source of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.179 
it's an incredibly bright source of
light<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.629> you<00:02:02.929> can<00:02:02.959> use<00:02:03.319> it<00:02:03.349> to<00:02:03.649> balance<00:02:03.979> the

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
light and you can use it to balance the

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.429 
light and you can use it to balance the
window<00:02:04.610> light<00:02:04.849> with<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.689> light<00:02:05.719> bank<00:02:06.200> light

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
window light with the light bank light

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.339 
window light with the light bank light
and<00:02:06.709> get<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.310> best<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.759> both<00:02:07.969> worlds<00:02:08.349> the

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
and get the best of both worlds the

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.930 
and get the best of both worlds the
other<00:02:09.500> advantage<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.129> light<00:02:10.280> Bank<00:02:10.519> is<00:02:10.729> the

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
other advantage of the light Bank is the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.630 
other advantage of the light Bank is the
bulbs<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.959> bulbs<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.410> here<00:02:12.440> are<00:02:12.829> all<00:02:12.980> daylight

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
bulbs the bulbs in here are all daylight

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.759 
bulbs the bulbs in here are all daylight
balanced<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.930> white<00:02:15.200> balance<00:02:15.410> will<00:02:15.739> be

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
balanced so the white balance will be

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.000 
balanced so the white balance will be
perfectly<00:02:16.459> matched<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.209> window<00:02:17.510> light

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
perfectly matched to the window light

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.650 
perfectly matched to the window light
the<00:02:19.010> night<00:02:19.160> bank<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:19.640> vary<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.269> amount<00:02:20.359> of

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
the night bank can vary the amount of

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.300 
the night bank can vary the amount of
light<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.019> produces<00:02:21.109> because<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.129> turn

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
light it produces because you can turn

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.970 
light it produces because you can turn
on<00:02:22.609> off<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.180> bulbs<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:24.079> chances<00:02:24.650> are<00:02:24.709> for

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
on off the bulbs now the chances are for

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.069 
on off the bulbs now the chances are for
this<00:02:25.250> situation<00:02:25.489> I'm<00:02:26.060> going<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.480> want<00:02:26.629> all<00:02:26.810> the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
this situation I'm going to want all the

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.780 
this situation I'm going to want all the
light<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.620> light<00:02:27.890> bank<00:02:28.129> can<00:02:28.340> throw<00:02:28.579> out

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
light that this light bank can throw out

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.449 
light that this light bank can throw out
but<00:02:29.359> I<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.720> turn<00:02:29.989> on<00:02:30.019> either<00:02:30.530> individual

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
but I can turn on either individual

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.089 
but I can turn on either individual
bulbs<00:02:31.910> or<00:02:32.120> sets<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.660> bulbs<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.590> can<00:02:33.769> use<00:02:33.889> the

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
bulbs or sets of bulbs and I can use the

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.280 
bulbs or sets of bulbs and I can use the
histogram<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.940> metering<00:02:35.269> facility<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:36.139> my

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
histogram and metering facility of my

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.470 
histogram and metering facility of my
video<00:02:36.560> camera<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.430> make<00:02:37.639> sure<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.120> get<00:02:38.239> the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
video camera to make sure that I get the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.390 
video camera to make sure that I get the
light<00:02:38.660> perfectly<00:02:39.349> balanced<00:02:41.500> okay<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:42.560> lights

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
light perfectly balanced okay so lights

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.280 
light perfectly balanced okay so lights
are<00:02:43.549> in<00:02:43.609> position<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.359> cameras<00:02:44.780> rolling<00:02:44.989> and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
are in position the cameras rolling and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.379 
are in position the cameras rolling and
the<00:02:45.650> subjects<00:02:46.160> ready<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.849> we<00:02:47.030> can<00:02:47.150> now<00:02:47.359> take

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
the subjects ready so we can now take

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.150 
the subjects ready so we can now take
our<00:02:47.780> video<00:02:48.109> safe<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.889> knowledge<00:02:48.980> that

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
our video safe in the knowledge that

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.150 
our video safe in the knowledge that
it's<00:02:49.459> going<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:49.609> look<00:02:49.760> fantastic

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
it's going to look fantastic

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:07.960 
it's going to look fantastic
so<00:02:52.160> tell<00:02:52.370> me<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.849> won<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.120> lottery

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.310 

so<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.210> last<00:03:09.300> part<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.750> interview<00:03:10.080> we

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
so for the last part of the interview we

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.030 
so for the last part of the interview we
need<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.620> get<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.490> video<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.180> our<00:03:12.930> subject<00:03:13.680> and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
need to get a video of our subject and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.850 
need to get a video of our subject and
we<00:03:14.190> need<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.490> at<00:03:14.700> her<00:03:14.940> piano<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.620> means

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
we need to be at her piano so that means

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.160 
we need to be at her piano so that means
we're<00:03:17.040> using<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.520> ambient<00:03:18.180> room<00:03:18.450> light<00:03:18.690> now

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
we're using the ambient room light now

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.630 
we're using the ambient room light now
that's<00:03:19.350> all<00:03:19.530> well<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:19.770> good<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.250> it's<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:20.580> a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
that's all well and good but it's not a

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.090 
that's all well and good but it's not a
lot<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.970> ambient<00:03:21.360> light<00:03:21.390> around<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.290> it's<00:03:23.010> not

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
lot of ambient light around and it's not

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.760 
lot of ambient light around and it's not
particularly<00:03:23.550> nice<00:03:23.850> lighting<00:03:24.210> so<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.500> make

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
particularly nice lighting so to make

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.230 
particularly nice lighting so to make
our<00:03:25.950> subjects<00:03:26.460> stand<00:03:26.790> out<00:03:27.030> from<00:03:27.210> the

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
our subjects stand out from the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.480 
our subjects stand out from the
background<00:03:27.330> we've<00:03:28.200> got<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.500> light<00:03:28.680> Bank<00:03:28.950> but

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
background we've got the light Bank but

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.650 
background we've got the light Bank but
we<00:03:29.580> don't<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.000> use<00:03:30.120> all<00:03:30.240> of<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.480> lights

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
we don't have to use all of the lights

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.890 
we don't have to use all of the lights
in<00:03:30.930> fact<00:03:31.500> for<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.100> less<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:32.910> more<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.810> I'm

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
in fact for this less is more so I'm

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.260 
in fact for this less is more so I'm
only<00:03:34.110> going<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.410> use<00:03:34.470> two<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.370> bulbs<00:03:35.730> so

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
only going to use two of the bulbs so

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.330 
only going to use two of the bulbs so
I'm<00:03:36.330> just<00:03:36.420> gonna<00:03:36.510> switch<00:03:36.870> on<00:03:37.080> two<00:03:37.770> bulbs<00:03:37.980> like

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
I'm just gonna switch on two bulbs like

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.490 
I'm just gonna switch on two bulbs like
that<00:03:38.610> now<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.480> will<00:03:39.690> put<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:40.170> bit<00:03:40.320> more

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
that now that will put a little bit more

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.710 
that now that will put a little bit more
light<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.310> subject<00:03:41.550> and<00:03:42.060> it'll<00:03:42.600> even

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
light on to the subject and it'll even

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.210 
light on to the subject and it'll even
throw<00:03:43.050> a<00:03:43.080> little<00:03:43.500> bit<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.680> light<00:03:43.830> on<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
throw a little bit of light on the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.830 
throw a little bit of light on the
background<00:03:44.670> what<00:03:45.209> we<00:03:45.330> don't<00:03:45.450> want<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.750> the
