across<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.509> middle<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.740> pancaked

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
across the middle but because I pancaked

braid<00:01:25.950> back<00:01:26.159> here<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.540> taking<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
braid back here so I'm just taking a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.210 
braid back here so I'm just taking a
small<00:01:28.080> amount<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.590> hair<00:01:28.799> from<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> ponytail

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
small amount of hair from the ponytail

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
small amount of hair from the ponytail
it's<00:01:29.820> actually<00:01:30.210> part<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> tail<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it's actually part of the tail from the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.030 
it's actually part of the tail from the
braid<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:32.460> front<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.869> find<00:01:34.530> having<00:01:34.829> this

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
braid up front and I find having this

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.789 
braid up front and I find having this
section<00:01:35.460> wet<00:01:36.140> helps<00:01:37.140> us<00:01:37.259> stand<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> little

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
section wet helps us stand out a little

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.130 
section wet helps us stand out a little
bit<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> bun<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:39.990> you're

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
bit more from the bun but then you're

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.240 
bit more from the bun but then you're
just<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> make<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> regular

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
just going to make a regular

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
just going to make a regular
three-strand<00:01:41.549> braid<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.509> make<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> nice<00:01:43.140> and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
three-strand braid and make it nice and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170 
three-strand braid and make it nice and
tight<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.369> probably<00:01:44.640> could<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.090> even

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
tight and I probably could have even

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.420 
tight and I probably could have even
used<00:01:45.450> less<00:01:45.810> hair<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> wanted<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
used less hair for this but I wanted to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.460 
used less hair for this but I wanted to
make<00:01:47.640> sure<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.970> showed<00:01:48.210> through<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> don't

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
make sure it showed through so I don't

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.499 
make sure it showed through so I don't
break<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:49.770> very<00:01:50.009> far<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.090> take<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> little

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
break down very far I just take a little

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
break down very far I just take a little
flip<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.380> hold<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> from<00:01:52.890> unwinding

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
flip on there to hold it from unwinding

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
flip on there to hold it from unwinding
you<00:01:54.000> could<00:01:54.240> certainly<00:01:54.450> keep<00:01:54.780> braiding<00:01:55.020> but

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you could certainly keep braiding but

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
you could certainly keep braiding but
then<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:56.219> likely<00:01:56.460> show<00:01:56.909> through<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
then it will likely show through the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
then it will likely show through the
rest<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> bun<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.740> point<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.070> this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
rest of the bun and the point of this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.950 
rest of the bun and the point of this
was<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.149> one<00:02:00.180> stripe<00:02:00.780> across

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
was to just have that one stripe across

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.429 
was to just have that one stripe across
the<00:02:01.290> center<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.759> bun<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> rest

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the center of the bun so with the rest

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.770 
the center of the bun so with the rest
of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.649> hair<00:02:04.890> you're<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.299> making<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
of the hair you're going to be making a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.330 
of the hair you're going to be making a
regular<00:02:06.960> braid<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:08.280> wrap<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.789> into<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.179> bun

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
regular braid to wrap it up into a bun

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.089 
regular braid to wrap it up into a bun
I<00:02:10.540> missed<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.750> with<00:02:11.840> water<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.379> help<00:02:12.620> cut<00:02:12.890> down

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
I missed it with water to help cut down

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.400 
I missed it with water to help cut down
on<00:02:13.250> playa<00:02:13.519> ways<00:02:13.810> divide<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> hair<00:02:15.019> into<00:02:15.170> three

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
on playa ways divide the hair into three

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.100 
on playa ways divide the hair into three
sections<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:17.180> always<00:02:17.360> cross<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.900> right

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
sections and I always cross the right

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.020 
sections and I always cross the right
over<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.500> center<00:02:18.800> first<00:02:19.129> and<00:02:19.430> then<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.819> left

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
over the center first and then the left

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.339 
over the center first and then the left
over<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.690> then<00:02:20.810> you're<00:02:20.930> gonna<00:02:21.050> leave<00:02:21.319> that

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
over and then you're gonna leave that

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.670 
over and then you're gonna leave that
right<00:02:21.739> right<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.280> top<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.780> left<00:02:24.110> section

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
right right on top of that left section

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.770 
right right on top of that left section
and<00:02:25.430> then<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.730> cross<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.239> right<00:02:26.390> one<00:02:26.569> over

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
and then I cross the right one over

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.839 
and then I cross the right one over
again<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.739> left<00:02:27.950> one<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.519> then<00:02:28.670> at<00:02:28.760> this

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
again and the left one and then at this

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.970 
again and the left one and then at this
point<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.510> pull<00:02:29.750> my<00:02:29.870> clip<00:02:30.110> out<00:02:30.290> if<00:02:30.890> you

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
point I can pull my clip out if you

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.770 
point I can pull my clip out if you
don't<00:02:31.129> have<00:02:31.220> an<00:02:31.310> elastic<00:02:31.549> whatever<00:02:32.120> we<00:02:32.330> just<00:02:32.360> I

older daughter did this as she kind of

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.170 
older daughter did this as she kind of
pulled<00:03:18.079> on<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.290> edges<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.650> her<00:03:19.100> bun<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.880> almost

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
pulled on the edges of her bun to almost

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.539 
pulled on the edges of her bun to almost
make<00:03:20.329> it<00:03:20.450> flower<00:03:20.870> like<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.680> didn't<00:03:22.220> do<00:03:22.340> that

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
make it flower like I didn't do that

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.660 
make it flower like I didn't do that
with<00:03:22.760> hers<00:03:23.500> as<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.680> did<00:03:24.859> this<00:03:25.010> tutorial<00:03:25.519> just

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
with hers as I did this tutorial just

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.789 
with hers as I did this tutorial just
because<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.359> had<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.840> braid<00:03:27.049> things<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:27.530> tight

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
because I had to braid things so tight

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.789 
because I had to braid things so tight
and<00:03:28.040> wrap<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:28.400> tight<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:29.630> be<00:03:29.989> able<00:03:30.079> to<00:03:30.260> get

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
and wrap it so tight to be able to get

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.229
