00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.079
 More and more we see on TV the so-called traffic fights 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.140
 and sometimes loss of life or serious consequences. 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.840
 I started driving at age 19 today and I'm 46. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 Over the last 27 years I have done a lot of wrong. 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.000
 I already ran a lot, I already passed a red light, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.399
 I shut down other drivers, hit a few times, 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:21.479
 I already cursed. 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.880
 Some nonsense I did because I was very young and inexperienced, 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.970
 others because he was already very experienced and confident. I also did silly things because I was tired, 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.869
 or sleepy. Many because of being late and wanting to compensate 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.000
 the delay is fast, and that "second 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.080
 of foolishness "where it seems that the soul leaves the body for some 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.240
 seconds and we go through a red light without realizing it. 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 It is true that drinking, running and other actions are really dangerous 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.140
 and more and more we see that society is charging for punishment. 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.820
 But one thing is very important, of all the nonsense I've done, 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.920
 of all the times I closed someone or put someone in a tight 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.730
 ... I never did it for wanting! 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.810
 Neither I nor you and anyone else wake up in the morning and say, 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.090
 "Ah, today I'm going out to close a lot of people." 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.959
 Of the times it happened, just as I had no intention of closing or creating a 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.290
 accident, when they closed me and when they hit my 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.220
 motorcycle or car these people also did not for wanting. 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.620
 Of some that I remember: A mother taking her son to college did not 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.870
 I knew the street was double-handed ... I hit. Another tourist era saw the street that it needed 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.760
 go and entered ... closed me and I hit. Another was crossing a crossroads thinking that 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.340
 It gave time ... it did not work, and I hit. And a few others, 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.190
 and none of them left home with the intention of "beating Emilio". 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.819
 Even though I was not to blame, it would not be fair for me to fight ... 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.030
 that I shot myself ... not even if I was rude and impolite 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.700
 ... with a mother who was worried about her son 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.950
 ... with a lady who was lost in a different city 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.470
 ... with a gentleman who perhaps by age did not calculate well a distance 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.240
 When something bad happens to you in transit, 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.260
 Count to 10 ... but count yourself !!! 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.730
 As long as you count to 10, - remember that the other side may be a parent 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.390
 - someone tired of a long day's work 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.680
 - someone in a hurry going to help a sick family member 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.560
 - someone who is not to blame for our autoescolas being so bad 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.020
 - someone who, like you, is of good character 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.989
 and she may be too embarrassed to have caused you any trouble. 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.940
 But if by any chance whoever begets you is a drunk, a rich little boy, or a 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.989
 hustler ... ah ... yes yes ... also Count to 10 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.100
 As long as you count to 10, - remember that reacting can lead you to jail 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.940
 - remember that reacting can hurt some innocent 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.440
 - remember that reacting can make you never see your children or your 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.930
 dear ones - remember that you may never come back 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.930
 to home 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.210
 Counting up to 10 is to make those 10 seconds 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.280
 make an incident a story to tell your grandchildren 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.840
 and not a statistic on the police pages.
