00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:11.440
 Canon eos kiss x 3 minutes review part 2 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:16.780
 I will put the review part 1 in the explanation column below this one, but this time 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:21.520
 I think that I would like to introduce in the second part of the review 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:25.780
 I will tell you at the beginning of Etore, but I usually 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.390
 We use clean 5 d markless shop one 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:33.360
 It is unmarked 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.760
 Use users had the same until recently in two cars was using a guy that state 40 d 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.910
 I did it, though 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 It has become this either way but I was more generations old model to the roots now 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:51.270
 Surprise is a little Well you Nde there is only that the comparison is for it that I at mon, such 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.080
 Point of may be off 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:01.900
 Such a story Toka there is lucky to where the first which button first it is please forgive me if 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:07.200
 Well, maybe everyone who is looking at here 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.909
 I'll skip it because I already know it and I know it well 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.640
 Describe what I felt pure when I used it 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.240
 First 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.370
 That the name is a shame 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.120
 I said this in the previous review but I will say it again and again 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:30.159
 The name is Harenchi 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:34.430
 Because Sir like this barometer representing the parent density between that men and women 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.000
 It is a kiss by words I kiss 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.380
 ぇ video 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.240
 Yes, says the next little important thing I Well Hey this 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.690
 This file is called "raw file", which is the native format of photos 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.400
 It's 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:56.990
 The format seems to be expanded and is not compatible 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:02.840
 I think that maybe there is upward compatibility, but the developing software that I have been using until now 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:06.290
 I've stopped working at all, so I wonder what I'm going to do 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.380
 From this product's bundled cd-rom 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.800
 Home genuine development software 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.970
 Install dpp digital photo professional 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.710
 I Since the movement was Tan When the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:25.310
 Poor old and supportive like me 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:30.819
 Please be careful if you are using third party software 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.720
 Yes then as a point where this shame camera has changed compared to this 5 d etc 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.860
 Critical factor 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.760
 There is a pixel count 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.560
 5 d is 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:45.680
 While this 1280 cartoon seems to be this shameless camera has 800 million lines 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:52.220
 There is about 1 point 4 times 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.930
 And when you look at the actual size of the raw file, it is roughly 1.7 times 1.8 times 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.800
 It's like the size 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:03.250
 It's a little less than twice 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.240
 I think there are a lot of people who are pure rejoicing as the Mach prime goes up, but I am a little funny 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.980
 Not 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.030
 Don't say 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.299
 All media and hard disks for data storage 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.569
 You will consume at nearly twice the speed 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:21.940
 It This is not interesting it a little 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:25.300
 What I have never complained about before 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:31.060
 It's a strange example, but at a sushi restaurant 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:33.010
 There is a shop that gives a strange sushi with the size of the neta about three times larger than the size of the Shari 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.629
 is not it 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.739
 Well, some people may say that it feels a little extravagant 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.960
 But 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:46.720
 I think that I can not eat it with a single bite 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.850
 I can not help you 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:57.540
 It 's a place where you can wind a long file or a huge file 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:01.290
 In the path 5 d At the same anymore one big point video engine 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.260
 What was de-jitter pain in this infamous camera 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:10.340
 It became visibly 5 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:14.310
 The 3rd generation is new, and the 5th unit of Dick is the model before this 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.870
 Even the guy named x6i has already been unveiled 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:24.250
 Once you from everyone's but might you say I'll know kind of 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:28.449
 Purely happy for me and after all the picture engine will improve 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.750
 I'm glad that the iso sensitivity is getting better 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:35.440
 In other words, you can shoot even in dark places 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:40.990
 The maximum value of the 5 d regular sensitivity is 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.370
 In extended mode where iso 1600 was the limit I will go a little more 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.180
 Because the film gets dirty 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.949
 If it is niece, it is 1600 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:52.550
 If it is this shame camera, it will go to 12800 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:58.100
 The say 1600 and 12800 This is another 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:05.060
 The digit is incorrect but the wrong digit is wrong 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:07.430
 There are some Japanese people who use the term " orderly" or "orderly " quite normally, but the digit is 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.340
 It's ugly to say that it 's different 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:15.460
 Let's say spring 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:19.849
 It's like running 400km on a street with a speed limit of 40km. 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:24.679
 It's 400 kg. 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:27.979
 Be careful Well not run at 400 km it is also everyone's 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:34.129
 And in the case of me at work 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:37.550
 Quite often was the purely may be referred to take pictures in the hall long does a live house much 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:41.580
 I'm glad when the iso sensitivity goes up 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:47.039
 One more such sound iso 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:49.409
 It's very lazy settings that there is a setting to say vomiting 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:56.249
 But I'm glad this is 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:58.259
 Well I guess I'm not bothered by nature but I do this automatically 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.050
 What does it really say 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:04.900
 You're right 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:09.880
 For example, it's strange, but I'm in Komeda Pass 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:12.980
 If you order hot coffee, you will have a morning set at the same price 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.860
 It's like you were told 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:26.610
 It's a pleasure 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:35.780
 No polo color with no elements to boooo Oh nook 7 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:35.780
 Nde was the flow sony pou dou dou
