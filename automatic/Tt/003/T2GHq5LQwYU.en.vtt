an AC charger that comes included with
the<00:01:02.320> bag<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.550> let's<00:01:03.730> so<00:01:03.970> how<00:01:04.149> would<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.570> charge

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
the bag so let's so how would you charge

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.960 
the bag so let's so how would you charge
your<00:01:05.019> device<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.439> this<00:01:05.590> battery<00:01:05.950> is<00:01:06.040> full<00:01:06.310> then

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
your device so this battery is full then

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.090 
your device so this battery is full then
you<00:01:07.000> can<00:01:07.420> pretty<00:01:07.630> much<00:01:07.720> do<00:01:08.170> charge<00:01:08.650> whatever

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
you can pretty much do charge whatever

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.460 
you can pretty much do charge whatever
you<00:01:09.340> want<00:01:09.520> whenever<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:09.880> want

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you want whenever you want

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.940 
you want whenever you want
with<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:14.380> each<00:01:14.500> array<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:15.250> comes<00:01:15.550> with<00:01:15.820> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
with the with each array it comes with a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.290 
with the with each array it comes with a
set<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:17.979> laptop<00:01:18.430> adapters<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:18.909> look<00:01:19.180> like

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
set of laptop adapters that look like

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.660 
set of laptop adapters that look like
this<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:20.200> we<00:01:20.380> have<00:01:20.500> set<00:01:20.740> for<00:01:20.979> pretty<00:01:21.130> much<00:01:21.220> any

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
this and we have set for pretty much any

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.120 
this and we have set for pretty much any
modern<00:01:22.240> laptop<00:01:22.720> we<00:01:23.080> have<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.260> up<00:01:23.380> for<00:01:23.530> tips<00:01:23.979> or

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
modern laptop we have it up for tips or

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.430 
modern laptop we have it up for tips or
most<00:01:24.340> many<00:01:24.580> any<00:01:24.820> modern<00:01:25.150> laptop<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:26.170> what<00:01:26.320> you

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
most many any modern laptop and what you

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.490 
most many any modern laptop and what you
would<00:01:26.530> do<00:01:26.770> is<00:01:27.750> connect<00:01:28.750> this<00:01:28.870> to<00:01:29.049> the<00:01:29.140> battery

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
would do is connect this to the battery

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.070 
would do is connect this to the battery
set<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.130> voltage<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.760> right<00:01:30.909> voltage<00:01:31.690> for

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
set the voltage to the right voltage for

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.780 
set the voltage to the right voltage for
your<00:01:32.260> battery<00:01:32.620> as<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.100> can<00:01:33.220> see<00:01:33.400> here<00:01:33.670> we

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
your battery as you can see here we

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.109 
your battery as you can see here we
outputs<00:01:34.390> 12<00:01:34.780> 16<00:01:35.229> or<00:01:35.350> 19<00:01:35.680> volts<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.070> then<00:01:36.850> turn

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
outputs 12 16 or 19 volts and then turn

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.609 
outputs 12 16 or 19 volts and then turn
on<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.420> battery<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.750> connect<00:01:38.110> it<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.260> your

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
on the battery and connect it to your

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.060 
on the battery and connect it to your
laptop<00:01:38.890> that's<00:01:39.700> pretty<00:01:39.970> much<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:41.890> have

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
laptop that's pretty much it if you have

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.450 
laptop that's pretty much it if you have
a<00:01:42.100> MacBook<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.750> know<00:01:43.869> many<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.350> do<00:01:44.560> there

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
a MacBook you know many of you do there

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.350 
a MacBook you know many of you do there
is<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:46.390> solution<00:01:46.990> for<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.500> there's<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.820> we<00:01:49.270> have
