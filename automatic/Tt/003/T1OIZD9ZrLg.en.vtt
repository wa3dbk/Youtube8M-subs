00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 hello friends today I'll show you how 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.070
 make a lemon chicken for it 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.590
 we will use a chicken of a kilo and a half 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.200
 that the 700 plus or minus 2 lemons 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.210
 let's do it with an onion bed 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.770
 and potatoes a scallion would be enough 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:39.710
 minced and about 34 onions split in 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.309
 baker in sheets and finally 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.470
 salt and pepper or paprika first thing 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.989
 let's do is put a bed of 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.989
 onion in our baking sheet 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.880
 we spread the onion well 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.180
 and we will throw up a trickle of 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.180
 oil 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.340
 on top we will put the potatoes 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.090
 we will add salt 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.610
 and now what we are going to do is 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.430
 salt the chicken 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.540
 For this we will take salt together 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.540
 the salt chicken 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.479
 inside we also have to put him 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.479
 salt in the chicken 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.119
 now we would pepper or paprika 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.530
 I in this case to use paprika and 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.530
 you know I like paprika a lot 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.320
 and do not forget to take it for 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.320
 inside 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.960
 Now we are going to take a little 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.940
 chicken oil 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.940
 we throw him and we start 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.900
 let's give a little shine to those of 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.900
 chicken 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.460
 last what we would have left would be 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.770
 squeeze the two lemons well then because 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.380
 what we would have left would be to take the juice 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.840
 of the lemon inside the chicken a little bit and 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.500
 around 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.990
 of the tray 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.410
 never on top of the chicken because I already 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.350
 we have put the oil 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.420
 then we would throw it like that and good 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.370
 our chicken would be ready to 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.430
 put it in the oven preheat the oven 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.610
 at 200 degrees 10-15 minutes and we put it 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.590
 in principle half an hour happened the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.920
 first half hour we will go around 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.920
 chicken 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.550
 and we'll put it back to 200 again 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.530
 degrees another half hour elapsed the 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.340
 another half hour we will give the 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.340
 back to the chicken 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.299
 and we will add around a small glass of water 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.280
 we will return to the oven 20 minutes 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.770
 more good once the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.750
 last 20 minutes we will take out the chicken and 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.960
 the last thing left to do would be 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.270
 click here I have separated the 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.140
 cons thighs and breasts with 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.450
 wings and we have put the little bed of potatoes and 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.980
 over the chicken if you liked a 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.150
 like and see you in the following recipe 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.150
 a little treat
