00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
an i5 bigger yeah that's up i'm the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.729 
an i5 bigger yeah that's up i'm the
first<00:00:40.829> thing<00:00:41.160> i<00:00:41.430> will<00:00:42.000> show<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.840> make

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
first thing i will show you how to make

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.950 
first thing i will show you how to make
it<00:00:43.800> better<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:46.309> obviously<00:00:47.510> made<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.539> picture

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it better is obviously made the picture

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.150 
it better is obviously made the picture
smaller<00:00:50.719> let's<00:00:51.719> make<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.899> smaller<00:00:52.320> I'm<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
smaller let's make it smaller I'm the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.319 
smaller let's make it smaller I'm the
second<00:00:53.550> thing<00:00:54.079> preview<00:00:55.079> put<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:55.980> auto

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
second thing preview put it on auto

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.220 
second thing preview put it on auto
instead<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.360> having<00:00:57.570> best<00:00:58.020> quality<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.739> I

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
instead of having best quality for I

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.360 
instead of having best quality for I
know<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.320> makes<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.800> good<00:01:01.980> quality

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
know it makes it really good quality

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.200 
know it makes it really good quality
better<00:01:04.460> see<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:07.049> still<00:01:07.380> lags<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
better see out but is it still lags a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.730 
better see out but is it still lags a
lot<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.990> will<00:01:10.049> compute<00:01:10.530> by<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
lot of it and I will compute by a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.609 
lot of it and I will compute by a
goodbye<00:01:10.950> book<00:01:12.229> yeah<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.159> put<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:15.470> or<00:01:16.470> is
