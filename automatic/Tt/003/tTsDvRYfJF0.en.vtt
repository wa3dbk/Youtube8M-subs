baseboard prior to painting this could

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.950 
baseboard prior to painting this could
be<00:00:47.430> done<00:00:47.670> by<00:00:47.850> hand<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.570> piece<00:00:48.780> of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
be done by hand with a piece of

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.350 
be done by hand with a piece of
sandpaper<00:00:49.309> any<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> same<00:00:50.820> papers<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.270> we

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
sandpaper any of the same papers that we

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.779 
sandpaper any of the same papers that we
were<00:00:51.420> using<00:00:51.690> earlier<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:53.039> could<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.399> done<00:00:53.579> by

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
were using earlier this could be done by

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.340 
were using earlier this could be done by
hand<00:00:54.920> doing<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.100> small<00:00:56.430> piece<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.350> doing

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
hand doing a small piece like this doing

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.689 
hand doing a small piece like this doing
it<00:00:58.440> by<00:00:58.559> hand<00:00:58.739> probably<00:00:58.980> wouldn't<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.370> too<00:00:59.550> bad

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it by hand probably wouldn't be too bad

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.869 
it by hand probably wouldn't be too bad
but<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.300> were<00:01:00.449> installing<00:01:01.140> baseboard<00:01:01.879> in

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
but if you were installing baseboard in

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
but if you were installing baseboard in
an<00:01:03.090> entire<00:01:03.449> house<00:01:03.750> where<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.170> had<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> large

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
an entire house where you had a large

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.920 
an entire house where you had a large
area<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.339> sand<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:06.210> where<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> portable

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
area to sand that's where the portable

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
area to sand that's where the portable
electric<00:01:07.290> sander<00:01:07.320> comes<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.369> makes<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
electric sander comes in it makes it

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.320 
electric sander comes in it makes it
much<00:01:09.180> easier<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.930> less<00:01:10.560> time-consuming<00:01:11.330> so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
much easier and less time-consuming so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.640 
much easier and less time-consuming so
let's<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.630> ahead<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.049> sand<00:01:13.350> down<00:01:13.500> our

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
let's go ahead and sand down our

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
let's go ahead and sand down our
baseboard<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> little<00:01:14.310> bit<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.520> demonstrate

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
baseboard a little bit and demonstrate

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.640 
baseboard a little bit and demonstrate
how<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.240> used<00:01:16.070> we<00:01:17.070> plugged<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.409> we<00:01:19.409> tied

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
how it's used we plugged it in we tied

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.840 
how it's used we plugged it in we tied
our<00:01:19.680> cord<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.280> sure<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> doesn't<00:01:20.700> come

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
our cord make sure it doesn't come

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420 
our cord make sure it doesn't come
undone<00:01:21.270> while<00:01:21.479> we're<00:01:21.600> using<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.770> it's

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
undone while we're using it and it's

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.570 
undone while we're using it and it's
quite<00:01:23.549> simply<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.150> place<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.960> device<00:01:25.920> down

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
quite simply just place the device down

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.249 
quite simply just place the device down
onto<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> wood<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> want<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.720> sand<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
onto the wood that you want to sand and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.380 
onto the wood that you want to sand and
while<00:01:28.500> you're<00:01:28.619> holding<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.040> firmly<00:01:29.310> turn<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
while you're holding it firmly turn it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.450 
while you're holding it firmly turn it
on<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.259> we're<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.770> move<00:01:31.950> back<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
on and we're going to move back and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.789 
on and we're going to move back and
forth<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> consistent<00:01:33.570> pattern<00:01:33.750> until<00:01:34.680> we

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
forth in a consistent pattern until we

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.340 
forth in a consistent pattern until we
get<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> desired<00:01:35.509> smoothness<00:01:36.509> or<00:01:36.720> texture<00:01:37.200> of

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
get the desired smoothness or texture of

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.300 
get the desired smoothness or texture of
the<00:01:37.470> wood<00:01:37.650> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the wood that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.070 
the wood that
here<00:01:39.310> we<00:01:39.400> go

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.859 

ah

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.060 

feels<00:01:53.869> pretty<00:01:54.079> good<00:01:54.290> I<00:01:54.350> didn't<00:01:54.740> need<00:01:54.799> to<00:01:54.860> go

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
feels pretty good I didn't need to go

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.179 
feels pretty good I didn't need to go
too<00:01:55.130> far<00:01:55.579> I<00:01:56.329> just<00:01:56.780> had<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:56.960> light<00:01:57.229> rough<00:01:57.770> texture

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
too far I just had a light rough texture

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.010 
too far I just had a light rough texture
on<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.399> surface<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:58.939> just<00:01:59.149> needed<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.570> sand<00:01:59.840> it

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
on the surface I just needed to sand it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.880 
on the surface I just needed to sand it
lightly<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:01.250> took<00:02:01.460> care<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.759> that
