this<00:00:02.610> here<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.210> my<00:00:04.020> first<00:00:04.230> attempt<00:00:04.799> at<00:00:04.890> forging

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
this here is my first attempt at forging

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.709 
this here is my first attempt at forging
a<00:00:05.339> katana<00:00:05.370> blade<00:00:06.770> didn't<00:00:07.770> go<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:07.890> well<00:00:08.719> it's

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
a katana blade didn't go so well it's

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.959 
a katana blade didn't go so well it's
made<00:00:09.929> out<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.139> 1075<00:00:10.950> steal<00:00:12.530> it<00:00:13.530> was<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.580> started

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
made out of 1075 steal it was it started

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.340 
made out of 1075 steal it was it started
off<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.269> piece<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.509> steel<00:00:15.780> looking<00:00:16.139> like

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
off as a piece of steel looking like

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.750 
off as a piece of steel looking like
that<00:00:17.960> George<00:00:18.960> didn't<00:00:19.410> beat<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.830> shape

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.720 

round<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.910> more<00:00:24.090> or<00:00:24.210> less<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.570> shape<00:00:25.550> tried<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
round it more or less to shape tried to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.300 
round it more or less to shape tried to
heat<00:00:26.970> treating<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.800> that<00:00:28.800> fire<00:00:29.010> pit<00:00:29.279> right

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
heat treating it in that fire pit right

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.450 
heat treating it in that fire pit right
there<00:00:30.800> couldn't<00:00:31.800> quite<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.189> up<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
there couldn't quite get it up to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.750 
there couldn't quite get it up to
temperature<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.110> only<00:00:34.710> parts<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> edge<00:00:35.520> or

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
temperature so only parts of the edge or

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240 
temperature so only parts of the edge or
properly<00:00:36.120> hardened<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.829> some<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> parts

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
properly hardened and some of the parts

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.590 
properly hardened and some of the parts
that<00:00:38.340> did<00:00:38.640> harden<00:00:40.520> you<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.760> closely<00:00:42.059> here

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that did harden you see closely here

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.190 
that did harden you see closely here
cracked<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.450> probably<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
cracked so this is probably going to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840 
cracked so this is probably going to
break<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.649> test<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.190> hopefully<00:00:47.430> without

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
break when I test it hopefully without

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.490 
break when I test it hopefully without
making<00:00:48.360> me<00:00:48.450> end<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.200> guy<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.469> the

Home Shopping Network video but I'm

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.160 
Home Shopping Network video but I'm
still<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> try<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.600> out<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
still going to try it out and see if I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.600 
still going to try it out and see if I
can<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> few<00:00:55.649> good<00:00:55.710> wax<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.489> at

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
can get a few good wax out of it at

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.110 
can get a few good wax out of it at
least<00:01:01.250> using<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> belt<00:01:02.489> grinder<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
least using a belt grinder on the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.039 
least using a belt grinder on the
surface<00:01:03.570> didn't<00:01:04.409> work<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.739> well<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.869> guess<00:01:06.869> I'm

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
surface didn't work so well I guess I'm

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.550 
surface didn't work so well I guess I'm
going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> by<00:01:07.979> hand<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:10.320> hard

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
going to have to do it by hand the hard

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.450 
going to have to do it by hand the hard
way<00:01:12.049> when<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.140> was<00:01:13.290> looking<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.680> info<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.130> saw

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
way when I was looking up info I saw

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.109 
way when I was looking up info I saw
some<00:01:14.670> information<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:17.460> quenching<00:01:17.939> is

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
some information that the quenching is

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.820 
some information that the quenching is
what<00:01:18.330> gives<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.780> blade<00:01:18.990> its<00:01:19.170> curve<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
what gives the blade its curve and I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.130 
what gives the blade its curve and I
thought<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.400> hokey<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> forged<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
thought that was hokey so I forged it to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.719 
thought that was hokey so I forged it to
the<00:01:22.259> same<00:01:22.470> shape<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.920> original<00:01:23.460> blade

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the same shape as the original blade

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.830 
the same shape as the original blade
here<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:26.130> new<00:01:26.310> blade<00:01:26.840> has

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
here and now you see the new blade has

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.380 
here and now you see the new blade has
almost<00:01:28.770> exactly<00:01:29.310> twice<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.909> curve<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
almost exactly twice the curve of the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:47.770 
almost exactly twice the curve of the
original<00:01:38.390> alright<00:01:39.390> let's<00:01:39.630> test<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.899 

okay<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:48.979> double<00:01:49.369> layer<00:01:49.549> thick

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
okay this is double layer thick

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.660 
okay this is double layer thick
cardboard<00:01:50.890> which<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.040> heavier<00:01:52.340> than<00:01:52.400> the

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
cardboard which is heavier than the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.870 
cardboard which is heavier than the
normal<00:01:52.940> target<00:01:53.299> I<00:01:53.360> cut<00:01:53.570> with

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:06.969 

see<00:01:56.540> how<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:56.719> works

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.410 

not<00:02:07.979> much<00:02:08.190> worse<00:02:08.429> than<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.700> previous<00:02:09.179> blade

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
not much worse than the previous blade

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.070 
not much worse than the previous blade
did

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
did

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.970 
did
that's<00:02:11.530> already<00:02:11.830> bent<00:02:13.530> not<00:02:14.530> unlike<00:02:14.830> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
that's already bent not unlike the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:28.470 
that's already bent not unlike the
previous<00:02:15.160> blade

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.850 

sharpen<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.600> up<00:02:29.720> strength<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.320> out<00:02:30.470> let's<00:02:30.680> give

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
sharpen it up strength it out let's give

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:47.650 
sharpen it up strength it out let's give
it<00:02:30.920> another<00:02:31.160> try

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.070 

broke<00:02:48.320> in<00:02:48.500> two<00:02:48.710> places<00:02:49.010> at<00:02:49.250> once<00:02:52.870> more<00:02:53.870> or<00:02:53.960> less

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
broke in two places at once more or less

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.450 
broke in two places at once more or less
what<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.320> was<00:02:54.440> expecting<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:58.070> there's<00:02:58.310> still

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
what I was expecting that there's still

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:09.850 
what I was expecting that there's still
enough<00:02:58.700> left<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:58.970> make<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.150> short<00:02:59.390> sword<00:03:08.860> just

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
enough left to make a short sword just

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.760 
enough left to make a short sword just
for<00:03:10.070> fun<00:03:10.780> let's<00:03:11.780> take<00:03:12.020> what's<00:03:12.260> left<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.620> this

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
for fun let's take what's left of this

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:22.840 
for fun let's take what's left of this
thing<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.160> chop<00:03:13.370> on<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.580> two-by-four<00:03:19.960> first

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
thing and chop on a two-by-four first

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:43.130 
thing and chop on a two-by-four first
now<00:03:23.850> we're<00:03:24.090> ready

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.020 

that's<00:03:43.710> after<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.160> blades<00:03:44.400> doing<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.790> little

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
that's after the blades doing a little

00:03:45.030 --> 00:04:01.380 
that's after the blades doing a little
better

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:15.379 

on<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.510> bit<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.780> an<00:04:01.870> edge

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:26.790 

this

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:58.040 

so<00:04:27.800> fast<00:04:28.069> though
