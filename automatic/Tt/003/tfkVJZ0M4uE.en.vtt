00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.640
 Show Printable Version 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.099
 You guys are the furb party rock and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.619
 Minor souls are 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 who are they people they 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.070
 personalities of fab 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.870
 so every little bug that comes to a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.149
 personality then this one from that one 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.460
 personality we play badly 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.770
 educated, bad tempered 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.890
 so he does not do much he just has 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.730
 a mole so it looks different too 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.899
 so he has he make some noises right 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 strangers but she does not do anything in a 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.640
 rope and linen it moment if you give 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.229
 food like this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:13.619
 it also eats in applications 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 he receives the food too but you 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.049

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.380
 what does he speak 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.610
 but they do not change personality 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.490
 because each one 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 in this collection represents a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.020
