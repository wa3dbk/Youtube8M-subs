00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.229 
question we have is what would you like
to<00:00:41.230> see<00:00:41.410> from<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.770> u.s.<00:00:42.100> moving<00:00:42.489> forward<00:00:42.850> it's

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
to see from the u.s. moving forward it's

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.459 
to see from the u.s. moving forward it's
a<00:00:43.300> little<00:00:43.539> closer<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:44.110> home<00:00:44.230> with<00:00:44.350> this

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
a little closer to home with this

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.380 
a little closer to home with this
question<00:00:44.739> la<00:00:45.640> do<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:45.760> want<00:00:45.879> to<00:00:45.940> start<00:00:46.180> us<00:00:46.239> off

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
question la do you want to start us off

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.510 
question la do you want to start us off
I<00:00:46.690> don't<00:00:47.350> know<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:47.559> think<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.920> midfield<00:00:48.309> has

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
I don't know I think the midfield has

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.979 
I don't know I think the midfield has
kind<00:00:48.789> of<00:00:48.910> I<00:00:49.120> think<00:00:49.329> they<00:00:49.420> need<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.660> go<00:00:49.809> through

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
kind of I think they need to go through

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.240 
kind of I think they need to go through
the<00:00:50.050> midfield<00:00:50.230> more<00:00:50.770> and<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:50.920> think<00:00:50.980> they<00:00:51.160> need

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
the midfield more and I think they need

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.670 
the midfield more and I think they need
to<00:00:51.370> play<00:00:51.579> and<00:00:51.699> combine<00:00:52.059> I<00:00:52.090> think<00:00:52.510> it's

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
to play and combine I think it's

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.360 
to play and combine I think it's
predictable<00:00:53.680> that<00:00:53.770> they<00:00:53.890> get<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.129> ball<00:00:54.340> on

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
predictable that they get the ball on

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.599 
predictable that they get the ball on
some<00:00:54.820> certain<00:00:55.270> players<00:00:55.449> shoot<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.710> so<00:00:57.460> that's

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
some certain players shoot and so that's

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.430 
some certain players shoot and so that's
kind<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:57.910> their<00:00:58.210> technical<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:59.289> they're

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
kind of their technical and they're

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.080 
kind of their technical and they're
smart<00:00:59.769> enough<00:00:59.980> tactically<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:00.550> break<00:01:00.879> down<00:01:01.030> I

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
smart enough tactically to break down I

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.270 
smart enough tactically to break down I
think<00:01:01.239> any<00:01:01.539> team<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:02.199> think<00:01:02.829> they<00:01:02.980> all<00:01:03.100> gotta

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
think any team and think they all gotta

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.490 
think any team and think they all gotta
find<00:01:03.579> again<00:01:03.940> what<00:01:04.449> they're<00:01:04.629> fighting<00:01:05.019> for<00:01:05.050> and

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
find again what they're fighting for and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.230 
find again what they're fighting for and
find<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.100> fight<00:01:06.310> together<00:01:06.550> absolutely

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
find it to fight together absolutely

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.740 
find it to fight together absolutely
what<00:01:07.900> do<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.050> think<00:01:08.230> Laurie<00:01:09.240> yeah<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.270> mean<00:01:10.630> I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
what do you think Laurie yeah I mean I

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.719 
what do you think Laurie yeah I mean I
think<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.560> little<00:01:11.770> bit<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.189> tricky

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
think this is a little bit of a tricky

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.850 
think this is a little bit of a tricky
question<00:01:12.759> because<00:01:13.330> but<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.439> four<00:01:14.680> of<00:01:14.710> us

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
question because but the four of us

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.410 
question because but the four of us
could<00:01:15.100> agree<00:01:15.189> we'd<00:01:15.700> probably<00:01:16.060> would<00:01:16.240> like<00:01:16.360> to

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
could agree we'd probably would like to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.899 
could agree we'd probably would like to
see<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.990> little<00:01:17.439> bit<00:01:17.560> more<00:01:17.650> interplay<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.460> think

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
see a little bit more interplay I think

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.160 
see a little bit more interplay I think
a<00:01:19.060> buildup

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
a buildup

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.940 
a buildup
kind<00:01:21.009> of<00:01:21.329> small<00:01:22.329> angles<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:23.350> little<00:01:23.650> bit<00:01:23.770> more

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
kind of small angles a little bit more

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.830 
kind of small angles a little bit more
creativeness<00:01:24.490> Becca<00:01:25.450> what<00:01:25.540> do<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:25.689> think

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
creativeness Becca what do you think

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.359 
creativeness Becca what do you think
about<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.439> know<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.590> think<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:27.159> they

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
about this you know I think that they

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.030 
about this you know I think that they
rely<00:01:28.030> on<00:01:28.060> certain<00:01:28.650> things<00:01:29.650> that<00:01:29.799> they

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
rely on certain things that they

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.770 
rely on certain things that they
shouldn't<00:01:30.250> they<00:01:30.880> shouldn't<00:01:31.150> have<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.509> rely<00:01:31.630> on

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
shouldn't they shouldn't have to rely on

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.569 
shouldn't they shouldn't have to rely on
because<00:01:32.170> they're<00:01:32.320> good<00:01:32.470> enough<00:01:32.560> players<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.369> a

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
because they're good enough players in a

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.840 
because they're good enough players in a
well<00:01:34.540> supported<00:01:34.750> system<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.860> with<00:01:36.490> plenty<00:01:36.759> of

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
well supported system and with plenty of

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.399 
well supported system and with plenty of
time<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.030> train<00:01:37.299> together<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.720> train<00:01:38.200> in

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
time to train together and train in

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.270 
time to train together and train in
leagues<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:41.290> have<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.770> consistent

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
leagues and just have that consistent

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.120 
leagues and just have that consistent
consistent<00:01:43.030> professional<00:01:43.659> level<00:01:44.049> so<00:01:44.079> I<00:01:44.590> think

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
consistent professional level so I think

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.999 
consistent professional level so I think
part<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.759> it<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:45.970> just<00:01:46.000> their<00:01:46.360> style<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.290> if

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
part of it is just their style and if

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.459 
part of it is just their style and if
they're<00:01:48.670> gonna<00:01:48.790> win<00:01:49.180> playing<00:01:49.659> their<00:01:49.990> style<00:01:50.320> I

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
they're gonna win playing their style I

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:51.810 
they're gonna win playing their style I
think<00:01:50.680> they<00:01:50.770> just<00:01:50.799> need<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.219> be<00:01:51.340> more<00:01:51.520> decisive

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
think they just need to be more decisive

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.760 
think they just need to be more decisive
but<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.270> agree<00:01:52.570> what<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.930> agree<00:01:53.350> with<00:01:53.500> what<00:01:53.680> all

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
but I agree what I agree with what all

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.350 
but I agree what I agree with what all
you<00:01:54.100> said<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.579> I<00:01:54.640> think<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.210> thing

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
you said and I think that the thing

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.090 
you said and I think that the thing
about<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.630> u.s.<00:01:55.840> team<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.500> they<00:01:56.710> show<00:01:56.950> up

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
about the u.s. team is that they show up

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.310 
about the u.s. team is that they show up
in<00:01:57.219> big<00:01:57.369> moments<00:01:57.820> so<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.270> think<00:01:58.390> definitely

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
in big moments so I think definitely

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.560 
in big moments so I think definitely
their<00:01:59.829> best<00:02:00.369> is<00:02:00.579> yet<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.820> come<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.539> think

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
their best is yet to come and I think

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.270 
their best is yet to come and I think
that<00:02:01.899> that<00:02:02.049> will<00:02:02.170> be<00:02:02.289> brought<00:02:02.500> out<00:02:02.530> as<00:02:02.890> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
that that will be brought out as the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.550 
that that will be brought out as the
stakes<00:02:03.969> get<00:02:04.180> higher<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.570> pressures<00:02:04.990> on<00:02:05.170> and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
stakes get higher the pressures on and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.380 
stakes get higher the pressures on and
the<00:02:05.770> competition<00:02:06.280> gets<00:02:06.460> more<00:02:06.670> difficult<00:02:06.789> so

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
the competition gets more difficult so

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.029 
the competition gets more difficult so
next<00:02:07.750> which<00:02:08.320> this<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.800> an<00:02:08.890> interesting

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
have these crew

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.990 
have these crew
I<00:04:31.590> mean<00:04:31.889> this<00:04:32.010> is<00:04:32.130> some<00:04:32.280> have<00:04:32.610> never<00:04:32.790> even<00:04:32.910> been

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
I mean this is some have never even been

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.490 
I mean this is some have never even been
out<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.180> their<00:04:33.300> country<00:04:33.750> some<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.080> them<00:04:34.200> all

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
out of their country some of them all

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.980 
out of their country some of them all
have<00:04:34.740> jobs<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.490> this<00:04:36.240> is<00:04:36.419> a<00:04:36.450> stage<00:04:36.780> that

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
and that's that's the importance of all

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.970 
and that's that's the importance of all
of<00:04:42.570> this<00:04:42.780> right<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.110> mean<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.410> lot<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.740> women
