the disc to format to partition and then

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.300 
the disc to format to partition and then
format<00:01:51.420> until<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> two<00:01:52.140> separate<00:01:52.680> drives<00:01:53.009> as

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
format until the two separate drives as

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.580 
format until the two separate drives as
you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.570> loading<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.439> the
