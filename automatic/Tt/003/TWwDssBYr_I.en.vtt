team really wants to push into the other

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.500 
team really wants to push into the other
here<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:11.700> all<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> best<00:01:12.299> position

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
here they all want the best position

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
here they all want the best position
last<00:01:13.260> round<00:01:13.500> complexity<00:01:14.189> red<00:01:14.369> went<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.729> ahead

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
last round complexity red went on ahead

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.749 
last round complexity red went on ahead
and<00:01:15.030> did<00:01:15.360> run<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.530> EG<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.250> lost<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and did run in to EG and they lost that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.219 
and did run in to EG and they lost that
round<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.119> they're<00:01:18.240> probably<00:01:18.479> hesitating<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
round so they're probably hesitating a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.090 
round so they're probably hesitating a
bit<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.100> fact<00:01:21.680> not<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
bit here because of that fact not not a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.010 
bit here because of that fact not not a
huge<00:01:23.369> factor<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.880> stealth<00:01:24.150> buffs<00:01:24.420> either<00:01:24.659> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
huge factor the stealth buffs either so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.899 
huge factor the stealth buffs either so
who<00:01:25.619> knows<00:01:25.799> maybe<00:01:26.100> these<00:01:26.340> teams<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.729> sit

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
who knows maybe these teams will sit

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.310 
who knows maybe these teams will sit
here<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> next<00:01:27.330> 15<00:01:27.840> minutes<00:01:28.049> hopefully

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
here for the next 15 minutes hopefully

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960 
here for the next 15 minutes hopefully
not<00:01:28.650> though<00:01:28.860> hopefully<00:01:29.040> hopefully<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
not though hopefully hopefully the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.609 
not though hopefully hopefully the
accident<00:01:30.360> gets<00:01:30.509> moving<00:01:30.720> along<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.079> shortly

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
accident gets moving along here shortly

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.010 
accident gets moving along here shortly
it's<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> situation<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
it's this kind of situation you what you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.530 
it's this kind of situation you what you
basically<00:01:34.200> want<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> other<00:01:34.860> team<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.280> push

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
basically want the other team to push

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.480 
basically want the other team to push
because<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.930> gives<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.380> setup<00:01:38.220> that

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
because that gives you the setup that
