especially since the operating system is
what<00:02:59.380> really<00:02:59.560> can<00:02:59.769> make<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.130> biggest<00:03:00.550> and

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
what really can make the biggest and

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.820 
what really can make the biggest and
