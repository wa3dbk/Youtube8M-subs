00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
command so basic mounts that are only

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.670 
command so basic mounts that are only
useful<00:00:19.970> in<00:00:20.359> servers<00:00:20.869> that<00:00:21.080> you<00:00:21.199> can<00:00:21.350> use<00:00:21.500> in

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
servers and that is also the reason that

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
will be able to access the server from

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.740 
will be able to access the server from
the<00:01:29.330> IP<00:01:29.569> so<00:01:30.110> there's<00:01:30.890> that<00:01:31.179> then<00:01:32.179> there's<00:01:32.450> ban

the IP so there's that then there's ban
list<00:01:33.020> which<00:01:33.319> bases<00:01:33.770> its<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.310> place<00:01:34.550> a<00:01:34.819> displace

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:35.599 
list which bases its to place a displace

then there's debug which will start a

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.710 
then there's debug which will start a
debug<00:01:43.099> which<00:01:43.399> i<00:01:43.610> guess<00:01:43.819> is<00:01:43.849> handy<00:01:44.479> if<00:01:44.509> you're

the players in the server so that one's
pretty<00:02:28.550> useful<00:02:28.940> then<00:02:29.330> there<00:02:29.480> /<00:02:29.750> me<00:02:30.050> select<00:02:30.860> me

something there so so this one does
actually<00:02:41.300> work<00:02:41.480> here<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.170> then<00:02:42.320> just<00:02:42.860> type

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
actually work here and then just type

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
and then that binds you can make fake

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.850 
and then that binds you can make fake
that<00:02:48.350> messages<00:02:48.890> like<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:51.500> doesn't

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
that messages like this and it doesn't

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.340 
that messages like this and it doesn't
look<00:02:52.010> quite<00:02:52.190> like<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.760> looks<00:02:53.660> when<00:02:54.020> you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
look quite like it looks when you

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.020 
look quite like it looks when you
actually<00:02:54.620> die<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:55.520> pretty<00:02:55.700> believable

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
actually die but it's pretty believable

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.600 
actually die but it's pretty believable
pretty<00:02:56.840> funny<00:02:57.020> then<00:02:57.710> there's<00:02:57.920> less<00:02:58.160> public

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
pretty funny then there's less public

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.030 
pretty funny then there's less public
space<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:59.120> publisher<00:02:59.750> your<00:03:00.080> server<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.710> open

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
space to publisher your server to open

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.830 
space to publisher your server to open
it<00:03:01.130> i<00:03:01.250> think<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.700> all<00:03:01.820> that<00:03:02.000> stuff<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.270> yeah<00:03:02.630> oh

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
it i think and all that stuff so yeah oh

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.050 
it i think and all that stuff so yeah oh
by<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.680> way<00:03:03.770> these<00:03:04.010> commands<00:03:04.490> I<00:03:04.670> think<00:03:04.940> can

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
by the way these commands I think can

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.750 
by the way these commands I think can
all<00:03:05.330> be<00:03:05.510> executed<00:03:06.230> from<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.590> server<00:03:06.950> log<00:03:07.220> also

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
all be executed from the server log also

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.910 
all be executed from the server log also
and<00:03:08.000> then<00:03:08.840> they're<00:03:08.990> sable<00:03:09.500> which<00:03:09.710> will

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
and then they're sable which will

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.790 
and then they're sable which will
basically<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.400> save<00:03:10.700> your<00:03:10.910> world<00:03:11.500> save<00:03:12.500> off

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
basically just save your world save off

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.730 
basically just save your world save off
which<00:03:13.160> will<00:03:13.400> turn<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.790> off<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.600> autosave<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
which will turn it off the autosave it

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.150 
which will turn it off the autosave it
has<00:03:16.340> standard<00:03:16.910> lead<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.390> just<00:03:18.350> sometimes<00:03:18.770> save

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
has standard lead to just sometimes save

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.700 
has standard lead to just sometimes save
your<00:03:19.370> world<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:19.820> this<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.690> safe<00:03:20.930> on<00:03:21.170> so<00:03:21.590> that

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
your world and this is safe on so that

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.410 
your world and this is safe on so that
when<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.220> save<00:03:22.490> of<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.850> can<00:03:23.030> turn<00:03:23.210> it

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
when you you save of you can turn it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.320 
when you you save of you can turn it
back<00:03:23.600> on<00:03:24.100> then<00:03:25.100> they're<00:03:25.310> set<00:03:25.580> idle<00:03:26.060> timeout

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
back on then they're set idle timeout

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.060 
back on then they're set idle timeout
and<00:03:26.780> didn't<00:03:27.170> well<00:03:27.920> /<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.900> idle<00:03:29.900> timeout<00:03:30.230> well<00:03:30.800> I

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
and didn't well / it idle timeout well I

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.460 
and didn't well / it idle timeout well I
don't<00:03:31.820> actually<00:03:32.150> think<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.810> completion

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
don't actually think that completion

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.070 
don't actually think that completion
doesn't<00:03:33.920> actually<00:03:34.070> work<00:03:34.400> with<00:03:34.640> these<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.750> set

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
doesn't actually work with these so set

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.290 
doesn't actually work with these so set
idle<00:03:36.440> time<00:03:36.650> at<00:03:36.830> an<00:03:36.980> end<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.310> time<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.060> want

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
idle time at an end the time you want

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.860 
idle time at an end the time you want
because<00:03:38.480> then<00:03:39.170> when<00:03:39.610> people<00:03:40.610> are<00:03:40.910> AFK<00:03:41.510> they

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
because then when people are AFK they

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.440 
because then when people are AFK they
don't<00:03:42.080> just<00:03:42.350> stay<00:03:42.920> AFK<00:03:43.430> for<00:03:43.460> really<00:03:44.060> long<00:03:44.210> and

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
don't just stay AFK for really long and

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.210
