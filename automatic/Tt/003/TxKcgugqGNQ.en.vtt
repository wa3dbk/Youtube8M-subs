00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.070 

as<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:08.680> forward-thinking<00:00:09.130> builder<00:00:09.849> I<00:00:10.030> chose<00:00:10.839> to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
as a forward-thinking builder I chose to

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.350 
as a forward-thinking builder I chose to
revive<00:00:11.410> maple<00:00:11.980> because<00:00:12.639> maple<00:00:13.179> is<00:00:13.330> a

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
revive maple because maple is a

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.419 
revive maple because maple is a
first-world<00:00:13.839> wood<00:00:14.200> it's<00:00:14.830> something<00:00:15.249> that's

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
first-world wood it's something that's

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.430 
first-world wood it's something that's
coming<00:00:15.820> from<00:00:16.240> here<00:00:16.510> in<00:00:16.600> the<00:00:16.690> domestic<00:00:16.960> United

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
coming from here in the domestic United

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.220 
coming from here in the domestic United
States<00:00:17.860> in<00:00:18.240> temperate<00:00:19.240> forests<00:00:19.750> all<00:00:19.900> over<00:00:20.140> the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
States in temperate forests all over the

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.670 
States in temperate forests all over the
world

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
world

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.250 
world
well<00:00:21.250> those<00:00:21.460> forests<00:00:22.119> are<00:00:22.240> really<00:00:23.109> well

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
well those forests are really well

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.980 
well those forests are really well
managed<00:00:23.769> they're<00:00:24.609> sustainably<00:00:25.269> harvested

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
managed they're sustainably harvested

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.499 
managed they're sustainably harvested
that's<00:00:26.859> a<00:00:27.039> resource<00:00:27.460> that<00:00:27.759> I<00:00:27.789> can<00:00:28.000> count<00:00:28.240> on

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
that's a resource that I can count on

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.950 
that's a resource that I can count on
with<00:00:29.320> that<00:00:29.500> knowledge<00:00:30.039> I<00:00:30.580> decided<00:00:31.509> to<00:00:31.689> go<00:00:31.810> back

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
with that knowledge I decided to go back

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.960 
with that knowledge I decided to go back
to<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.259> workbench<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:32.980> design<00:00:33.340> some<00:00:33.580> guitars

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
to the workbench and design some guitars

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.340 
to the workbench and design some guitars
that<00:00:34.810> featured<00:00:35.380> maple<00:00:35.890> in<00:00:36.070> their<00:00:36.640> best<00:00:36.880> forms

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that featured maple in their best forms

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.530 
that featured maple in their best forms
so<00:00:38.350> as<00:00:38.470> I<00:00:38.620> approach<00:00:38.740> this<00:00:39.310> I<00:00:39.520> thought<00:00:40.030> well

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
so as I approach this I thought well

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.540 
so as I approach this I thought well
I'll<00:00:41.020> take<00:00:41.290> everything<00:00:41.590> I<00:00:41.830> love<00:00:42.040> about<00:00:42.070> maple

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
I'll take everything I love about maple

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.520 
I'll take everything I love about maple
and<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.300> things<00:00:43.540> I<00:00:43.690> know<00:00:43.750> from<00:00:44.140> building

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
and the things I know from building

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.610 
and the things I know from building
archtop<00:00:44.920> guitars<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.760> mandolins<00:00:46.240> in<00:00:46.660> these

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
archtop guitars and mandolins in these

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.310 
archtop guitars and mandolins in these
other<00:00:47.800> instruments<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.760> apply<00:00:49.660> that<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:50.020> the

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
other instruments and apply that to the

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.500 
other instruments and apply that to the
flat<00:00:50.590> top<00:00:50.830> guitar<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.910> bring<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.360> it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
flat top guitar to bring to it

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.470 
flat top guitar to bring to it
everything<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.290> I<00:00:53.740> could<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.610> make<00:00:55.240> that<00:00:55.450> a

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
everything that I could to make that a

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.810 
everything that I could to make that a
gratifying<00:00:56.140> playing<00:00:56.770> experience<00:00:57.340> and

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
gratifying playing experience and

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.550 
gratifying playing experience and
somebody<00:00:58.120> picks<00:00:58.360> up<00:00:58.480> this<00:00:58.660> industry

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.720 

I<00:01:04.489> ended<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.580> altering<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.330> back<00:01:06.770> bracing<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
I ended up altering the back bracing to

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.180 
I ended up altering the back bracing to
make<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.060> move<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.810> work<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.350> lot<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.800> of

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
make it move and work a lot like that of

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.040 
make it move and work a lot like that of
an<00:01:11.280> arch<00:01:11.460> top<00:01:11.730> guitar<00:01:12.150> you're<00:01:12.720> getting<00:01:12.990> a

an arch top guitar you're getting a

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.500 
an arch top guitar you're getting a
tremendous<00:01:13.260> low-end<00:01:14.040> warmth<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.610> power<00:01:14.820> from

tremendous low-end warmth and power from
this<00:01:15.690> new<00:01:15.900> design<00:01:16.260> I<00:01:17.090> started<00:01:18.090> borrowing

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
