00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
ways such that we could create a variety

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.419 
ways such that we could create a variety
of<00:01:17.689> mission<00:01:18.229> throughout<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.219> challenge

luck<00:01:26.829> initially<00:01:27.829> it<00:01:28.039> was<00:01:28.219> just<00:01:28.490> this<00:01:28.670> this

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
luck initially it was just this this

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.510 
luck initially it was just this this
idea<00:01:29.539> where<00:01:29.869> you'd<00:01:30.380> have<00:01:30.590> these<00:01:30.770> these<00:01:31.249> like

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
idea where you'd have these these like

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.330 
idea where you'd have these these like
slot<00:01:31.999> reels<00:01:32.329> that<00:01:32.689> would<00:01:33.319> as<00:01:33.619> they<00:01:33.950> would<00:01:34.100> come

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
slot reels that would as they would come

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.370 
slot reels that would as they would come
up<00:01:34.549> they<00:01:34.819> would<00:01:34.939> randomly<00:01:35.210> pick<00:01:35.810> different

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
up they would randomly pick different

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.010 
up they would randomly pick different
modifiers<00:01:37.189> who<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.909> would<00:01:38.060> fight<00:01:38.479> who<00:01:38.869> you

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
modifiers who you would fight who you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.039 
modifiers who you would fight who you
would<00:01:39.200> be<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.969> these<00:01:40.969> modifiers<00:01:41.600> were<00:01:41.869> just

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
would be and these modifiers were just

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.050 
would be and these modifiers were just
exposed<00:01:42.590> elements<00:01:43.219> like<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.579> flip<00:01:43.909> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
exposed elements like you flip the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.889 
exposed elements like you flip the
screen<00:01:44.420> upside<00:01:44.659> down<00:01:45.369> double<00:01:46.369> damage<00:01:46.969> and

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
screen upside down double damage and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.660 
screen upside down double damage and
what<00:01:48.020> happened<00:01:48.439> is<00:01:48.590> when<00:01:48.889> we<00:01:49.039> implemented

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
what happened is when we implemented

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.520 
what happened is when we implemented
this<00:01:49.819> people<00:01:50.329> were<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.749> excited<00:01:51.109> about<00:01:51.350> it

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
this people were so excited about it

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.129 
this people were so excited about it
that<00:01:51.889> it<00:01:52.280> actually<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:53.179> ended<00:01:53.600> up<00:01:53.689> spawning

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
that it actually it ended up spawning

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.679 
that it actually it ended up spawning
off<00:01:54.409> its<00:01:54.649> own<00:01:54.770> separate<00:01:55.700> mode<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.450> game

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
off its own separate mode in the game

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.989 
off its own separate mode in the game
sometimes<00:01:57.289> it<00:01:57.469> was<00:01:57.590> fun<00:01:57.770> stuff<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.369> know<00:01:58.789> some
