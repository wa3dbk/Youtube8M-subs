calm the material i'm using for this
knife<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.000> an<00:00:15.269> old<00:00:15.420> file<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:16.020> begin<00:00:16.830> by<00:00:16.890> heating

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
knife is an old file I begin by heating

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.300 
knife is an old file I begin by heating
it<00:00:17.430> up<00:00:17.580> until<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.420> non-magnetic<00:00:19.189> then<00:00:20.189> I

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it up until it is non-magnetic then I

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.250 
it up until it is non-magnetic then I
let<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.640> cool<00:00:20.820> slowly<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.810> room<00:00:21.840> temperature

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
let it cool slowly to room temperature

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.410 
let it cool slowly to room temperature
again<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.310> process<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.939> called<00:00:24.000> annealing

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
again this process is called annealing

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.689 
again this process is called annealing
and<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.140> must<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.380> done<00:00:25.590> before<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.160> file<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and it must be done before the file is

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.560 
and it must be done before the file is
soft<00:00:26.970> enough<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.480> worked<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:29.420> next<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
soft enough to be worked with next I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.389 
soft enough to be worked with next I
check<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.199> straightness<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.890> correct<00:00:32.250> any

to<00:01:00.960> make<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> paper<00:01:01.410> template<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.280> i<00:01:02.430> can

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
to make a paper template so that i can

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
to make a paper template so that i can
refer<00:01:02.850> back<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.750> size<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.439> shape

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
refer back to it for size and shape

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:23.510 
refer back to it for size and shape
comparison<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.000> optional<00:01:06.180> though

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399 

I<00:01:23.579> use<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> grinder<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.899> remove<00:01:25.170> material

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
quickly and cut out the rough shape but

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.260 
quickly and cut out the rough shape but
I<00:01:28.229> come<00:01:28.439> back<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.799> file<00:01:29.009> by<00:01:29.219> hand<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.939> achieve

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
after marking the line for the shoulders

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.940 
after marking the line for the shoulders
I<00:01:53.759> use<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.569> Jaws<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.170> Vice<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.679> guide

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
I use the Jaws of the Vice as a guide

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.279 
I use the Jaws of the Vice as a guide
for<00:01:55.979> straightness<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.850> file<00:01:57.569> to<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> market

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
for straightness and file to the market

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:06.230 
for straightness and file to the market
I<00:02:03.170> use<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> triangular<00:02:04.979> file<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.759> make<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> small

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
I use a triangular file to make a small

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.749

the<00:02:30.000> knife<00:02:30.180> begins<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.049> that's<00:02:31.440> where<00:02:31.680> we

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
the knife begins and that's where we

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.710 
the knife begins and that's where we
will<00:02:32.040> begin<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.459> cut<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.730> bevel<00:02:35.510> when<00:02:36.510> cutting

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
will begin to cut the bevel when cutting

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.660 
will begin to cut the bevel when cutting
the<00:02:36.840> bevels<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.470> knife<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.890> hold<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> file

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
the bevels of the knife I hold the file

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.850 
the bevels of the knife I hold the file
of<00:02:38.849> about<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> 10<00:02:39.450> degree<00:02:39.599> angle<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.140> draw<00:02:40.829> it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
of about a 10 degree angle and draw it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.550 
of about a 10 degree angle and draw it
from<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.310> toil<00:02:41.700> down<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.420> tip<00:02:42.660> there

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
from the toil down to the tip there

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.960 
from the toil down to the tip there
isn't<00:02:43.829> anything<00:02:44.010> very<00:02:44.250> complicated<00:02:44.850> about

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
isn't anything very complicated about

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:58.300 
isn't anything very complicated about
this<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.540> takes<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.959> long<00:02:46.109> time

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.500 

you<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.460> see<00:02:59.640> at<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.850> point<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.330> the

the<00:03:47.990> next<00:03:48.290> step<00:03:48.590> is<00:03:48.800> heat<00:03:49.220> treating<00:03:50.440> heat<00:03:51.440> and

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
the next step is heat treating heat and

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.530 
the next step is heat treating heat and
cool<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.860> blade<00:03:52.220> as<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.910> did<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.240> anneal<00:03:53.510> it

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
cool the blade as you did to anneal it

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.830 
cool the blade as you did to anneal it
at<00:03:53.870> least<00:03:54.020> three<00:03:54.410> times<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:56.450> relieves

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
at least three times this relieves

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.130 
at least three times this relieves

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
before tempering the knife I need to

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.390 
before tempering the knife I need to
make<00:04:28.940> sure<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.420> hardened<00:04:29.870> correctly<00:04:30.400> and

make sure that it hardened correctly and

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.500 
make sure that it hardened correctly and
to<00:04:31.430> do<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.210> use<00:04:32.390> a<00:04:32.420> file<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.110> lightly<00:04:34.510> draw

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
to do that I use a file and lightly draw
