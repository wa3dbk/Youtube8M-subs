00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
okay so basically what we're doing is

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.330 
okay so basically what we're doing is
every<00:02:27.260> time<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:27.440> change<00:02:27.590> strings<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.250> a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
every time we change strings it's a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.190 
every time we change strings it's a
sweet<00:02:28.519> picking<00:02:28.819> motion<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.690> picking<00:02:30.049> does

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
sweet picking motion so you picking does

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.860 
sweet picking motion so you picking does
not<00:02:30.380> mean<00:02:30.590> down<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.459> then<00:02:31.760> down<00:02:32.209> again<00:02:32.690> it

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
not mean down and then down again it

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.819 
not mean down and then down again it
means<00:02:33.250> down<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.900> all<00:02:36.109> strings<00:02:36.410> under<00:02:36.650> that

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
means down and all strings under that

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.310 
means down and all strings under that
squeak<00:02:37.100> are<00:02:37.370> hit<00:02:40.060> make<00:02:41.060> sense<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:41.959> that's<00:02:42.170> what

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
squeak are hit make sense so that's what

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.930

but demo but this the last notice of
occurring<00:03:23.730> too<00:03:23.970> quickly<00:03:24.240> so<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.500> to

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
occurring too quickly so you have to

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.100 
occurring too quickly so you have to

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
slow it down a little bit so that we

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.610 
slow it down a little bit so that we
