sniper hgx that hex file that's the code

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.609 
sniper hgx that hex file that's the code
that<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:25.020> flashed<00:01:25.259> into<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
that will actually be flashed into the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.320 
that will actually be flashed into the
controller<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.250> that's<00:01:26.850> pretty<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.180> all

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
controller and that's pretty much all

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
controller and that's pretty much all
you<00:01:27.390> need<00:01:27.540> winrar<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:28.650> we've<00:01:28.799> got

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you need winrar for so now we've got

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.039 
you need winrar for so now we've got
those<00:01:29.130> files<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.640> our<00:01:29.759> desktop<00:01:30.150> let's<00:01:30.869> go

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
those files on our desktop let's go

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.730 
those files on our desktop let's go
ahead<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.259> launch<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.799> hid<00:01:32.220> bootloader<00:01:33.740> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
ahead and launch the hid bootloader and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980 
ahead and launch the hid bootloader and
this<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.369> hid<00:01:36.030> bootloader<00:01:36.509> software

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
this is what hid bootloader software

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530 
this is what hid bootloader software
looks<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.070> right<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.610> says<00:01:38.880> device

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
looks like and right now it says device

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.240 
looks like and right now it says device
not<00:01:39.840> detected<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.530> let's<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.799> ahead<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.009> grab

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
not detected so let's go ahead and grab

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.330 
not detected so let's go ahead and grab
our<00:01:41.430> controller

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.550 

and<00:01:46.969> to<00:01:47.090> put<00:01:47.299> our<00:01:47.390> controller<00:01:47.780> into<00:01:48.109> flashing

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
and to put our controller into flashing

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.050 
and to put our controller into flashing
mode<00:01:48.710> just<00:01:49.219> hold<00:01:49.429> down<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.759> sync<00:01:50.000> button

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
mode just hold down the sync button

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.620 
mode just hold down the sync button
while<00:01:50.450> powering<00:01:50.750> up<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.020> controller<00:01:52.630> grab

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
while powering up the controller grab

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.999 
while powering up the controller grab
the<00:01:53.750> programming<00:01:54.229> cable<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:54.710> i<00:01:54.740> went<00:01:54.950> ahead

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
the programming cable and i went ahead
