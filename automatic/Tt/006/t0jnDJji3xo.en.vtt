00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.720
 friends, hello to you, totally games 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.309
 today we do analytics on dysord 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.160
 2 people asked me to make such a video 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.740
 I dug a lot of interesting information on 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.590
 about this game and I can already with you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.570
 share start with gameplay 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.650
 because the first part was 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 It focused on stealth stealth mode 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.300
 gameplay that's why rest assured that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.550
 the second part will also do 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.309
 emphasis on the remaining component 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.829
 so in this regard, everything will be fine 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.770
 same as in the first part but only 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.820
 get new gadgets yes there maybe 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.160
 some other more improved crossbow 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.469
 maybe also some kind of abilities 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.379
 up, such as those that were in the first part 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.859
 the graphics itself will be in principle too what 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.870
 it's the same in the first part of her little 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.900
 redo ie she will be a little bit 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.979
 improved so the game will go absolutely 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.470
 all because the first part she was in 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.990
 graphics plan well, not exactly progressive 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.490
 I think the unreal engine was used there 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.000
 engine 3 version is very old 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.520
 engine 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.360
 so of course I could be wrong about 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.880
 engine but i just don't remember honestly 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.619
 some engine was here you will 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.799
 sure the second part will also be on that 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.820
 the same engine so i think the game is yours 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.100
 will go without any problems 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:48.140
 also when buying a licensed copy 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:50.430
 Dysonord 2 Buyers Will Get Beta 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.090
 access to doom 4 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.290
 This was already with wolfenstein for not warrant 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.310
 but unfortunately those who bought the game 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.979
 for some reason she could not 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.920
 activate doom 4 code I donâ€™t know what 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.340
 it is connected and it is generally not known when 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.600
 there will be a beta test at all 4 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.959
 but they give you no less 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:20.570
 access to the beta test also in dizord 2 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:23.940
 there will be multiplayer for me personally 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.980
 unexpectedly because dizonord 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.160
 and multiplayer is not compatible at all 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.640
 things i think i should play like this 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:37.020
 focus only on the single player campaign 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.880
 and do not need any multi player there if 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.820
 will be co-op this will be much 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.510
 better because it became a friend 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.640
 it will be quite interesting well in this 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.790
 it will be generally just a bomb probably 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.940
 the game will play a lot of people and if 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.220
 multiplayer screw this means that 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.430
 some attention when developing will go 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.320
 it is the multiplayer component and 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.290
 this way may suffer single 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.360
 campaigns are of course a strange move 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.430
 maybe they will cancel 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.549
 will cancel multiplayer which bioshock 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.640
 Infinite but we'll see what will happen next and 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.760
 the actions of the game by the way will occur 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.920
 to 0 and here, but there will still be a new location 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.459
 this is the whole empire 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.640
 the game world is called no te vi 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.769
 this is a fight a completely new location there 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.540
 there will be a lot of interesting things she will 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.610
 big here it is little information on this 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.010
 about so far available on the Internet 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.550
 so it is already necessary to wait for some 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.190
 trailers of some new information 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.810
 we play for his new hero 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:55.050
 name is Emily Koldun 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.010
 yes this is a new hero maybe even 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.550
 the story we will meet our cargo our 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.730
 cargo 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.170
 well and of course we will probably meet 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.170
 the plot of some already familiar characters 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:14.260
 Here is all the information that has been 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.959
 available on the internet I collected it 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.610
 from all sources 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.550
 here by the way bison 2 will have 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:30.440
 additional name is called game 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:34.910
 darkness of these that's called the game 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:39.370
 just like the whole imperial whole 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:43.430
 imperial city let's say that asset here these 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:46.550
 the fault is translated here therefore 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.120
 the moment is all that is known to repeat 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.990
 that maybe the game will not repeat them 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.520
 fate 1 maybe it will be either better 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.500
 either worse, that is, anyway 1 out of 2 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.750
 but we hope that this game will be very 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.090
 interesting and I think developers know 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.789
 what do the more the first part was 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.539
 just gorgeous in terms of gameplay in terms of 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:14.509
 plot and indeed in terms of the atmosphere therefore 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:18.410
 friends I say goodbye to this 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:21.919
 it was analytics dyordord 2 darkness 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.729
 of these and meet in the following videos 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.729
 bye everyone
