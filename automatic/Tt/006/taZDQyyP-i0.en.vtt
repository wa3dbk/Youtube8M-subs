00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 m 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.660
 this week we present the nissan 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.460
 micra car that makes a return to 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:26.660
 canada they have been marketed 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:28.400
 from 1984 to 1992 the nissan micra 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.510
 present as family to 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.210
 5-door hatchback 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.590
 just like his big sister the versa we have 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.239
 by the way eliminated the sedan 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.650
 so we have two models going 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.010
 compete directly in the same 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.140
 niche 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.909
 by cons the microphone a little bit more 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.870
 small more affordable we wipe them 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.519
 out 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.080
 we appreciate its dynamic front 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.000
 the back and a little bit more 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.640
 controversial but we appreciate his 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.860
 compact size its agility also its 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.019
 good turning diameter which makes it a 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.309
 excellent track said why are we going 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:01.610
 enjoy this car there we are on board 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.379
 of the micro here is the version s so 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.790
 the books and the most affordable one that gets 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.020
 revenge be below 10 thousand 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.670
 dollars which is still pretty 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.440
 surprising for a new car 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.860
 I have against that the pta which is 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.590
 pretty bald manual rearview mirror windows 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.130
 manual also board pretty edge 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.840
 receding 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.490
 but let's stop all functional 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.980
 when trying in the versions the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.360
 more posh including the sr is added 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.100
 electrical groups we add a 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.600
 screen a little bigger with camera 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.970
 reversing steering wheel controls 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.380
 cruise control often the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.600
 Automatic box 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.440
 otherwise the rest is very similar on 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.630
 enjoy the hall 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.490
 the quality of the materials and the finish 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.740
 of course what a subcompact 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.380
 so the space especially 0 to the passengers 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.390
 is more restricted one must one owes one's 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.470
 order and removing a little bit in 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.280
 before doing a little more to 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.370
 rear passengers 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:55.210
 but otherwise the car 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:57.640
 makes good what she promises under the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.310
 hood the microphone receives a four engine 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.320
 1.6-liter cylinders that deploys 109 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.540
 horses for a couple of 207 pounds 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.120
 feet it's actually the same engine that 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.590
 team the nissan poured its engine cat 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.530
 linh can be paired with a transmission 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.900
 manual five-speed serial or a 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.940
 optional four-speed automatic 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.440
 on all the books is what the most 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.230
 interesting of the car its price of 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.730
 base does 1998 dollars that's what they have 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.630
 makes the new car the most affordable 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.630
 in Canada
