 computers august 2015 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.809
 came as the processor intel core i7 5028 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.230
 with 60 33 gigahertz 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 he has a turbo of 3.6 gigahertz 140 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.510
 watt TDP trading that everyone suggests none 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.550
 two sets as a theoretical 12 core 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.380

 years without problems if they are sufficient 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.239
 because time is so weak came yes 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.510
 per 3 it is a very big and strong 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.059
 cpu cooler and with him comes the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.940
 processor provides files and as 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.890
 mainboard the s hawx 99 extremely much with 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.770
 the internet x90 chipset sp 3 s ata 384 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.410
 ram benches pci express 3.0 a branch 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.620
 according to a 7.1 sound chip and then 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.470
 Europe only two ps 2 4 x usb 2 once 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.170
 external sata fourman usb3 a lan 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.760
 socket and five 3.5 millimeter latches 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.390
 as well as that sounds for the sound chip 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.710
 then as a working memory 16 gb script 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.570
 shot ddr4 2010/15 are very fast 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.299
 it is a quad anything can eat by 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 use chat mode and 16 gb 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.450
 for gamers the next few years 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.259
 first enough as ssd the 250gb cuddle 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.820
 biggs 100 it's a fast ssd and 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.920
 250 gb is usually sufficient for that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.890
 operating system all programs and one 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.909
 two games as hdd one terabyte 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.110
 from toshiba 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.520
 It is above average 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.259
 fast hard disk and a terabyte 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.259
 are most of you loose 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.280
 suffice then as a graphics card 4gb 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.920
 in 3d gtx 980 ossi it is one 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.450
 overclocked version of the gtx 980 anyway 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.890
 she stays cool and thanks to her great 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.909
 the fairly low power consumption 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 pretty quiet 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.479
 with it you should then as well as all 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.969
 current games on the highest 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.750
 Settings can play as fluent 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.569
 power supply the 550w be quiet process 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.520
 has 80 plus gold water saving energy 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.090
 is it just cable management what you can 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.760
 the cables 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.920
 which you do not need and 550 watts 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.420
 for the pc more than enough one has thus 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.000
 still room to upgrade 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.090
 then another dvd burner of lg and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.280
 This housing frightened the faina 4 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.930
 It is a simple noble housing with 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.879
 very much space for components 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.349
 besides, there are already two fans 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.060
 pre-installed but of course know 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.459
 decide for yourself which yes take 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.110
 wanted to optional who does not want the pc 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.510
 I would like to assemble him myself 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.000
 also for 26 euro 90 can assemble 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.920
 that was it synonymous with the video if 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.150
 Ask the video as two months later 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.290
 description look through it to me 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.940
 click on each link 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.680
 the previously through our latest version
