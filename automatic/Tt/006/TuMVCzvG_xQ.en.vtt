 j 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.390
 but that was after playing 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:14.579
 but the change 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.259
 quarrel 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.259
 the sprint treated equally 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.890
 burning seray did not come out of the store 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.819
 it doesn't fit too long 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.499
 I came back from a grin 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.890
 with that the school is moving all over france that is five months one 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.560
 farm became 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.170
 and those coaches in a chance to return to the farm phone on one 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.560
 chance 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.900
 that shows statistics and a chance in kirchberg 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.010
 in a greenhouse 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.050
 Monday comes the name of the casino 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.750
 and 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.600
 it is tene that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 who first has three goals for the casting 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.680
 a new team of products 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.810
 to win the block 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.890
 9 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.379
 the room is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.810
 what follows yesterday to prevent yet another chance 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.390
 he is playing cards 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.310
 that sale in a crowd that 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.050
 both government failed to spring and summer 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.680
 she can't do that at least is the most likely 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.640
 that can be that of this match between switzerland and france 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.860
 and that is now going to change it may be that it can be back in 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 there was a big debt yesterday 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.509
 the winning more than ten times very colorful drink 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.080
 but where 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.360
 that covered 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.009
 and especially getting used to it 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.009
 line and bounce will be the perfect combination 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.580
 and there for the rest and dick roach 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.520
 yes those clubs and lemonade 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 from this information to a plus of 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.280
 theron the manager 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.410
 with his 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.520
 An example is to figure out the best player but to sell 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.729
 the hold 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.819

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.539
