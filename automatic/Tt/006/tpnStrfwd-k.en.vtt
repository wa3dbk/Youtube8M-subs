00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
sure sometimes the camera is kind of

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.969 
sure sometimes the camera is kind of
hard<00:01:31.959> to<00:01:32.050> get<00:01:32.200> in<00:01:32.319> there<00:01:32.470> because<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.770> have<00:01:32.860> to

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
hard to get in there because you have to

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.820 
hard to get in there because you have to
make<00:01:33.160> it<00:01:33.420> nice<00:01:34.420> inside<00:01:34.810> there's<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.530> camera

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
make it nice inside there's the camera

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.940 
make it nice inside there's the camera
and<00:01:36.179> then<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.330> don't<00:01:37.479> want<00:01:37.599> to<00:01:37.660> take<00:01:37.780> your<00:01:37.959> the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
and then you don't want to take your the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.910 
and then you don't want to take your the
board<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.750> make<00:01:40.750> sure<00:01:40.780> all<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.140> little<00:01:41.590> flaps

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
board and make sure all the little flaps

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.430 
board and make sure all the little flaps
that<00:01:42.160> you<00:01:42.340> have<00:01:42.459> sticking<00:01:42.910> up<00:01:43.000> are<00:01:43.440> pointing

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
that you have sticking up are pointing

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.529 
that you have sticking up are pointing
upwards<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:46.390> can<00:01:46.569> slide<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:49.030> board<00:01:49.300> back

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
upwards so you can slide the board back

00:01:49.539 --> 00:02:07.130 
upwards so you can slide the board back
in<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:51.190> put<00:01:51.489> the<00:01:51.640> board<00:01:51.910> in<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.950> this

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.980 

sometimes<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.320> difficult<00:02:08.500> because<00:02:09.690> all<00:02:10.690> the

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
sometimes it's difficult because all the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.100 
sometimes it's difficult because all the
little<00:02:11.260> things<00:02:12.210> sometimes<00:02:13.210> aren't<00:02:13.630> always<00:02:13.750> up

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
little things sometimes aren't always up

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.450 
little things sometimes aren't always up
so<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:16.060> got<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.390> make<00:02:16.510> sure<00:02:16.570> they're<00:02:16.990> all

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
so you got to make sure they're all

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.110 
so you got to make sure they're all
behind<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.670> board<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.850> everything

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
behind the board and you have everything

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.630 
behind the board and you have everything
out<00:02:26.370> sorry<00:02:27.370> about<00:02:27.460> that<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.970> knocked<00:02:28.810> over<00:02:29.020> my
