00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.739
 wait for that automatically 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.229
 for a year 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:12.419
 have extended it 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.390
 have in the past Frank every now and then also right from their point of view 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.849
 asked what is then 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.999
 the requirement profile of what we have in the new coach 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.020
 Richter Landes are kept covered 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.449
 I am today 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.689
 who to do it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.079
 Giving a bit more information to us is what we have said in the end 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.530
 In the last week it is important that many 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.700
 start a new beginning 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.450
 now wants 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.640
 in this situation in the second division and we wanted 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.030
 Of course with this new start also have a coach 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.150
 On the one hand the Jung is dynamic 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.570
 and on the other hand but also already experienced 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.950
 I believe custom on the spot on it 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.920
 refer 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.999
 what success Markus Babbel as 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.280
 Player had 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.740
 "We know everything 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.060
 He also has experience 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.910
 already collected at VfB Stuttgart as coach last as assistant coach of 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.960
 Armin Fay 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.950
 next to it 1 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.830
 in the ear as head coach 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.320
 December with the then reach also Dr of the Champions League 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.040
 what is necessary because causes 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.150
 I'm glad to be here 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.500
 after the yes Neuss is all the more beautiful 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.950
 I think that reflects the clubs piece again 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.320
 It's a big club for me, that's why I'm so proud 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.900
 to be allowed to sit here 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.760
 and of course very happy when I called on Mills Open at all 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.740
 Cracks would exist 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.490
 if for the second league to take over a team from the 2 league 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.720
 was 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 for me no big thought because that of course 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.180
 yes a team like Hertha BSC would like to train and then have 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.320
 exchanged with him one noticed 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.890
 that thanks to many points we were in agreement and that is so during very much 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.240
 was consistent and 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.009
 In order to talk with Michael Ohl it was also nice to talk to those Gegenbauer
