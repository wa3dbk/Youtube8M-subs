00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you when you fired off then there's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
you when you fired off then there's
magic<00:01:11.159> sword<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:12.060> someone's<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.570> magical

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
magic sword it's someone's a magical

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.109

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
enemy and this ability always crits so

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.060 
enemy and this ability always crits so
I'm<00:01:18.240> thinking<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.080> combination<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.799> coin

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
I'm thinking that a combination of coin

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.820 
I'm thinking that a combination of coin
toss<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:21.150> magic<00:01:21.659> sword<00:01:21.930> might<00:01:22.200> actually<00:01:22.409> be

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
toss with magic sword might actually be

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.390 
toss with magic sword might actually be
really<00:01:23.159> effective<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.020> do<00:01:25.020> quite<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> lot<00:01:26.189> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
really effective and do quite a lot of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.210 
really effective and do quite a lot of
damage<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> opponent<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.320> there's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
damage to the opponent and then there's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.569 
damage to the opponent and then there's
the<00:01:29.640> Dutch<00:01:30.060> ability<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.950> could<00:01:32.310> perhaps

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the Dutch ability and you could perhaps

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.200 
the Dutch ability and you could perhaps
use<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.400> I<00:01:35.400> think<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
use it with that but and I think it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.609 
use it with that but and I think it
would<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.479> better<00:01:36.630> used<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.079> portal<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
would be better used with portal and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
would be better used with portal and
I'll<00:01:37.740> show<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:37.950> why<00:01:38.299> then<00:01:39.299> there's<00:01:39.479> some

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I'll show you why then there's some

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.109 
I'll show you why then there's some
value<00:01:39.810> attic<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.890> add<00:01:41.520> some<00:01:41.939> more

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
value attic so you can add some more

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.929 
value attic so you can add some more
damage<00:01:42.479> pretty<00:01:43.229> basic<00:01:43.549> disruption<00:01:44.549> remove

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
damage pretty basic disruption remove

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.940 
damage pretty basic disruption remove
all<00:01:45.119> buffs<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.689> debuffs<00:01:45.869> from<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.409> enemy<00:01:46.770> I

all buffs and debuffs from the enemy I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.840 
all buffs and debuffs from the enemy I
don't<00:01:47.880> know<00:01:48.000> how<00:01:48.829> how<00:01:49.829> good<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
don't know how how good this is going to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.710 
don't know how how good this is going to
be<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.770> personally<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> would<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.399> wary<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
be and personally I would be wary of of

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.350 
be and personally I would be wary of of
using<00:01:55.409> an<00:01:56.119> entire<00:01:57.119> round<00:01:57.450> 2<00:01:58.340> debuff<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.610> your

using an entire round 2 debuff your your

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.749 
using an entire round 2 debuff your your
opponent<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:00.990> perhaps<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.950> might<00:02:02.430> come<00:02:02.729> in

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
opponent but perhaps it might come in

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.440 
opponent but perhaps it might come in
handy<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.619> for<00:02:04.619> instance<00:02:04.740> against<00:02:05.460> creatures

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
handy and for instance against creatures

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.719 
handy and for instance against creatures
such<00:02:06.719> as<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.200> mirror<00:02:07.469> striders<00:02:07.979> who<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.550> the

such as the mirror striders who have the

such as the mirror striders who have the
pump<00:02:09.030> ability<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.569> would<00:02:09.899> assume<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.500> will

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
pump ability I would assume that it will

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.120 
pump ability I would assume that it will
remove

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
remove

portal<00:02:24.420> ability<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.500> basically

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
portal ability and this is basically

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.810 
portal ability and this is basically
another<00:02:26.690> another<00:02:27.690> thing<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.860> swabbing<00:02:29.400> and

another another thing you swabbing and

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.780 
another another thing you swabbing and
well<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:31.020> don't<00:02:31.620> take<00:02:31.830> damage<00:02:32.070> from<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
toss combined with magic sword and then

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.670 
toss combined with magic sword and then
using<00:02:44.640> portal<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.480> avoid<00:02:45.780> taking<00:02:46.200> too<00:02:46.530> much

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
using portal to avoid taking too much
