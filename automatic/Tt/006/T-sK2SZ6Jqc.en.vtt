00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.530
 Today I would like to try an atmos 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.110
 make with moss and I do one 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.600
 small test before just times 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.820
 For the sake of interest, how much does one want to know 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.390
 can water he must accept the sacrifice 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:25.099
 we now have a 75 liter pot 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.779
 we also put the mountains and have 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.169
 I'll be right now that's what it means 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.800
 we now have 0 kilograms says the 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.800
 pot is empty 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:45.820
 Now we have and we have that beautiful 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:53.570
 not packed and it has to be dry 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:59.289
 whole times on the scales I have to me 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:02.390
 that's why it's almost 300 grams 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.360
 so now we pack the whole thing 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.710
 the attitude we have one now 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.750
 twelve liters bucket and now twelfth 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:15.680
 Once I put the 75 liter pot with me 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.630
 filled with fashion kleinstein on it 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.630
 the whole thing does not float up to us 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:47.680
 that's ten liters of water and now 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:49.770
 Now let long as I remember 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.770
 Not 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.380
 that has to go on for over an hour now 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.060
 water almost two hours even and 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:16.210
 Now let's just drain 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:18.280
 and then we are the same time that 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:26.100
 I have to drain now and now 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.100
 put the pot on the scales ok 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:41.110
 Welcome to a kilogram and almost 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.739
 900 kilo 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.910
 that's about two liters of water 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.950
 sums not entirely but at least two 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.430
 litre water 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.430
 that's a lot 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.299
 Yes, and now you need that must 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.299
 of course, to detach
