00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
double actually just means you have the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.749 
double actually just means you have the
option<00:01:24.079> of<00:01:24.170> either<00:01:24.259> mixed<00:01:24.950> up<00:01:25.100> our<00:01:25.250> shotguns

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
option of either mixed up our shotguns

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.310 
option of either mixed up our shotguns
there's<00:01:26.539> a<00:01:26.600> lot<00:01:26.719> of<00:01:26.810> different<00:01:27.079> kinds<00:01:27.259> of

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
there's a lot of different kinds of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.889 
there's a lot of different kinds of
shotguns<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.149> for<00:01:29.149> the<00:01:29.240> most<00:01:29.420> part<00:01:29.689> this<00:01:29.840> is

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
shotguns but for the most part this is

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.359 
shotguns but for the most part this is
the<00:01:30.020> general<00:01:30.500> generally<00:01:30.890> what<00:01:31.039> you'll<00:01:31.189> find

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
the general generally what you'll find

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.340 
the general generally what you'll find
brake<00:01:31.820> action<00:01:32.359> meaning<00:01:32.689> they<00:01:32.899> break<00:01:33.170> open

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
brake action meaning they break open

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.080 
brake action meaning they break open
kind<00:01:33.799> of<00:01:33.859> like<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.039> old<00:01:34.189> cowboy<00:01:34.549> coach<00:01:34.820> guns

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
kind of like the old cowboy coach guns

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.240 
kind of like the old cowboy coach guns
and<00:01:35.299> stuff<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:36.350> there's<00:01:36.649> double<00:01:36.979> barrels

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
and stuff so there's double barrels

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.700 
and stuff so there's double barrels
single<00:01:37.729> barrels<00:01:38.000> triple<00:01:38.420> barrels<00:01:38.810> sometimes

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
single barrels triple barrels sometimes

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.349 
single barrels triple barrels sometimes
there's<00:01:39.920> combinations<00:01:40.579> of<00:01:40.820> rifles<00:01:41.210> and

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
there's combinations of rifles and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.840 
there's combinations of rifles and
shotguns<00:01:41.600> together<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.740> multiple<00:01:43.310> barrels<00:01:43.640> so

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
shotguns together in multiple barrels so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.270 
shotguns together in multiple barrels so
there<00:01:44.000> may<00:01:44.119> be<00:01:44.149> two<00:01:44.539> rifles<00:01:45.039> barreled<00:01:46.039> and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
there may be two rifles barreled and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.219 
there may be two rifles barreled and
then<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.850> shotgun<00:01:47.270> barrel<00:01:47.539> underneath<00:01:47.780> or

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
then a shotgun barrel underneath or

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.959 
then a shotgun barrel underneath or
something<00:01:48.530> like<00:01:48.679> that<00:01:48.890> but<00:01:49.579> generally

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
something like that but generally

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.130 
something like that but generally
speaking<00:01:50.000> you'll<00:01:50.420> see<00:01:50.600> double<00:01:50.990> or<00:01:51.109> single

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140

barrel<00:01:51.679> break<00:01:51.890> actions<00:01:52.340> sometimes<00:01:52.609> triple

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
barrel break actions sometimes triple

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.130 
barrel break actions sometimes triple

would be a shotgun like this this bottom
piece<00:02:01.909> here<00:02:02.329> is<00:02:02.810> what's<00:02:03.140> known<00:02:03.350> as<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.590> tubular

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
piece here is what's known as a tubular

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.320 
piece here is what's known as a tubular
magazine<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:05.539> holds<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.560> extra<00:02:06.979> shells

magazine and it holds the extra shells

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.430 
magazine and it holds the extra shells
there's<00:02:08.330> all<00:02:08.509> different<00:02:08.539> kinds<00:02:09.140> there's<00:02:09.380> a

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
there's all different kinds there's a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.860 
there's all different kinds there's a
pump<00:02:09.710> like<00:02:10.130> this<00:02:10.160> one<00:02:10.490> here<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.910> semi-auto

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
pump like this one here a semi-auto

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.480 
pump like this one here a semi-auto
which<00:02:12.140> would<00:02:12.290> look<00:02:12.470> very<00:02:12.500> similar<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.370> this

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
which would look very similar to this

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.700 
which would look very similar to this
except<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.630> piece<00:02:14.870> wouldn't<00:02:15.230> move<00:02:15.410> here

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
except the this piece wouldn't move here

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.010 
except the this piece wouldn't move here
that<00:02:16.430> means<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.760> would<00:02:16.850> operate<00:02:17.060> by<00:02:17.570> itself

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
that means it would operate by itself

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.420 
that means it would operate by itself
every<00:02:18.380> time<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.650> pull<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.860> trigger<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.310> would

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
every time you pull the trigger it would

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.770 
every time you pull the trigger it would
operate<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.120> reload

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
operate and reload
