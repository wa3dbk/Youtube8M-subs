00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
next we're gonna put that invasion star

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.260 
next we're gonna put that invasion star
on<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> back<00:00:15.809> corner<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.920> store<00:00:17.270> particular

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
on the back corner this store particular

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.750 
on the back corner this store particular
has<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> Nevada<00:00:18.750> star<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.920> fairly<00:00:20.520> large

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
has a Nevada star and it's fairly large

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.210 
has a Nevada star and it's fairly large
it's<00:00:21.660> gonna<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.500> gonna<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.010> some

it's gonna is gonna have some

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.160 
it's gonna is gonna have some
interference<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:23.910> between<00:00:24.090> them<00:00:24.420> between

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
interference here between them between

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.519 
interference here between them between
the<00:00:25.410> topo<00:00:25.800> bracket<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.930> body<00:00:28.140> handle

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the topo bracket and in the body handle

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.939 
the topo bracket and in the body handle
so<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:30.210> I'll<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.720> I'll<00:00:30.960> I'll<00:00:31.619> cut

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
so what I'll do here is I'll I'll cut

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.280 
so what I'll do here is I'll I'll cut
some<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.279> our<00:00:32.399> stencil<00:00:32.820> down<00:00:33.000> use<00:00:33.870> our<00:00:34.050> tape

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
some of our stencil down use our tape

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.639 
some of our stencil down use our tape
and<00:00:34.500> mash<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.010> protect<00:00:35.820> these<00:00:35.940> items<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.649> in

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and mash to protect these items and in

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
and mash to protect these items and in
that<00:00:37.950> matter<00:00:38.160> we'll<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.629> flat

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
that matter we'll get it down on a flat

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.510 
that matter we'll get it down on a flat
surface<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.739> don't<00:00:40.829> want<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> try<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> bend

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
surface you don't want to try to bend

00:00:41.520 --> 00:01:02.130 
surface you don't want to try to bend
this<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.570> stencil<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.200> over<00:00:43.500> stuff<00:00:43.739> so

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.110

see you in here back where that's at get
a<00:01:08.150> little<00:01:08.240> closer<00:01:08.570> over<00:01:08.990> here

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
a little closer over here

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:25.469 
a little closer over here
get<00:01:10.610> that<00:01:10.790> away<00:01:11.800> with<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.890> body<00:01:13.160> handle

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:38.210 

so<00:01:26.020> be<00:01:26.170> real<00:01:26.350> close<00:01:26.619> Diana's<00:01:27.250> corn

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.109 

okay<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:39.280> that's<00:01:39.490> what<00:01:39.729> we're<00:01:39.820> going<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.000> end

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
okay so that's what we're going to end

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.810 
okay so that's what we're going to end
up<00:01:40.180> doing<00:01:41.170> but<00:01:42.070> in<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.250> collision<00:01:42.520> weights

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
up doing but in the collision weights

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.539 
up doing but in the collision weights
that<00:01:43.030> were<00:01:43.149> clearly<00:01:43.420> two<00:01:43.979> obstructions<00:01:45.390> now

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that were clearly two obstructions now

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.320 
that were clearly two obstructions now
I'm<00:01:48.549> going<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:48.909> use<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:51.460> mask<00:01:51.729> for<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.119> line

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
I'm going to use the the mask for a line

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.039 
I'm going to use the the mask for a line
here<00:01:52.920> I'm<00:01:53.920> also<00:01:54.159> going<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:54.899> make<00:01:55.899> your

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
here I'm also going to make your

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.760 
here I'm also going to make your
measurement<00:01:56.820> put<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.909> points<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.420> star

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
measurement put the points of the star

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.730 
measurement put the points of the star
up<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.070> top<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.460> body<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:02.409> see<00:02:02.590> that

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
up to the top of the body to see that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.100 
up to the top of the body to see that
I've<00:02:02.860> got<00:02:03.070> it<00:02:03.220> on<00:02:03.310> there

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
I've got it on there

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:16.740 
I've got it on there
square<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:08.229> looks<00:02:08.560> good<00:02:13.110> okay<00:02:15.750> transfer

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
square that looks good okay transfer

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:34.290 
square that looks good okay transfer
paper<00:02:17.019> off

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.440 

just<00:02:35.300> tap<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:37.400> corners<00:02:37.879> there<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.239> let<00:02:38.330> it

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
just tap the corners there and let it

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.850 
just tap the corners there and let it
hang<00:02:38.660> sort<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.050> loose<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:40.310> check<00:02:41.000> your<00:02:41.860> mazes

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
hang sort of loose and check your mazes

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.059 
hang sort of loose and check your mazes
and<00:02:43.129> everything<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.580> make<00:02:43.610> sure<00:02:43.760> you

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:57.130 

good<00:02:49.810> then<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:52.370> go<00:02:52.579> around<00:02:53.980> do<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.099> top<00:02:56.140> pull

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
good then to go around do the top pull

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.599 
good then to go around do the top pull
down<00:02:57.379> a<00:02:57.409> little<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.219> don't<00:02:58.400> get<00:02:58.549> any

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
down a little so you don't get any

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:16.600 
down a little so you don't get any
records<00:02:59.180> nice<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.780> smooth

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.220 

it's<00:03:17.610> off<00:03:17.820> paper<00:03:18.120> off<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:21.600> we'll<00:03:21.750> check<00:03:21.990> these

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
it's off paper off so we'll check these

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:35.670 
it's off paper off so we'll check these
areas<00:03:22.710> all<00:03:22.920> along<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:28.280> stencil

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:04:28.200 

number<00:03:36.489> ready<00:03:36.700> start<00:03:37.000> masking<00:03:37.180> off<00:03:44.790> this

as always check for any little pockets
where<00:04:33.860> they<00:04:34.300> read<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.510> get<00:04:35.630> around<00:04:39.220> shaker

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
where they read and get around shaker

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:48.360 
where they read and get around shaker
steps<00:04:40.640> up<00:04:40.820> one<00:04:40.970> last<00:04:41.150> time

under<00:05:31.949> spray<00:05:32.279> on<00:05:32.460> that<00:05:32.509> fly<00:05:33.509> into<00:05:33.990> with<00:05:34.139> a<00:05:34.169> topo

00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:34.619 
under spray on that fly into with a topo

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:40.549 
under spray on that fly into with a topo
bracket<00:05:36.649> yeah<00:05:37.649> I'll<00:05:38.009> see<00:05:38.189> if<00:05:38.249> we<00:05:38.339> can<00:05:38.490> get<00:05:39.559> this

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:40.559 
bracket yeah I'll see if we can get this

00:05:40.559 --> 00:06:35.659 
bracket yeah I'll see if we can get this
off

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:55.719 

few<00:06:36.669> issues<00:06:36.819> with<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.300> center<00:06:37.629> of<00:06:37.659> the<00:06:37.780> star

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:12.590 

but<00:06:56.300> there<00:06:56.509> it<00:06:56.629> is<00:06:56.749> just<00:06:57.199> like<00:06:57.409> that
