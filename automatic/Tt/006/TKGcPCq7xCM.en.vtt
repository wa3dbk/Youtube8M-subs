00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.349
 Hello friends, I am Yuri Primachenko 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 and greet you on the channel the rest 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.869
 arctic today's review again 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.910
 will talk about the team on the dresser 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.550
 performed in a slightly different manner 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.330
 than I talked about this video 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.029
 oak dresser so look we are 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.020
 in the children's room where our products are 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.960
 including the beds they were made by 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.450
 the technology described in the course 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.410
 bed do it yourself 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.350
 and the most basic thing for what i want here 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.680
 shoot a little this here 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.640
 here 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.570
 dresser well I must say that this dresser 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.789
 slightly simpler than the one that is shown 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.199
 in the video oak chest of drawers 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.530
 some features but just that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.150
 perhaps only apparent because 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.700
 was done 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:13.740
 this chest of drawers is pretty thorough 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.460
 it was necessary to calculate everything very clearly 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.049
 dimensions to get and dimensions that 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.070
 showed the customer to comply with certain 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.939
 dimensions and even the depth of the box 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.500
 because it is often asked exactly here on 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.500
 certain depth of drawers 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.799
 who doesn't have his own in this 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.490
 certain features it firstly 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:44.740
 the fact that the chest of drawers is not on the legs but on the base 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.780
 wooden corners and at the back I will hide the base 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.179
 efforts to be able somewhere 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.939
 move it randomly to hook 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.060
 there was no base in this dresser 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.860
 frame you and sides as you see solid 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.869
 and in this dresser 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.349
 This is a clean dresser consisting of six 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:10.299
 drawers in this to mod all these 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:13.810
 drawers they kind of attacked retractable 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:18.280
 mechanisms large enough painted 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.190
 this dresser waterborne water acrylic varnish 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.190
 water based white enough 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:29.110
 dear again I repeat that like 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.739
 dresser's just such a plan can be 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.720
 it is quite easy to do and in general 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.489
 even in not very equipped carpentry 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.859
 workshop 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.459
 using for this whether furniture board 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.290
 perhaps even in thick plywood 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.030
 use planned plywood 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.739
 which is now sold in the market quite 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.480
 it is not necessary to use 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.440
 furniture panels from expensive materials 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.480
 type of oak can be fully used 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.260
 pine furniture shield which in general 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.889
 then in the product 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:09.430
 also behaves beautifully these 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:12.069
 The drawers are full and they also 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.190
 close this dresser 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:20.650
 and was made by us in the kit to these 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.700
 the beds well in this room will be 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.700
 be done a little later 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.489
 white cabinets 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:34.730
 when i will do that too 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:37.410
 take a video and tell you about it 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.140
