00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
personally believe that off body carry

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.560 
personally believe that off body carry
is<00:01:24.350> usually<00:01:25.220> never<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.580> good<00:01:25.850> idea<00:01:26.150> because

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
is usually never a good idea because

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.290 
is usually never a good idea because
it's<00:01:27.050> just<00:01:27.200> way<00:01:27.380> too<00:01:27.409> easy<00:01:27.700> for<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.180> lose

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.600 
it's just way too easy for you to lose
track<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.630> your<00:01:29.780> gun<00:01:30.020> or<00:01:30.229> for<00:01:30.440> just<00:01:30.620> it<00:01:31.130> for<00:01:31.550> it

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
track of your gun or for just it for it

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.420 
track of your gun or for just it for it
