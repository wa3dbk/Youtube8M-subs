we had a question come in from someone
who's<00:00:02.939> using<00:00:03.179> supercoder<00:00:03.899> so<00:00:04.650> they're<00:00:05.100> doing

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
who's using supercoder so they're doing

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.950 
who's using supercoder so they're doing
some<00:00:05.549> research<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.150> they<00:00:06.210> came<00:00:06.420> across<00:00:06.569> some

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
some research and they came across some

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:28.109 
some research and they came across some

code at a great booth there so um down
on<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.090> bottom<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.659> was<00:01:11.720> talking<00:01:11.960> about<00:01:12.049> these

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
on the bottom it was talking about these

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.500 
on the bottom it was talking about these
two<00:01:12.530> codes<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:13.729> this<00:01:14.000> is<00:01:14.180> what<00:01:14.330> she's

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
two codes and so this is what she's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.179 
two codes and so this is what she's
talking<00:01:14.840> about<00:01:14.900> this<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:15.560> statement<00:01:15.830> here

talking about this this statement here
so<00:01:16.340> let<00:01:16.460> me<00:01:16.580> show<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.720> answer<00:01:18.170> sheet

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.240 

how<00:01:21.530> we<00:01:21.590> worked<00:01:21.979> this<00:01:22.189> out<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.740> on<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:24.979> bottom

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
how we worked this out so on the bottom

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.249 
how we worked this out so on the bottom
of<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.400> page<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:25.759> I<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.119> showed<00:01:26.330> you<00:01:26.360> the

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
of the page that I just showed you the

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.440 
of the page that I just showed you the
scenario<00:01:27.560> describes<00:01:28.189> both<00:01:28.490> impedance<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.240> pH

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
scenario describes both impedance and pH

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.929 
scenario describes both impedance and pH
test<00:01:29.840> being<00:01:30.140> performed<00:01:30.560> in<00:01:30.859> one<00:01:31.159> session<00:01:31.549> if

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
test being performed in one session if

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.569 
test being performed in one session if
you<00:01:32.539> think<00:01:33.079> coding<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.130> as<00:01:34.280> easy<00:01:34.429> as

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
you think coding it is as easy as

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.999 
you think coding it is as easy as
billing<00:01:34.999> nine<00:01:35.420> one<00:01:35.659> zero<00:01:35.960> three<00:01:36.140> eight<00:01:36.530> and

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
billing nine one zero three eight and

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.039 
billing nine one zero three eight and
nine<00:01:37.579> eleven<00:01:37.850> oh<00:01:37.939> three<00:01:38.240> four-year<00:01:38.509> wrong<00:01:38.810> so

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
nine eleven oh three four-year wrong so

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.690 
nine eleven oh three four-year wrong so
she's<00:01:39.229> quoting<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.649> article<00:01:39.679> dodge<00:01:40.670> a

if there's a bundling issue and how I
choose<00:02:00.109> which<00:02:00.350> code<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.889> report<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:01.850> I'm<00:02:01.909> going

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
choose which code to report so I'm going

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.429 
choose which code to report so I'm going
to<00:02:02.119> grab<00:02:02.270> these<00:02:02.509> two<00:02:02.780> codes<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.350> go<00:02:03.469> back<00:02:03.679> to

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
to grab these two codes and go back to

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.850 
to grab these two codes and go back to
my<00:02:06.439> super<00:02:06.859> coder<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:08.110> up<00:02:09.110> on<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.289> top<00:02:09.380> when

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
get things like CCI edit checker so you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.440 
get things like CCI edit checker so you
just<00:02:18.110> go<00:02:18.290> in<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.800> in<00:02:19.340> this<00:02:19.520> box<00:02:19.819> you<00:02:20.150> put<00:02:20.330> in

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
just go in and in this box you put in

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.300 
just go in and in this box you put in
your<00:02:20.569> codes<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.440> need<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.709> separate<00:02:22.100> them

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
your codes and you need to separate them

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.960 
your codes and you need to separate them
by<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.550> comma<00:02:22.640> instead<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.569> word<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.970> and

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
by a comma instead of the word and and

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.699 
by a comma instead of the word and and
you<00:02:26.209> just<00:02:26.390> click<00:02:26.600> on<00:02:26.720> validate<00:02:29.440> well<00:02:30.440> maybe

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
you just click on validate well maybe

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.790 
you just click on validate well maybe
not<00:02:30.950> separated<00:02:31.610> with<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.730> comma

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.140 

no<00:02:36.800> there<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.340> just<00:02:37.550> have<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.760> screen<00:02:38.000> so

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
no there it is I just have the screen so

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.820 
no there it is I just have the screen so
bigger<00:02:38.360> didn't<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:41.510> here's<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.050> two<00:02:42.230> codes<00:02:42.500> 9

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
bigger didn't so here's the two codes 9

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.640 
bigger didn't so here's the two codes 9
103<00:02:43.430> 8<00:02:43.550> &amp;<00:02:43.730> 9<00:02:43.760> 103<00:02:44.390> 4<00:02:44.630> we've<00:02:44.780> got<00:02:44.960> this<00:02:45.110> big<00:02:45.320> red

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
103 8 &amp; 9 103 4 we've got this big red

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.400 
103 8 &amp; 9 103 4 we've got this big red
flag<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.330> telling<00:02:47.630> me<00:02:47.750> I'm<00:02:48.080> not<00:02:48.200> going

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
flag so this is telling me I'm not going

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.130 
flag so this is telling me I'm not going
to<00:02:48.500> get<00:02:48.620> away<00:02:48.740> with<00:02:48.860> coding<00:02:49.340> both<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.900> I'm

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
to get away with coding both and so I'm

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.810 
to get away with coding both and so I'm
gonna<00:02:51.290> read<00:02:51.560> what<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.890> box<00:02:52.100> says<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.790> says

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
gonna read what the box says and it says

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.790 
gonna read what the box says and it says
the<00:02:53.600> 9<00:02:53.810> 103<00:02:54.650> 8<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.850> column<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.690> code<00:02:57.020> for<00:02:57.410> 9<00:02:57.590> 1

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
the 9 103 8 is a column to code for 9 1

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.970 
the 9 103 8 is a column to code for 9 1
0<00:02:57.860> 3<00:02:58.250> 4<00:02:58.810> these<00:02:59.810> codes<00:03:00.260> cannot<00:03:00.590> be<00:03:00.770> built

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
0 3 4 these codes cannot be built

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.240 
0 3 4 these codes cannot be built
together<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.610> any<00:03:01.790> circumstance<00:03:02.720> code<00:03:03.440> 9<00:03:03.680> 103

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
together in any circumstance code 9 103

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.750 
together in any circumstance code 9 103
8<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.550> bundled<00:03:05.060> into<00:03:05.330> 9<00:03:05.930> 103<00:03:06.470> for<00:03:06.680> code<00:03:07.040> 9<00:03:07.250> 103

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
8 is bundled into 9 103 for code 9 103

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.610 
8 is bundled into 9 103 for code 9 103
it<00:03:07.880> cannot<00:03:08.150> be<00:03:08.300> build<00:03:08.480> with<00:03:08.630> 9<00:03:08.780> 103<00:03:09.320> 4<00:03:09.560> so

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
it cannot be build with 9 103 4 so

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.230 
it cannot be build with 9 103 4 so
basically<00:03:12.620> what<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:12.890> do<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.490> look<00:03:13.760> at<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.030> RV

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
basically what I do is I look at the RV

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.490 
basically what I do is I look at the RV
use<00:03:14.890> we've<00:03:15.890> got<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.400> one<00:03:16.610> is<00:03:16.760> worth<00:03:17.170> 14.5<00:03:18.170> o

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
use we've got this one is worth 14.5 o

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.130 
use we've got this one is worth 14.5 o
RV<00:03:18.920> use<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:19.970> one's<00:03:20.240> worth<00:03:20.420> five<00:03:20.690> point<00:03:20.990> nine

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
RV use this one's worth five point nine

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.680 
RV use this one's worth five point nine
three<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:22.190> depending<00:03:22.700> on<00:03:22.820> where<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.150> live<00:03:23.360> and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
three so depending on where you live and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.200 
three so depending on where you live and
whatever<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.170> this<00:03:24.500> gets<00:03:24.740> multiplied<00:03:25.430> times

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
whatever this this gets multiplied times

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.970 
whatever this this gets multiplied times
a<00:03:26.480> conversion<00:03:26.900> factor<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.440> come<00:03:27.680> up<00:03:27.800> with<00:03:27.920> a

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
a conversion factor to come up with a

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.830 
a conversion factor to come up with a
dollar<00:03:28.190> amount<00:03:28.550> so<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.820> higher<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.300> RV<00:03:29.630> you

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
dollar amount so the higher the RV you

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.070 
dollar amount so the higher the RV you
the<00:03:30.230> more<00:03:30.470> money<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:31.370> code<00:03:31.640> is<00:03:31.820> is<00:03:32.030> worth<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.050> I

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
the more money the code is is worth so I

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.590 
the more money the code is is worth so I
normally<00:03:33.860> when<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.100> have<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.030> know<00:03:35.150> between

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
normally when I have it you know between

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.900 
normally when I have it you know between
two<00:03:36.050> codes<00:03:36.380> we'll<00:03:36.890> go<00:03:37.040> with<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.370> higher<00:03:37.550> code

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
two codes we'll go with the higher code

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.930 
two codes we'll go with the higher code
the<00:03:38.120> nine<00:03:38.300> 103<00:03:38.930> eight<00:03:39.050> because<00:03:39.230> it's<00:03:39.440> worth

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
the nine 103 eight because it's worth

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.430 
the nine 103 eight because it's worth
14.5<00:03:40.940> OC<00:03:41.770> not<00:03:42.770> CEUs<00:03:43.250> yeah<00:03:43.520> RV<00:03:44.120> use<00:03:44.300> so<00:03:45.050> what

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
14.5 OC not CEUs yeah RV use so what

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.840 
14.5 OC not CEUs yeah RV use so what
that's<00:03:45.560> what<00:03:45.800> you're<00:03:45.950> looking<00:03:46.310> for<00:03:46.490> if<00:03:46.670> your

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
that's what you're looking for if your

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.270 
that's what you're looking for if your
documentation<00:03:47.590> sounds<00:03:48.590> like<00:03:48.710> it<00:03:48.830> supports

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
documentation sounds like it supports

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.730 
documentation sounds like it supports
both<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.570> pop<00:03:50.810> both<00:03:51.140> of<00:03:51.320> those<00:03:51.410> codes

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
both and you pop both of those codes

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.720 
both and you pop both of those codes
into<00:03:52.220> your<00:03:52.370> your<00:03:52.700> CCI<00:03:53.540> edit<00:03:53.990> checker<00:03:54.230> then<00:03:55.070> and

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
into your your CCI edit checker then and

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.000 
into your your CCI edit checker then and
it<00:03:55.850> comes<00:03:56.060> up<00:03:56.180> as<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:56.870> know<00:03:56.960> you<00:03:57.530> can't<00:03:57.800> build

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
it comes up as you know you can't build

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.990 
it comes up as you know you can't build
both<00:03:58.220> of<00:03:58.400> them<00:03:58.490> together

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
both of them together

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.730 
both of them together
well<00:03:59.090> then<00:03:59.210> build<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.570> more<00:03:59.750> comprehensive<00:04:00.230> one

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
well then build a more comprehensive one

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.700 
well then build a more comprehensive one
okay<00:04:01.520> so<00:04:02.060> this<00:04:02.210> so<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.690> smaller<00:04:02.990> or<00:04:03.290> less<00:04:03.500> or

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
okay so this so the smaller or less or

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.980 
okay so this so the smaller or less or
RV<00:04:04.010> u1<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.610> one<00:04:04.880> that's<00:04:05.000> bundled<00:04:05.540> into<00:04:05.690> it

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
RV u1 is the one that's bundled into it

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.930 
RV u1 is the one that's bundled into it
so<00:04:06.770> let<00:04:06.860> me<00:04:06.890> go<00:04:06.950> back<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.490> rest<00:04:07.700> of<00:04:07.850> my

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
so let me go back to the rest of my

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.840 
so let me go back to the rest of my
answer<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.050> is<00:04:09.290> what<00:04:09.700> she<00:04:10.700> was

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
answer so this is what she was

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.720 
answer so this is what she was
struggling<00:04:11.690> with<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.740> just<00:04:13.250> was<00:04:13.400> kind<00:04:13.580> of

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
struggling with I just was kind of

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.780 
struggling with I just was kind of
comparing<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.390> two<00:04:14.630> codes<00:04:14.930> here<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.290> see

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
comparing the two codes here to see

and<00:04:36.260> it's<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.680> little<00:04:36.890> apparently<00:04:37.550> more

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760

three<00:04:49.640> four<00:04:49.910> also<00:04:50.270> be<00:04:50.390> violating<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.470> CCI

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
three four also be violating the CCI

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
see nine 103 four described as the more

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.620 
see nine 103 four described as the more
extensive<00:05:06.920> code<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:08.000> actually<00:05:08.210> should<00:05:08.600> say

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
extensive code it actually should say

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.400 
extensive code it actually should say
nine<00:05:09.080> 103<00:05:10.070> eight<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.730> the<00:05:11.480> more<00:05:11.720> extensive

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
nine 103 eight is the more extensive

nine 103 eight is the more extensive
code<00:05:12.920> so<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:13.550> can<00:05:13.760> see<00:05:13.940> why<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.510> know<00:05:14.600> that

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
code so I can see why you know that

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.900 
code so I can see why you know that
would<00:05:14.960> have<00:05:14.990> tripped<00:05:15.470> someone<00:05:15.830> up<00:05:15.980> so<00:05:16.430> focus

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
would have tripped someone up so focus

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.480
