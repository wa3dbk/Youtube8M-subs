on<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.370> left<00:00:02.580> side<00:00:02.760> is<00:00:03.290> the<00:00:05.390> 92<00:00:06.560> tower<00:00:07.560> led

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
on the left side is the 92 tower led

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.379 
on the left side is the 92 tower led
from<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.580> LEDs<00:00:09.230> on<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.830> right<00:00:11.010> side<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
from the LEDs on the right side is the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:27.440 
from the LEDs on the right side is the
v3<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:16.080> p3<00:00:16.740> Triton<00:00:17.130> here's<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.550> brakes

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.660 

and<00:00:28.020> that's<00:00:28.200> without<00:00:28.350> even<00:00:28.530> focusing<00:00:29.280> it<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and that's without even focusing it you

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.710 
and that's without even focusing it you
can<00:00:29.850> see<00:00:32.180> that<00:00:33.180> site<00:00:33.420> looks<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> little

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
can see that site looks a little

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.780 
can see that site looks a little
brighter<00:00:34.080> on<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.740> parking<00:00:35.190> lysis<00:00:35.580> just

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
brighter on the parking lysis just

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.180 
brighter on the parking lysis just
because<00:00:35.970> I<00:00:36.210> haven't<00:00:36.330> focused<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:37.710> Triton<00:00:38.100> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
because I haven't focused the Triton I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.260 
because I haven't focused the Triton I
just<00:00:38.370> threw<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.700> there<00:00:38.820> real<00:00:39.000> quick<00:00:39.150> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
just threw it in there real quick to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.550 
just threw it in there real quick to
make<00:00:39.330> a<00:00:39.450> video<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.140> sure<00:00:40.320> we'll<00:00:40.440> get

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
make a video so I'm sure we'll get

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.200 
make a video so I'm sure we'll get
brighter<00:00:40.830> if<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.100> focus<00:00:41.310> it<00:00:43.489> but<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.670> overall

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
brighter if I focus it but the overall

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.200 
brighter if I focus it but the overall
output<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:46.309> much<00:00:47.309> brighter<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:50.059> I'll<00:00:51.059> do

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
output is just much brighter and I'll do

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.680 
output is just much brighter and I'll do
a<00:00:51.239> comparison<00:00:51.720> I<00:00:52.050> i<00:00:52.200> also<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.120> v3<00:00:54.120> Triton

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
a comparison I i also have a v3 Triton

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.830 
a comparison I i also have a v3 Triton
in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.100> right<00:00:56.100> turn<00:00:56.730> signal<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.210> well<00:00:59.840> there's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
in the right turn signal as well there's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.200 
in the right turn signal as well there's
the<00:01:01.250> stock<00:01:02.510> amber<00:01:03.510> turn<00:01:03.690> signal<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:08.210> there's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the stock amber turn signal and there's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:24.920 
the stock amber turn signal and there's
the<00:01:09.330> v3

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:43.250 

to<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.020> hazards<00:01:26.380> on

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:02:32.570 

you

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.810 

so<00:02:34.500> I'll<00:02:35.500> make<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.710> better<00:02:35.950> video<00:02:36.100> once<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.700> gets

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
so I'll make a better video once it gets

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:44.940 
so I'll make a better video once it gets
dark<00:02:37.000> outside<00:02:37.240> probably<00:02:37.810> tomorrow<00:02:40.020> but<00:02:43.950> there

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
dark outside probably tomorrow but there

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.160 
dark outside probably tomorrow but there
it<00:02:45.070> is
