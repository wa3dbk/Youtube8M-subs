00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.160
 good afternoon dear viewers and 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.019
 my channel followers my name is Igor 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.110
 pepper and in this video tutorial we are with you 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.420
 consider how to turn 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.109
 image on your monitor 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.240
 computer happens very often that after 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.880
 any game you have 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.420
 inadvertently image on the monitor 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.179
 displayed feet up or in the side 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.279
 on the left to the left there are several approaches on 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.860
 this question why are you on the go 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.170
 watching a video don't try to do it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.379
 do it after you see 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.360
 video to the end and so let's start with 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.809
 the simplest example 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.700
 and so if you see that you have 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.920
 upside down image about here 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.410
 so it means but you can't see here 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.899
 somewhere just a strip out with the right 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.030
 the sides can actually see everything I have 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.250
 displayed differently so there is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.410
 several ways to bring it all back in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.379
 the initial position for this is not necessary 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.560
 fuss no need to panic well let's start with 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.150
 the most difficult ways yes and so everyone knows 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.590
 cherished start button control panel 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.299
 we go by the way some here 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.299
 displayed differently and right there 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.430
 begin to fuss that he has something not 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.680
 so all you have so you need to press only 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.930
 here many are just ticked 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 on the category shook on but push and 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.400
 old small icons here are less 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.159
 either choose the last item 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.070
 Here we select the screen accordingly. 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.020
 setting the screen parameters and how you 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.350
 see here we can choose either 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.320
 landscape here in this case so if 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.700
 choose portrait then it will be sideways 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.439
 our image if we choose landscape 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.200
 inverted just turns out that 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.470
 us here it will stand like that but feet 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.420
 up or portrait upside down 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.960
 for example you chose landscape 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.570
 inverted clicked apply and clicked 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.420
 save changes there is another way 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.110
 You can do this through the previously created 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.030
 god mode folder if you don't know how it is 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.270
 do can watch one of 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.990
 video lessons at the end will be a link 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:22.700
 click to see the full video so 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.950
 click on god mode again it turns out 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.080
 down below we almost need with almost the most 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.270
 the bottom of the page because everything here 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.970
 arranged in alphabetical order 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.890
 respectively the words screen on and almost in 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.220
 right at the end and choose here 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.680
 screen orientation changes click two 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.660
 times here again we can choose which of us 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.820
 need landscape portrait and you 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.739
 click save changes you have 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.590
 the image will be different next 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.410
 third way you are directly on 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.380
 monitor, right-click 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.730
 choose parameters from the chart here 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.489
 choose an item 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.690
 turn and here already choose turn on 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.060
 90 degrees to 180 only 270 to 90 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.150
 degrees that's what we get and the most 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.130
 easy way don't bother don't 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.860
 with the first not with the second me with the third 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.070
 reception because there is a faster and 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.549
 proper reception for that we are just 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.400
 press the key combination kontrol alt 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:27.930
 and hold them and click on the arrow 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.239
 down the image will be kicked up or 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.209
 head down whatever you want to call it 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.500
 if again you press kontrol alt and 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.720
 up arrow 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.989
 accordingly she will roll over again on 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 our places and the same thing if we 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.230
 hold down the control alt arrow 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.000
 to the right we will have a head 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.680
 right if kontrol alt hold 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.100
 at the same time click on the left arrow 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.430
 then our image will be head with 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.549
 the left side is the easiest way 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.730

 friends, I don't think this is the best 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.560
 option but once you have already decided to joke
