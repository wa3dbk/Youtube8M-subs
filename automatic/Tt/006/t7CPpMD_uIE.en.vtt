it<00:02:47.910> climbs<00:02:48.150> really<00:02:48.630> well<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.320> saddle<00:02:49.650> it

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
it climbs really well in the saddle it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.310 
it climbs really well in the saddle it
doesn't<00:02:50.280> seem<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.730> be<00:02:50.880> too<00:02:51.510> much<00:02:51.630> torsional
