to<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> light<00:00:51.210> graphite<00:00:51.719> right<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:53.480> and

to the light graphite right there and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.290 
to the light graphite right there and
then<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> stealth<00:00:55.289> grey<00:00:56.030> see<00:00:57.030> right<00:00:57.180> here

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
then the stealth grey see right here

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970 
then the stealth grey see right here
along<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> mudguard<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.770> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
along the mudguard it's got like that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.150 
along the mudguard it's got like that
reptile<00:00:59.219> type<00:00:59.730> print<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
reptile type print on it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
reptile type print on it
in<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> same<00:01:02.520> color<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> elephant<00:01:03.510> print

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
in the same color on the elephant print

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.320 
in the same color on the elephant print
I<00:01:07.369> think<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.790> been<00:01:08.909> cool<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.150> they

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
I think it would have been cool if they

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810 
I think it would have been cool if they
would<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.600> made<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.400> cement

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
would have made it on you know cement

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.450 
would have made it on you know cement
and<00:01:12.000> grey<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.990> normally<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.650> elephant

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
and grey that's normally on elephant

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.940 
and grey that's normally on elephant
print<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.140> this<00:01:16.140> stuff<00:01:16.380> kind<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.710> gives<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
print but this stuff kind of gives it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.460 
print but this stuff kind of gives it
that<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.369> stealthy<00:01:17.790> look<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.150> guess<00:01:18.470> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that you know stealthy look I guess and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
that you know stealthy look I guess and
again<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.189> elephant<00:01:21.060> print<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.420> the
