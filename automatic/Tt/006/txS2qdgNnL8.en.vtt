00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.330
 hello editing presenting a product from mr his hand the big 48 35 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.690
 classics of the beginning of the marca 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.959
 existing in black version also 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.739
 so very specific at the level of the ancient form form 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.739
 really very aggressive 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.769
 so we're on a knife hours for the fight we're not here to do 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:19.640
 toast 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 a future of cutting the wand it's really 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.489
 very specific for the fight is the only defense 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.009
 the typing techniques that are revolutionary and very effective with 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.510
 a knife shape like that at the hook 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.510
 therefore right-handed opening only left-handed 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.620
 if it was me eva that allows an explosive opening right out of the 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.770
 poached 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.770
 position belt clip possible 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.200
 for the passage of the gois 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.450
 during the crisis as it should 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.400
 the steel if blood 54 cm long well typically at mercedes 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.610
 you have here g10 pads so making it an extremely mensch 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.290
 lightweight 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.970
 an extremely lightweight knife set of all the ways that 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.890
 it's a year at mercedes who tend to make knives to 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.540
 imposing is quite heavy 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.340
 there we are on a very very light product 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.480
 so different shots in this is the most classic learned hammer that 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.700
 team 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940
 and so effective 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.510
 the remote hook 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.510
 a little place it's fly too 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.730
 so a product really someone coming out a product like that it's 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.560
 someone who wants to secure the perimeter 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.280
 it's a novel anyway a product and I repeat it again typically for 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.600
 the fight in c 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 there is nothing else to do with it 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.300
 extremely extremely effective 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.250
 so it's a knife you can find also in the movie that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.250
 you may have already seen the punisher 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.040
 so this is a knife counts my behavior in the film in a 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.970
 percent action scene at the end of the movie 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.290
 for 100 euros black clothes against the others 3 5 series 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.290
 to talk about it at hamas 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.049
 a source 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.049
 no music 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.169
