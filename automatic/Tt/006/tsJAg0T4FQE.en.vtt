00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 comes a wildlife photographer 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.109
 had a meeting if you want scary 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.349
 with a polar bear when wanting to enter 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.110
 too much in his inhospitable world all the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.379
 scene was captured on video for the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.180
 delight of the public 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.060
 she tries to see if she can enter with 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.490
 the legs or biting this is a 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.810
 very close encounter with a polar bear 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.760
 of 450 kilos of weight and a stature of 2 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.550
 meters and a half 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.460
 I can feel it pushing all this weight 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.489
 the wildlife photographer of the bbc 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.649
 gordon buchanan was the arctic of norway 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 to photograph a family of bears 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.620
 polar but came closer than it 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.620
 I had planned 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.390
 is getting closer and closer my god is huge 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.120
 gordon is within what he calls 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.520
 your ice cube your version of a cage 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.610
 to protect itself from sharks but it 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.040
 protects only with his cameras is karen 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.110
 information future broches she collects 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.020
 information before approaching as 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.300
 when it stalks a seal and smells more 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.540
 strong at the weakest point of the cage 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.180
 the door with the claw raised the bear 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.420
 try to destroy the box for about 40 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.420
 minutes 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.909
 being so close I have an appreciation 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.340
 of what the animal really is 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.890
 mighty of the planet one of the animals 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.700
 more intimidating that really looks at us 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.700
 I eat food 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:43.340
 a food that the bear is determined 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:45.920
 to achieve he can smell me and he was a 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.700
 I find that buchanan was lucky in 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.159
 survive we saw was one of the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.679
 most spooky experiences that I've 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.599
 had intentionally but that 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.599
 it was really worth it 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.869
 it was a strange mixture of terror and 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:06.159
 comedy because I felt it was a 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.560
 stupid to try but it was amazing 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.560
