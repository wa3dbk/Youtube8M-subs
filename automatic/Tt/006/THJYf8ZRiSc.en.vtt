00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.300
 welcome to motor campsites today share about this ie 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.089
 did the ijssel columns fc utrecht 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.659
 it is one of the few 240 brain tumor solutions 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.450
 yes I already had a large part, certainly not at the government 240 expo 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:37.720
 wooden hessing 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.080
 he defends 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.670
 how often 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.230
 western source the stunt against fc lisse dances and the v60 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.430
 but this question does it concern the stentor 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.130
 according to insiders give between 60 and 120 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.179
 in other words, this actually still has the most traffic collision board 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.980
 where do you think that 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.680
 it is the spaciousness more a black box although the engine itself it is strange 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.000
 this is a nice trump to put my guests proudly on the role of lampard 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.520
 the design is sleek and looks good 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.950
 so do large windmills that the company wants to get even deeper into it than they do 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.020
 normal 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.240
 the design of the screen 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.790
 they want very nice although I have to say that the LED lighting afterwards but 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.180
 a bit unnecessary 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.800
 but well thought out is a gold-edged afterwards with which you 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800
 can move easily so far with howard york 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.970
 a merger or my screen wide 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.140
 and so on rg 24 21 23 and then something from the via gladiola 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.390
 demands measures that increase the margin of the division of May 29, 2008 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.870
 or the standard holla the resolution 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.520
 because they are behind the debts 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.000
 win like a display port the beesie connection and ali i 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.110
 this means that we think you can connect outside of your PC like I do 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.980
 just stood a bit 4 with an american 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.500
 In addition, there are also some extras to sit at a given moment was still 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.979
 but in the end 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.160
 and certainly not a single good 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.750
 because he predicts that almost all of them don't give in the winter 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.340
 placed 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.649
 but for clarity it's not a television it's a second engine 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.670
 would be a fairly easy one anyway 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.050
 if it doesn't work well either but when i made up my motorcycle accident and 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.500
 so 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.849
 then it was the same again 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.620
 in the positive sense 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.049
 holy shit what he gives tired by sharp image 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.290
 the team and the subsequent period in which the grant is for a part 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.180
 was sharper 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.439
 the colors go peter voser 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.649
 and this, of course, is also not forgotten 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:38.610
 mountain village in front of a motorcycle gang in Eindhoven will be decisive 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.400
 the computers and are the singers and dancers if you want 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.310
 there was a cleaning lady on there are also a number of people 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.000
 be optimized for a certain idea 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.240
 two requests from all kinds of expensive cars have become gray 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.589
 the 240 hertz is also activated here 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:01.379
 and so theirs the next day and it is then customary to continue for it 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.809
 who can see the work 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.139
 Finally, it also became a web page setting that requires the Facebook profile 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.449
 optimizing, but as with the most expensive city, this one also 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.739
 just all if only wishing 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.669
 study the 22 Herzog 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.339
 but what people also do not finish summer a basic benghazi 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.939
 but he has come up with such a solution for being a trainer under black 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:24.909
 stain placed 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.349
 This ensures that you keep sharp and the flexibility 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.819
 then they do not have to be afraid of it and to start flying lies down 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:32.419
 look 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.050
 because if those where the angry citizens who work 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.910
 nothing is going on yet, for example you can get intercepted 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.670
 really only come along but if you want to be active motor you see 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.610
 A number of details in this you normally don't look like one 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.910
 number of bullets that go around that I am not going to do a few to look forward to it 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.969
 example of 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.290
 because when the attention was drawn on the bobbin it was incredibly sharp 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.369
 it seemed that for the game platform 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.839
 I had my legs were much more depth 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:05.030
 In addition, there is also room for other lorries to convince the monitor 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.309
 the club always seems the same to me 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:11.189
 sharing with this out is like going to ajax show at the local 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.040
 community 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.019
 it will probably come through but they come 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.340
 the price tag stuck to this they are actually meant for stool 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.229
 because they must try 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.509
 and also assistance 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.310
 4 that there are no hdmi in a baby room 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.180
 no in the second room a strip on the other side 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.139
 and it is fun being held what to me 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.260
 but there are little say you should do a better gaming experience 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.500
 however, they do this
