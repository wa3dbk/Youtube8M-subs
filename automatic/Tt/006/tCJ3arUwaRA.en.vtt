00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.060
 is today 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.619
 our activity is with a pet bottle because we have to take care of the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800
 environment and no plays around 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.020
 grandson and the secretary 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.370
 It's our worst activity today. 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.159

 here I have already separated I had an abortion I have already used the entire contents of the testimony 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.990
 It's because of the fact that the little bottle has made a 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.479
 Tokyo 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:57.789
 it will be the mouth 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.000
 I'm going to make a splash. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.519
 it is said that the shakhtar's mouth can be trash 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.090
 take the marks if you get a mark if you can take out 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.770
 a cloth with the option 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.150

 the whole region since I go there 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.519
 with the 16 year old thrush here 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.239
 I'm cutting 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.839

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:57.879

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.169
 the same performance I did 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.079
 Diana

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.679
 the hole is not the mouth I made in the bottle pet there 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.959
 so here's why cutting it right 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.519
 There will not be this block here 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.569

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.409
 Your body is passing glue here. 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.749
