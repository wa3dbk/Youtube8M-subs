00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.210
 we are here doing style 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.180
 lamb is rather 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.649
 I counted what 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.609
 I understand three people 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.759
 in fact I understand that I cut English 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.789
 and well some people are surprised that you can follow it with this text 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.279
 and yes you can what happens is that the thread 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.409
 what results 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:29.519
 It is quite rough because the subject is not easy with the peeling quite successful 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.590
 so I've never seen them use it to make clothes 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.399
 but can be used to be accessory or for others 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.250
 other things 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.190
 and the truth for the people that like this 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.390
 by the way is that you can reach the human being as a challenge 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.090
 interesting 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.130
 I have achieved and the hair shed after 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.630
 soaking 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.690
 pretty hard percent would choose someone else cleaners 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.080
 From home 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.690
 I'm not going to say exactly what it is because those mixtures angels have 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.030
 fulfilled be responsible for in no death 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.049
 but good I want that with that maybe you can even be otherwise 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.530
 is that the overnight 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.270
 by the way to the notice 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.410
 by chile it seems to me that problem for the human aspect 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.380
 very slippery equipment 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.920
 and that a kid that the dogs join when I spoke 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.390
 when you do not 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.260
 and the pillar 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.700
 Yes together 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.980
 prevents them from sticking but now 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.980
 if you pay attention 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.250
 there are also 2 sep 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.480
 uboldi cent are a little minutes 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.400
 slippery as I said 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.960
 baic that I'm doing it with a use of it 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.390
 who himself 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.039
 is made with a stick 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.110
 a hook 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.310
 I put a copper weight on that copper wire and I did it with my mom 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 with a cover 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.670
