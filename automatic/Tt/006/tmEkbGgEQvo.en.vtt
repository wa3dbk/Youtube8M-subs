00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:26.630
 I got caught up in what health I believe 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.630
 after 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.010
 we put every economy ires 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.000
 no if not man hours 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 now dear to us suisse 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.010
 Yup 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.130
 in the kitchen 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.240
 him and from tomorrow 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.430
 I 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.650
 the gang guys and welcome to this 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.010
 new gameplay sung hwan kim fed locum 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.340
 dell this time we are still in one 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.500
 very important important clash 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.050
 but we come to us we come to the speech 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.630
 where to treat it in this commentary 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.310
 I wanted to talk mainly about the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.720
 obviously of how many you are doing 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.370
 first comment a pc maybe from paul 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.170
 I will invent the next ones 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.450
 other absurd speeches, however, this time 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.710
 I want to talk about the soul itself 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.680
 manga ANIA that the video game 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.010
 of the one piece anime I wanted 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.680
 talk about the drawing and so many of you two o 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.970
 three people so 23 people are me 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.250
 they sent a private message on 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.410
 youtube telling me and I'm staying 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.310
 bad because one piece lately 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.290
 drawn badly 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.000
 watching the latest one piece episodes 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.780
 with facebook men for the set was 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.310
 an 8 many times many times not 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.590
 always because there are maybe some 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.140
 I saw really fantastic but many 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.730
 times in eight of the imperfections in the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.340
 meaning that drawings on facts really do not 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.320
 badly they changed the structure a 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.209
 hungry kind of design it seems that 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.620
 all the team I followed one 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.120
 piece from the beginning that I am now 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.950
 even throwing out on television the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.350
 rhymes bet the wonkies that I follow 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.200
 but always too short, Italian 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.959
 on italy2 even apple trees could 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.519
 begin at 88 and a half 188 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.519
 reach eight in the evening anyway 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.519
 letting the speeches and I notice 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.209
 really a change there is also a 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.890
 blind would see this change 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.200
 from the first 100 bet episodes to 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.940
 this part borsato twisted the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.560
 drawing the way to draw the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.750
 there are also good differences in the 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.970
 meaning that now there are sixteen noni that 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.160
 makes her beautiful dirty figure in the sense 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.830
 than to see a cardboard shing to everything 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.690
 3d lcd led plasma tv screen 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.940
 what you have or see how i 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.860
 old gloves alone I cut on four thirds 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.500
 that is, those black bands in part were not 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.120
 nice stuff 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.220
 is another thing I noticed let's say 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.190
 pro to this new kind of design 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.770
 are the colors are much more vivid than 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.860
 confidence in the seats are more cared for more 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.170
 shiny and make you enter the soul e 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.250
 But it just really is not fair 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.840
 fact that they changed completely 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.760
 the way of drawing of one piece 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.980
 guys, try it if you don't believe it 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.830
 go on google images practically 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.950
 he writes the one piece for example 2004 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:40.320
 2005 the top bet 30 40 50 100 so e 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.510
 download an image of zoro nami and 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.720
 sanji etcetera of anger and so on 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.660
 Street 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.500
 and then go always write the one piece 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.580
 let's put it 550 as a bet is downloaded 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.020
 an image of the same protagonist 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.570
 on the computer 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.980
 you will notice guys that there is a change 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.140
 abysmal in the drawings ie I do not say that 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.450
 his illness as well as in naruto ho 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.670
 noticed that in the Pompeii clash 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.920
 there were drawings made of shit that is 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.959
 it's not that nintendo but they were made with 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.360
 I believe a new pci program that is 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.239
 to make animations ultra-defined 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.250
 fast ones where type without vinaria 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.260
 did miller happen etc. 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.700
 etc. and I noticed that mine too 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.600
 cousin is noted as pointed out 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.430
 he to me that in an animation was face 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.290
 it will depend on store dias and was no longer fine 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.450
 there was only one hole in the middle was a 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.370
 drawing error but that animation 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.830
 they used with the computer to make him do it 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.150
 neither superfiga moves etcetera etc. has 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.770
 destroyed that piece 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.810
 according to me go to see the 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.840
 episode of it seems to me that it is the one where 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.750
 naruto turns into a fox against 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.700
 do you think I know the number but compared to a 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.500
 see and you will see that I am right 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.880
 anyway boys too 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.200
 gameplay ends with let me know 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.510
 you too and if you have noticed this 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.040
 changes a good piece and naruto too 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.419
 I'll do the Russian I have to say I hear them 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.260
 always better only in those two three 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.060
 episodes that is that smearing but lte 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.740
 abysmal, serious, so guys, I repeat myself 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.150
 let me know in the comments what it is 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.370
 also think of the design of one 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.260
 served pieces there was more before or now 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.360
 if you noticed if it makes them written 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.919
 for the squares simat to fan ass why or 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.729
 of one piece even if it is not true because 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.500
 I love it 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.780
 however let know guys and 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.240
 we see that next gameplay of 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.900
 one piece that moved bye guys a 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.900

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.199
 vv 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:44.839
 correct we believe single-dose truth is that 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:44.839
 I don't know how or ask to mark start 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:56.900
 further upstream 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:06:00.020
 why you teach the devastating since 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:07.910
 nomad street and then never do business 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:09.980
