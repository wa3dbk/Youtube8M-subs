00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.880
 last part of the dc and eventually on 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.460
 the roof in front of the pvp dealer of the horde 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.539
 what happens next yes in the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.760
 following you see the duel completely 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.470
 in full length and of course learn 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.240
 Answer as well as the winner 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.189
 faded in and yes the winner gets 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.750
 of course, the code sent in the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.360
 run the week congratulations 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.430
 At table and we will continue right away 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.610
 with the next question of what happens 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.610
 next 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.170
 you look completely in the sense of the addons of 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.720
 week is also about pack 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.060
 Fighting is a fight with the fight 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.640
 in my thorn cock whip with the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.130
 view of ixia and the brevity of the anubis 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.880
 Now the question is what's happening in 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.979
 this duel against the dk, first of all, me 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.070
 wins the duel 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.080
 2 d dk wins the duel or third 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.619
 The tks are so annoyed that he's the duel 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.270
 leaves prematurely or fourth I am 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.149
 The duel got so annoyed prematurely 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.770
 leave the right answer needed 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.240
 me only to write in the comments and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.780
 then you will find out next week if 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.190
 you were right or not 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.960
 Well and this time there is no gewoba 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.929
 because who has seen my effects video 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.360
 I know the blizzard itemshop 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.429
 more or less will avoid in 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.050
 future Bavarian simply not 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.019
 wants to support more the whole 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.970
 development of wow and that's why 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.530
 we give the whole now without giving 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.940
 away but I think it goes in anyway 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.670
 order and in that sense I wish 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.500
 you much fun have fun while rates in 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.570
 appreciate and we see and who we are 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.850
 Unfortunately, a video is already over 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.500

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.280
