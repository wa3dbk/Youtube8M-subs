 we'll meet them in a moment thanks to julien the sales manager 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
 he takes us behind the scenes of the wl 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.480
 ranking the grapefruit stage 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.860
 with 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530
 the foam 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.640
 Australian 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.830
 the australian chain made in brazil 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.750
 with special requests with forms of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.610

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.500
 nv is the rocker 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.170
 heaps of hastiness with them exotic wood-sized colors 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.750
 so laurent Ã§a it's really the hall spine of the board 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.440
 however, he was also good 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.440
 the team that manufacture and quality of france 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.600
 there we will tell them that he had a little bit wet 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 but it's the only one we have a numerically controlled machine 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.080
 so after my worries 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.240
 because to take out four boards a day ufolep from this machine she realizes 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.799
 impressionistic from the understaffing of the client 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.500
 entered a computer 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.510
 Grapefruit is not recommended at 70% and then passes into the hands of 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.510
 sector 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.090
 you are fleeing the rails of the march 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.399
 reach 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.549
 how to get by on the other hand 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.519
 simply by aof 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.509
 difficulties in finding one 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.930
 because at the time it was not easy at all surprised to see 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.929
 popular than a maintenance in the 80s 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 so I started very little in the first round 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.759
 at the age of 15 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:30.360
 I continued slowly 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.299
 and it really became a snowball effect 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.209
 it is important and about fifty boards the year 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.699
 around 16 17 years old 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.949
 I'm going to have some college 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.539
 until we decide 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.669
 finally supported by parents 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.369

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.369
 professional to live 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.809
 fourteen years after the beginning more w she became a felipe teacher 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.759
 their parents with a motto each piece is unique hence the importance of 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.319
 next workshop 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.319
 the murderer of the ice deposits 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.049
 post 6 i'm a little every night 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.730
 debate on the decline the people no longer want to impose on the people 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.619
 from the eurozone seized postscanada that 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:24.099
 we will see program below they have degraded 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.429
 Besides, I'm from 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.669
 Do you know 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:30.999
 what have you tried 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:33.119
 george w according to m 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:34.989
 however it seems to me 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.519
 in the industry the consumption of cosmetics having 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.319
 bank accounts in his own name 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.319
 for those who are of course more expensive but it's like in the past 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.659
 quite different or even the signature of the simple signature of 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:50.369
 the artist 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.069
 it's too bad surprises 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.869
 of the g20 in cannes south of France 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.649
 That's the one I'm going to leave from hidden objects by 210 votes in California 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:02.029
 this framework the features like that it reinforces his fate of 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.379
 cooperatives exchanges of know-how 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.769
 and we have ideas and it's clear 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.439
 from all the countries where 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.250
 who come to the tulip 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.239
 once a year for me to do what's called 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.579
 I took these dogs 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.060
 and she just did 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.060
 some boards 50 hundred boards 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.699
 prompt to some people 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.629
 So we just ordered a billboard per share 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.449
 news channels 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.860
 the master carpenter 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.360
 Turkish autebert w9 launched an art gallery next to the plate 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.749
 showcase of culture 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.639
 good plan the siesta 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.030
 in the next step really the quilanese stratification have protected 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.030
 by a dumpling she will copy it from the surfboard 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.069
 to all the stars selling it's going to be out angry 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.809
 the canoe without making any hurt by not putting too much dream either and 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:56.249
 it's like a club 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.590
 all were received the week the total weight of the board 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.710
 the final resistance of the board 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.120
 ea 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 and with its history 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.650
 that's how more works wl of nine employees in one atmosphere 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.419
 relaxed 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.360
 the other craft business the Cardinal brothers did not imagine getting there 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.550
 but the worry is managed calmly their job is above all a passion 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.349
 who goes back before their birth 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.309
 it's the pr it's a plan that fits in percent 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:45.149
 year-end complaining late 70s 18 70 6% and so quickly 

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:48.330
 I tried on his island and on the coast 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.740
 the coast of Charente so here it is practice and in the Ile de Re 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.119
 he met our mother who to worry now he is 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:59.219
 obvious that tonight on the beach and that france kind world came after 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.710
 and eto'o immediately and encourage every summer to go to the beach yesterday 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.569
 afternoon but his surfing advance and so is it since tiny little ones 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.009
 cubes nevertheless the surf virus 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.189
 the patient zero whoever is at the origin of the virus here it is jean-pierre 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.969
 the dad 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:18.139
 who often comes to see his fistons in color to give a hand 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.539
 here and there or that the remedies for the workshop to be nickel 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.039
 in short, it's a little soul of the w she besides he has his totem in the 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.650
 shop his first surfboard 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.900
 we took the party in fac 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.839
 we left with his surfboard 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.900
 with the advanced that the questions that are said to be happy 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.569
 yes the surf and where he dies in college 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.439
 we quickly understood the difficulty 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:44.409
 of course that interested me Tuesday's bombing 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.499
 well 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:50.419
 He graduated from the Fine Arts in Bordeaux and his brother needed 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:51.039
 landmarks 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:53.139
 and who comes to work with me 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.599
 and that's how they created their business 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.319
 I did not think he got there 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.889
 that would be good I'm very happy for them 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.300
 it's a lot of work 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.300
 but it's interesting because 

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:10.899
 they are part of the forgotten people who go to work by following 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.149
 so 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:15.509
 it's quite rare 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.509
 and it's good 

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:22.830
 the wsj 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.599
 although a shadow on the board 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:26.469
 more time to surf
