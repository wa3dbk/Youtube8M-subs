00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
art really emphasizes that like cap is

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.830 
art really emphasizes that like cap is
now<00:02:34.170> kind<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.849> mangy<00:02:35.849> looking<00:02:36.239> with<00:02:36.450> his<00:02:36.480> long

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
now kind of mangy looking with his long

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.170 
now kind of mangy looking with his long
hair<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.620> bruises<00:02:38.280> everywhere<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.940> he's

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
hair and bruises everywhere and he's

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.830

just<00:02:39.420> dirty<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.459> it's<00:02:41.459> not<00:02:41.640> just<00:02:42.000> physically

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
just dirty and it's not just physically

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.530 
just dirty and it's not just physically
I<00:02:43.020> think<00:02:43.050> it's<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.770> psychological<00:02:44.700> toll<00:02:45.270> as

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
I think it's a psychological toll as

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.080 
I think it's a psychological toll as
well<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.250> where<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.850> real

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
well and this is where the real

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.199 
well and this is where the real
distinction<00:02:48.959> between<00:02:49.319> caps<00:02:50.250> father<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.970> cap

America strong but at the same time cap
remains<00:03:37.350> an<00:03:37.739> idealist<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:39.329> issue<00:03:39.660> where

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
remains an idealist in this issue where

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.680 
remains an idealist in this issue where
cap<00:03:40.440> saves<00:03:41.190> one<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.609> frocks<00:03:41.880> from<00:03:42.150> being

cap saves one of the frocks from being

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.520 
cap saves one of the frocks from being
boiled<00:03:43.079> alive<00:03:43.350> for<00:03:44.040> their<00:03:44.280> DNA<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.530> he

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
boiled alive for their DNA and he

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.500 
boiled alive for their DNA and he
basically<00:03:46.709> risks<00:03:47.250> everything<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.329> this

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
basically risks everything to do this

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.840 
basically risks everything to do this
but<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.410> works<00:03:49.650> out<00:03:49.920> for<00:03:50.100> him<00:03:50.190> because<00:03:50.640> that's

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
but it works out for him because that's

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.660 
but it works out for him because that's
what<00:03:51.120> turns<00:03:51.390> jet<00:03:51.660> black<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.049> side<00:03:52.370> so<00:03:53.370> you

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
what turns jet black to the side so you

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.490 
what turns jet black to the side so you
know<00:03:53.760> paid<00:03:53.970> off<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.450> think<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.780> good<00:03:54.930> guy<00:03:55.109> paid

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
know paid off I think a good guy paid

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.500 
know paid off I think a good guy paid
off<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.920> did<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.459> thought<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:57.030> entire

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
off it did but I thought that entire

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.280 
off it did but I thought that entire
change<00:03:57.989> in<00:03:58.650> her<00:03:59.370> demeanor<00:03:59.549> was<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.570> quick<00:04:00.840> like

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
change in her demeanor was so quick like

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.590 
change in her demeanor was so quick like
she<00:04:01.530> grew<00:04:01.920> up<00:04:02.100> look<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.549> dominated<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.390> think

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
she grew up look that dominated I think

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.550 
she grew up look that dominated I think
she<00:04:03.690> was<00:04:03.780> already<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.140> fence<00:04:04.380> because

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
she was already on the fence because

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.069 
she was already on the fence because
earlier<00:04:05.160> cap<00:04:05.940> had<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.239> opportunity<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.870> kill

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
earlier cap had the opportunity to kill

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.580 
earlier cap had the opportunity to kill
her<00:04:07.290> but<00:04:07.709> didn't<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.569> still<00:04:09.569> think<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.109> was<00:04:10.290> too

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
her but didn't I still think it was too

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.199 
her but didn't I still think it was too
quick<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.130> change<00:04:11.400> even<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:11.940> scene

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
quick of a change even in this scene

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.630 
quick of a change even in this scene
right<00:04:12.450> before<00:04:12.510> he<00:04:13.019> jumps<00:04:13.440> she's<00:04:13.799> against<00:04:14.459> him

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
right before he jumps she's against him

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.360 
right before he jumps she's against him
and<00:04:14.819> then<00:04:15.390> he<00:04:16.320> jumps<00:04:16.709> down<00:04:16.890> then<00:04:17.190> he's

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and then he jumps down then he's

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.360 
and then he jumps down then he's
basically<00:04:17.700> at<00:04:18.000> her<00:04:18.690> mercy<00:04:19.320> he<00:04:19.919> could<00:04:20.280> do

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
basically at her mercy he could do

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.450 
basically at her mercy he could do
anything<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.299> she's<00:04:22.109> like<00:04:22.260> all<00:04:22.440> right<00:04:22.500> you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
anything and she's like all right you

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.120 
anything and she's like all right you
know<00:04:23.780> Father<00:04:24.780> forgive<00:04:25.110> me<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.590> he<00:04:25.650> pulls<00:04:25.919> him

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
know Father forgive me and he pulls him

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.629 
know Father forgive me and he pulls him
up<00:04:26.250> I<00:04:26.520> just<00:04:27.479> felt<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.870> was<00:04:27.900> too<00:04:28.110> quick<00:04:28.490> she<00:04:29.490> does

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
up I just felt it was too quick she does

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.730 
up I just felt it was too quick she does
talk<00:04:29.940> about<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.330> upcoming<00:04:30.539> invasion<00:04:31.320> of

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
talk about the upcoming invasion of

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.010 
talk about the upcoming invasion of
Earth<00:04:31.979> though<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.580> how<00:04:32.940> Zola<00:04:33.330> is<00:04:33.600> gonna<00:04:33.840> like

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
Earth though and how Zola is gonna like

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.200 
Earth though and how Zola is gonna like
spread<00:04:34.350> its<00:04:34.470> influence<00:04:34.590> there<00:04:35.190> using<00:04:35.909> his

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
spread its influence there using his

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.230 
spread its influence there using his
mutate<00:04:36.690> army<00:04:37.280> do<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.370> think<00:04:38.550> ian<00:04:38.820> is<00:04:39.000> gonna

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
mutate army do you think ian is gonna

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.340 
mutate army do you think ian is gonna
survive<00:04:39.539> to<00:04:39.720> that<00:04:39.870> point

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
survive to that point

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.470 
survive to that point
I<00:04:40.440> think<00:04:41.040> Ian<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.640> gonna<00:04:41.910> survive<00:04:42.270> I<00:04:42.330> think

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
I think Ian is gonna survive I think

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.390 
I think Ian is gonna survive I think
Captain<00:04:43.050> America<00:04:43.560> has<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.740> greater<00:04:44.040> chance<00:04:44.280> for

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
Captain America has a greater chance for

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.300 
Captain America has a greater chance for
not<00:04:44.610> surviving<00:04:45.180> no<00:04:46.140> there's<00:04:46.710> no<00:04:46.830> like<00:04:46.980> Captain

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
not surviving no there's no like Captain

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.100 
not surviving no there's no like Captain
America<00:04:47.340> dies<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:48.180> don't<00:04:48.390> I<00:04:48.750> don't<00:04:48.870> know<00:04:49.020> if

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
America dies I don't I don't know if

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.070 
America dies I don't I don't know if
he's<00:04:49.230> gonna<00:04:49.380> die<00:04:49.890> I<00:04:49.950> would<00:04:50.880> say<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.420> Ian

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
he's gonna die I would say that Ian

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.790 
he's gonna die I would say that Ian
might<00:04:52.410> have<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.770> take<00:04:52.980> him<00:04:53.190> back<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.460> earth<00:04:54.800> to

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
might have to take him back to earth to

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.450 
might have to take him back to earth to
save<00:04:56.010> him

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
save him

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.240 
save him
type<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:57.510> deal<00:04:57.720> like<00:04:58.020> cap<00:04:58.260> it's<00:04:58.740> gonna<00:04:58.890> reach<00:04:59.130> a

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
type a deal like cap it's gonna reach a

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.040 
type a deal like cap it's gonna reach a
point<00:04:59.460> where<00:04:59.760> he<00:04:59.940> just<00:04:59.970> can't<00:05:00.360> keep<00:05:00.690> standing

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
point where he just can't keep standing

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.410 
point where he just can't keep standing
up<00:05:01.350> and<00:05:01.560> his<00:05:02.100> son<00:05:02.430> is<00:05:02.610> gonna<00:05:02.760> have<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.030> stand<00:05:03.270> up

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
up and his son is gonna have to stand up

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.990 
up and his son is gonna have to stand up
for<00:05:03.690> him<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:04.200> was<00:05:04.830> also<00:05:04.980> kind<00:05:05.100> of<00:05:05.220> thinking<00:05:05.490> this

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
for him I was also kind of thinking this

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.850 
for him I was also kind of thinking this
could<00:05:06.180> all<00:05:06.270> just<00:05:06.450> be<00:05:06.540> like<00:05:06.810> a<00:05:06.990> simulation

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
could all just be like a simulation

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.680 
could all just be like a simulation
because<00:05:08.460> when<00:05:08.670> cap<00:05:08.940> first<00:05:09.240> goes<00:05:09.480> in<00:05:09.600> a

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
because when cap first goes in a

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.080 
because when cap first goes in a
dimension<00:05:10.080> Z<00:05:10.290> Zola<00:05:11.100> hasn't<00:05:11.430> like<00:05:11.550> hooked<00:05:11.910> up

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
dimension Z Zola hasn't like hooked up

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.040 
dimension Z Zola hasn't like hooked up
to<00:05:12.330> this<00:05:12.590> experimental<00:05:13.590> chair<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:15.450> this<00:05:15.870> could

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
to this experimental chair so this could

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.480 
to this experimental chair so this could
all<00:05:16.140> be<00:05:16.290> in<00:05:16.350> his<00:05:16.440> head<00:05:16.620> which<00:05:17.130> I<00:05:17.250> guess<00:05:17.400> would

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
all be in his head which I guess would

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.860 
all be in his head which I guess would
be<00:05:17.520> kind<00:05:17.730> of<00:05:17.790> a<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.360> reader<00:05:18.540> but

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
be kind of a you to the reader but

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.070 
be kind of a you to the reader but
I<00:05:18.900> guess<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:20.190> point<00:05:20.940> of<00:05:21.180> that<00:05:21.300> would<00:05:21.510> be<00:05:21.570> to

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
I guess the point of that would be to

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.380 
I guess the point of that would be to
show<00:05:22.440> Captain<00:05:22.980> America<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.400> he<00:05:23.490> is<00:05:23.610> lost<00:05:23.850> if

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
show Captain America that he is lost if

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.490 
show Captain America that he is lost if
in<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.810> next<00:05:24.960> issue

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
in the next issue

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.500 
in the next issue
Ian<00:05:25.800> goes<00:05:26.100> through<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.670> just<00:05:26.700> demolishes

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
Ian goes through and just demolishes

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.060 
Ian goes through and just demolishes
Captain<00:05:27.900> America<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.560> basically<00:05:28.860> just

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
Captain America and basically just

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.940 
Captain America and basically just
breaks<00:05:29.340> his<00:05:29.550> spirit<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.170> I<00:05:31.170> guess<00:05:31.350> then<00:05:31.560> Zola

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
breaks his spirit and I guess then Zola

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.710 
breaks his spirit and I guess then Zola
wins<00:05:32.220> so<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.850> grade<00:05:33.030> for<00:05:33.210> Captain<00:05:33.480> America

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
wins so the grade for Captain America

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.230 
wins so the grade for Captain America
number<00:05:33.810> 7<00:05:34.410> well<00:05:34.650> if<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:34.860> give<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.130> I'd<00:05:36.000> give

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
number 7 well if you give it I'd give

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.620 
number 7 well if you give it I'd give
this<00:05:36.390> issue<00:05:36.630> a<00:05:36.920> 3.5<00:05:37.920> out<00:05:38.190> of<00:05:38.250> 5<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.940> would<00:05:39.510> have

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
this issue a 3.5 out of 5 I would have

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.150 
this issue a 3.5 out of 5 I would have
given<00:05:39.780> it<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.170> higher<00:05:40.410> grade<00:05:40.740> because<00:05:40.950> I'm

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
given it a higher grade because I'm

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.010 
given it a higher grade because I'm
really<00:05:41.400> enjoying<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.820> story<00:05:42.090> but<00:05:42.480> I<00:05:42.540> did<00:05:42.810> feel

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
really enjoying the story but I did feel

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.300 
really enjoying the story but I did feel
that<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:44.430> jet<00:05:44.700> scene<00:05:44.970> was<00:05:45.210> a<00:05:45.440> corny<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.650> B
