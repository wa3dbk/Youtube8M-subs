00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 hello everyone I'm critical 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.740
 and today I bring you believe that it consists of harry potter let's start 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.019
 JK Rowling is famous for his saga of Harry Potter books 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.089
 but she did not plan to make the movies but she herself needed a 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.560
 budget to be able to earn a living 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.259
 JK Rowling hates Harry Potter movies but not his book as he says that 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:21.869
 your book 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.489
 is what most hide their magic the movie is just an image 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:27.069
 negative of it 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.999
 in the final book of Harry Potter 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.839
 JK Rowling falls into a defensive hole 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.440
 for finishing his famous saga 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.540
 that lasted 1 generation of fame 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.970
 she did not know what to do she used drugs to calm down she could not 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.540
 she was transferred to a psychological restoration center 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.100
 I'm one of those who took her to that place 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.809
 when we were carrying it, I was writing something 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.820
 I looked and approached the title of that book I put in classic letters of 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:53.740
 Harry Potter 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.200
 harry potter the last scar 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.820
 I am a fan of Harry Potter and I took the manuscript and saved it in my 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.250
 pocket 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.420
 I told my home after putting it in isolation 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.000
 I sat on my bedside table 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.490
 and I started reading 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.790
 it was all the time 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640
 ten pages only 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.500
 and they started like this 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.950
 Harry was talking to his children 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.659
 about the death of their parents 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.900
 telling him the most horrible details 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.210
 frightening them 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.950
 fendi enters the place and it fell to Harry saying that that does not detract 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.830
 Perry tells him he does not care, they say in the search 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.840
 parry starts looking at a picture of him 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.210
 with rum and hermione 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.010
 and began to shed tears in the photo 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.140
 walking jarry is walking down the street of the wizards empty 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.370
 if you meet the mirror of wishes 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.840
 Harry looks at himself and his parents are there 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.890
 Jarry throws himself in the mirror and cries 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.350
 cries and cries for hours 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.610
 and never happens someone to stop him 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.890
 as if he were alone in the world 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.280
 because he looks in the mirror 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.250
 after the goal 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.940
 more deformed as in its first form behind the head of the first 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.760
 black magic teacher 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.000
 and I said in the language of the snakes something that arrime the shoulder to understand 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.270
 while causing your staff 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.589
 he wakes up in azkaban with three mentors touching his whole body 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.259
 then call appears and says 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:15.099
 that is the lesson above 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.929
 kill your whole family with luck to that 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.459
 a point of agreement where they attack jarrio 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.430
 Jarry cries out in pain the Dementors touch him and he will carry the memories more 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.509
 dark of harry 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.879
 telling him to fix I know where his parents are 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.609
 repeating that in your head for hours until you arrive rita where they are 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.719
 exclaiming a lot 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.629
 from here the letter has a red tint 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.180
 because it does not support more 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.360
 and begins to bite the bars trying to get his blood spilled by 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.479
 mouth but can not do it 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.069
 the dementors well in the rice in the mind 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.659
 that reneging her deceased family 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.109

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.870
 other dishes is harry looking at rum and the mallorquin also dead 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.299
 but it was not that they were dead from guns 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.459
 they were dead without showing disgusting features 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.009
 Barry does not understand 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:10.339

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.929
 nothing happens apart 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.239
 parry snatches the rod of the world 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.539
 and it is pointed 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.839
 the Dementors come back to him 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.559
 the previous images that the river always saw the same 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.899
 harris smiling macabrely next to voldemort 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:28.499

 Harry then points his mother say 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.219
 the text disappeared 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.789
 as if jk rowling was missing the end 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.839
 I ran to see her so she could tell me the end 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:52.889
 she told me something they spoke a weird language I did not understand 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.909
 so he wrote on the wall 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.079
 some ellipses 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.779
 and then this word 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.979

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.019
 the doctors came and they said that her body is suffering she said one of 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.829
 the three forbidden successes 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.819
 and stopped to convulse 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:23.110
 she sat 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.379
 and looked at the moon 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.379

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.000
