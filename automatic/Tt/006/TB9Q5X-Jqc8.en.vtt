00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.810 
we're and be looking at my computer mom
so<00:00:07.020> we<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.929> msi<00:00:12.769> g65<00:00:13.769> gaming<00:00:14.639> motherboard

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
so we have a msi g65 gaming motherboard

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
so we have a msi g65 gaming motherboard
is<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.509> 1150<00:00:16.410> socket<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> processor

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
is a 1150 socket and for the processor

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.519 
is a 1150 socket and for the processor
we<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.410> AI<00:00:19.710> five<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.750> 4670k<00:00:21.750> at<00:00:22.140> five

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
we have AI five of 4670k at five

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.330 
we have AI five of 4670k at five
gigahertz<00:00:23.810> for<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> money<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.769> really<00:00:26.099> can't

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
gigahertz for the money you really can't

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.120 
gigahertz for the money you really can't
beat<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:27.080> advi--<00:00:28.080> gigahertz<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.800> scored

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
beat this advi-- gigahertz it's scored

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.520 
beat this advi-- gigahertz it's scored
better<00:00:30.090> than<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:31.369> 4770k<00:00:33.170> about<00:00:34.170> forty<00:00:34.469> percent

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
better than a 4770k about forty percent

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.030 
better than a 4770k about forty percent
faster<00:00:35.040> than<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> stock<00:00:35.870> 4770k<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> mean<00:00:37.890> even

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
faster than a stock 4770k so I mean even

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.540 
faster than a stock 4770k so I mean even
if<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> overclock<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> 4770k<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:40.680> four

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
if you overclock the 4770k to about four

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.520 
if you overclock the 4770k to about four
four<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.510> half<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.780> hurt<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.200> still

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
four and a half get hurt it's still

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
four and a half get hurt it's still
going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.829> pretty<00:00:44.219> close<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
going to be pretty close so for a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.060 
going to be pretty close so for a
hundred<00:00:46.050> dollars<00:00:46.320> less<00:00:46.559> that's<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.010> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
hundred dollars less that's what I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.430 
hundred dollars less that's what I
decided<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> go<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.809> bad<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
decided to go for it's not that bad and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.869 
decided to go for it's not that bad and
for<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.120> memory<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.949> crucial

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
for the the memory we have the crucial

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.020 
for the the memory we have the crucial
ballistix<00:00:54.180> sport<00:00:55.250> these<00:00:56.250> are<00:00:56.399> 24<00:00:56.850> hundred

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030

ballistix sport these are 24 hundred
megahertz<00:00:57.480> um<00:00:58.760> they<00:00:59.760> run<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.329> well<00:01:00.949> these

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
megahertz um they run pretty well these

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.149 
megahertz um they run pretty well these
are<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:02.510> eight<00:01:03.510> gig<00:01:03.840> modules<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.559> they're<00:01:04.739> 16

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
are two eight gig modules so they're 16

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.510 
are two eight gig modules so they're 16
gigs<00:01:05.400> total<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.260> did<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.640> got<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:10.189> custom<00:01:11.189> most

you can see with the bridge these are

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.080 
you can see with the bridge these are
actually<00:01:51.780> together<00:01:52.049> better<00:01:52.649> than<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:53.130> 780<00:01:53.729> or<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
actually together better than a 780 or a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.260 
actually together better than a 780 or a
titan<00:01:55.399> by<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> decent<00:01:56.850> amount<00:01:56.939> maybe

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
titan by a decent amount maybe

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.980 
titan by a decent amount maybe
twenty-five<00:01:57.719> thirty<00:01:57.899> percent<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:59.990> they're

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
twenty-five thirty percent and they're

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
twenty-five thirty percent and they're
about<00:02:01.380> five<00:02:01.710> hundred<00:02:01.920> dollars<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.579> pair<00:02:03.119> so

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
about five hundred dollars for pair so

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
about five hundred dollars for pair so
you<00:02:03.570> can't<00:02:03.780> really<00:02:04.430> can't<00:02:05.430> really<00:02:05.579> beat<00:02:05.729> that

base<00:02:35.420> do<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.170> kind<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:36.980> do<00:02:37.100> this<00:02:37.250> mod<00:02:37.490> I'm

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
base do you kind of do this mod I'm

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.850 
base do you kind of do this mod I'm
going<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.390> eventually<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:39.260> doing<00:02:39.650> a

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
going to eventually be doing a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.160 
going to eventually be doing a
water-cooling<00:02:40.670> full<00:02:41.480> water<00:02:41.750> cooling<00:02:42.020> loop

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
water-cooling full water cooling loop

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.229 
water-cooling full water cooling loop
except<00:02:42.680> for<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.860> video<00:02:43.069> card<00:02:43.280> because<00:02:43.670> no<00:02:44.090> one

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
except for the video card because no one

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.390 
except for the video card because no one
makes<00:02:44.420> video<00:02:44.720> card<00:02:44.989> loop<00:02:45.230> para<00:02:45.500> blocks<00:02:46.190> for

makes video card loop para blocks for

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.090 
makes video card loop para blocks for
these<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.900> shame<00:02:48.610> anyway<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.050> guess<00:02:51.440> that's

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
these the shame anyway so I guess that's

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.009 
these the shame anyway so I guess that's
taken<00:02:52.670> care<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.300> we're<00:02:53.570> going<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.750> go<00:02:53.810> look

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
taken care of so we're going to go look

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.370 
taken care of so we're going to go look
at<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.230> case<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> half<00:02:55.640> 9-12<00:02:56.600> case<00:02:56.930> made

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
at the case it is a half 9-12 case made

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.120 
at the case it is a half 9-12 case made
by<00:02:57.500> Cooler<00:02:57.739> Master<00:02:58.239> it's<00:02:59.239> an<00:02:59.420> alright<00:02:59.630> case<00:03:00.140> it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
by Cooler Master it's an alright case it

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.600 
by Cooler Master it's an alright case it
could<00:03:01.280> be<00:03:01.430> better<00:03:02.410> it's<00:03:03.410> kind<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.830> flimsy<00:03:04.160> I

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
could be better it's kind of flimsy I

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.729 
could be better it's kind of flimsy I
mean<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.300> probably<00:03:05.690> due<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.170> fact<00:03:06.320> i<00:03:06.530> took

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
mean it's probably due the fact i took

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.140 
mean it's probably due the fact i took
out<00:03:06.890> some<00:03:07.489> of<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.640> structural<00:03:08.030> integrity

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
out some of the structural integrity

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.550 
out some of the structural integrity
from<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.110> hard<00:03:09.500> drive<00:03:09.590> cage<00:03:10.120> but<00:03:11.380> what<00:03:12.380> can

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
from the hard drive cage but what can

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.949 
from the hard drive cage but what can
you<00:03:12.650> do<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:13.010> does<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.220> job<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.730> that's<00:03:14.660> all<00:03:14.930> that

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
you do it does a job and that's all that

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.720 
you do it does a job and that's all that
matters<00:03:15.320> so<00:03:15.739> now<00:03:16.130> we're<00:03:16.310> going<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.489> be<00:03:16.580> moving

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
matters so now we're going to be moving

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.500 
matters so now we're going to be moving
on<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.720> monitor<00:03:18.670> yes<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.880> can<00:03:20.000> see<00:03:20.209> I'm
