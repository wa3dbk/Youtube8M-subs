really not that bad the only thing that

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.520 
really not that bad the only thing that
you<00:04:04.190> know<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.790> wish<00:04:05.090> they<00:04:05.330> had<00:04:05.510> on<00:04:05.720> them<00:04:05.930> was<00:04:06.290> I

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
you know I wish they had on them was I

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.740 
you know I wish they had on them was I
wish<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.010> arms<00:04:07.370> went<00:04:07.640> down<00:04:07.910> instead<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.510> their

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
wish the arms went down instead of their

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.140 
wish the arms went down instead of their
bending<00:04:08.990> like<00:04:09.320> that<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:09.860> mean<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.550> legs<00:04:10.790> bend

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
bending like that I mean the legs bend

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.890 
bending like that I mean the legs bend
but<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:11.480> wish<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.840> arms<00:04:12.140> would<00:04:12.260> bend<00:04:12.470> as<00:04:12.680> well

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
but I wish the arms would bend as well

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.730 
but I wish the arms would bend as well
because<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.140> way<00:04:15.290> they'd<00:04:15.530> be<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.650> little

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
because of that way they'd be a little

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.759 
because of that way they'd be a little
bit<00:04:15.950> more<00:04:16.100> flexible<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:17.570> play<00:04:17.870> with<00:04:18.140> instead

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
bit more flexible to play with instead

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.550 
bit more flexible to play with instead
