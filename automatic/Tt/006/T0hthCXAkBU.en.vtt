00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.680
 You with the passing of time. 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.470
 So I'll talk a little bit like 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.810
 Pass the blush further along the video 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.609
 I just started to control myself 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.769
 I have a lighting contour video 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.359
 everything else but if it was a thing I 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.230
 I like to pass the point. 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.300
 before the blush and then I do not have 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.160
 doubt of order I wanted to leave 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.350
 Of course you come in, I'm only from 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.690
 contour goes until it was kind of strange to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.670
 strange just to pass base the contour 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.460
 bad boy came back did not think i stayed there 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.710
 need a little one and I even prefer 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.809
 talking to you know that I'm with the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.059
 bad voice as you can see playing 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.460
 Throat closes all the time, I'm fine. 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.309
 aching but it 's bad so I'll keep 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.800
 supercell grandmas just for you 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.230
 then how to pass blush I will use this 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.210
 middle of the mac is the one that will give you 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.920
 you will see 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.080
 but he has that tone that get 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 money has a sparkling it is very 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.470
 beautiful that she brought to me from 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 and travel is the following is blush and has no 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.030
 too much mystery or anything legal to approach 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.070
 that for us has no doubt if any 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.250
 a certain type of blush for 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.320
 each face format and only this to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 I'm a little confused for example all 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.830
 look at that face business I 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.130
 I can not find you, let's go 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.450
 round on your face is oval I never know 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.790
 sometimes I think he's more oval but 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.950
 I never know and I discovered that there is a 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.450
 universal way of blush and is the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.280
 that I'll show you there on the blog 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.670
 I'll leave it right if this little table 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.770
 in the table that is the illustration that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.290
 various kinds of blush various kinds of 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.680
 blush formats for each face tones 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.229
 blush for each face but so is not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.390
 there is a certain thing, for example if 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.460
 You 're white, you can not use it. 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.040
 bush 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.450
 anyway you can not wear a blush she does not 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.270
 there is a rule 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.479
 What's going to get better for you? 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.740
 but does not mean that if you spend a 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.179
 tone that does not 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.550
 tati indicating that it will not be legal 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.730
 understood in the makeup there vacations 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.640
 environment there are modifications then 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.500
 I never know where the person you just goes from. 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.290
 pass away that way no 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.910
 You experienced that, then I'll go. 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 tell you what I use 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.290
 I use this beat here that is the fiber 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.750
 this is 18 7 is to be that he is from 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.750
 replica of mac he has this cut 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.519
 so that part of him the black is 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.450
 of natural bristles and this issue of 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.000
 synthetic 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.920
 this brush actually works for the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.829
 base food to leave the skin more 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.680
 velvety, you know just how I told you before 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.690
 You guys I have things that Moscow is 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.700
 here it is proven but I use down 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.459
 there are things I use for other 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.810
 purposes that I think fit 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.610
 It's better for me that I adapt better. 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.130
 so I pass the rabbit blush I 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.959
 I think he gives a more beautiful call. 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.480
 one more blush brush actually is 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.720
 this one that it 's like it's where dust 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.760
 lower op where poor people give this one here 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.100
 is the little one blush this acquisition 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.290
 the blackhawks kit I do so the handle 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.030
 a little 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.769
 I always hit the product because it 's like I already 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.519
 I told you, you better add 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:28.410
 the product that you then have to take out and 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:31.019
 alone and I do as soon as I did I already 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.549
 I got to my face so I did not 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:38.730
 so to do so I already brought him 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.010
 so it is as if I have only from afar and 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.400
 I already brought the always do not concentrate 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.780
 nowhere on my face 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.489
 I'm using this boldness 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.069
 money orange now but you can 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.700
 use boldness can use anything and 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.669
 the following is the blush it is so here 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.590
 top of the apples and I bring it here for 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:04.380
 my them and now will think 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.709
 the blush what is the function of blush function 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.460
 blush is to return the natural robot from the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.560
 skin that people 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.830
 when we spend more when the 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.090
 people passes basis we give the universe a 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.000
 fully uniformed the other then the people 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.480
 takes everything to the natural robot that is 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.190
 blush and where is our natural love is 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.280
 on the cheek had thought that 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.400
 little gonzaguinha is push then the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.740
 blush is here you have to be very careful 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.630
 because the bass is not here 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.880
 This is not a warlock here. 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.820
 contour or bronze 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.240
 so if you want to wear a bronze one 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.340
 blush in case any bronze color in the bush 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.900
 but it is so dangerous 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.700
 Then you can come here to give 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.730
 depth in the field but imagine only 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.610
 You come with good rosy here already stopped. 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.920
 to think how lucky this train would be 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.520
 so the bush 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.340
 the natural flush of the face is here the people 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.190
 have to return to the base took the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.670
 blush is yes here is where we stay 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.250
 used here or in participating in the 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.220
 depth is a bronze is a blush 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.830
 intense tone disagreed as much as speaking 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.260
 so just think 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.920
 The chubby one is here so this is where I 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.840
 I do things and this way that is the way 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.350
 universal form is the way that 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.420
 face round face I created on the face the same 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.160
 I do not know until now what is bad taste 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.390
 I do not know if it 's oval I do not know if it's 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.030
 round I do not know then he only came 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.460
 so if you do not always find yourself 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.360
 so try to beat the product coming here 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.070
 why this because you lived a lot 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.820
 product you no longer put here 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.790
 direct 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.430
 he's concentrated here , you guys like 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:57.240
 but the ideal would be that a hole in the 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.520
 You half know this is a little place on the ground. 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.760
 and do so 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.530
 but here is you smile is the apple top 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:11.350
 and you are dragging there 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:15.490
 This is his place and then you 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.890
 so sure, this is it, I hope you do not have 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.220
 cast doubts there on the blog I'll leave 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.470
 the illustration will leave the shades of blush 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.310
 which are most suitable for each tone of 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.560
 skin 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.470
 but that's what I said proper is not 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.290
 forbidden if you like one and today I 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.670
 I'm white for me and it 's indicated to use 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.340
 pink blush 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:39.370
 Yes, I think it's right for me. 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:44.410
 blushes you cook using boats and 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.950
 yes but I'm not so fan of using in 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.410
 me 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.180
 bush so i even use it but when 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.370
 some for ours today I want to raze 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.920
 it's not these bonuses that my body I go 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.800
 put a and Maria Garden or by a mistake I 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.970
 I love this earthy blush brush here 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.680
 taste 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.220
 although this one is used by mary 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.450
 kay stay until snow already everything I will not 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.670
 knowing how to say the name now we'll have 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.220
 everything good everything I showed here but there 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.050
 on the blog of the little boy buchinho without saying that 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:16.090
 he is accused but he has a 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.770
 shimmer a golden aspect then he 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.870
 will also serve as a zen-illuminator 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.180
 know it's not promotion to call the world but 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.180
 it gives an illuminator brightness 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.870
 So he's the blush that's beautiful to me. 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.220
 that I 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.050
 although I did not like plastic so much 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.940
 I used this one here I like this is it for me 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.220
 is indicated by the rose but I still 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.170
 I prefer the earthy ones and I will not go 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.320
 hold a convention if I can not 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.790
 understood then we have to use the 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.910
 we like to think we 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.710
 People are but there on the blog will give all 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:49.230
 information in case you are not sure 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.230
 This is a kiss and hug, bye
