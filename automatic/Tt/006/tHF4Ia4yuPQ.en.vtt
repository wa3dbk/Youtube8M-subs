00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.390
 that type of collars goes to the solar 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.769
 the subject that is made if the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.289
 gauze and combined also with other fabrics 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:56.760
 and many dresses another summer if 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.739
 you also have the shirt 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.809
 that can also be replaced in 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.030
 muslin we have in knit fabrics 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.309
 that will be defined more by their mats 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.280
 past the good point I'll leave you 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.650
 places 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.900
 Well, what if it's a pleasure for me? 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.340
 to be here as I always tell you and let's go 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.930
 to start the road I was a little bit with 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.640
 the mold are going to have to have this 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.810
 mold that you like that you like how 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.400
 they are left in terms of detail but 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.110
 We are working with flat fabrics I have 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.300
 in mind this you are going to need to leave 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.040
 the margins plus the seam allowance 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.050
 so have amplitude that we do not have 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.420
 so tight because they are a head of 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.009
 gaza we will not be very good cloth 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.450
 of points indicate of the double this 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.040
 It corresponds to the back and I'll go 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.810
 showing all the pieces so that it 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.540
 located in more or less can raise the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.310
 yoke or not because if it costs them 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.679
 then you can leave them without yoke that 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.520
 be whole being patterned gauze a lot 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.560
 you will not notice 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.149
 I have here the yoke piece this 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.679
 corresponds to the back this is what 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.030
 He will come to the front by 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.340
 course will be longer range 'in 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.800
 his back that the forward have the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.509
 front piece that we are going to add is 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.759
 exactly the sides and the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.770
 long the length can leave it veto or in 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.630
 this rounded shape and if you 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.330
 you can see I have added what we are going 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.130
 to use for the postman in the doubles 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.479
 for the mailman and they have to have in 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.250
 also counts the centimeters that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.300
 you need to cross this 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.120
 shirt like that 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.890
 that I need more sleeves sleeves 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.600
 they are very simple like a model always 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.760
 so that you do not get scared then without pressure 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.970
 and wason costs me so much they move 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.320
 fabrics do not be afraid if you start with 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.900
 easier models like in this case 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.120
 here we have a very simple appointment not 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.280
 excavated is not that it's not that they need 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.460
 without having that exact sleeve for that appointment 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.040
 look how simple the cuffs are 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.930
 a simple rectangle that we bend and 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.030
 look, we sew sleeve cuffs 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.340
 very simple and as for the neck 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.470
 also that they get so complicated that they 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.270
 scared I made them simple line of 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.240
 dots indicates double cloth we're going to do 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.830
 excluding one piece this is what 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.600
 I'm going to fold and I'll be left with this 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.820
 way the neck of these with seams 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.380
 we mark what is good skin and neck 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.690
 let's start with the armed and go to 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.940
 notice that it's simple I 'll tell you again 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.190
 if you find many pieces they do 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.110
 this time you have won in a whole piece 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.550
 they will be very nice 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.640
 let's start I'll leave this in 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.230
 I already started working 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.700
 so what did I do with 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.830
 straight seam of course he 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.989
 to the back piece like you 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.760
 can give when they work with the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.500
 flat need to have the iron at 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.970
 side always be a seam and then 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.680
 we're going to have to go to the plate like that 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.550
 to work a neat way 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.620
 straight seam to one centimeter have in 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.890
 account are working with very fabrics 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.739
 thin need fine needles and threads 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.300
 fine then let's sew a 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.580
 centimeter of grassi let's go 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.110
 Towards our Hannover sewing machine 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.940
 so you can see the your 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.340
 sharpened in terms of its sharpening it 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.170
 they always ask me how is the subtle 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.349

 machine to join fabrics simply what 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.459
 what they should do is loosen cited two 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.709
 points as much the tension of the thread of the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.959
 needles in this case we have two needles 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.400
 but if you have one the attention of one of 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.560
 the needles 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.709

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.360
 that's how all of these will work 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.190
 I already have my back and now what 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.860

 mailman we are not working with fabrics 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.570
 thin is advisable to be something 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.430
 narrow 22 centimeters and a half yes to 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.800
