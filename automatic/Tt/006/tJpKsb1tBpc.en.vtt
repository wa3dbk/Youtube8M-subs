eventually<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.200> at<00:04:56.560> one<00:04:56.770> point<00:04:56.800> I<00:04:57.250> figured

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
eventually and at one point I figured

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.190 
eventually and at one point I figured
out<00:04:57.730> he<00:04:58.150> wouldn't<00:04:58.450> really<00:04:58.840> be<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.170> best

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
out he wouldn't really be the best

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.650 
out he wouldn't really be the best
player<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.710> play<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:00.580> would<00:05:00.940> I<00:05:01.120> would<00:05:01.420> take

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
player to play and I would I would take

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.080 
player to play and I would I would take
a<00:05:01.690> coward<00:05:02.170> out<00:05:02.320> again<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.710> was<00:05:02.890> just<00:05:03.160> testing

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
a coward out again I was just testing

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.060 
a coward out again I was just testing
things<00:05:04.330> out<00:05:04.570> seeing<00:05:05.020> our<00:05:05.170> might<00:05:05.560> be<00:05:05.800> able<00:05:05.920> to

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
things out seeing our might be able to

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.030 
things out seeing our might be able to
line<00:05:06.370> my<00:05:06.610> squad<00:05:07.000> up<00:05:07.150> but<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.390> I<00:05:07.780> never<00:05:08.110> really

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
line my squad up but I I never really

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.310 
line my squad up but I I never really
figure<00:05:09.400> out<00:05:09.430> how<00:05:09.760> exactly<00:05:10.090> I<00:05:10.570> wanted<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:11.020> play

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
figure out how exactly I wanted to play

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.350 
figure out how exactly I wanted to play
it<00:05:11.590> took<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.890> quite<00:05:12.220> a<00:05:12.250> while<00:05:12.490> as<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:12.790> said<00:05:13.150> and

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
it took a quite a while as I said and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.570 
it took a quite a while as I said and
you're<00:05:14.140> just<00:05:14.320> swapping<00:05:14.650> players<00:05:15.100> around<00:05:15.370> here

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
you're just swapping players around here

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.120 
you're just swapping players around here
trying<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.150> find<00:05:16.420> a<00:05:16.600> lineup<00:05:16.810> I<00:05:17.170> thought<00:05:18.100> I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
trying to find a lineup I thought I

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.790 
trying to find a lineup I thought I
might<00:05:18.460> be<00:05:18.670> able<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:19.180> win<00:05:19.570> me<00:05:19.720> my<00:05:19.900> first<00:05:20.290> group

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
might be able to win me my first group

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.760 
might be able to win me my first group
stage<00:05:20.830> game<00:05:21.700> so<00:05:22.420> yeah<00:05:22.990> I<00:05:23.020> should<00:05:23.350> see<00:05:23.500> I<00:05:23.530> just

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
stage game so yeah I should see I just

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.080 
stage game so yeah I should see I just
did<00:05:23.890> a<00:05:23.920> lot<00:05:24.040> of<00:05:24.160> players<00:05:24.370> going<00:05:24.670> back<00:05:24.910> and

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
did a lot of players going back and

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.210 
did a lot of players going back and
forth<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.510> eventually<00:05:25.960> we<00:05:26.110> do<00:05:26.350> get<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.800> Asian

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
forth and eventually we do get the Asian

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.520 
forth and eventually we do get the Asian
players<00:05:27.520> out<00:05:27.790> we'll<00:05:28.390> get<00:05:28.510> you<00:05:28.750> tuck<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.320> in

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
players out we'll get you tuck it in

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.370 
players out we'll get you tuck it in
here<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:30.040> there<00:05:30.460> we<00:05:30.580> go<00:05:30.730> with<00:05:30.910> a<00:05:30.970> bit<00:05:31.150> of<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.380> bit

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
here and there we go with a bit of a bit

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.110 
here and there we go with a bit of a bit
of<00:05:32.470> an<00:05:32.560> F<00:05:32.800> we<00:05:33.010> can<00:05:33.250> attack<00:05:33.610> we<00:05:33.790> still<00:05:34.000> have

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
of an F we can attack we still have

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.550 
of an F we can attack we still have
Eddie<00:05:34.330> Johnson<00:05:34.900> in<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.170> then<00:05:35.260> a<00:05:35.350> few

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
Eddie Johnson in and then a few

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.160 
Eddie Johnson in and then a few
Europeans<00:05:36.190> in<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.460> defense<00:05:37.270> so<00:05:37.900> that<00:05:38.050> was

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
Europeans in the defense so that was

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.780 
Europeans in the defense so that was
pretty<00:05:38.440> much<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.770> squad<00:05:39.070> in<00:05:39.250> there<00:05:39.550> not

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
pretty much the squad in there not

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.550 
pretty much the squad in there not
exactly<00:05:40.390> the<00:05:40.540> best<00:05:40.690> chemistry<00:05:41.290> but

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
exactly the best chemistry but

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.680 
exactly the best chemistry but
eventually<00:05:41.860> we<00:05:42.130> go<00:05:42.280> into<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.610> game<00:05:42.940> I<00:05:43.210> would

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
eventually we go into a game I would

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.300 
eventually we go into a game I would
come<00:05:43.870> up<00:05:43.990> against<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.410> hundred<00:05:44.770> chemistry

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
come up against a hundred chemistry

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.610 
come up against a hundred chemistry
Europeans<00:05:45.940> I<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.570> yeah<00:05:46.750> my<00:05:46.900> first<00:05:47.170> chance<00:05:47.470> in

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
Europeans I and yeah my first chance in

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.500 
Europeans I and yeah my first chance in
the<00:05:47.740> second<00:05:48.190> minute<00:05:48.370> suit<00:05:48.670> occur<00:05:48.940> on<00:05:49.300> the

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
the second minute suit occur on the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.630 
the second minute suit occur on the
polio<00:05:49.990> and<00:05:50.230> there<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:50.950> go<00:05:51.190> down<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.490> wing

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
polio and there you go down the wing

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.700 
polio and there you go down the wing
stop<00:05:51.940> up<00:05:52.090> would<00:05:52.270> affect<00:05:52.600> so<00:05:52.810> play<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.410> a<00:05:53.440> die

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
stop up would affect so play to a die

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.920 
stop up would affect so play to a die
who<00:05:53.770> finds<00:05:54.250> Johnson<00:05:54.880> we<00:05:55.000> take<00:05:55.270> this<00:05:55.480> shot<00:05:55.750> and

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
who finds Johnson we take this shot and

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.170 
who finds Johnson we take this shot and
on<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.170> rebound<00:05:56.380> we're<00:05:56.770> lucky<00:05:57.070> enough<00:05:57.220> to

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
on the rebound we're lucky enough to

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.450 
on the rebound we're lucky enough to
bring<00:05:58.420> ourselves<00:05:58.600> over<00:05:59.470> one<00:05:59.710> nil<00:06:00.040> so<00:06:00.220> it<00:06:00.280> could

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
bring ourselves over one nil so it could

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.830 
bring ourselves over one nil so it could
start<00:06:00.700> through<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.030> game<00:06:01.210> we're<00:06:01.390> on<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:01.630> ball

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
start through the game we're on the ball

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.360 
start through the game we're on the ball
again<00:06:02.080> I<00:06:02.200> die<00:06:02.410> with<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:02.650> nice<00:06:02.890> little<00:06:03.070> fake

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
again I die with a nice little fake

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.550 
again I die with a nice little fake
shall<00:06:03.640> we<00:06:03.730> go<00:06:03.940> past<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.480> fender<00:06:04.840> very<00:06:05.140> lucky

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
we're into the second half where you'll

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.270 
we're into the second half where you'll
truss<00:06:28.030> it<00:06:28.270> in<00:06:28.450> and<00:06:28.720> we'll<00:06:29.650> of<00:06:29.740> course<00:06:29.770> can<00:06:30.250> see

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
truss it in and we'll of course can see
