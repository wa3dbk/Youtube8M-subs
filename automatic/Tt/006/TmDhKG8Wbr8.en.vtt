whatever you're using you see there

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.340 
whatever you're using you see there

4.8<00:00:40.350> sorry<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> now<00:00:41.430> I'm<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.879> get

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
4.8 sorry and now I'm just going to get

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.150 
4.8 sorry and now I'm just going to get
out<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:42.930> ten<00:00:43.410> pound<00:00:43.710> units<00:00:44.010> see

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
out of it with ten pound units see

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.650 
out of it with ten pound units see
that's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.430> lot<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.640> money<00:00:44.940> there<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> lay<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that's a lot of money there to lay the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.450 
that's a lot of money there to lay the
horse<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.200> price<00:00:46.469> should<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.770> pushing<00:00:47.160> up

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
horse so this price should be pushing up

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.700 
horse so this price should be pushing up
and<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.789> pushes<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.480> we're<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and as it pushes up we're just going to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.439 
and as it pushes up we're just going to
put<00:00:49.950> these<00:00:50.129> little<00:00:50.370> drip<00:00:50.700> feed<00:00:50.940> bets<00:00:51.210> in

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
put these little drip feed bets in

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.880 
put these little drip feed bets in
because<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.930> don't<00:00:52.079> want<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> big<00:00:52.710> bet

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
because we don't want to put a big bet

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.670 
because we don't want to put a big bet
in<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.250> scare<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> market<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.469> force<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
in to scare the market and force the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
in to scare the market and force the
price<00:00:55.890> back<00:00:56.160> down<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.030> already

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
price back down you see it's already

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.560 
price back down you see it's already
moved<00:00:57.629> from<00:00:57.899> 4.8<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.219> six<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.420> we're<00:01:00.539> just

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
moved from 4.8 out to six so we're just

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.900 
moved from 4.8 out to six so we're just
putting<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.109> ten<00:01:01.440> pounds<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.010> time<00:01:02.039> not

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
putting in ten pounds at a time not

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.509 
putting in ten pounds at a time not
spooking<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> market<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.199> hopefully<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
spooking the market and hopefully the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.550 
spooking the market and hopefully the
layers<00:01:05.760> keep<00:01:06.119> driving<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.840> giving<00:01:07.170> us<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
layers keep driving and up giving us a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.940 
layers keep driving and up giving us a
better<00:01:07.830> average<00:01:08.130> price<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.500> goes<00:01:10.680> up

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
better average price so as it goes up

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.070 
better average price so as it goes up
we're<00:01:11.430> laying<00:01:11.640> higher<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> higher<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.750> we

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
we're laying higher and higher and we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.760 
we're laying higher and higher and we
get<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> better<00:01:14.070> average<00:01:14.610> price<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.659> go<00:01:15.869> so

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
get a better average price as we go so

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.679 
get a better average price as we go so
up<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> six<00:01:17.280> point<00:01:17.580> two<00:01:17.820> now<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.420> see

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
up to six point two now and you can see

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.730 
up to six point two now and you can see
by<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> matchsticks<00:01:20.990> on<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.200> left<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
by the matchsticks on the left of the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160 
by the matchsticks on the left of the
horse<00:01:22.950> which<00:01:23.820> way<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> price<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
horse which way the price is going and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.020 
horse which way the price is going and
therefore<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.830> levels<00:01:26.250> out<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.729> when<00:01:26.939> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
therefore when it levels out and when it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760 
therefore when it levels out and when it
comes<00:01:27.210> back<00:01:27.509> down<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:28.619> it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
comes back down you can see now it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.190 
comes back down you can see now it
started<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> hit<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.579> top<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.450> leveling<00:01:30.990> out

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
started to hit the top it's leveling out

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
started to hit the top it's leveling out
it's<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.880> any<00:01:33.119> higher

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's not going to really go any higher

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.030 
it's not going to really go any higher
than<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.960> still<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> great<00:01:34.350> move<00:01:34.710> from

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
than this it's still a great move from

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.840 
than this it's still a great move from
4.8<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.360> 6.8<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> comes<00:01:38.610> back

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
4.8 out to 6.8 and then as it comes back

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.090 
4.8 out to 6.8 and then as it comes back
down<00:01:39.090> we'll<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.990> close<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.470> position<00:01:40.950> out

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
down we'll just close the position out

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.630 
down we'll just close the position out
and<00:01:41.340> that'll<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.700> us<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:43.159> final<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.520> at

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and that'll be us so final one there at

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.969 
and that'll be us so final one there at
6.2<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> market<00:01:46.049> turned<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.530> cancel

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
6.2 is the market turned will cancel

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.100
