00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:41.819 
together and I think when you get them
together<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:40.780> get<00:00:40.840> a<00:00:40.900> large<00:00:41.140> portion<00:00:41.590> of

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
together you get a large portion of

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.260 
together you get a large portion of
those<00:00:41.949> people<00:00:42.190> who<00:00:42.460> are<00:00:42.489> actually<00:00:42.879> discussing

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
those people who are actually discussing

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.240 
those people who are actually discussing

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
things that are real too many things

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.150 
things that are real too many things
that<00:00:45.309> are<00:00:45.400> issues<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.850> me<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.680> Bane<00:00:47.920> has

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
that are issues to me and it's Bane has

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160

no<00:00:48.339> history<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:49.030> young<00:00:49.420> people<00:00:49.839> actually

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
no history of young people actually

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.350 
no history of young people actually
making<00:00:50.559> a<00:00:50.769> difference<00:00:50.800> so<00:00:51.610> it's<00:00:52.000> kind<00:00:52.210> of<00:00:52.239> nice

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
making a difference so it's kind of nice

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.480 
making a difference so it's kind of nice
to<00:00:52.420> see<00:00:52.720> that<00:00:52.750> lead<00:00:53.110> over<00:00:53.230> in<00:00:53.559> this<00:00:53.620> country

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490

what they believe in and people talking
about<00:00:59.380> things<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.770> are<00:00:59.890> very<00:01:00.100> close<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.910> them

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
about things that are very close to them

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.900 
about things that are very close to them
look<00:01:01.210> at<00:01:01.300> something<00:01:01.650> music<00:01:02.650> opens<00:01:03.460> that<00:01:03.640> up<00:01:03.670> at

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
look at something music opens that up at

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.850 
look at something music opens that up at
somebody's<00:01:04.750> an<00:01:05.050> environment<00:01:05.650> where<00:01:05.740> they're

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
somebody's an environment where they're

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.330 
somebody's an environment where they're
with<00:01:06.010> people<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.430> they<00:01:06.910> feel<00:01:06.940> similar<00:01:07.540> to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
with people that they feel similar to

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.980 
with people that they feel similar to
listening<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.180> music<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.720> enjoying

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
listening to music and enjoying

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.420 
listening to music and enjoying
yourselves<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:11.619> think<00:01:11.770> it<00:01:11.830> makes<00:01:11.979> it<00:01:12.070> easy<00:01:12.280> for

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
yourselves I think it makes it easy for

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.609 
yourselves I think it makes it easy for
them<00:01:12.729> as<00:01:12.850> an<00:01:12.970> house<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.450> discuss<00:01:14.380> those<00:01:14.560> things

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
them as an house to discuss those things

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.969 
them as an house to discuss those things
I<00:01:15.159> know<00:01:15.549> this<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.970> not<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:17.229> a<00:01:17.260> festival<00:01:17.560> that's

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
been around a very long time forecastle

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.680 
been around a very long time forecastle
it's<00:01:21.610> something<00:01:21.940> that's<00:01:22.090> kind<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:22.330> grassroots

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
it's something that's kind of grassroots

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.469 
it's something that's kind of grassroots
sort<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.290> thing

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
sort of thing

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
sort of thing
it's<00:01:24.869> turned<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> war<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.950> was<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.220> like

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it's turned out to war it was this like

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.760 
it's turned out to war it was this like
six<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.570> eight<00:01:27.659> years<00:01:27.930> they've<00:01:28.229> guy<00:01:28.380> yeah

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
six or eight years they've guy yeah

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.070 
six or eight years they've guy yeah
somewhere<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.509> starting<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
somewhere and it's really starting to

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.530 
somewhere and it's really starting to
work<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.430> good<00:01:32.610> way<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.180> think

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
work in a really good way I think

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.570 
work in a really good way I think
partially<00:01:34.020> because<00:01:34.350> its<00:01:34.619> downtown<00:01:35.070> because

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
partially because its downtown because

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.270 
partially because its downtown because
it's<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.970> city<00:01:36.210> setting<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it's in a city setting you know and and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.679 
it's in a city setting you know and and
I<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.970> lot<00:01:39.119> more<00:01:39.270> fun<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
I think that's a lot more fun for the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.139 
I think that's a lot more fun for the
artists<00:01:40.229> especially<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.670> crowd<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
artists especially and for the crowd to

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.820 
artists especially and for the crowd to
the<00:01:42.180> first<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.170> don't<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.530> deal<00:01:43.710> with

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
the first you don't have to deal with

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.810 
the first you don't have to deal with
the<00:01:43.890> normal<00:01:44.190> things<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.580> have<00:01:44.789> to<00:01:44.940> do

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
the normal things that you have to do

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.160 
the normal things that you have to do
