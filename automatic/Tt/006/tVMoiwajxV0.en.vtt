00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
this seed and I will I'll write that out

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.150 
this seed and I will I'll write that out
in<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.170> description<00:00:45.200> if<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:45.829> want<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.010> try

in the description if you want to try
this<00:00:46.220> out<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.180> generate<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.810> map<00:00:48.020> use<00:00:48.200> the<00:00:48.320> seed

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
this out so generate a map use the seed

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.740 
this out so generate a map use the seed
and<00:00:48.680> you'll<00:00:48.800> get<00:00:48.950> a<00:00:49.010> dungeon<00:00:49.520> two<00:00:50.390> dungeons

fancy nothing special you know that the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.229 
fancy nothing special you know that the
advantage<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.450> can<00:02:51.690> stack<00:02:51.989> them<00:02:52.200> but

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
advantage is that you can stack them but

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.880 
advantage is that you can stack them but
they<00:02:54.239> heal<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.020> little<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.590> they're<00:02:55.770> not

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
they heal so little that they're not

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.830 
they heal so little that they're not
even<00:02:56.100> really<00:02:56.220> worth<00:02:56.550> taking<00:02:57.360> up<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.570> whole<00:02:57.600> lot
