extensive project with pieces that need
to<00:00:17.570> be<00:00:17.600> quite<00:00:18.020> uniform<00:00:18.410> I<00:00:18.860> really<00:00:19.490> felt<00:00:19.760> the

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
to be quite uniform I really felt the

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.730 
to be quite uniform I really felt the
need<00:00:19.970> to<00:00:20.150> step<00:00:20.690> away<00:00:20.840> from<00:00:20.990> that<00:00:21.289> a<00:00:21.320> little<00:00:21.590> bit

I wanted to go into the studio explore
different<00:00:24.980> materials<00:00:25.539> try<00:00:26.539> some<00:00:26.779> textures

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
different materials try some textures

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.550 
different materials try some textures
really<00:00:27.859> work<00:00:28.160> with<00:00:28.310> bold<00:00:28.670> bright<00:00:28.970> colors<00:00:29.560> just

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
to get away from the stuff that I had

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.340 
to get away from the stuff that I had
been<00:00:33.769> doing<00:00:33.920> for<00:00:34.280> quite<00:00:34.399> a<00:00:34.519> while<00:00:34.749> so<00:00:35.749> the

thing<00:00:36.559> I<00:00:36.649> was<00:00:36.769> most<00:00:36.800> excited<00:00:37.280> about<00:00:37.699> was

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
thing I was most excited about was

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.809 
thing I was most excited about was
trying<00:00:39.019> out<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.409> new<00:00:39.440> pouring<00:00:40.100> medium<00:00:40.460> that

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:40.819 
trying out the new pouring medium that

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:44.049 
trying out the new pouring medium that
was<00:00:41.030> made<00:00:41.269> by<00:00:41.449> liquitex<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.579> fluid<00:00:43.579> medium

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
was made by liquitex so fluid medium

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.539 
was made by liquitex so fluid medium
that<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.569> mix<00:00:44.839> with<00:00:45.079> your<00:00:45.409> paints<00:00:45.889> so<00:00:46.249> you<00:00:46.399> can

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:46.549 
that you mix with your paints so you can

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:48.789 
that you mix with your paints so you can
pour<00:00:47.120> them<00:00:47.389> on<00:00:47.629> top<00:00:47.809> of<00:00:47.929> your<00:00:48.049> panel<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:48.649> the

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
pour them on top of your panel and the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.189 
pour them on top of your panel and the
colors<00:00:49.159> really<00:00:49.309> flow<00:00:49.760> into<00:00:50.089> each<00:00:50.120> other<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.170> I

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
colors really flow into each other so I

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.449

you go this is the medium I was talking
about

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
about

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.479 
about
it's<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:03.079> pouring<00:01:03.589> medium<00:01:03.920> created<00:01:04.369> by

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
it's the pouring medium created by

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.359 
it's the pouring medium created by
liquitex<00:01:05.089> it's<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.689> high<00:01:05.930> gloss<00:01:06.170> fluid<00:01:06.979> medium

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
liquitex it's a high gloss fluid medium

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.389 
liquitex it's a high gloss fluid medium
that<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.380> semi-transparent<00:01:09.380> or<00:01:09.770> whitish<00:01:10.159> when

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
that is semi-transparent or whitish when

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.480 
that is semi-transparent or whitish when
it<00:01:10.520> comes<00:01:10.729> out<00:01:10.969> of<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.180> bottle<00:01:11.479> or<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.740> bucket

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
it comes out of the bottle or the bucket

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.760 
it comes out of the bottle or the bucket
in<00:01:13.609> this<00:01:13.759> case<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.359> it<00:01:15.289> dries<00:01:15.560> completely

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
in this case and it dries completely

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.120 
in this case and it dries completely
clear<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:16.600> use<00:01:17.600> one<00:01:17.899> cup<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.530> medium<00:01:18.890> and

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
clear I use one cup of the medium and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.490 
clear I use one cup of the medium and
mix<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.060> with<00:01:20.149> 1<00:01:20.329> tablespoon<00:01:21.020> of<00:01:21.170> acrylic

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
mix it with 1 tablespoon of acrylic

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.039 
mix it with 1 tablespoon of acrylic
paint<00:01:21.740> I<00:01:21.979> like<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.939> use<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.270> Golan<00:01:23.630> fluid

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
paint I like to use the Golan fluid

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.779 
paint I like to use the Golan fluid
acrylics<00:01:24.469> but<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:24.799> can<00:01:24.920> also<00:01:25.039> use<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.549> stuff

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
acrylics but you can also use the stuff

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.179 
acrylics but you can also use the stuff
body<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.299> just<00:01:26.329> find<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:27.229> fluid<00:01:27.710> acrylics

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
body I just find that the fluid acrylics

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.730 
body I just find that the fluid acrylics
are<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.369> little<00:01:28.579> bit<00:01:28.759> easier<00:01:29.179> to<00:01:29.240> mix<00:01:29.689> once<00:01:30.590> I've

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
are a little bit easier to mix once I've

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.550 
are a little bit easier to mix once I've
mixed<00:01:30.979> them<00:01:31.219> I<00:01:31.340> put<00:01:31.520> them<00:01:31.729> in<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:31.969> squirt<00:01:32.270> bottle

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
mixed them I put them in a squirt bottle

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.109 
mixed them I put them in a squirt bottle
then<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.590> need<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.829> nice<00:01:34.039> prepared<00:01:34.490> surface<00:01:34.759> I

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
then you need a nice prepared surface I

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.819 
then you need a nice prepared surface I
like<00:01:35.299> to<00:01:35.450> work<00:01:35.600> on<00:01:35.749> wood<00:01:36.020> but<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.289> can<00:01:36.469> also<00:01:36.590> do

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
like to work on wood but you can also do

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.139 
like to work on wood but you can also do
it<00:01:36.920> on<00:01:37.009> canvas<00:01:37.219> it<00:01:37.490> doesn't<00:01:37.759> really<00:01:37.909> make<00:01:38.119> a

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
it on canvas it doesn't really make a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.120 
it on canvas it doesn't really make a
difference<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.780> have<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.409> nice<00:01:39.649> variety<00:01:39.920> of

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
difference I have a nice variety of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.099 
difference I have a nice variety of
palette<00:01:40.549> knives<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.999> I<00:01:41.060> used<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:41.509> spread<00:01:41.929> out

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
palette knives that I used to spread out

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.779 
palette knives that I used to spread out
the<00:01:42.289> paints<00:01:42.679> after<00:01:42.950> I've<00:01:43.069> poured<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:43.670> then<00:01:43.759> I

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
the paints after I've poured and then I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.510 
the paints after I've poured and then I
use<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.600> spray<00:01:45.170> bottle<00:01:45.380> with<00:01:45.740> some<00:01:45.920> water<00:01:46.130> as

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
use a spray bottle with some water as

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.739 
use a spray bottle with some water as
well<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.740> when<00:01:48.890> I'm<00:01:49.009> doing<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.700> try<00:01:50.689> to

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
well so when I'm doing this I try to

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.289 
well so when I'm doing this I try to
suspend<00:01:51.140> my<00:01:51.469> panel<00:01:51.890> on<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.579> wood<00:01:52.789> beams<00:01:53.030> which

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
suspend my panel on to wood beams which

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.450 
suspend my panel on to wood beams which
are<00:01:53.420> underneath<00:01:53.929> a<00:01:54.140> piece<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.499> plastic<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.130> want

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
are underneath a piece of plastic I want

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.550 
are underneath a piece of plastic I want
to<00:01:55.579> make<00:01:56.389> sure<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.719> panel<00:01:57.079> touches<00:01:57.439> as

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
to make sure that the panel touches as

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.630 
to make sure that the panel touches as
little<00:01:57.829> surface<00:01:58.189> as<00:01:58.310> possible<00:01:58.490> because<00:01:58.939> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
little surface as possible because the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.310 
little surface as possible because the
and<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.030> paints<00:02:00.330> are<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.720> drip<00:02:00.900> off<00:02:01.080> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and the paints are going to drip off the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.350 
and the paints are going to drip off the
sides<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.920> wherever<00:02:02.400> it's<00:02:02.850> going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.120> touch

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
sides and wherever it's going to touch

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.050 
sides and wherever it's going to touch
the<00:02:03.960> surface<00:02:04.200> where<00:02:04.620> it's<00:02:04.740> lying<00:02:04.980> on<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.790> will

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the surface where it's lying on it will

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.540 
the surface where it's lying on it will
be<00:02:06.300> glued<00:02:06.690> together<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.680> that's<00:02:07.860> also<00:02:08.130> why<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
be glued together so that's also why the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.910 
be glued together so that's also why the
plastic<00:02:09.240> is<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.420> top<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.960> wood<00:02:10.110> because

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
plastic is on top of the wood because

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.980 
plastic is on top of the wood because
otherwise<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.880> it's<00:02:12.060> easier<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.600> pull<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
otherwise like it's easier to pull it

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.870 
otherwise like it's easier to pull it
off<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.380> plastic<00:02:13.860> as<00:02:14.070> opposed<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.760> wood

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
off the plastic as opposed to the wood

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.510 
off the plastic as opposed to the wood
beams<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:15.780> before<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.200> start<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:17.370> want<00:02:17.460> to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
beams now before you start you want to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.890 
beams now before you start you want to
make<00:02:17.580> sure<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.940> your<00:02:18.090> surface<00:02:18.750> is

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
make sure that your surface is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.770 
make sure that your surface is
completely<00:02:19.410> level<00:02:20.000> not<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.570> this

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
completely level not just in this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.470 
completely level not just in this
direction<00:02:21.990> but<00:02:22.620> also<00:02:22.770> in<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.910> direction<00:02:24.390> as

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
direction but also in this direction as

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.840 
direction but also in this direction as
well<00:02:24.740> because<00:02:25.740> what's<00:02:25.950> going<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.250> happen<00:02:26.340> is

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
well because what's going to happen is

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.699 
well because what's going to happen is
that<00:02:26.880> you're<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.720> pour<00:02:27.959> your<00:02:28.020> paint<00:02:28.140> and

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
that you're going to pour your paint and

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.590 
that you're going to pour your paint and
it's<00:02:29.010> going<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.250> spread<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.640> over<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.209> panel

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
it's going to spread out over your panel

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.810 
it's going to spread out over your panel
and<00:02:30.840> if<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.080> panelists<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.740> leaning<00:02:32.250> this

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
and if the panelists like leaning this

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.760 
and if the panelists like leaning this
way<00:02:32.880> then<00:02:33.570> all<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> paint<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.140> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.470> Sag

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
way then all the paint is going to Sag

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.140 
way then all the paint is going to Sag
that<00:02:35.070> way<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.550> there's<00:02:35.670> not<00:02:35.850> going<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> be

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
that way and there's not going to be

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.850 
that way and there's not going to be
anything<00:02:36.570> left<00:02:36.900> once<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.890> dry<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:39.650> level<00:02:40.650> is

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
anything left once it's dry so level is

00:02:40.860 --> 00:03:36.760 
anything left once it's dry so level is
important

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.080 

so<00:03:37.770> this<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.250> what<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.460> piece<00:03:38.610> looks<00:03:38.910> like

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
so this is what the piece looks like

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.330 
so this is what the piece looks like
right<00:03:39.330> now<00:03:39.380> it's<00:03:40.380> been<00:03:40.560> all<00:03:40.680> drive<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.220> I've
