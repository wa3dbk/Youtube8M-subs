00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
glacis then is to make sure that his his

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.800 
glacis then is to make sure that his his
he<00:01:08.400> still<00:01:08.610> has<00:01:08.700> preferences<00:01:08.970> glaces<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.689> our

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
he still has preferences glaces is our

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.719 
he still has preferences glaces is our
long<00:01:09.990> range<00:01:10.140> turkey<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.920> only<00:01:11.010> does<00:01:11.670> he

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
long range turkey so not only does he

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the first yeah so one of the things

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.190 
the first yeah so one of the things
we're<00:01:21.060> doing<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.299> were<00:01:21.390> actually<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.780> tweaking

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
we're doing is were actually be tweaking

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.050 
we're doing is were actually be tweaking
the<00:01:22.350> ranges<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.070> his<00:01:23.220> notes<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.700> give<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the ranges of his notes to give them a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.240 
the ranges of his notes to give them a
wider<00:01:24.270> dispersal<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.080> covering<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:25.920> area

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
wider dispersal and covering more area

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.179 
wider dispersal and covering more area
so<00:01:26.460> even<00:01:26.759> at<00:01:26.909> max<00:01:27.240> range<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.930> east<00:01:28.650> immediate

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
so even at max range of east immediate

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.960 
so even at max range of east immediate
corrective<00:01:34.070> cuz<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.189> didn't<00:01:35.369> want<00:01:35.549> place<00:01:35.790> this

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
corrective cuz we didn't want place this

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.370 
corrective cuz we didn't want place this
is<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.360> character<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.930> even<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.350> you're
