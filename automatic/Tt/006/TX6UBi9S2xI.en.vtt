one<00:01:43.280> once<00:01:44.020> lots<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.200> monsters<00:01:46.000> endless

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000

getting hit by the monster which makes

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.520 
getting hit by the monster which makes
it<00:02:11.280> more<00:02:11.460> difficult<00:02:11.870> but<00:02:12.870> there's<00:02:13.080> not<00:02:13.260> enough
