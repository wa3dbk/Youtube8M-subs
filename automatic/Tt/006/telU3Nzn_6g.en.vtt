noteworthy change in this build are the
improvements<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> Start<00:00:25.920> menu<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.580> you

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
improvements to the Start menu as you

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.820 
improvements to the Start menu as you
can<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.510> Start<00:00:27.779> menu<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.289> finally

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
can see the Start menu is now finally

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.560 
can see the Start menu is now finally
transparent<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.730> now<00:00:29.820> our<00:00:29.970> number<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.359> other

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
transparent and now our number of other

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.939 
transparent and now our number of other
little<00:00:30.779> tweaks<00:00:31.140> done<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.769> make<00:00:31.920> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
little tweaks done to it to make it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.850 
little tweaks done to it to make it
better<00:00:32.550> overall<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.290> there<00:00:34.649> were<00:00:34.739> no

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
better overall so up here there were no

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.040 
better overall so up here there were no
longer<00:00:35.040> any<00:00:35.160> icons<00:00:35.760> next<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> places<00:00:36.600> area

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
longer any icons next to the places area

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.690 
longer any icons next to the places area
and<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.649> makes<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.980> more<00:00:38.040> embedded

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and that just makes it more embedded

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.840 
and that just makes it more embedded
more<00:00:39.180> permanent<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> Start<00:00:40.320> screen<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
more permanent to the Start screen I

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.889 
more permanent to the Start screen I
think<00:00:41.850> that's<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> nice<00:00:42.149> change<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.629> kind<00:00:42.870> of

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
think that's a nice change I kind of

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.180 
think that's a nice change I kind of
like<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.350> does<00:00:43.530> definitely<00:00:43.920> look<00:00:44.010> more

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
like it it does definitely look more

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
like it it does definitely look more
modern<00:00:44.370> also<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> believe<00:00:45.000> hitbox<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
modern also I believe hitbox is a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.400 
modern also I believe hitbox is a
slightly<00:00:46.469> smaller<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:48.329> may<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.809> me<00:00:49.140> but

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
slightly smaller that may just be me but

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.010 
slightly smaller that may just be me but
I<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:51.690> take<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> look

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
I think they are so just take a look

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.810 
I think they are so just take a look
then<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.469> then<00:00:52.949> make<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.280> own<00:00:53.370> judgments<00:00:53.760> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
then and then make your own judgments I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.029 
then and then make your own judgments I
guess<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:54.899> apps<00:00:55.110> button<00:00:55.230> has<00:00:55.739> changed

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
guess the all apps button has changed

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.819 
guess the all apps button has changed
from<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.610> arrow<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.149> list<00:00:57.719> icon<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> guess<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
from an arrow to a list icon I guess and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.639 
from an arrow to a list icon I guess and
here<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.600> apps<00:01:00.870> area<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.320> per<00:01:01.469> usual

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
here is the all apps area as per usual

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
here is the all apps area as per usual
now<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.660> drop

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
now as you can see here there is a drop

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.690 
now as you can see here there is a drop
down<00:01:04.199> arrow<00:01:04.530> next<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.920> folders<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
down arrow next to folders and that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.640 
down arrow next to folders and that
indicates<00:01:05.939> whether<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> Java<00:01:06.840> folder<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
indicates whether the Java folder is a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.140 
indicates whether the Java folder is a
menu<00:01:08.070> I've<00:01:08.280> dropped<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.549> menu<00:01:08.729> which<00:01:08.970> it

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
menu I've dropped that menu which it

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.630 
menu I've dropped that menu which it
usually<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.460> drop<00:01:11.460> down

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
usually is so you can see here drop down

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.039 
usually is so you can see here drop down
menu<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.090> buncha<00:01:12.299> four<00:01:12.479> programs<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
menu with a buncha four programs in it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.660 
menu with a buncha four programs in it
but<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> nasty<00:01:13.979> bug<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.369> build

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
but there's a nasty bug in this build

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.969 
but there's a nasty bug in this build
and<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.140> replicate<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.830> bug

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and if you can replicate this bug

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.120 
and if you can replicate this bug
yourself<00:01:17.509> by<00:01:18.509> simply<00:01:18.930> opening<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
yourself by simply opening up a with the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
yourself by simply opening up a with the
windows<00:01:20.400> accessory<00:01:20.970> folder<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.450> then

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
windows accessory folder and then

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.899 
windows accessory folder and then
closing<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> again

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
closing it again

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.550 
closing it again
the<00:01:23.909> Start<00:01:24.210> menu<00:01:24.450> crashes<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.259> don't<00:01:25.320> know

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the Start menu crashes and I don't know

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.780 
the Start menu crashes and I don't know
why<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.740> believe<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.340> something<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> do

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
why I believe it's got something to do

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.819 
why I believe it's got something to do
of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> amount<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.390> programs<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.439> folder<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
of the amount of programs in a folder I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
of the amount of programs in a folder I
guess<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:29.549> entirely<00:01:29.790> sure<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.570> does

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
guess I'm not entirely sure but it does

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.569 
guess I'm not entirely sure but it does
entirely<00:01:31.350> crash<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.189> takes<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.460> few

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
entirely crash and it takes a few

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.219 
entirely crash and it takes a few
minutes<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> come<00:01:33.150> back<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:34.049> yes

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
minutes to it to come back but yes

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.780 
minutes to it to come back but yes
that's<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> nasty<00:01:35.250> bugs<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.640> this

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that's one of the nasty bugs in this

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
that's one of the nasty bugs in this

down at the bottom your desktops are
numbered<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.770> bill<00:01:55.920> there's<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
numbered now in this bill there's a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.550 
numbered now in this bill there's a
weird<00:01:56.310> bug<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.750> desktops<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.409> not

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
weird bug which the desktops do not

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
why but it's just a bug I guess so again

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.020 
why but it's just a bug I guess so again

this<00:02:10.470> build<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.190> now<00:02:11.780> you

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
this build you can now you

if<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.080> wish<00:02:35.320> but<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.130> think<00:02:36.340> most<00:02:36.520> people<00:02:36.580> are

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
if you wish but I think most people are

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.700 
if you wish but I think most people are
going<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.180> like<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.690> new<00:02:37.900> change<00:02:38.200> done<00:02:38.530> to

going to like this new change done to
toss<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:40.080> furthermore<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.230> finally

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
toss you furthermore you can finally

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.980 
toss you furthermore you can finally
move<00:02:42.220> windows<00:02:42.610> between<00:02:42.850> desktops<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:43.900> I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
move windows between desktops so if I

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.810 
move windows between desktops so if I
move<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.530> file<00:02:44.800> explorer<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.130> desktops<00:02:45.580> 3

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
move this file explorer to desktops 3

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.030 
move this file explorer to desktops 3
you'll<00:02:46.480> see<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.840> pops<00:02:47.080> in<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.290> distil<00:02:47.560> 3<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:47.980> I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
you'll see it pops in to distil 3 and I

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.310 
you'll see it pops in to distil 3 and I
can<00:02:48.190> use<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.550> there<00:02:48.790> as<00:02:48.820> well<00:02:49.209> which<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:50.050> pretty

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
can use it there as well which is pretty

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.090 
can use it there as well which is pretty
cool

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
cool

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.920 
cool
so<00:02:51.430> task<00:02:51.670> view<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:51.940> definitely<00:02:52.360> shaping<00:02:52.690> up<00:02:52.900> to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
so task view is definitely shaping up to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.690 
so task view is definitely shaping up to
be<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.140> great<00:02:53.350> multi<00:02:53.770> desktop<00:02:54.130> tool<00:02:54.370> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
be a great multi desktop tool and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.230 
be a great multi desktop tool and
something<00:02:55.120> many<00:02:55.330> people<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.720> believe<00:02:56.020> will<00:02:56.290> use

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
something many people I believe will use

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.940 
something many people I believe will use

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
this app as you can see that the I'm

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.150 
this app as you can see that the I'm
sure<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.109> highlights<00:04:17.470> different<00:04:17.620> here

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
sure the highlights different here

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.250 
sure the highlights different here
I<00:04:18.570> believe<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.660> highlights<00:04:19.930> div<00:04:20.049> in<00:04:20.140> here

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
I believe the highlights div in here

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.260 
I believe the highlights div in here
which<00:04:20.380> is<00:04:20.530> fairly<00:04:20.739> nice<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.640> if<00:04:21.729> we<00:04:21.849> go<00:04:22.000> into

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
which is fairly nice and if we go into

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.089 
which is fairly nice and if we go into
the<00:04:22.840> multitasking<00:04:23.410> area<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:23.890> where<00:04:24.039> you

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
the multitasking area this is where you

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.610 
the multitasking area this is where you
can<00:04:24.220> change<00:04:24.490> your<00:04:25.180> task<00:04:25.870> view

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
can change your task view

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.640 
can change your task view
behavior<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:27.370> in<00:04:27.699> the<00:04:27.820> display<00:04:28.750> area<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:29.470> can

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
behavior and in the display area you can

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.740 
behavior and in the display area you can
see<00:04:29.800> here<00:04:30.040> that's<00:04:30.250> everything<00:04:31.210> now<00:04:31.360> has<00:04:31.540> the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
see here that's everything now has the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.250 
see here that's everything now has the
new<00:04:31.990> sort<00:04:32.470> of<00:04:32.590> toggle<00:04:33.160> UI<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.900> think's<00:04:35.110> just

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
new sort of toggle UI and I think's just

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.480 
new sort of toggle UI and I think's just
a<00:04:35.290> bit<00:04:35.410> more<00:04:35.530> streamlined<00:04:35.979> really<00:04:36.280> in<00:04:36.370> this

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
a bit more streamlined really in this

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.960 
a bit more streamlined really in this
area<00:04:36.760> which<00:04:36.910> is<00:04:37.060> fairly<00:04:37.449> nice<00:04:38.340> windows<00:04:39.340> inside
