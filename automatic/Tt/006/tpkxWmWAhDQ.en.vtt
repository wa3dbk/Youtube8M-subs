00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.190
 Tell me the truth 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.790
 If this giant screen was on here 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.220
 with division of the screen is 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.920
 microsoft we are here at mtur no 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.439
 booth and microsoft're full of game 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.109
 here's another one since 2007 is true 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.820
 I already tested it and have a college too. 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.500
 I try to do everything quickly. 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.650
 here to show the games will give a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.320
 then it is too crowded on the pair or 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.149
 of people all the time is very 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 videographer people people coming out 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.410
 unlike the sony booth that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.469
 there is also a closed sea ​​wall 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.520
 open and microsoft is fine 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.550
 centralized so you can see that it is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.870
 practically a square environment 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.020
 practically a parallelepiped in a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.739
 rectangle and there are a number of things 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.510
 or posters 17 overdrive the end colleges 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.930
 has a wrap is also a game that is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.200
 angry and mean then we'll give 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.080
 a navigated here 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.049
 right there, that mouth is where 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.689
 it's rolling it's seven o'clock 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.430
 we already tested I tested it by the way I got it 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.020
 a 50-minute queue 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.009
 we will soon reach 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.740
 because not only to show quickly 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.750
 for you guys like a great class of 50 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.400
 minutes to get angry 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.290
 The 17 players are very big and there 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.659
 cool who gets a representative a door 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.430
 microsoft voice on the front talking about 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.619
 the game all the time and lupi denies 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.570
 instructions on how to play like you 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.909
 can see this queue here not being 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.630
 filmed now behind the brass in the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.380
 comes back and makes another tub and each person 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.210
 It takes more or less 10 to 15 minutes 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.729
 of gambling 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.049
 if you consume marching beat of each one 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.450
 it really is a waiting time 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.860
 I thought the game is very cool after 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.560
 We'll do a full test. 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.640
 of him here with that instinct as you 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.490
 They saw it will receive content 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.550
 additional is that everything is already included 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.970
 available 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.950
 is also a theme plus one 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.630
 A little bit here, we 'll go 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.570
 entering the stands that is a bit 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.160
 Quieter in the queue is not so big 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.810
 gives to come and play a good that 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.480
 here is the additional content of varzim 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.560
 that super mega super after ten 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.370
 designed the former alpha that is a dirt and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.350
 shin here this minecraft is here for 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.570
 showed the last light subway on that 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.480
 redux edition which is today the first game 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.180
 the first two and mastered but not 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.740
 my way of seeing the hottest or the most 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.190
 hot apart from just set Brazil arrived 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.930
 led in elite snapper is cool 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.370
 now it is closer but full 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.220
 is now a quiet one and we will go 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.380
 reach here the blame 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.180
 that ubisoft open world proposal 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.040
 the car game is right here 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.750
 this left side and I already tested it 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.570
 here like raw 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.520
 he has a map of the world absurdly 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.260
 immense and an interesting curiosity 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.060
 it was done by the same team of 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.300
 driver of the first love drugs was a 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.010
 last on paraná online at last it was 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.650
 made by the same team in three or 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.709
 four developers involved year 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.540
 declared the giant map takes an hour to 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.230
 an hour and a half from one beach after the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.910
 other 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.050
 I also tested the game there about 15 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.640
 I'll take a little test 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.520
 complete for you to check 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.790
 people here just beyond the lion 's eye look at the 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.290
 also a promise and lukewarm to 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.580
 hot I would say the game proposal is very 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.610
 interesting, we played, I played 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.070
 I took a frightful blow here here so 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.750
 it was good ledin cef college the title of 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.020
 exclusive franchise to Microsoft 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.390
 install a hatch 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.030
 and the game is very cool, how was it? 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.460
 reinforced at the microsoft conference 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.440
 you can choose a villain a hero or 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.300
 villain and how it's being filmed and now 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.070
 are watching the villain he plays in that 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.660
 perspective the galley is a perspective 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.400
 aerial view 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.020
 the hero for example does not play like this 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.110
 When you play as a hero you play 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.210
 as a third person game is a rpg 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.090
 traditional and here you have this vision 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.750
 that is more strategic only to those who 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.730
 it's villainous 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.770
 today as villain buys four heroes and 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.470
 I won, tell me in passing. 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:25.260
 I'll keep Kyoto as I told you 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.590
 You're the microsoft booth too. 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.960
 Closed non-parallelepiped target 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.450
 here is the park project that is no longer 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.140
 no big news already felipe beta 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.300
 it is open and run from boyd strong that 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.510
 It's very interesting to play, very handsome. 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.250
 We'll talk more about him later. 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.700
 there is the tweet that does not do so much 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.340
 time 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.040
 is already available on the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.100
 microsoft are announcing a little more 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.410
 strong in a slightly more aggressive way 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.860
 Why do not you even have to say it in the gallery? 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.910
 after a 12 raid has a wretched hype 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.340
 This game is not 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.240
 The game is beautiful, we're going to bounce. 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.060
 hands on them 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.700
 him and will do a complete test to 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.430
 You are after and nothing more natural than 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.800
 There's a guy who walks up and down is still the face. 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.640
 from microsoft that load says 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.220
 passage 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.790
 The game is beautiful, graphically speaking. 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.710
 you can see that the displays 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.660
 confortline are always full right 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.170
 we just went through there not 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.750
 They find and set I was not so full 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.000
 the forum is always full all the time 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.430
 we can trust and since it opened 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.680
 Why noon today did not stop a 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.430
 minute of time queue to play 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.800
 out 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.090
 I think this basically 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.420
 I think basically this is me here. 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.130
 a good future for microsoft is like me 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.830
 I told people three or four games is 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.730
 of the 17 truths the alexandre rambo 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.050
 leds 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.960
 then we'll do previews and 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.370
 complete for you to check and I think 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.450
 that for now that Microsoft is 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.890
 taking time to send 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.250
 Thanks guys for not being below that 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.250
 play
