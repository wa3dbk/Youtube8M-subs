00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
of concepts we talked about in the

of concepts we talked about in the
concept<00:01:13.010> section<00:01:13.400> i<00:01:13.550> am<00:01:14.119> using<00:01:14.330> double<00:01:14.869> stops

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
concept section i am using double stops

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.200 
concept section i am using double stops
I<00:01:15.500> am<00:01:15.740> tweaking<00:01:16.010> my<00:01:16.190> third<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.670> I'm<00:01:16.970> tweaking

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
I am tweaking my third and I'm tweaking

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.690 
I am tweaking my third and I'm tweaking
my<00:01:17.420> flat<00:01:17.810> 7<00:01:18.290> i'm<00:01:18.470> using<00:01:18.860> half<00:01:19.070> step<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:19.550> i'm

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
my flat 7 i'm using half step and i'm

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.790 
my flat 7 i'm using half step and i'm
using<00:01:19.970> whole<00:01:20.210> step<00:01:20.509> bends<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.560> there's<00:01:21.740> a

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
using whole step bends so there's a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.530 
using whole step bends so there's a
bunch<00:01:22.009> of<00:01:22.160> things<00:01:22.340> together<00:01:22.550> really<00:01:23.000> work<00:01:23.390> to

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
bunch of things together really work to

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.170 
bunch of things together really work to
put<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.869> solo<00:01:24.110> 2<00:01:24.490> into<00:01:25.490> good<00:01:25.670> use<00:01:25.700> now<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:29.060> a

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
put the solo 2 into good use now it's a

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.330 
put the solo 2 into good use now it's a
bit<00:01:29.360> country<00:01:29.720> feeling<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.650> that's<00:01:30.860> because

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
bit country feeling and that's because

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.210 
bit country feeling and that's because
of<00:01:31.580> just<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.940> feel<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.659> double<00:01:33.440> stops<00:01:33.710> so

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
of just the feel and the double stops so

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.770 
of just the feel and the double stops so
let's<00:01:34.369> take<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.580> look<00:01:34.850> at<00:01:35.300> some<00:01:35.509> of<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.690> ideas

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
let's take a look at some of the ideas

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.560 
let's take a look at some of the ideas
that<00:01:35.990> I'm<00:01:36.140> doing<00:01:36.289> so<00:01:36.890> but<00:01:37.220> first<00:01:37.460> khordam<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:37.940> g

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
odd right there's a lot of combinations

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.250 
odd right there's a lot of combinations
of<00:04:45.970> ideas<00:04:46.360> in<00:04:46.479> here<00:04:46.630> but<00:04:46.780> it's<00:04:46.870> all<00:04:47.020> stuff

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
of ideas in here but it's all stuff

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.320 
of ideas in here but it's all stuff
we're<00:04:47.440> really<00:04:47.620> familiar<00:04:48.010> with<00:04:48.070> sound<00:04:48.460> wise<00:04:48.729> so

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
we're really familiar with sound wise so

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.610 
we're really familiar with sound wise so
that's<00:04:49.479> really<00:04:49.599> important<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.169> see<00:04:50.320> that<00:04:50.349> none

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
that's really important to see that none

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.409 
that's really important to see that none
