feathers shorter dad of course the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.460 
feathers shorter dad of course the
mutations<00:02:55.160> could<00:02:55.340> also<00:02:55.489> be<00:02:55.760> an<00:02:55.850> improvement

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
mutations could also be an improvement

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.680 
mutations could also be an improvement
