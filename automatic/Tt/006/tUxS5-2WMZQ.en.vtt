so<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.060> had<00:00:06.359> this<00:00:06.479> idea<00:00:06.889> regarding<00:00:07.889> the<00:00:08.010> Xbox

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
so I had this idea regarding the Xbox

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.420 
so I had this idea regarding the Xbox
one<00:00:08.820> consoles<00:00:09.809> UI<00:00:10.139> itself<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.250> user

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
one consoles UI itself the user

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.080 
one consoles UI itself the user
interface<00:00:12.000> says<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.750> should<00:00:12.960> really<00:00:13.500> call<00:00:13.710> it

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
interface says we should really call it

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.019 
interface says we should really call it
I<00:00:15.560> was<00:00:16.560> thinking<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:17.039> myself<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.580> know<00:00:17.640> after

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I was thinking to myself you know after

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.609 
I was thinking to myself you know after
looking<00:00:18.240> at<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> dashboard<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.350> after

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
looking at the dashboard and after

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.470 
looking at the dashboard and after
looking<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.070> all<00:00:20.280> the<00:00:20.910> things<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.390> are

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
looking at all the things that are

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.720 
looking at all the things that are
running<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.050> user<00:00:22.289> interface<00:00:22.830> which<00:00:23.430> are

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
running on this user interface which are

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.120 
running on this user interface which are
by<00:00:24.330> far<00:00:24.690> pretty<00:00:25.080> impressive<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.770> like<00:00:25.949> what

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
by far pretty impressive I like what

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.279 
by far pretty impressive I like what
they've<00:00:26.279> done<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.779> far<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
they've done with it but as far as the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.590 
they've done with it but as far as the
customization<00:00:29.160> goes<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.699> seems<00:00:30.180> like<00:00:30.449> it's

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
customization goes it seems like it's

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.650 
customization goes it seems like it's
very<00:00:30.660> very<00:00:31.230> basic<00:00:32.269> essentially<00:00:33.269> all<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.510> can

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
very very basic essentially all you can

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
very very basic essentially all you can
do<00:00:33.780> at<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.019> moment<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.980> turn<00:00:35.190> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
do at this moment is you can turn it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.880 
do at this moment is you can turn it
green<00:00:36.000> red<00:00:36.720> blue

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
green red blue

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.639 
green red blue
I<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:38.370> yellow<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.110> like<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> grayish<00:00:40.620> color

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
I think yellow and like a grayish color

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.870 
I think yellow and like a grayish color
I<00:00:41.160> think<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.770> as<00:00:43.770> far<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.370> anything<00:00:44.610> else

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
I think so as far as anything else

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.000 
I think so as far as anything else
that's<00:00:45.239> basically<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:46.320> basically<00:00:46.800> all

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that's basically it that's basically all

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 
that's basically it that's basically all
you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.030> Xbox<00:00:48.570> one's<00:00:48.899> user

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
you can do to your Xbox one's user

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.000 
you can do to your Xbox one's user
interface<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:51.260> what<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.290> think<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.649> should<00:00:52.680> do

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
interface so what I think they should do

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.459 
interface so what I think they should do
is<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.539> should<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
is I think that they should have the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.970 
is I think that they should have the
ability<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:56.070> add<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:57.170> would<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.500> say<00:00:58.680> live

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
ability to add I would have to say live

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.029 
ability to add I would have to say live
wallpapers<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> background<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.829> user

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
wallpapers in the background on the user

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.119 
wallpapers in the background on the user
interface<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.469> reason<00:01:04.469> why<00:01:04.649> I<00:01:04.680> say<00:01:05.100> this

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
interface and the reason why I say this

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.639 
interface and the reason why I say this
is<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:06.810> would<00:01:07.020> create<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.590> whole<00:01:08.009> new

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
is because it would create a whole new

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.480 
is because it would create a whole new
interest<00:01:10.649> in<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.490> Xbox<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.450> home<00:01:12.719> screen

interest in your Xbox one home screen

screen itself to your pins I mean it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.849 
screen itself to your pins I mean it
wouldn't<00:01:24.539> matter<00:01:24.689> where<00:01:24.959> you<00:01:25.079> go<00:01:25.289> it<00:01:25.619> would

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
wouldn't matter where you go it would

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.889 
wouldn't matter where you go it would
the<00:01:26.069> live<00:01:26.249> wallpaper<00:01:26.549> would<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.359> there<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
the live wallpaper would be there in the

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.169 
the live wallpaper would be there in the
background<00:01:28.109> floating<00:01:28.920> around<00:01:29.219> it<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:30.119> be

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
background floating around it would be

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.909 
background floating around it would be
mostly<00:01:30.719> visible<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.409> home<00:01:31.590> screen

because as we all know when you click on

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.069 
because as we all know when you click on
a<00:01:33.899> certain<00:01:34.849> thing<00:01:35.849> like<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.149> certain<00:01:36.569> game<00:01:36.779> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
a certain thing like a certain game you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.800 
a certain thing like a certain game you
don't<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.349> see<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.709> background<00:01:38.219> black<00:01:38.810> as

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
don't really see the background black as

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.929 
don't really see the background black as

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
much on the home screen so it would be a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.019 
much on the home screen so it would be a
home<00:01:42.240> screen<00:01:42.719> based<00:01:43.169> user<00:01:43.560> interface<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.999> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
lot of wallpapers and what they could do

if<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.379> make<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.679> background<00:02:11.250> like

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
if you can make your background like

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.660 
if you can make your background like
raining<00:02:12.090> water<00:02:12.920> or<00:02:13.920> even<00:02:14.670> better

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
raining water or even better

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.920 
raining water or even better
and<00:02:15.760> what<00:02:15.880> if<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.090> doesn't<00:02:16.270> have<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and what if it doesn't have to be the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.550 
and what if it doesn't have to be the
background<00:02:17.170> itself<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:19.020> how<00:02:20.020> about<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.350> have

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
background itself and how about we have

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.309 
background itself and how about we have
it<00:02:20.709> fused<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:22.090> actual<00:02:22.569> user<00:02:22.810> interface

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
it fused with the actual user interface

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.620 
it fused with the actual user interface
like<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.700> would<00:02:24.910> be<00:02:25.030> in<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.240> foreground

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
like this it would be in the foreground

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.730 
like this it would be in the foreground
of<00:02:26.350> your<00:02:27.190> home<00:02:27.850> screen<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.530> said

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
of your home screen so like I said

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.470 
of your home screen so like I said
before<00:02:29.830> say<00:02:30.370> for<00:02:30.640> example<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.330> live

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
before say for example the live

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.920 
before say for example the live
wallpaper<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.440> rain<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:34.330> would<00:02:34.480> actually<00:02:34.690> see

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
wallpaper is rain you would actually see

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.650 
wallpaper is rain you would actually see
droplets<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.709> rain<00:02:35.980> hitting<00:02:36.459> your<00:02:36.880> actual

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
droplets of rain hitting your actual

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.520 
droplets of rain hitting your actual
screen<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.610> sliding<00:02:39.610> down<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.350> front<00:02:41.350> of

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
screen and sliding down it in front of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.380 
screen and sliding down it in front of
your<00:02:41.860> home<00:02:42.040> screen<00:02:42.250> not<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.820> background

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
your home screen not in the background

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.449 
your home screen not in the background
so<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.380> would<00:02:44.500> be<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> really<00:02:44.890> cool<00:02:44.980> addition

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
so that would be a really cool addition

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.780 
so that would be a really cool addition
as<00:02:45.760> well<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:46.270> something<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:46.750> that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
as well to have something like that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.760 
as well to have something like that
