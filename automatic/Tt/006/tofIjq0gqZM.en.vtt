00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
snail in for this one and he actually

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.059 
snail in for this one and he actually

abilities<00:02:41.519> not<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:43.349> guy<00:02:43.530> actually<00:02:43.709> has

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
abilities not that this guy actually has

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.729 
abilities not that this guy actually has
elemental<00:02:44.610> beliefs<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.269> in<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:46.349> rock<00:02:46.530> spirit

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739

video<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.790> guy<00:02:48.060> was<00:02:48.299> using<00:02:48.569> elemental

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
video the guy was using elemental

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.240 
video the guy was using elemental
beliefs<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.370> that's<00:02:50.970> why<00:02:51.239> he<00:02:51.750> was<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.950> that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
beliefs so that's why he was in for that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.099 
beliefs so that's why he was in for that
guy's<00:02:53.400> team<00:02:53.609> but<00:02:53.790> i<00:02:53.940> thought<00:02:54.239> i'll<00:02:54.450> try<00:02:54.840> am<00:02:54.989> i

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
guy's team but i thought i'll try am i

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.309 
guy's team but i thought i'll try am i
why<00:02:55.440> not<00:02:55.650> as<00:02:56.040> well<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.390> guy<00:02:57.629> has<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> dive

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
why not as well so this guy has a dive

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.380 
why not as well so this guy has a dive
ability<00:02:58.829> which<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.670> only<00:02:59.790> water<00:03:00.090> attack

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
ability which is the only water attack

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.330 
ability which is the only water attack
he<00:03:00.690> actually<00:03:00.840> has<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.650> does<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.829> crap-ton

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
he actually has but it does a crap-ton

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.399 
he actually has but it does a crap-ton
of<00:03:02.489> damage<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.269> always<00:03:03.510> good<00:03:03.659> as<00:03:03.840> long<00:03:04.379> as

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
of damage so it's always good as long as

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.789 
of damage so it's always good as long as
it<00:03:04.680> doesn't<00:03:04.859> get<00:03:05.099> mr.<00:03:05.579> dodge<00:03:05.849> like<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:07.379> tear

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
it doesn't get mr. dodge like the tear

extra twenty-five percent damage for
free<00:03:18.209> turns<00:03:18.510> which<00:03:19.109> is<00:03:19.319> pretty<00:03:19.739> good<00:03:19.940> that

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
free turns which is pretty good that

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.360 
free turns which is pretty good that
combined<00:03:21.510> by<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.169> might<00:03:22.590> do<00:03:22.829> quite<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.160> bit<00:03:23.250> of

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
combined by that might do quite a bit of

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.610 
combined by that might do quite a bit of
damage<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.910> we<00:03:24.120> also<00:03:24.299> have<00:03:24.419> an<00:03:24.810> ooze<00:03:25.079> touch<00:03:25.410> I

care about professional quality or not

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.290

so let's hopefully finish him off with

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.350 
so let's hopefully finish him off with
this<00:06:04.599> attack<00:06:05.020> and<00:06:05.260> I<00:06:05.919> he<00:06:06.520> obviously<00:06:06.820> dodges<00:06:07.330> it

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
this attack and I he obviously dodges it

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.310 
this attack and I he obviously dodges it
of<00:06:07.599> course<00:06:07.840> but<00:06:08.050> let's<00:06:08.919> continue<00:06:09.370> on<00:06:09.669> with<00:06:09.909> our

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
of course but let's continue on with our

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.430 
of course but let's continue on with our
using<00:06:11.320> touch<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:11.979> hopefully<00:06:12.520> finish<00:06:12.789> him<00:06:12.970> off

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
there we go one shot left hopefully and

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.710
