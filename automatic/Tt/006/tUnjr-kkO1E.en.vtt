with<00:02:43.530> electronics<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:45.260> am<00:02:46.260> really<00:02:46.530> starting<00:02:46.950> to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
with electronics I am really starting to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.150 
with electronics I am really starting to
wonder<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.910> had<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.900> problem<00:02:49.260> after<00:02:49.650> doing

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
wonder I had this problem after doing

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.310 
wonder I had this problem after doing
the<00:02:50.370> Reiki<00:02:50.730> weekend<00:02:51.120> my<00:02:51.480> iphone<00:02:52.020> wouldn't

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
the Reiki weekend my iphone wouldn't

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.580 
the Reiki weekend my iphone wouldn't
stop<00:02:52.620> buzzing<00:02:52.950> now<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> cannot<00:02:54.450> even<00:02:54.660> get<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.380> to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
stop buzzing now I cannot even get it to

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.470 
stop buzzing now I cannot even get it to
switch<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:59.450> wonder<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.910> will<00:03:03.060> become<00:03:03.300> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
switch on I wonder if this will become a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.810 
switch on I wonder if this will become a
problem<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.440> planet<00:03:04.890> if<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.190> continue<00:03:05.670> to

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
problem on the planet if we continue to

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.990 
problem on the planet if we continue to
increase<00:03:06.000> our<00:03:06.390> energy<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.930> frequency<00:03:08.000> mine

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
increase our energy and frequency mine

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.979 
increase our energy and frequency mine
have<00:03:09.780> never<00:03:10.650> been<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.250> high<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.420> am<00:03:12.540> loving

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
have never been so high and I am loving

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.810 
have never been so high and I am loving
this<00:03:13.200> but<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.650> seems<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.220> electronics

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
this but it seems that the electronics

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.840 
this but it seems that the electronics
or<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.800> guess<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:16.980> need<00:03:17.040> more<00:03:17.220> powerful

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
or not I guess I need more powerful

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.229 
or not I guess I need more powerful

great right now how can I attract a
friend<00:03:42.390> did<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.750> edit<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.470> then<00:03:43.680> I

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
friend did it edit of that and then I

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.750 
friend did it edit of that and then I
continue<00:03:44.459> on<00:03:44.580> with<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.880> story<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:46.760> I've

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
continue on with the story but I've

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.449 
continue on with the story but I've
really<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.510> then<00:03:48.750> yeah<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.680> then<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:49.950> go<00:03:50.430> back

really and then yeah and then I go back
into<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.299> I<00:03:51.450> said<00:03:51.780> well<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:51.989> wonder<00:03:52.380> if<00:03:52.590> at

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
into it and I said well I wonder if at

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.289 
into it and I said well I wonder if at
some<00:03:52.890> point<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> evolution<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:53.970> human

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
some point of the evolution of human

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.720 
some point of the evolution of human
beings<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:55.079> shall<00:03:55.290> get<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.799> stage<00:03:56.250> where<00:03:56.280> we

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
beings we shall get to a stage where we

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.910 
beings we shall get to a stage where we
can<00:03:56.910> no<00:03:57.090> longer<00:03:57.120> use<00:03:57.480> all<00:03:58.110> these<00:03:58.290> electronic

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
can no longer use all these electronic

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.490 
can no longer use all these electronic
devices<00:03:59.269> maybe<00:04:00.269> there'll<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.600> such<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.049> clash

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
devices maybe there'll be such a clash

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.069 
devices maybe there'll be such a clash
between<00:04:01.530> our<00:04:02.100> high<00:04:02.370> frequency<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.299> human

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
again my book number two the memos are

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.520 
again my book number two the memos are
in<00:05:29.380> that<00:05:29.590> computer<00:05:30.010> so<00:05:31.110> I'm<00:05:32.110> just<00:05:32.380> learning

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
in that computer so I'm just learning

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.910 
in that computer so I'm just learning
how<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.890> detach<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.820> I'm<00:05:33.970> seeing<00:05:34.920> actually

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
how to detach and I'm seeing actually

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.420 
how to detach and I'm seeing actually
the<00:05:36.810> I'm<00:05:37.810> stepping<00:05:38.680> back<00:05:38.890> and<00:05:39.100> being<00:05:39.280> grateful

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.180 
the I'm stepping back and being grateful
for<00:05:40.030> what<00:05:40.210> I<00:05:40.240> have<00:05:40.300> right<00:05:40.720> now<00:05:40.990> where<00:05:41.860> I<00:05:41.890> came

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
for what I have right now where I came

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.040 
for what I have right now where I came
so<00:05:42.460> far<00:05:42.670> you<00:05:42.970> know<00:05:43.090> everything<00:05:43.750> that<00:05:43.870> has

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
so far you know everything that has

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.930 
so far you know everything that has
happened<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:44.770> that<00:05:45.130> this<00:05:45.430> might<00:05:45.700> be<00:05:45.850> an

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
happened and that this might be an

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.770 
happened and that this might be an
opportunity<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:47.220> reconnect<00:05:48.220> in<00:05:49.060> a<00:05:49.180> more<00:05:49.360> human

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
opportunity to reconnect in a more human

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.840 
opportunity to reconnect in a more human
way<00:05:49.840> I<00:05:50.440> spent<00:05:50.980> a<00:05:51.040> lot<00:05:51.220> of<00:05:51.250> times<00:05:51.580> on<00:05:51.760> the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
way I spent a lot of times on the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.190 
way I spent a lot of times on the
computer<00:05:52.270> so<00:05:52.510> maybe<00:05:52.720> there's<00:05:52.930> some<00:05:53.080> other

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
computer so maybe there's some other

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.110 
computer so maybe there's some other
things<00:05:53.560> I<00:05:53.680> should<00:05:53.950> be<00:05:53.980> doing<00:05:54.130> as<00:05:54.640> part<00:05:54.760> of<00:05:54.970> my

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
something about that to be said as we

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.620 
something about that to be said as we
are<00:06:37.980> raising<00:06:38.980> our<00:06:39.280> frequencies<00:06:39.910> there's<00:06:40.360> more

are raising our frequencies there's more
