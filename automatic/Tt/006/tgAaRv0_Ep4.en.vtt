00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.429
 unpacked and touched video with focus 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.500
 like it in the wide shower on the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.560
 carton already to see yes it is 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.380
 really a white housing and indeed 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.269
 by 1 with striking blue color accents 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.180
 also can already be guessed 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.619
 this is a really big case 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:36.660
 full tower of the self large xl atx 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.750
 can record mainboards 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.390
 but also a lot of space 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.050
 needs and not just balance 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.539
 The housing weighs a stately 16 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.940
 kilogram 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.879
 we will try that out of the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.899
 carton out and then in 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.899
 to introduce detail 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:29.920
 unpacked the gts here in all its 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:32.740
 splendor and mightiness european 1 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.289
 but relatively striking design before 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:42.009
 should appeal to all gamers rather 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.349
 whether color clearly dominating it 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.520
 white some black elements give that 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:52.360
 human and blue accents in the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.759
 practical page responsive front 5 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.920
 Drive places for 525 two drives 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.590
 a tape and a mounting kit for one 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.789
 External purity inch walk recumbent 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:11.530
 also including a big one 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:16.930
 Sucker 20 cm fan becomes the cooling system 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:20.019
 factory rounded fan at the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.680
 back both fans lit by 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.930
 There are optional hip places 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.880
 of course also a whole row in the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.660
 side panel in the floor under the lid 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:41.579
 notable as well one 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:45.519
 fan control here on these two 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.850
 senior friendly designed huge 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.850
 grope 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:55.560
 the fan control in four stages 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:59.079
 affect 0 50 80 500 percent 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.920
 in addition, there is a panel with 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:08.530
 usb 3.0 also on usb 2.0 on the right 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.920
 then the switch side of this switch 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:17.109
 If yes, also for management 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:22.060
 wurstfinger very well suitable otherwise 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:26.230
 then dropped the pattern in the lid area 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:34.389
 then the air intakes for the optional ones 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:38.889
 Cover the fan all the way back 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:44.650
 the turntable a big window here in 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:49.180
 his rich but that in broken 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.590
 through the optional fan places that is 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.799
 sure taste thing but that you 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.799
 say 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.889
 looking at the back one then 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:01.810
 to recognize classical composition like you 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.479
 current standard is the power supply and 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:10.959
 on the ground could expand 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:13.750
 dust filter that we then here at the 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:18.060
 right wall of the house big 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.060
 Prejudice hose penetrations 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:28.040
 remove the subscribed 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.370
 that actually sits quite comfortably 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.150
 just hooked on these rails 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.400
 is therefore nothing great it is something powerful 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.650
 because of that, but also a little force 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.750
 approach 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:49.820
 positive falls to acting very, very 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:54.550
 Robust beautiful ruby ​​seems to rise 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.550
 not to ask the material thickness 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.750
 nor does gstaad become a blue one 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.700
 color for the interior 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:10.130
 that's definitely a colorful one 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.070
 housing in frame few have quite 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.740
 there will be courage to ask how 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.720
 we are proven and that's one 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:23.030
 very welcome change to 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:25.910
 black porridge otherwise here in the 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.780
 interior equal to watch tool-free 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:35.450
 Assembly for the optical drives 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:38.740
 by the way, stands for a three and a half as 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.740
 external can be mounted 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.060
 hard disks can be a maximum of seven pieces 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.370
 load into this upward push here 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.490
 simply screwed without decoupling 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:54.800
 By the way, this is now rather the 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:58.600
 except for a tool-free 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 Assemble both expansion cards with 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.960
 big locks now that is 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:15.880
 But plastic makes a right front 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:15.880
 robust impression quite pleasant 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.600
 Otherwise, then stop the coach with 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:27.080
 sled that this trade the beautiful 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.350
 blue is tainted with neat 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.090
 distance to the opposite sides 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.760
 So management should be pretty good too 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:38.420
 be feasible we also have this 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.000
 rubber bushings which dissolve 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.830
 relatively fast as I am right now 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.950
 but you have to determine otherwise 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.320
 welcome, of course 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:52.060
 heidi cables are protected and man 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.060
 even a thing already knew things 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:02.620
 yes at first glance yahoo has cool 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:07.070
 a well-equipped one of course 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:12.350
 visually striking extraordinary 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:16.700
 extrovert housing we hung up 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:18.500
 will test it now and then 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:23.840
 in our detailed hardwareluxx 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:26.270
 test report whether this gts on 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.200
 a recommendable full tower 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:34.340
 is or rather little but rather a blender 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:37.360
 have too much on the optics 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.360
 was concentrated
