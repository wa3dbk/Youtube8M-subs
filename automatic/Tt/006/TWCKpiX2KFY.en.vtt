00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.400 
they're great cars unmatched reliability
and<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.269> really<00:00:24.570> hold<00:00:24.689> their<00:00:24.869> value<00:00:24.900> well

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and they really hold their value well

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.259 
and they really hold their value well
but<00:00:25.949> how<00:00:26.099> about<00:00:26.160> cords<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.789> never<00:00:26.970> really

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
but how about cords have never really

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.220 
but how about cords have never really
been<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> would<00:00:27.869> felt
