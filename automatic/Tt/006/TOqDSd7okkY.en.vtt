00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.920 
finish quests during the speedrun they
skipped<00:00:58.980> most<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.640> not<00:00:59.699> all<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.510> dialogue

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

and any cutscenes to be had in the game

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.450 
and any cutscenes to be had in the game
mainly<00:01:04.019> due<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.290> them<00:01:04.619> knowing<00:01:05.040> what<00:01:05.369> was

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
mainly due to them knowing what was

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.520 
mainly due to them knowing what was
happening<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.060> story<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.659> took<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
happening in this story it took them a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.620 
happening in this story it took them a
total<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> 25<00:01:08.580> hours<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.270> go<00:01:09.390> through<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
total of 25 hours just to go through the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.719 
total of 25 hours just to go through the
main<00:01:09.810> quests<00:01:10.260> which<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.549> these

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
main quests which with all these

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.640 
main quests which with all these
barriers<00:01:12.119> removed<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.250> as<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> speedrun<00:01:14.790> i

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
barriers removed and as a speedrun i

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.200 
barriers removed and as a speedrun i
think<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> 50<00:01:17.040> hour<00:01:17.159> estimate<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> good

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
think the 50 hour estimate is a good

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.210 
think the 50 hour estimate is a good
estimate<00:01:18.630> maybe<00:01:19.020> even<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> average

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
estimate maybe even more for the average

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.999 
estimate maybe even more for the average
player<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.869> game<00:01:22.049> has<00:01:22.229> supposedly<00:01:22.590> had<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
player the game has supposedly had a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.399 
player the game has supposedly had a
slight<00:01:23.430> difficulty<00:01:24.030> increase<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.229> will

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
slight difficulty increase so that will

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.899 
slight difficulty increase so that will
influence<00:01:25.799> time<00:01:26.340> taken

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
influence time taken

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.510 
influence time taken
i'm<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:28.259> sure<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> devs<00:01:28.829> accounted<00:01:29.490> for

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
i'm not sure if the devs accounted for

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.179 
i'm not sure if the devs accounted for
dead<00:01:30.119> battles<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.780> cut<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.740> out<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
dead battles or cut that out and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.100 
dead battles or cut that out and
continued<00:01:33.119> their<00:01:33.270> timer<00:01:33.479> from<00:01:33.750> when<00:01:33.930> they

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
continued their timer from when they

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.560 
continued their timer from when they
died<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> few<00:01:35.759> hundred<00:01:36.180> percent<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
died so it is a few hundred percent of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
died so it is a few hundred percent of
the<00:01:36.659> main<00:01:36.840> story<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:38.280> includes<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the main story or it includes the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.740 
the main story or it includes the
inevitable<00:01:39.540> pails<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.560> dead<00:01:40.920> gerelds<00:01:41.400> if<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
inevitable pails of dead gerelds if the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.899 
inevitable pails of dead gerelds if the
dead<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.259> still<00:01:43.680> would<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.250> good<00:01:44.460> length<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
dead it still would be a good length I

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
dead it still would be a good length I
do<00:01:45.180> think<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.600> would<00:01:45.780> abide<00:01:46.020> by<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.290> general

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
do think they would abide by the general

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
do think they would abide by the general
rule<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.979> thumb<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.520> speedruns<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.270> death

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
rule of thumb with speedruns on death

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.929 
rule of thumb with speedruns on death

time<00:02:05.899> yeah<00:02:06.899> at<00:02:07.079> least<00:02:07.340> if<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:09.119> did<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.599> would

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
time yeah at least if I did I would

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.210 
time yeah at least if I did I would
definitely<00:02:10.229> give<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> good<00:02:10.619> batch<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220

books to it I mean a hundred hours is a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.229 
books to it I mean a hundred hours is a
very<00:02:16.220> very<00:02:16.430> long<00:02:16.700> time

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
very very long time

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.270 
very very long time
I<00:02:17.269> could<00:02:17.989> play<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.290> likes<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.530> far<00:02:18.799> cry<00:02:18.980> for

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
I could play the likes of far cry for

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.470 
I could play the likes of far cry for
roughly<00:02:20.060> 100%<00:02:20.930> through<00:02:21.290> four<00:02:22.190> times<00:02:22.459> or<00:02:22.760> watch

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
roughly 100% through four times or watch

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.940 
roughly 100% through four times or watch

the Lord of the Rings trilogy nearly

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.979 
the Lord of the Rings trilogy nearly
eleven<00:02:25.280> times<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.269> fact<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.659> it<00:02:26.870> could

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
eleven times and the fact that it could

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.559 
eleven times and the fact that it could
be<00:02:27.049> longer<00:02:27.530> than<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.099> even<00:02:28.730> another

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
be longer than that and even another

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.259 
be longer than that and even another
fifty<00:02:29.930> hours<00:02:30.140> longer<00:02:30.379> roughly<00:02:31.159> with<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.670> DLC

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
fifty hours longer roughly with a DLC

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.839 
fifty hours longer roughly with a DLC
it's<00:02:33.049> a<00:02:33.140> lot<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.379> possible<00:02:33.769> productivity<00:02:34.670> time

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
it's a lot of possible productivity time

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.729 
it's a lot of possible productivity time
hopefully<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.750> developers<00:02:36.319> have<00:02:36.440> did<00:02:36.590> the
