you ice cream because it's in a draw in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.109 
you ice cream because it's in a draw in
the<00:01:36.619> freezer<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.100> stops<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.520> air<00:01:37.640> circulation

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
the freezer it stops the air circulation

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.219 
the freezer it stops the air circulation
from<00:01:38.360> hitting<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:38.869> know<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.079> have<00:01:39.170> a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
from hitting it you know you have a

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.950 
from hitting it you know you have a
circulation<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.070> cold<00:01:40.280> air<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:40.640> hard<00:01:41.270> exactly

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
circulation to cold air so hard exactly

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.600 
circulation to cold air so hard exactly
it's<00:01:42.049> about<00:01:42.079> 5<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.560> 10<00:01:42.590> degrees<00:01:42.860> warmer<00:01:43.070> get

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
it's about 5 to 10 degrees warmer get

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.609 
it's about 5 to 10 degrees warmer get
crystallized<00:01:44.149> that's<00:01:45.079> that's<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.439> cool

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
crystallized that's that's a cool

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.440 
crystallized that's that's a cool
function<00:01:46.100> it's<00:01:46.250> not<00:01:46.369> that<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.000> cost<00:01:47.240> this

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
function it's not that and the cost this

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.850 
function it's not that and the cost this
to<00:01:47.689> you<00:01:47.810> have<00:01:47.990> for<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.200> same<00:01:48.409> feature<00:01:48.680> you

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
to you have for the same feature you

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.380 
to you have for the same feature you
could<00:01:49.009> set<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.340> little<00:01:49.610> bit<00:01:49.880> warmer<00:01:50.299> than

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
could set this a little bit warmer than

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.700 
could set this a little bit warmer than
freezing<00:01:50.719> and<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.079> can<00:01:51.200> put<00:01:51.289> your<00:01:51.380> ice<00:01:51.530> cream

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
that will be soft okay this is key that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.270 
that will be soft okay this is key that
soft<00:01:54.049> close<00:01:54.259> is<00:01:54.439> key<00:01:54.619> because<00:01:54.770> one<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.130> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
soft close is key because one of the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.709 
soft close is key because one of the
major<00:01:55.460> mount<00:01:55.820> functions<00:01:56.270> with<00:01:56.359> the<00:01:56.450> old<00:01:56.570> eyes

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
major mount functions with the old eyes

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.789 
major mount functions with the old eyes
do<00:01:56.899> you<00:01:57.320> do<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.619> young<00:01:57.859> again<00:01:59.439> okay<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:00.500> it

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
do you do that young again okay so it

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.620 
do you do that young again okay so it
goes<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.189> gradually<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.789> its<00:02:01.939> own<00:02:02.119> yeah<00:02:02.420> one

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
goes and gradually on its own yeah one

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.910 
goes and gradually on its own yeah one
of<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.810> major<00:02:02.960> malfunctions<00:02:03.590> with<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.770> old

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
to see the outside of this so you have

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.880 
to see the outside of this so you have
your<00:02:36.850> just<00:02:39.630> very<00:02:40.630> simple<00:02:41.020> design<00:02:41.350> ok

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
your just very simple design ok

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.340 
your just very simple design ok
pyramid-shaped<00:02:42.810> when<00:02:43.810> it's<00:02:43.959> ready<00:02:44.200> to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
pyramid-shaped when it's ready to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.080 
pyramid-shaped when it's ready to
harvest<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.860> gives<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.100> slight<00:02:45.550> twist<00:02:45.880> and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
harvest it gives a slight twist and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.400 
harvest it gives a slight twist and
everything<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.900> only<00:02:47.020> little<00:02:47.230> it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
everything so this is the only little it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.350 
everything so this is the only little it
only<00:02:47.560> makes<00:02:47.800> orders<00:02:48.280> as<00:02:48.400> 10<00:02:48.730> tubes<00:02:48.970> at<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.209> time

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
only makes orders as 10 tubes at a time

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.880 
only makes orders as 10 tubes at a time
yeah<00:02:49.660> but<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.900> makes<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.230> fast<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.709> like<00:02:50.800> I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
yeah but it makes it fast and like I

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.470 
yeah but it makes it fast and like I
