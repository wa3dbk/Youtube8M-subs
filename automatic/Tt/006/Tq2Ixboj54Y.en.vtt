or to give your name in and if you had
good<00:03:56.190> interconnection<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:57.120> would<00:03:57.239> be<00:03:57.329> able

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
good interconnection you would be able

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.809 
good interconnection you would be able
to<00:03:57.540> talk<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:58.199> him<00:03:58.409> so<00:03:59.069> only<00:03:59.220> comments<00:03:59.699> down

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
to talk to him so only comments down

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.839 
to talk to him so only comments down
below<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.359> I<00:04:01.199> think<00:04:01.949> that<00:04:02.099> if<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.699> is

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
below on this I think that if this is

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.640 
below on this I think that if this is
some<00:04:03.030> good<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.359> bad<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.569> this<00:04:03.840> biasness<00:04:04.319> is

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
some good and bad in this biasness is

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.610 
some good and bad in this biasness is
gone<00:04:04.889> but<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.430> think<00:04:05.699> we<00:04:05.790> lost<00:04:05.940> someone<00:04:06.329> who<00:04:06.620> was

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
gone but I think we lost someone who was

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.589 
gone but I think we lost someone who was
more<00:04:07.949> closer<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.579> gamers<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.090> actually

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
more closer to the gamers and actually

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.240 
more closer to the gamers and actually
had<00:04:09.900> more<00:04:10.109> communication<00:04:10.709> with<00:04:10.919> you<00:04:11.069> people

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
had more communication with you people

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.239 
had more communication with you people
it<00:04:11.489> wasn't<00:04:11.669> just<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:12.000> suit
