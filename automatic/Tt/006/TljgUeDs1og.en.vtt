yeah this is a pretty good simulation of
a<00:04:06.230> party<00:04:07.040> or<00:04:07.310> if<00:04:08.150> not<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.420> party<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.020> a<00:04:09.230> horrific

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
a party or if not a party of a horrific

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.010 
a party or if not a party of a horrific
LSD<00:04:10.730> induced<00:04:11.320> coma<00:04:12.320> nightmare

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
LSD induced coma nightmare

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.560 
LSD induced coma nightmare
and<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.920> like<00:04:15.130> how<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.340> urine<00:04:15.760> is<00:04:15.880> so<00:04:16.030> strong<00:04:16.390> it

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
and I like how the urine is so strong it

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.870 
and I like how the urine is so strong it
really<00:04:16.600> pushes<00:04:17.170> everyone<00:04:17.709> like<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.250> firehose

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
really pushes everyone like a firehose

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.530 
really pushes everyone like a firehose
pushes<00:04:19.480> like<00:04:19.660> protesters<00:04:21.210> that<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.360> some

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
pushes like protesters that is some

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.080 
pushes like protesters that is some
really<00:04:23.110> strong<00:04:23.800> penis<00:04:24.130> muscles<00:04:24.670> right<00:04:24.850> there

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
really strong penis muscles right there

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.900 
really strong penis muscles right there
I<00:04:25.270> mean<00:04:25.810> overall<00:04:26.110> it's<00:04:26.650> a<00:04:26.980> great<00:04:27.100> simulation

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
I mean overall it's a great simulation

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.060 
I mean overall it's a great simulation
of<00:04:28.150> being<00:04:28.720> at<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:28.900> party<00:04:29.260> with<00:04:29.440> alien<00:04:29.920> and

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
of being at a party with alien and

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.290 
of being at a party with alien and
progeria<00:04:30.460> children<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.470> having<00:04:33.030> 50,000<00:04:34.030> tons

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
progeria children and having 50,000 tons

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.360 
progeria children and having 50,000 tons
of<00:04:34.600> urine<00:04:34.990> inside<00:04:35.470> your<00:04:35.650> bladder<00:04:35.920> at<00:04:36.190> all

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
of urine inside your bladder at all

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.670 
of urine inside your bladder at all
times<00:04:36.670> so<00:04:37.480> it<00:04:37.510> gets<00:04:37.840> an<00:04:37.960> official<00:04:38.080> stand

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
times so it gets an official stand

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.120 
times so it gets an official stand
