which<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.830> let<00:02:33.070> him

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.959 

okay<00:02:39.719> zigzag<00:02:40.719> and<00:02:40.930> straight<00:02:41.349> first<00:02:41.939> okay<00:02:42.939> so

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
okay zigzag and straight first okay so

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.640 
okay zigzag and straight first okay so
we're<00:02:43.299> going<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.629> do<00:02:43.780> straight<00:02:44.109> stitch<00:02:44.409> right

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
we're going to do straight stitch right

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.030 
we're going to do straight stitch right
now<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.219> then<00:02:45.489> we'll<00:02:45.700> change<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.390> zig<00:02:46.599> zag

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
now and then we'll change it to zig zag

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.839 
now and then we'll change it to zig zag
okay<00:02:48.040> here<00:02:48.280> we<00:02:48.340> go

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
we're going to do straight stretch okay

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.369 
we're going to do straight stretch okay
and<00:02:56.709> you're<00:02:57.159> going<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.370> see<00:02:57.639> the<00:02:58.510> stitches<00:02:59.109> and

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
and you're going to see the stitches and

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.830 
and you're going to see the stitches and
because<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.549> see<00:03:00.760> over<00:03:01.000> here<00:03:01.030> we<00:03:01.359> put<00:03:01.780> a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
because if you see over here we put a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.170 
because if you see over here we put a
little<00:03:01.930> bit<00:03:02.260> more<00:03:02.469> tension<00:03:02.909> because<00:03:03.909> it's<00:03:04.090> a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
little bit more tension because it's a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.619 
little bit more tension because it's a
heavy<00:03:04.389> tread<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.319> then<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:07.000> stitches<00:03:07.389> both

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
heavy tread and then the stitches both

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.839 
heavy tread and then the stitches both
sides<00:03:07.930> will<00:03:08.200> be<00:03:08.319> very<00:03:08.620> clean<00:03:08.920> very<00:03:08.950> nice

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849
