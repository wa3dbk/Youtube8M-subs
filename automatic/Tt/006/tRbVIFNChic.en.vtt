time and both them actually do legitly

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.690 
time and both them actually do legitly
open<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.180> from<00:02:24.329> coat<00:02:24.510> weird<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.680> when<00:02:26.549> I'm

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
open it's from coat weird but when I'm

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.220 
open it's from coat weird but when I'm
I'm<00:02:26.939> in<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.239> glitch<00:02:27.450> more<00:02:27.659> than<00:02:27.810> absolutely

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
I'm in this glitch more than absolutely

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.990 
I'm in this glitch more than absolutely
open<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:28.560> got<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.769> exact<00:02:29.099> same<00:02:29.340> texture<00:02:29.819> so

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
open it's got the exact same texture so

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.399 
open it's got the exact same texture so
I<00:02:30.299> have<00:02:30.659> a<00:02:30.689> feeling<00:02:31.049> they're<00:02:31.140> actually

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
I have a feeling they're actually

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:32.929 
I have a feeling they're actually
definitely<00:02:31.859> gonna<00:02:31.980> use<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.609> something

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
definitely gonna use this for something

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.940 
definitely gonna use this for something
or<00:02:33.090> maybe<00:02:33.599> they'll<00:02:33.870> just<00:02:33.900> add<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.439> is<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> new

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
or maybe they'll just add this is a new

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.280 
or maybe they'll just add this is a new
possible<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.519> police<00:02:36.209> location<00:02:36.840> for<00:02:37.049> police

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
possible a police location for police

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.080 
possible a police location for police
but<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.829> have<00:02:38.310> no<00:02:38.489> idea<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:38.939> they're

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
but I have no idea but they're

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.940 
but I have no idea but they're
definitely<00:02:39.269> should<00:02:39.750> definitely<00:02:40.379> use<00:02:40.409> this<00:02:40.739> as

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
definitely should definitely use this as

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.369 
definitely should definitely use this as
is<00:02:41.400> basically<00:02:42.269> already<00:02:42.510> done<00:02:42.930> they<00:02:43.109> just<00:02:43.260> need
