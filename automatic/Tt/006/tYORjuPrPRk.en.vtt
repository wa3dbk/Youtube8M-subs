from there we're going to drain it and

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.920 
from there we're going to drain it and
put<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.190> some<00:01:08.430> seasoning<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.690> so

this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.440> of<00:01:10.560> those<00:01:10.680> things<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.100> dinner

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
this is one of those things that dinner

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
this is one of those things that dinner
comes<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> table<00:01:12.330> very<00:01:12.600> very<00:01:12.870> quickly<00:01:13.200> and

I<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.520> you're<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> find<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> useful

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
I think you're going to find it useful

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
I think you're going to find it useful
so<00:01:15.450> we're<00:01:15.720> wait<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.380> steam<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> then

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
so we're wait for this to steam and then

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.810

we'll<00:01:17.190> be<00:01:17.310> back<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.640> finish<00:01:17.910> it<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:19.670> okay<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
we'll be back to finish it up okay the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
we'll be back to finish it up okay the
time<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:21.570> notice<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.230> gotten
