00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.510 
isn't that a nice-looking one beautiful
the<00:00:46.079> reason<00:00:46.410> why<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:46.710> used<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> blood<00:00:47.250> worm

the reason why they used the blood worm

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.549 
the reason why they used the blood worm
is<00:00:47.730> more<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.300> time<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> year<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.320> because

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
is more this time of the year is because

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.590 
is more this time of the year is because
the<00:00:50.010> current<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> Hudson<00:00:51.120> River<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.539> very

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the current in the Hudson River is very

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.709 
the current in the Hudson River is very
strong<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> blood<00:00:54.329> worm<00:00:54.570> on

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
strong so when you put the blood worm on

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.590 
strong so when you put the blood worm on
the<00:00:54.750> hook<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.590> actually<00:00:56.129> keeps<00:00:56.910> from<00:00:57.149> ripping

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the hook it actually keeps from ripping

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.779 
the hook it actually keeps from ripping
off<00:00:57.809> because<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> lot<00:00:58.770> tougher<00:00:59.100> worm<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
off because it's a lot tougher worm the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
off because it's a lot tougher worm the
worm<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> lot<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.809> tough<00:01:01.170> than<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:02.039> sand

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
worm is a lot more tough than the sand

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.810 
worm is a lot more tough than the sand
one<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> basically<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.920> put<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.189> worm<00:01:05.489> like
