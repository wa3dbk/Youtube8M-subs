get up for that red to the opposite what

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.360 
get up for that red to the opposite what
he'd<00:03:25.240> have<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.480> stun<00:03:25.750> at<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.020> N<00:03:26.140> he's<00:03:27.040> left<00:03:27.250> it

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.030 
he'd have to stun at the N he's left it
a<00:03:27.460> bit<00:03:27.490> short<00:03:27.880> but<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:29.410> could<00:03:29.650> work<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.980> his

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
a bit short but it could work to his

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.650 
a bit short but it could work to his
advantage<00:03:30.100> because<00:03:30.790> if<00:03:31.000> he<00:03:31.060> pops<00:03:31.270> this<00:03:31.510> he's

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
advantage because if he pops this he's

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.540 
advantage because if he pops this he's
gonna<00:03:31.750> open<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.140> Reds<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.470> pink<00:03:32.710> up<00:03:32.890> what's

gonna open the Reds and pink up what's

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.370 
gonna open the Reds and pink up what's
he<00:03:33.640> for<00:03:33.820> this<00:03:34.090> could<00:03:34.240> be<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.450> key<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.690> winning

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
he for this could be the key to winning

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.560 
he for this could be the key to winning
the<00:03:35.560> second<00:03:35.950> frame<00:03:36.160> if<00:03:36.700> this<00:03:36.910> works<00:03:37.180> out<00:03:37.360> but

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
the second frame if this works out but
