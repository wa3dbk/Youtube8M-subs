keep<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.650> mind<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.040> when<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.460> fell<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.969> wasn't

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
keep in mind that when it fell it wasn't

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.689 
keep in mind that when it fell it wasn't
like<00:00:15.540> it's<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.870> normal<00:00:16.109> height<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> mean<00:00:17.220> this

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
like it's a normal height so I mean this

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.290 
like it's a normal height so I mean this
might<00:00:17.910> be<00:00:18.119> pretty<00:00:18.960> bias<00:00:19.410> there<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:19.949> or<00:00:20.100> no<00:00:21.650> now

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
might be pretty bias there but or no now

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.269 
might be pretty bias there but or no now
apparently<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:25.170> blackberry<00:00:25.619> z10<00:00:25.800> is

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
apparently I the blackberry z10 is

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460 
apparently I the blackberry z10 is
substantially<00:00:27.119> taller<00:00:27.390> wider<00:00:27.750> thicker<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
substantially taller wider thicker and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.530 
substantially taller wider thicker and
heavier<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.519> feel<00:00:29.730> fine<00:00:30.320> although<00:00:32.540> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
heavier then I feel fine although you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
heavier then I feel fine although you
know<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.200> differences<00:00:34.710> disease<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.280> actually

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
know the differences disease it actually

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.299 
know the differences disease it actually
opens<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.960> change<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.559> micro<00:00:38.160> sim

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
opens up so you can change the micro sim

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
opens up so you can change the micro sim
card<00:00:38.780> large<00:00:39.780> battery<00:00:40.290> etc<00:00:41.450> now<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> issue<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
card large battery etc now the issue I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.959 
card large battery etc now the issue I
see<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.920> fact<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.460> screen<00:00:44.700> broke

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
see here the fact that the screen broke

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
see here the fact that the screen broke
is<00:00:45.180> mainly<00:00:45.629> because<00:00:45.899> um<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
is mainly because um you know a

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.270 
is mainly because um you know a
blackberry<00:00:48.989> hasn't<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.530> done<00:00:49.800> any<00:00:50.039> good

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
blackberry hasn't really done any good

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.760 
blackberry hasn't really done any good
phone<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> full<00:00:51.329> smartphone<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.260> they

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
phone like a full smartphone so they

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.220 
phone like a full smartphone so they
haven't<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.520> know<00:00:53.699> done<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> testing

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
haven't really you know done the testing

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
haven't really you know done the testing
on<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.469> person<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> while<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.910> for

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
on this person for a while like for

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
example Samsung has been had so much

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.010 
example Samsung has been had so much
phones<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.090> understand<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.629> gorilla

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
phones they understand that gorilla

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.369 
phones they understand that gorilla
glass<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:01.949> iphone<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.379> had

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
glass is the way to go iphone as I had

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
glass is the way to go iphone as I had
the<00:01:04.559> nobler<00:01:05.159> Apple<00:01:05.519> had<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> iphone<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.180> the

the nobler Apple had the iphone for the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
the nobler Apple had the iphone for the
SEC<00:01:06.420> 2007<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:07.650> understand<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> could

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
SEC 2007 so they understand that could

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
SEC 2007 so they understand that could
really<00:01:08.400> lasted<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> way<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.600> know

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
really lasted the way to go so I know

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.130 
really lasted the way to go so I know
hopefully<00:01:10.260> blackberry<00:01:11.070> maybe<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
hopefully blackberry maybe with it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.940 
hopefully blackberry maybe with it
hopefully<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.260> don't<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.770> know

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
hopefully they don't go like you know

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.969 
hopefully they don't go like you know
epic<00:01:14.340> fail<00:01:14.580> before<00:01:14.850> their<00:01:15.180> next<00:01:15.360> um<00:01:15.979> version

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
epic fail before their next um version

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
epic fail before their next um version
of<00:01:17.130> their<00:01:17.520> smartphone<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> z10<00:01:18.659> wherever

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
of their smartphone not the z10 wherever

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.800 
of their smartphone not the z10 wherever
comes<00:01:19.259> after<00:01:19.710> um<00:01:19.890> hopefully<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.210> has<00:01:21.450> some<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
comes after um hopefully that has some a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
comes after um hopefully that has some a
better<00:01:22.229> glass<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.159> unlike<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
better glass on there but unlike the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.740 
better glass on there but unlike the
footage<00:01:24.689> isn't<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.680> big<00:01:25.740> either<00:01:26.189> so

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
footage isn't really that big either so

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.120 
footage isn't really that big either so
overall<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> mean<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.350> shouldn't<00:01:28.530> really<00:01:28.650> break

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
overall I mean it shouldn't really break

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.969 
overall I mean it shouldn't really break
that<00:01:29.369> easily<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:30.259> something<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that easily on something like the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.179 
that easily on something like the
Samsung<00:01:32.490> s3<00:01:33.150> samsung<00:01:33.900> has<00:01:34.290> Forbes<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.890> coming

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
break easily and they do that's why

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.020 
break easily and they do that's why
people<00:01:41.470> recommend<00:01:42.130> screen<00:01:42.400> protectors<00:01:42.850> but

people recommend screen protectors but

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.570 
people recommend screen protectors but

know kind of the same size like an
iPhone<00:01:47.650> to<00:01:47.830> me<00:01:47.950> that's<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:49.300> shouldn't<00:01:49.600> bring

that much you know I know we'll see this
all<00:01:51.910> turns<00:01:52.150> out<00:01:52.300> though<00:01:52.540> but<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:53.020> think<00:01:53.800> for

all turns out though but I think for

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.770 
all turns out though but I think for
business<00:01:54.340> users<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:55.120> think<00:01:55.420> they<00:01:55.510> might

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
business users I think they might

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.120 
business users I think they might
actually<00:01:55.960> have<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.260> problem<00:01:56.680> with<00:01:56.830> this<00:01:56.950> issue

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
actually have a problem with this issue

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.390 
actually have a problem with this issue
because<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:58.300> know<00:01:58.480> if<00:01:58.780> you're<00:01:59.160> if<00:02:00.160> you're<00:02:00.280> in

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
because you know if you're if you're in

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.950 
because you know if you're if you're in
a<00:02:00.430> business<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:01.000> you're<00:02:01.090> like<00:02:01.240> what<00:02:01.420> lexi<00:02:01.810> or
