00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
tried it and we're doing very well with

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.990 
tried it and we're doing very well with
this<00:02:00.119> chair<00:02:00.680> it's<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> only<00:02:02.100> chair<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.969> I

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
this chair it's the only chair that I

can<00:02:03.299> find<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.020> moment<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.860> was

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
can find at the moment that was

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.180 
can find at the moment that was
comfortable<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.600> sizing<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.500> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
comfortable with the sizing of it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.850 
comfortable with the sizing of it
and<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:09.060> factor<00:02:09.630> now<00:02:10.380> 180<00:02:11.250> he<00:02:11.910> right<00:02:12.090> now<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and this factor now 180 he right now and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.050 
and this factor now 180 he right now and
everybody<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:14.820> me<00:02:14.880> jumping<00:02:15.360> up<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.570> down

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
everybody see me jumping up and down

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.280 
everybody see me jumping up and down
realistically<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.420> should<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.870> flipped<00:02:19.140> over

realistically I should be flipped over

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.950 
realistically I should be flipped over
in<00:02:19.560> through<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> barbershop<00:02:20.970> window<00:02:21.360> because

in through the barbershop window because

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.500 
in through the barbershop window because
you<00:02:22.080> can't<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.610> chair<00:02:24.120> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
you can't do that on a chair that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.870 
you can't do that on a chair that
doesn't<00:02:24.990> have<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.860> rights<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.400> building
