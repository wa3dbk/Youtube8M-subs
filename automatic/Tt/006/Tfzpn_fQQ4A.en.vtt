00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.099
 and then guys south of 27 another video 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.630
 learning guitar series with beats on 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.630
 Today's time we're going to see the music. 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.820
 do not let me down is a very easy song 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.050
 but it is an interesting novelty that is the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.090
 use of suspended chords 6 with the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.439
 minors that we had not seen in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.140
 other videos 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.060
 the song starts with a chorus and in that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 part we're going to use two chords 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.059
 easy to be smaller than it has texture in 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.300
 second home here and I'll use the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.629
 finger 3 and 24 here 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 on Wednesday the rope on the fifth and fourth 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.829
 in the fourth house on Thursday and Wednesday 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.719
 strings here is also who you have 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.590
 with difficulty and deduce another that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.820
 stayed here 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.649
 the indicator you can use to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.059
 and help in their management also 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.280
 another cut we 're going to a bigger one already 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.540
 we have seen many times without difficulty, right? 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.940
 beauty to the beat but it is a bit difficult and 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.880
 the same as appear on the screen are two 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.280
 down then reverse up down 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.799
 down and ends with low again 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.810
 I 'll do some with the ropes. 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.710
 loose and guitar just to get the hand 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.710
 right then 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.869
 but rather with the cornea a cut does 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.829
 30 smaller than the novelty until then only for 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.829
 withdraw the rhythm is 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.090
 the staff is just that we will do 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.530
 twice in each chord playing and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.560
 singing together stays like this reads media 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560
 on 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.770
 piglet 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.769
 Watch out for beauty next to you. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.459
 then she is the verse she has the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.830
 same notes the same beat and it's the same 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.410
 sequence of the court then it is we 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.860
 basically changes nothing changes only the melody 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:34.459
 of the voice that is so in the bar and redden 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.459
 MILACH dean 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.950
 and the citizens 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.970
 then and there will win the same sequence 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.890
 the same beat has no difficulties 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.580
 beauty what will change in music then 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.780
 it will only be from the third to give 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.330
 a part there at the end that people 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.220
 it's called parts and it changes 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.800
 a little chords that we will 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.420
 use in this part that are the chords 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.730
 me higher again but the higher up 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.800
 now he is a person in the second house and 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.580
 that format with all three of them one day 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.160
 is appearing on the team on your screen 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.590
 It's okay, this part is going to 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.030
 changed is so hit interesting because 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.130
 can serve on various other songs 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.920
 they are all down what goes 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.680
 do a charm of the beat but if our 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.269
 footprint we should do all to 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.340
 low with the same intensity 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.250
 Are going to be two so I'm going to make 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.700
 only give a greater intensity 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.299
 ropes from the top of the biome and 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.540
 others 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:47.230
 I came back to all and there will highlight the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.359
 bass strings then if I do with the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.500
 loose strings here for you to attack 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.500
 It's going to be more or less like this. 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.879
 It's a little strange, let's do with the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.879
 Wake up to get better. 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.100
 yes but act upon 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.490
 think 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.570
 hashim beauty 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:20.660
 let's see how it is part 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:23.260
 Sung, it 's a party dwarf, did not take a 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.260
 wave reads 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:34.700
 and if not, not 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.080
 And then it's all right, that beat is 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.600
 easy to take care to get 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.790
 vary this personal intensity does not 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.010
 no other type of music page 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.870
 it's these parts they repeat everything 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.240
 well then today's video to us 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.640
 ends here in the next video era 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.490
 make a video or song that has 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.500
 but the court is a little more difficult 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.510
 and that englobe and everything that we saw 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.930
 until now of chords sharp chord 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.730
 with bigger minor eyelashes and chords 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.080
 others did not say guys until 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.080
 next a grace
