00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:31.730
 oddo hello did you get that way - a 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.810
 little like me i think so here it is 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.070
 here 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:40.010
 there is nothing else to say 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.960
 this is the NPC 1.7 Here it was 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.550
 pointed a day and then we found a 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.010
 very honestly good message after me 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.330
 said here it is grievance so the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.559
 server were not protected to 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.600
 people who are connected on they have 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.030
 all farted so we'll show you the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.559
 house also what does it look like 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.199
 dear house when it started when 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.500
 you are not shown yet all I 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.300
 think 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.100
 suddenly its dark and not for nothing 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.220
 here we are down side yes it's good 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.870
 I'm fine, I've got some mountain halves 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.190
 draw so suddenly this is not it 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.480
 for that too that there was no 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.030
 of episode 5 last Tuesday according to the 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.770
 climb to show you that's wrong 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.740
 responds also from your point of view 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.070
 the episode the word the word point of view 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.810
 precisely there is more point of view 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.780
 so here we are 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.549
 it was the episode we show you a little 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.470
 the advances on the house but suddenly 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.149
 ben as I'm connected to turn 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.920
 a little episode to show them 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.020
 precisely to replace episode 5 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.289
 I saw that there was much left 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.000
 to show so here's the beginning I'm 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.860
 invented here I attacked some 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.020
 creepers who exploded good at 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.899
 prejudices here at there are more stairs 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.549
 aie has shelved there is more than 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.020
 threshold there is more ceiling in them 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.189
 coffers 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.100
 there is nothing more, or what it is all 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.649
 empty is no longer crap what 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.970
 but hey we can a little we can 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.679
 deploy to have a pick up and 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.000
 take back the hand as it is and 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.890
 when we finished the episode but hey 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.009
 the time that it protects the server 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.209
 everything was lgt not so it made 3 10 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.849
 words either right now with the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.370
 work of the coup there we will resume 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.370
 quietly we will take care of that and 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.750
 then we will resume but that's why 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.549
 why the episodes have fallen behind 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.660
 now that you know I have 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.489
 with your links that we had turned 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.489
 until episode 6 france stopped and 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:32.060
 then I am dying here you not had the 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.700
 stop on you so okay so I come 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.549
 I come back to the situation with the ferry 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.260
 is now you get your site from 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.380
 originally 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:47.299
 I hope otherwise now I'm coming I 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.890
 fly I come I think finally here so I 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.810
 think we're going to follow on I do not know 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.269
 too much what we will do if we will broadcast 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.340
 this episode 5 but I imagine that yes I 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.410
 know I do not know so much it's with a 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.819
 episode between because episode 5 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.950
 was still available on my 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.810
 point of view if you still want 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.519
 time to watch for those watching 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.380
 their allies I know that I'm 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.250
 less well but well I look at aileurs 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.410
 look at the mean - there will not be so 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.650
 you have at home always have a 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.780
 perspective of available here is 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.090
 light patricia of his self he remained to me 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.230
 that sense where is so if you want 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.980
 the imaginary with the sound and then you 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.019
 listen, but here is 25 minutes 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.489
 Here it is not worth not worth 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.750
 the penalty against the episode 6 had 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.459
 absolutely nothing to do with the house 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.170
 was gone in exploration so that 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.890
 brings me to always put I 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.140
 thought 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.330
 nou lÃ© not both sides and then 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.220
 after we resume with an episode finally 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
 the cua is not clear how we will 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.700
 to do but it will be well known 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.530
 hopefully take this one has 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.120
 backup 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.380
 quite so we'll take care of everything 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.970
 this one and then we will continue to 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.370
 turn and you do not do normal 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.660
 that there is a little delay we apologize we 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.240
 should have taken but we should have 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.530
 do the server protections 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.850
 before as for me there was no 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.010
 problem it's a server of this lot 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.840
 we had just taken for this series 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.630
 I did not think people were going 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.310
 to find the idea as if I know 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.560
 nothing but it's ugly 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.359
 this is our beautiful house see 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.970
 I put in well finished yeah yeah 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.530
 yeah this little tune you 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.620
 not bother any longer short video 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.240
 just to let you know 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.820
 crosby has very fast to very very fast 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.820
 so chao knew that ride their anthem
