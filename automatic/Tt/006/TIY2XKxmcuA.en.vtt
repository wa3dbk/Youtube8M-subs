00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.380
 hello to all and all the friends this 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.330
 dg case today i'm going to you 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.910
 learn how to make projectors 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.410
 who go out and who will be the human 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 so how do 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.320
 and well just a system was 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320
 least on 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.720
 so of course they are beautiful 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.070
 tons that is downstairs 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.070
 show it's all stupid huh it's the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.230
 so tinker with the beacon that is here 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.480
 the piston behind this lock 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.700
 who will push this block that will go so 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.230
 over the bacon and that it was worth 1 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.990
 why he's going to turn it off 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.790
 because a bacon when it is 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.579
 that there is a block above him it's 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.460
 one except the glass blocks 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.460
 who can we still market 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.320
 super helpful 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.830
 well, we'll immediately go to a 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.409
 mini phase construction so let's admit 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.979
 for this little Christmas garden we can 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.740
 decree two projectors one here is a 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.630
 rabbit so simply 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.630
 besides you can see the number 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.880
 of exact objects that they have to be 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.460
 in my inventory 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.050
 so I was just going 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.950
 place a piston like this 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.189
 to one of the guys at all 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.790
 another track like this always have to 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.770
 1 of the quarters of the troops 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.770
 then we will put some wood 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.930
 windows that 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.960
 so there for now you can 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.770
 identify the system that obviously remains 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.040
 the same I take a little land 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.030
 so here is 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.890
 thanks to this earth blatter not know 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.260
 it's mostly to do my support 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.430
 because it takes support for the 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.430
 bacon works 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.710
 there he will work 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.510
 finally he wants then the whites do not know 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.740
 not why my ordi bug is there times 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.580
 puts him in black even very often it's me 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.230
 gene 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.380
 then we finish the support 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.180
 2nd 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.689
 push exactly the same thing 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.510
 and to finish the most important if your 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:37.799
 system will not work 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.799
 I take a little bit of blues 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.870
 i put inde redstone in the middle 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.400
 finally thanks to my leverage I'm going 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.159
 to be able to activate them 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.959
 just one thing I replace the ice by 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.730
 of the earth otherwise it will not work 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.950
 since we can not weigh a lever 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.290
 on the ice 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.590
 and so I can close and open my 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.590
 system 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.720
 small modification we can of course 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.410
 open the house and so much 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.480
 further 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.980
 we do not have to put the lever 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.900
 so close for example we could 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.310
 put on the other side doing 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.220
 continue the red stone so far down 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.110
 so 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.870
 prayssas and brain to see according to the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.720
 distance so that's the end of this 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.970
 tutorial 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.970
 thank you for watching and see you soon
