00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.020 
48 hours in particular is where we could
see<00:01:55.229> most<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> storms<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.520> strengthening

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
see most of the storms of strengthening

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.149 
see most of the storms of strengthening
so<00:01:57.689> depending<00:01:58.229> how<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.469> does<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.770> 24<00:01:59.130> hours

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
so depending how it does in 24 hours

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.590 
so depending how it does in 24 hours
time<00:01:59.399> we'll<00:01:59.759> probably<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.210> good<00:02:00.299> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
time we'll probably have a good in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.990 
time we'll probably have a good in
of<00:02:00.900> how<00:02:01.020> strong<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.470> will<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.830> when<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.700> reaches

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
of how strong it will be when it reaches

probably<00:03:00.750> getting<00:03:01.140> up<00:03:01.260> there<00:03:01.440> as<00:03:01.590> well<00:03:01.830> but

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
probably getting up there as well but

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.400 
probably getting up there as well but
probably<00:03:02.819> nothing<00:03:03.150> too<00:03:03.360> serious<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
probably nothing too serious there the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.160 
probably nothing too serious there the
eye<00:03:04.440> isn't<00:03:05.000> obvious<00:03:06.000> at<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.329> time<00:03:06.570> but<00:03:07.079> it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
eye isn't obvious at this time but it

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.390 
eye isn't obvious at this time but it
will<00:03:07.260> probably<00:03:07.440> pop<00:03:07.680> out<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.100> next<00:03:08.220> few

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
will probably pop out in the next few

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.190 
will probably pop out in the next few
hours<00:03:08.549> judging<00:03:09.239> by<00:03:09.480> how<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.720> satellite

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
hours judging by how the satellite

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.319 
hours judging by how the satellite
images<00:03:10.590> been<00:03:10.739> going<00:03:10.980> recently<00:03:11.180> but<00:03:12.180> yeah

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
images been going recently but yeah

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.160 
images been going recently but yeah
yeahs<00:03:12.570> is<00:03:13.579> coming<00:03:14.579> out<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.299> other<00:03:15.570> side<00:03:16.140> of

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
yeahs is coming out on the other side of

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.900 
yeahs is coming out on the other side of
the<00:03:16.350> storm<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.010> there<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.340> likely<00:03:17.670> end<00:03:17.820> of

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the storm so there is likely end of

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.729 
the storm so there is likely end of
tunnel<00:03:18.030> there<00:03:18.359> almost<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.019> clear<00:03:19.170> now<00:03:19.620> in

a few hours time most of the storms

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.349 
a few hours time most of the storms

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
obviously we could be seeing a very
