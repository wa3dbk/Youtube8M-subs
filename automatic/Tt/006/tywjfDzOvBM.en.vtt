00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.580
 that's a 28 ps 80 cubic centimeter 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.809
 single cylinder motor we open 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.150
 hydrogen plant have been converted 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:20.369
 First of all we have the gas tank 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.880
 removed and also the original carburetor 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.880
 unscrewed 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:33.930
 the gas supply is now via 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.989
 a small hose connecting the da 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.110
 where the carburetor is mounted beforehand 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.110
 was attached 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.120
 We also have the original rooms 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 changed 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.480
 We also have the crankshaft to two 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:09.110
 one stocky and on the big one 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:14.750
 a magnet glued to the gear 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:18.860
 a halt sensor activates the signal 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.680
 from the hall sensor will be in one 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:31.190
 small circuit processed and 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:34.990
 then the ignition coil controls the circuit 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.990
 the train would be like this 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:52.400
 the attitude of the time 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.450
 is quite easy here by the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.450
 swiveling lever 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.780
 dx and coil are supplied from one 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.780
 small power adapter
