00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.630
 As you can see we have a pretty menu 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.320
 dynamic that is very similar to the menu 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.849
 of a tablet or the windows 8 menu if 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.649
 which I prefer and good as you see we have 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.989
 a start tab in which we have 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.780
 some shortcuts to the most points 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.059
 important so saying we have pass 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.129

 alerts in which as you see the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.579
 right there are some little points that we 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.579
 they indicate that with the right stick we can 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.440
 keep moving and we have the news 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.450

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.729

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.460
 machine to heat engines before 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.960
 playing online is that for example also 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.390

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.530

 investigating and I'll upload also that 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.910
 try we also have to see the 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.530
 players in shape that we go the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.510
 Templates that are updated in the mode 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.799
 online for example it is put here that I 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.150
 a point of view has been raised in a 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.209
 point let's say they have been hostile to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.860
 go up and we also have the equipment in 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.290
 way as we see there is the athletic that has 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.180
 climbed four points was tico the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.860
 barcelona has worked 12 uploaded 7 good 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.120
 the improvements that each team and its 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.040
 position 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.440
 we went down to start a new 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.120
 race and to the right to load 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.610
 races and we already have a career created 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.260
 because to go directly to it 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.049
 clown clubs great way if you do not 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.400
 you have tried let's go I recommend it a hundred 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.200
 per cent to throw a few games with 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.519
 the colleagues that there are troops is very good at 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.459
 see this year how are we going to hope that 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.930
 it is a great improvement they have made 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.629
 I hope last year that I was not very thin 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.849
 some friendly matches online for 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.410
 play against colleagues there have 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.880
 improvement and the good shafts 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.260
 and then up we actually have the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.210
 material another personality more like in 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.560
 the home tab that had 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.530
 to access this mode that also 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.000
 it is very handsome mode seasons online and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.490
 the novelty that if we give it to the right 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.920
 we have cooperative seasons in a 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.900
 new addition in this game for 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.030
 play two against two with a colleague then 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.790
 this is a season online and you play 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.200
 against two people how good you can 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.430
 create a career in a career 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.020
 cooperative forgiveness season 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.120
 independent with each friend and we go that 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.350
 will be saved individually and with 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.820
 colleague that you choose then come up to 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.800
 this first edition and take a few good 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.120
 times that is pretty good in case not 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.400
 you have people to play you raise it little what 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.780
 you have here and you play in two against two and 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.940
 he is very cool 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.010
 we will approve but come on it's very good 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.920
 paints as stability as other years 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.140
 to warm up making the passes well 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.450
 the shots get better and in our 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.830
 quality of game 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.240
 and then we also have choose player 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.760
 well to select the player that 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.990
 we want to have as you know in the previous 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.340
 of the game, so you go out to do 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.630
 games or to shoot on goal as 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.340
 good to choose when we think that you 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.260
 like diodo this journalist who likes 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.330
 in this new is Christian or a goalkeeper 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.850
 but we go more or less already you know what 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.130
 is 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.530
 more I do not know what it is and later 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.440
 I will investigate and go up to see what else things 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.260
 there we have another tab above it would be 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.930
 fc the catalog in which with the points 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.550
 what do we get together be by we take out 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.300
 after each game then we can 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.200
 redeem for celebrations kits 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.810
 coin multipliers for ultimate 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.660
 team improvements for the player of the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.600
 clubs but good last year but 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.510
 I imagine they have put more new things 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.740
 down the markers to see who 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.110
 has more ace level by fc 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.969
 and second for it to be no third good 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.819
 That's wrong 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:47.489
 among my friends we go that the whole world 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:50.099
 it's so good I'm not and then we have 

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:51.389
 good appliances we choose a team at 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.239
 start the game we ask what team 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.769
 we want to support myself chosen the old 

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:57.059
 madrid how rare has any video been seen 

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:58.340
 from another soccer game you know from 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.020
 what 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.030
 and well, it cost me structure to 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.030
 that our team is there to the fullest 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:10.910
 my alerts because nothing would be for what 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:13.250
 I see it puts a fifa information 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.990
 sergio aguero slow my and pedrosa have 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.270
 won a web week team position 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.200
 and it says that some friend is playing another 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.250
 I play the interface well 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.410
 information like that of what is 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.770
 happening with our environment and the 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.420
 cifa news 14 friends news

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.619
 colleagues to continue a little 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.629
 and then the last tab that the 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:34.369
 customize good settings to change 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.579
 all the camera game stuff 

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:38.749
 Controls help repair and so on 

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:40.129
 adjustments in line good if we want before 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:42.919
 the camera for online mode if 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:45.139
 we want to adjust the volume all that in 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.680
 profile because it was to see 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.659
 our things that we have edited edit 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.520
 teams then to change the templates 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.879
 if we want to update the if we want 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.719
 change a player in some transfer like that 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.719
 of estrangis 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:06.199
 the nerves the nerves 114 puts that is 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.210
 to buy downloadable content not what 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.099
 I have looked, I do not know if they will take something new, 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.249
 I know if in the future some way 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.469
 for the world already I will investigate it already 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:17.029
 others go up to see what is center of 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.219
 creation puts manages your content 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:20.509
 favorite generated by the user 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.060
 I also do not know what it is and they can be edited 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.289
 sneakers and download them already good I caught 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.330
 the premise of gangs like others 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:29.060
 years but good and later what 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.340
 investigate and I will upload each player then 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.740
 that some player for clubs or mode 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.080
 for career mode it will then edit 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.449
 player so if we want to modify the 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.089
 height the eyes the face we go from our 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:43.839
 character created previously the 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:43.839
 player if we want 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.159
 repetitions room that this I do not know if 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.530
 they were at home I think not if not 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.210
 I remember badly that it is for us what 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.889
 we will keep the best plays 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.270
 that we have saved is pretty cool 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.770
 I imagine that there will be no longer updated 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.330
 look again 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.680
 music custom chants touch ya 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.379
 it was three seasons ago it seems 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.479
 oil from previous games to climb 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.770
 if we have change the comments or the 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:08.319
 canticles then we can update with 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.719
 us ideas by tracks then to see 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:11.860
 the soundtrack of the game that usually 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:13.479
 be pretty good they have at least 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.770
 catchy songs to be grateful 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:15.520
 rather not how progress they have it 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.750
 three songs 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.550
 unaies is the guantanamera that 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:22.060
 I personally already have a little 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.319
 disrupted and finally the lawsuits by 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.509
 good to see all the people who have 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:27.150
 made the game where angel created the 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:29.620
