second<00:00:18.660> second<00:00:19.350> match<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.740> they<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
second second match that they have a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.720 
second second match that they have a
chance<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.430> sort<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.670> get<00:00:21.449> get<00:00:21.930> used<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.260> the

the<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> Swiss<00:01:39.659> crowd<00:01:39.899> it's<00:01:40.500> unusual<00:01:40.979> because

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the the Swiss crowd it's unusual because

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.649 
the the Swiss crowd it's unusual because
there's<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.640> many<00:01:41.880> Swiss<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.479> world

I'm confident for the weekend doubles
it's<00:02:07.619> always<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:08.070> of<00:02:08.100> em<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.000> up

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
it's always a bit of em you know it's up

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.400 
it's always a bit of em you know it's up
in<00:02:09.329> the<00:02:09.360> air<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.720> never<00:02:09.899> quite<00:02:10.079> know<00:02:10.140> what's

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
in the air you never quite know what's

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.140 
in the air you never quite know what's
going<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> happen<00:02:10.679> especially<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.910> kind

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
going to happen especially on this kind

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.270 
going to happen especially on this kind
of<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.269> court<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.870> think<00:02:13.079> it's<00:02:13.320> a<00:02:13.470> sin<00:02:13.980> open

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
of a court so I think it's a sin open

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.680 
of a court so I think it's a sin open
doubles<00:02:14.579> with<00:02:15.060> maybe<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.360> slight<00:02:15.570> advantage

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
doubles with maybe a slight advantage

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.199 
doubles with maybe a slight advantage
for<00:02:16.170> us<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:17.190> doesn't<00:02:17.489> mean<00:02:17.610> much<00:02:17.760> in

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
for us but that doesn't mean much in

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.680 
for us but that doesn't mean much in
tomorrow's<00:02:18.570> match<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.840> think<00:02:18.900> thanks
