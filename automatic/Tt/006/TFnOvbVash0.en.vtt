so<00:00:00.329> much<00:00:13.610> learning<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:32.030> has<00:00:33.030> made<00:00:33.270> use<00:00:33.480> of

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
so much learning and has made use of

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.010 
so much learning and has made use of
technology<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.829> taken<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:36.120> first

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
technology is taken right I think first

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.530 
technology is taken right I think first
of<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.260> technology<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.309> pedagogies<00:00:38.730> they

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
of all technology with pedagogies they

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.959 
of all technology with pedagogies they
work<00:00:39.750> wonders<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.469> think<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> entire<00:00:41.520> system

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
work wonders I think the entire system

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.330 
work wonders I think the entire system
is<00:00:42.090> very<00:00:42.239> revolutionary<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:43.680> has<00:00:43.920> given<00:00:44.219> us

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
is very revolutionary it has given us

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.760 
is very revolutionary it has given us
one<00:00:44.670> perspective<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.480> new<00:00:45.649> perspective<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> new

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
one perspective a new perspective a new

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.549 
one perspective a new perspective a new
dimension<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.730> entire<00:00:48.200> education<00:00:49.200> sector

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
dimension to the entire education sector

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.000 
dimension to the entire education sector
fecund<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.180> am<00:00:51.750> very<00:00:52.050> fortunate<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.980> be

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
fecund I think I am very fortunate to be

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.060 
fecund I think I am very fortunate to be
one<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.590> carving<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> destiny

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
one of the you know carving the destiny

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.090 
one of the you know carving the destiny
of<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.250> country<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.780> feel<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> person

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
of a country and I feel as a person

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.069 
of a country and I feel as a person
because<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.910> moved<00:01:00.090> around<00:01:00.359> from<00:01:00.660> Assam

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
because I have moved around from Assam

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.219 
because I have moved around from Assam
to<00:01:01.500> first<00:01:02.219> abroad<00:01:02.579> South<00:01:03.270> America<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> Assam

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
to first abroad South America to Assam

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.000 
to first abroad South America to Assam
now<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> tell<00:01:04.860> me

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
now to tell me

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.149 
now to tell me
so<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.610> think<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.330> find<00:01:06.990> education<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.710> our<00:01:07.860> times

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
so I think I find education in our times

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.330 
so I think I find education in our times
an<00:01:08.490> education<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.540> children<00:01:09.990> miles<00:01:10.890> apart

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
an education of my children miles apart

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
an education of my children miles apart
and<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.030> life<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.510> we

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and I think this is life all about we

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440 
and I think this is life all about we
learning<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.189> an<00:01:14.340> ongoing<00:01:14.520> process

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
learning is an ongoing process

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.990 
learning is an ongoing process
it<00:01:15.780> never<00:01:16.049> ends<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.650> guess<00:01:17.340> we're<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.580> one

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
it never ends I guess we're just one

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.539 
it never ends I guess we're just one
face<00:01:18.270> next<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.740> asked<00:01:20.130> about<00:01:20.280> our

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
face next and you just asked about our

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.820 
face next and you just asked about our
position<00:01:20.850> being<00:01:21.240> challenged<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.530> I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
position being challenged not at all I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.700 
position being challenged not at all I
think<00:01:23.340> teachers<00:01:23.580> are<00:01:24.090> teachers<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.229> course

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
think teachers are teachers of course

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.859 
think teachers are teachers of course

guides<00:01:32.640> through<00:01:33.360> technology<00:01:33.990> will<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.710> only

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
guides through technology will not only

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.429 
guides through technology will not only
incorporate<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> best<00:01:36.060> see<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.140> deal<00:01:37.409> with

we are towards globalization if I talk
of<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.790> technology<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.840> very<00:01:58.110> first

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
of and I see technology the very first

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.719 
of and I see technology the very first
path<00:01:59.549> to<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.450> success<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.049> globalization<00:02:01.770> so

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
path to the success of globalization so

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.490 
path to the success of globalization so
it's<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.450> blessing<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.469> blessing

are<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:41.320> comfortable<00:02:41.650> with<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.100> very<00:02:42.310> concept

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
are so comfortable with the very concept

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.240 
are so comfortable with the very concept
I<00:02:42.970> think<00:02:43.300> literature<00:02:44.080> some<00:02:44.650> boring<00:02:45.070> and

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
I think literature some boring and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.480 
I think literature some boring and
monotonous<00:02:46.140> they'd<00:02:47.140> given<00:02:47.320> way<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.590> real

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
monotonous they'd given way to real

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.310 
monotonous they'd given way to real
interesting<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.660> must<00:02:50.050> say<00:02:50.170> more

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
interesting and I must say more

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.110 
interesting and I must say more
interactive<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.070> we<00:02:51.640> are<00:02:51.730> making<00:02:51.910> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
interactive and we are making the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.750 
interactive and we are making the
abstract<00:02:52.540> concepts<00:02:53.050> very<00:02:53.530> very<00:02:53.770> concrete<00:02:54.190> so

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
abstract concepts very very concrete so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.400 
abstract concepts very very concrete so
we<00:02:54.790> are<00:02:54.970> reaching<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.300> children<00:02:55.690> through<00:02:56.260> and
