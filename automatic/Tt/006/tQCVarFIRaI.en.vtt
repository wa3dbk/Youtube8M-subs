started to happen the likelihood is if

started to happen the likelihood is if

you keep pitching it's probably going to
progress<00:01:56.540> but<00:01:57.540> there's<00:01:57.869> no<00:01:58.049> guarantee<00:01:58.079> that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
progress but there's no guarantee that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.069 
progress but there's no guarantee that
it<00:01:58.920> will<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.399> mean<00:01:59.850> some<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.329> conservative

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
it will I mean some of the conservative

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.289 
it will I mean some of the conservative
treatments<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.640> some<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.240> the

treatments for this and some of the
things<00:02:03.540> he's<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.229> consider

things he's going to have to consider

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.449 
things he's going to have to consider
right<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:05.340> his<00:02:06.180> options<00:02:06.719> are<00:02:07.020> rest<00:02:07.979> along

with<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.670> corticosteroid<00:02:09.080> injection<00:02:10.080> which

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
with a corticosteroid injection which

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.410 
with a corticosteroid injection which
can<00:02:10.709> decrease<00:02:11.190> some<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.610> inflammation<00:02:12.300> in

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
can decrease some of the inflammation in

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.860 
can decrease some of the inflammation in

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the hip

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.289

and<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:14.040> know<00:02:14.159> if<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.489> don't<00:02:14.670> respond<00:02:15.150> to

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
and you know if you don't respond to

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.020 
and you know if you don't respond to
that<00:02:15.510> within<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:16.080> months<00:02:16.470> period<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.730> next

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that within a months period the next

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.479 
that within a months period the next
option<00:02:18.180> would<00:02:18.930> be<00:02:18.989> surgery<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.980> these<00:02:20.310> are

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
option would be surgery and these are

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.680 
option would be surgery and these are
things<00:02:20.730> he's<00:02:20.909> going<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.360> weigh<00:02:21.659> out

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
things he's going to have to weigh out

things he's going to have to weigh out
Richie<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.909> conservative<00:02:24.720> treatment<00:02:25.170> do

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
Richie it is conservative treatment do

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.630 
Richie it is conservative treatment do
you<00:02:25.409> think<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:25.709> really<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.159> the<00:02:26.310> table<00:02:26.610> for

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
you think it's really on the table for

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.309 
you think it's really on the table for
an<00:02:26.819> elite<00:02:27.120> athlete<00:02:27.150> who<00:02:27.690> has<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.930> perform<00:02:28.080> in

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
an elite athlete who has to perform in

an elite athlete who has to perform in
an<00:02:28.440> elite<00:02:28.650> level<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.099> that's<00:02:29.489> that's<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
an elite level and that's that's the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.979 
an elite level and that's that's the
question<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:33.000> something<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.690> always

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
question it's something you can always

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.949 
question it's something you can always
try<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:35.159> his<00:02:35.430> situation<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.750> team

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
try in his situation and in the team

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.309 
try in his situation and in the team
situation<00:02:37.709> there's<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.730> timetable<00:02:39.319> component

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
situation there's a timetable component

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.100 
situation there's a timetable component
and<00:02:40.940> it's<00:02:41.940> something<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.420> he's<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:43.019> to

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
and it's something that he's going to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.589 
and it's something that he's going to
have<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.530> sit<00:02:43.920> down<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.280> consider<00:02:44.430> all<00:02:44.940> his

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
have to sit down and consider all his

have to sit down and consider all his
options<00:02:45.629> I've<00:02:46.260> seen<00:02:46.890> conservative<00:02:47.519> therapy

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
options I've seen conservative therapy

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.800 
options I've seen conservative therapy
work<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:49.680> lot<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:50.760> has<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:51.329> with<00:02:51.569> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
work and a lot of it has to do with the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.530 
work and a lot of it has to do with the
degree<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.319> tear<00:02:52.700> certainly<00:02:53.700> with<00:02:54.000> some

degree of the tear certainly with some

minor frame of the labrum you have a

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.949 
minor frame of the labrum you have a
better<00:02:57.299> shot<00:02:57.690> if<00:02:58.159> there's<00:02:59.159> fraying<00:02:59.670> and

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
better shot if there's fraying and

wore<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:10.109> to<00:03:10.560> work<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.069> get<00:03:11.790> him<00:03:11.970> through

October would he still then have to have
it<00:03:14.280> fixed<00:03:14.519> not<00:03:15.269> necessarily<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:16.049> he's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
it fixed not necessarily if he's

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.129 
it fixed not necessarily if he's
symptom-free<00:03:16.500> why<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.250> surgery<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.720> the

it<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:27.150> there<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> chance<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.410> he<00:03:28.560> had

a<00:03:55.620> quicker<00:03:55.889> recovery<00:03:56.160> there's<00:03:56.699> still<00:03:56.910> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
a quicker recovery there's still a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.580 
a quicker recovery there's still a
period<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.389> non-weight-bearing<00:03:57.810> after<00:03:58.470> the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.439 
period of non-weight-bearing after the
surgery<00:03:58.829> there's<00:03:59.430> rehab<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.090> goes<00:04:00.239> along

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
surgery there's rehab that goes along

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.500 
surgery there's rehab that goes along
with<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.980> if<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.579> have<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.819> do<00:04:03.120> those<00:04:03.299> other

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
with it if you have to do those other

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.659 
with it if you have to do those other
things<00:04:03.900> repair<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.650> labrum<00:04:04.859> then<00:04:05.519> you're

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
things repair the labrum then you're

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.280 
things repair the labrum then you're
talking<00:04:06.060> about<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.449> have<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.750> wait<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:06.959> that

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
talking about you have to wait for that

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.500 
talking about you have to wait for that
tissue<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.739> heal<00:04:07.859> back<00:04:08.310> down<00:04:08.669> to<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.000> bone<00:04:09.209> and

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
tissue to heal back down to the bone and

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.849 
tissue to heal back down to the bone and
you're<00:04:09.870> talking<00:04:10.230> about<00:04:10.379> somewhere<00:04:10.799> between

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
you're talking about somewhere between

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.009 
you're talking about somewhere between
an<00:04:11.310> eight<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.699> twelve<00:04:11.910> week<00:04:12.120> theory<00:04:12.419> and<00:04:12.660> then

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
an eight and twelve week theory and then

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.080 
an eight and twelve week theory and then
you<00:04:13.139> have<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.319> rehab<00:04:13.829> to<00:04:14.069> follow<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.639> so

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
you have a rehab to follow that so

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.270 
you have a rehab to follow that so
that's<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.419> bit<00:04:15.629> of<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.900> more<00:04:16.500> lengthy<00:04:16.709> recovery

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
that's a bit of a more lengthy recovery

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.210 
that's a bit of a more lengthy recovery
and<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:18.539> guess<00:04:18.870> less<00:04:19.139> predictable<00:04:19.530> on<00:04:20.010> that

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
and I guess less predictable on that

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.550 
and I guess less predictable on that
timetable<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:21.120> wanted<00:04:21.390> to<00:04:21.479> get<00:04:21.599> more<00:04:22.229> into<00:04:22.469> the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
timetable I wanted to get more into the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.420 
timetable I wanted to get more into the
acetabulum<00:04:23.280> if<00:04:23.490> we<00:04:23.640> could

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
acetabulum if we could

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.719 
acetabulum if we could
no<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.449> but<00:04:26.259> i<00:04:26.289> do<00:04:26.410> want<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.830> know<00:04:26.949> is<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.580> this

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
no I but i do want to know is is this

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.180 
no I but i do want to know is is this
arthroscopic<00:04:28.509> does<00:04:28.840> he<00:04:29.050> get<00:04:29.229> cut<00:04:29.530> wide<00:04:29.770> open

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
arthroscopic does he get cut wide open

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.400 
arthroscopic does he get cut wide open
or<00:04:30.370> are<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.699> going<00:04:31.030> with<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.180> camera<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.780> and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
or are you going with a camera and and

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.370 
or are you going with a camera and and
smaller<00:04:32.770> instruments<00:04:33.310> this<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.759> done

smaller instruments this is done
arthroscopically<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.880> guess<00:04:37.449> he<00:04:37.630> went<00:04:37.750> up

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
arthroscopically and I guess he went up

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.430 
arthroscopically and I guess he went up
