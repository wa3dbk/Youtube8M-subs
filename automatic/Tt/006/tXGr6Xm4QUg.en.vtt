over my eyelids but right now I'm just

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.790 
over my eyelids but right now I'm just
kind<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.720> buffing<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.140> into<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.500> skin<00:02:36.770> I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
kind of buffing it into the skin I

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
kind of buffing it into the skin I
didn't<00:02:37.190> do<00:02:37.280> my<00:02:37.400> brows<00:02:37.640> yet<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.330> can<00:02:38.510> kind<00:02:38.810> of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
didn't do my brows yet so I can kind of

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:55.640 
didn't do my brows yet so I can kind of
you<00:02:40.820> know<00:02:40.940> not<00:02:41.120> have<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.390> be<00:02:41.480> quite<00:02:41.780> as<00:02:41.810> careful

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.800 

so<00:02:56.129> I<00:02:56.160> think<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.700> super<00:02:56.940> fast<00:02:57.390> the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
so I think it's super fast the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.650 
so I think it's super fast the
foundation<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.620> really<00:02:59.099> what<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.510> like

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
foundation is really what so it's like

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.250 
foundation is really what so it's like
workable<00:03:01.849> and<00:03:02.849> I<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.150> find<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.420> super<00:03:04.110> easy

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
workable and I just find it super easy

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.100 
workable and I just find it super easy
to<00:03:04.590> apply<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.360> didn't<00:03:06.360> do<00:03:06.480> any<00:03:06.720> sort<00:03:06.989> of

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
to apply I didn't do any sort of

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.690 
to apply I didn't do any sort of
concealer<00:03:07.590> or<00:03:07.650> anything<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.280> guys<00:03:08.430> can

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
concealer or anything so you guys can

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.180 
concealer or anything so you guys can
see<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:10.019> amount<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.319> coverage<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.040> did

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
see the amount of coverage and I did

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.430 
see the amount of coverage and I did
have<00:03:11.370> some<00:03:11.459> redness<00:03:12.000> today

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.990 

so<00:03:17.920> it's<00:03:18.100> pretty<00:03:18.220> much<00:03:18.340> dead<00:03:18.670> if<00:03:18.820> there's

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
so it's pretty much dead if there's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.490 
so it's pretty much dead if there's
anything<00:03:19.240> on<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.570> back<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.840> my<00:03:19.900> hand<00:03:20.290> I'll

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
anything on the back of my hand I'll

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.420 
anything on the back of my hand I'll
just<00:03:20.970> put<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.000> buff<00:03:22.210> it<00:03:22.360> down<00:03:22.390> my<00:03:22.720> neck<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:26.430> like

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
just put a buff it down my neck and like

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.780 
just put a buff it down my neck and like
I<00:03:27.610> said<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:27.880> can<00:03:28.060> continue<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:29.400> buff<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.670> out

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
I said you can continue to buff it out

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.280 
I said you can continue to buff it out
for<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.180> little<00:03:31.390> bit<00:03:31.630> just<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.900> get<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.200> more

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
for a little bit just to get a more

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.430 
for a little bit just to get a more
flawless<00:03:32.740> look

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.400 

okay

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
okay

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.680 
okay
and<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.100> now<00:03:42.250> what<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.490> do<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:43.000> kind<00:03:43.210> of<00:03:43.270> set<00:03:43.540> the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
and so now what I do to kind of set the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.530 
and so now what I do to kind of set the
powder<00:03:43.930> since<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.470> gives<00:03:44.650> such<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:44.890> dewy<00:03:45.190> finish

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
powder since it gives such a dewy finish

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.960 
powder since it gives such a dewy finish
is<00:03:46.540> like<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.560> mentioned<00:03:47.950> before<00:03:47.980> he's<00:03:48.460> a<00:03:48.490> mac

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
is like I mentioned before he's a mac

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.020 
is like I mentioned before he's a mac
mineralize<00:03:49.450> skinfinish<00:03:50.100> looks<00:03:51.100> like<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.640> it

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
mineralize skinfinish looks like that it

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.780 
mineralize skinfinish looks like that it

which is why it's absolutely gigantic or

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.710 
which is why it's absolutely gigantic or
you<00:03:59.920> could<00:04:00.130> just<00:04:00.160> use<00:04:00.460> a<00:04:00.760> little<00:04:01.210> synthetic

that<00:04:08.140> today<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:09.630> kind<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.660> swirl<00:04:10.960> it<00:04:11.140> in<00:04:11.260> my

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
that today I kind of swirl it in my

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.490 
that today I kind of swirl it in my
product<00:04:11.770> a<00:04:11.890> little<00:04:12.010> bit<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:13.660> press<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.170> into

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
product a little bit and I press it into

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.129 
product a little bit and I press it into
my<00:04:14.650> skin<00:04:15.570> starting<00:04:16.570> around<00:04:16.690> my<00:04:16.900> nose

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.990 

and<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:22.770> find<00:04:23.039> that<00:04:23.129> this<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.520> great<00:04:23.789> way<00:04:23.969> to

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
and I find that this is a great way to

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.360 
and I find that this is a great way to
cover<00:04:24.569> up<00:04:24.719> pores<00:04:25.169> I<00:04:25.560> mean<00:04:25.740> I'm<00:04:25.889> not<00:04:26.039> sure<00:04:26.250> if

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
cover up pores I mean I'm not sure if

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.149 
cover up pores I mean I'm not sure if
it'll<00:04:26.550> work<00:04:26.610> for<00:04:26.939> everyone<00:04:27.270> but<00:04:27.599> it<00:04:28.259> tends<00:04:29.039> to

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
it'll work for everyone but it tends to

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.350 
it'll work for everyone but it tends to
work<00:04:29.250> really<00:04:29.370> well<00:04:29.759> for<00:04:29.819> me

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
work really well for me

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.170 
work really well for me
so<00:04:30.449> I<00:04:30.509> just<00:04:30.659> kind<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.870> Pat<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.229> into<00:04:31.409> the<00:04:31.590> skin

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
so I just kind of Pat it into the skin

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.869 
so I just kind of Pat it into the skin
in<00:04:33.180> any<00:04:33.539> sort<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:33.990> area<00:04:34.289> that<00:04:34.349> you<00:04:34.620> might<00:04:35.400> be<00:04:35.849> a

in any sort of area that you might be a

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.510 
in any sort of area that you might be a
little<00:04:36.360> bit<00:04:36.479> oilier<00:04:36.990> so<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:38.009> may<00:04:38.159> be<00:04:38.219> long

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
little bit oilier so it may be long

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.860 
little bit oilier so it may be long
before<00:04:38.699> had<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.210> bit<00:04:39.509> of<00:04:39.539> a<00:04:42.289> chin<00:04:44.449> and<00:04:45.449> then<00:04:45.719> I'm
