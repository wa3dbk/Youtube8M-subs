X does this is still a good addition to

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.890 
X does this is still a good addition to
have<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.310> because<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.880> metal<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:37.569> not

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
have it because it is metal and it's not

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.490 
have it because it is metal and it's not
flimsy<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.180> plastic<00:02:40.420> cooler<00:02:41.079> master

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500

one<00:02:41.620> but<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.940> one<00:02:42.970> in<00:02:43.269> my<00:02:43.299> case<00:02:43.660> once<00:02:44.079> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
one but the one in my case once you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.970 
one but the one in my case once you
mount<00:02:44.500> your<00:02:44.590> ssdna<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.489> sort<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:47.470> loses<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
mount your ssdna it sort of it loses the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.490 
mount your ssdna it sort of it loses the
flimsiness<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.959> converter<00:02:50.349> and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
flimsiness so we have the converter and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.900 
flimsiness so we have the converter and
then<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.860> some<00:02:51.069> screws<00:02:51.340> in<00:02:51.489> here<00:02:51.700> some

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
then we have some screws in here some

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.599 
then we have some screws in here some
silver<00:02:52.450> screws<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:53.380> reduce<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.920> vibration<00:02:54.069> of

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
silver screws to reduce the vibration of

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
the mounting if you have a normal clip

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.289 
the mounting if you have a normal clip
in<00:02:59.200> mounting<00:02:59.530> system<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.280> can<00:03:00.430> just<00:03:00.640> screw

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
in mounting system you can just screw

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.550 
in mounting system you can just screw
the<00:03:01.600> screws<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.109> and<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.790> will<00:03:03.940> reduce<00:03:04.170> noise<00:03:05.170> I

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
the screws in and it will reduce noise I

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.039 
the screws in and it will reduce noise I
think<00:03:06.010> yeah<00:03:06.280> just<00:03:07.209> kidding<00:03:07.480> or<00:03:07.600> reduce<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
think yeah just kidding or reduce the

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.650 
think yeah just kidding or reduce the
noise<00:03:08.139> which<00:03:08.380> off<00:03:08.970> I'd<00:03:09.970> carries<00:03:10.299> anything

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
noise which off I'd carries anything

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.750 
noise which off I'd carries anything

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
SSD this is very pretty probably one of

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.430 
SSD this is very pretty probably one of
the<00:03:18.850> surprising<00:03:19.389> things<00:03:19.660> about<00:03:19.780> holding<00:03:20.350> an

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
the surprising things about holding an

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.620 
the surprising things about holding an
SSD<00:03:20.859> is<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.130> fact<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.430> it's<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.329> small

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
SSD is the fact that it's just so small

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.729 
SSD is the fact that it's just so small
and<00:03:22.900> light<00:03:24.239> but<00:03:25.239> yeah<00:03:25.480> anyway<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.109> just<00:03:26.139> wanted

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
and light but yeah anyway I just wanted

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.129 
and light but yeah anyway I just wanted
to<00:03:26.799> give<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.010> scars<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.370> look<00:03:27.840> I'm<00:03:28.840> not<00:03:28.989> going

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
to take it out the box because I'm not

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.569 
to take it out the box because I'm not
