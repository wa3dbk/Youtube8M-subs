it's<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.519> decoder<00:00:29.519> card<00:00:29.910> basically<00:00:30.769> it's<00:00:31.769> about

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it's a decoder card basically it's about

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.840 
it's a decoder card basically it's about
a<00:00:32.070> credit<00:00:32.640> card<00:00:33.000> sized<00:00:33.329> piece<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> plastic<00:00:34.850> and

a credit card sized piece of plastic and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.780 
a credit card sized piece of plastic and
it's<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.540> pretty<00:00:36.780> thick<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.620> probably<00:00:38.520> on

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
it's it's pretty thick it's probably on

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.010 
it's it's pretty thick it's probably on
the<00:00:38.910> order<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.620> three<00:00:40.620> millimeters<00:00:41.160> thick<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
the order of three millimeters thick and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.540 
the order of three millimeters thick and
it's<00:00:43.020> supposed<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.590> able<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.829> read<00:00:44.280> this

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
it's supposed to be able to read this

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.360 
it's supposed to be able to read this
this<00:00:45.390> round<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.020> give<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:49.129> indication<00:00:50.129> on

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
this round and give you a indication on

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.900 
this round and give you a indication on
whether<00:00:50.879> your<00:00:51.090> coin<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:51.870> boolean<00:00:52.379> is

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
whether your coin or your boolean is

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.700 
whether your coin or your boolean is
valid<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:55.190> legit<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.510> I'll<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.199> kind<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.530> zoom

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
valid or legit so I'll just kind of zoom

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.979 
valid or legit so I'll just kind of zoom
in<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.609> once<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.629> turn<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
in here and once you turn the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
in here and once you turn the
orientation<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> certain<00:01:02.160> direction<00:01:02.340> it's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
orientation a certain direction it's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.020 
orientation a certain direction it's
supposed<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.769> read<00:01:06.740> valid<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.670> looks<00:01:08.850> like

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
supposed to read valid so it looks like

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.289 
supposed to read valid so it looks like
this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> legitimate<00:01:10.939> sunshine<00:01:11.939> minting

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
this is a legitimate sunshine minting

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600 
this is a legitimate sunshine minting
round<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> turn<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.189> ninety

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
round and when you turn this ninety

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.870 
round and when you turn this ninety
degrees<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.330> supposed<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> give<00:01:15.930> you

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
degrees it's supposed to give you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.760 
degrees it's supposed to give you
basically<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.000> sunburst<00:01:18.750> design<00:01:21.619> maybe<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
basically a sunburst design maybe a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.030 
basically a sunburst design maybe a
little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.130> hard<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:24.080> make<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.700> there<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.820> is

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
little bit hard to make out there it is

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.370 
little bit hard to make out there it is
see<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.869> light<00:01:31.110> being

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
see if I can get it with the light being

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.749 
see if I can get it with the light being
as<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:34.250> there<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.400> go

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
as it is there we go

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.700 
as it is there we go
bye<00:01:36.060> shadow<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.490> shield<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> light

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
bye shadow if I shield some of the light

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
bye shadow if I shield some of the light
you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.890> actually<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:42.649> so<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.939> goes

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you can actually see that so it goes

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.609 
you can actually see that so it goes
from<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:47.100> sunshine<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.899> ninety

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
from the sunshine and then ninety

00:01:49.619 --> 00:02:05.780 
from the sunshine and then ninety
degrees<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.700> goes<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:54.530> valid<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.640> that's

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
degrees it goes to valid so that's

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.380 
degrees it goes to valid so that's
pretty<00:02:05.969> clever<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.600> thought<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.170> was<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:08.390> neat

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
pretty clever I thought that was a neat

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.589 
pretty clever I thought that was a neat
new<00:02:09.629> feature<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.910> I'll<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.150> show<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.330> on

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
new feature and I'll just show you on

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.210 
new feature and I'll just show you on
all<00:02:12.780> these<00:02:14.300> see<00:02:15.300> if<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.629> get<00:02:15.780> them<00:02:15.900> all<00:02:16.860> to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
all these see if I can get them all to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.949 
all these see if I can get them all to
line<00:02:17.489> up<00:02:17.670> properly<00:02:18.620> valid<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:20.400> piece<00:02:20.870> here<00:02:21.870> we

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
line up properly valid one piece here we

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.900 
line up properly valid one piece here we
saw<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.230> middle<00:02:22.709> but<00:02:23.099> I'll<00:02:23.430> show<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.670> again

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
saw the middle but I'll show you again

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.820 
saw the middle but I'll show you again
and<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:27.510> last<00:02:27.690> piece<00:02:28.020> would<00:02:28.319> make<00:02:28.530> sure<00:02:28.680> this

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
and the last piece would make sure this

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.640 
and the last piece would make sure this
is<00:02:29.010> good<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.060> go

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
is good to go

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.619 
is good to go
so<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.489> fact<00:02:32.790> says<00:02:33.150> valid<00:02:34.940> also<00:02:35.940> wanted<00:02:36.450> to

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
so it in fact says valid also wanted to

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.080 
so it in fact says valid also wanted to
uh<00:02:37.310> those<00:02:38.310> are<00:02:38.430> my<00:02:38.550> first<00:02:38.790> sunshine<00:02:39.360> minting

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
uh those are my first sunshine minting

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.020 
uh those are my first sunshine minting
rounds<00:02:42.090> also<00:02:42.870> wanted<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.170> go<00:02:43.290> bar<00:02:43.560> style<00:02:44.030> so

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
rounds also wanted to go bar style so

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.930 
rounds also wanted to go bar style so
we'll<00:02:45.450> check<00:02:45.629> out<00:02:45.810> their<00:02:45.959> new<00:02:45.989> bars<00:02:46.730> it's<00:02:47.730> got

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
we'll check out their new bars it's got

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.020 
we'll check out their new bars it's got
the<00:02:48.120> sunburst<00:02:48.690> design<00:02:48.780> on<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.260> back<00:02:50.030> let's

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
the sunburst design on the back let's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.550 
the sunburst design on the back let's
just<00:02:51.239> try<00:02:51.450> their<00:02:51.629> bars<00:02:51.870> out<00:02:52.110> as<00:02:52.290> well<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:54.560> I've

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
just try their bars out as well so I've

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.149 
just try their bars out as well so I've
got<00:02:55.860> them<00:02:56.450> oriented<00:02:57.450> vertically<00:02:58.019> I'll<00:02:58.920> just

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159

a<00:03:06.390> lot<00:03:06.810> easier<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.319> orient<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.450> bars<00:03:09.450> because

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
a lot easier to orient the bars because

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.059 
a lot easier to orient the bars because
they<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.530> right<00:03:11.159> angles<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.760> course<00:03:13.069> and

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
they have right angles of course and

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.830 
they have right angles of course and
lastly<00:03:14.670> let's<00:03:15.709> try<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.830> get<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.659> light<00:03:18.659> to

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
lastly let's try and get the light to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.630 
lastly let's try and get the light to
show<00:03:19.050> that<00:03:20.989> ballot<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.709> we'll<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.340> upside

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
show that ballot and we'll go upside

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.550 
show that ballot and we'll go upside
down<00:03:23.879> or<00:03:24.120> 90<00:03:24.959> degrees<00:03:25.819> see<00:03:26.819> if<00:03:26.879> I<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.470> show<00:03:28.470> you
