00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.910 
know we're thick enough especially with
those<00:03:29.290> splines<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.859> there<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.250> support<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.819> rod

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
those splines in there to support a rod

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.640 
those splines in there to support a rod
so<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:32.950> had<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.400> go<00:03:33.519> with<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:33.969> option<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:35.500> now

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
so I had to go with this option but now

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.089 
so I had to go with this option but now
another<00:03:35.980> option<00:03:36.129> that<00:03:36.819> was<00:03:37.510> presented<00:03:38.139> to<00:03:39.069> me

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
another option that was presented to me

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.860

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
that was a little bit late and I might

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.099 
that was a little bit late and I might
try<00:03:41.079> another<00:03:41.500> sewing<00:03:41.799> box<00:03:42.540> with<00:03:43.540> this<00:03:43.719> option

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109
