00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello to all I find you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.690
 today for a video before 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.030
 books and more particularly from 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 reading that I plan for 2015 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.119
 you know me I'm not 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.709
 kind of challenge but I have 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.170
 thought a little bit and I thought 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.480
 that I had to choose tell the world that I 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.070
 absolutely wanted to read in 2015 I 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.370
 owns some I'll have to 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 buy me others that I have not yet 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.590
 but I'm really determined to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.010
 read 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.350
 first of all the saga at the foundation asia 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.579
 marked one of the highlights of science 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.050
 fiction and as I intend to 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.260
 talk to you soon about science fiction 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.270
 I had at all costs want and need to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.030
 read to read this saga actually 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.940
 especially because the brother of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.860
 christopher nolan will adapt it in series 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 so I think it's time for me to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.700
 put it to reading then it takes 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.430
 any price I finish story of a 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.579
 life of casanova I already explained 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.399
 that I read but here I have 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.860
 still not finished the thing and it takes 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.739
 really that 2015 is 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.670
 the year when the finish will not be what 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.590
 it's really exciting 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.869
 the man is very interesting it's good 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.060
 good writing there is no reason for 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.499
 I then got finally appointed 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.509
 I intend to read the children of 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:17.490
 perrine of tolkien which is one of the novels 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.709
 from this author that I have not elected yet 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.560
 which a priori is very very good and a little 

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.880
 more for adults so that's 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.380
 really interests me for the shot 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.819
 then I intend to read the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.259
 Famous Minal Sex Of Jeffrey Egenides 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.840
 I do not know exactly why I 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.399
 want to read it this year but but 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.859
 I know it might be that it could 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.770
 bring me a lot of things and I have 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.659
 really want to test and and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.030
 deco then a proofreading I 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.799
 intend to reread the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.630
 paying from johnatan intel who is a 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.700
 book that I had loved a lot but 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.290
 that I had read a lot younger there 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.060
 to his exit well I think question that 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.650
 I read it when my dad had it 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.450
 bought at the exit and I had taken him 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.800
 at that moment so we have to believe it 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.450
 but that I realize 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.820
 I also want to read 1.50 to 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.290
 loneliness of gabriel garcia mark because 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.330
 that it is a literature that a priori 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.850
 is a little different and I like 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.380
 well the idea of varying to vary a 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.910
 little my readings as you see 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.790
 other media realizes that I propose 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.140
 that's enough that's winter then I 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.880
 want good chardonnay Donna Tartt 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.470
 I loved the master and 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.060
 disillusions as I already have 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.890
 mentioned so there remain two of his 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.260
 novels to read including the chardonnay that has 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.819
 priori is a little darker but 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.670
 pretty well written she was rather 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.069
 appreciated by the critics even though I 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.530
 absolutely does not rely on this criticism 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.900
 especially Parisian to show me 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.459
 is a policeman but the story 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.610
 I intend to read the shop 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.709
 willow hair one drop which is a 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.300
 author fairly well known but that I have 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.430
 still never discovered and yet I 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.760
 think he has two or three books of him 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.290
 and this one a priori are better known and 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.630
 I like a lot when mixing 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.160
 when mixing the genres and and I 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.650
 think it will be a relaxing reading 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.959
 very much appreciated then it is not a 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.540
 book in particular but from an author he 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.160
 I really need to re-read the works 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.810
 molÃ¨re why because ever 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.489
 in my regard I find it very accessible 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.769
 and I still find very very 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.299
 current I read the majority of these areas 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.760
 and seems to me but I think it is 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.390
 important to re - read envy to some 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.040
 books like that that I think I think 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.680
 that it is necessary to reread because 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.209
 that because we have evolved because it 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.319
 that we can read the text in a way 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.239
 different and I think that 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.340
 finally fake a fantasy novel that 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.859
 I have for a very long time I want to 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.819
 any price win the war jones folds 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.870
 who is an extremely appreciated author 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.760
 in the midst of fantasy 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.950
 it's a French author so there is a 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.510
 cocorico and he often works 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.609
 very very qualitative he works 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.680
 a lot about words and understanding this 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.049
 what interests me even if 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.790
 Overall I love the fantasy 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.919
 classic who ranks but maybe good 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.169
 that with calais this author I discover myself 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.760
 another fantasy and famous play for 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.079
 this video is now complete 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.639
 do not hesitate to share with me what 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.419
 are the readings that you have planned 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.370
 for 2015 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.019
 you will give me your opinion on the one 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.879
 I proposed I find myself in a 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.010
 next video and in the meantime wear 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.719
 you good bye for the entity not 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.259
 for me, I like to keep the side 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:17.549
 enough it's authentic where I speak to you 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.440
 simply because for me it's a 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.669
 master of illusions of donna tartt i 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.280
 loved your reading I found 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.440
 its dynamic part in the middle is 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.639
 effective brain match swimming with very 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.639
 very afraid of it being literature
