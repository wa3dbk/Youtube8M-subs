00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
expert players but not for newbies so

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.830 
expert players but not for newbies so
not<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> confuse<00:00:47.760> them<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.660> kind<00:00:48.809> of

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
not to confuse them so it's kind of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
not to confuse them so it's kind of
faded<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.320> there<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.789> this

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
faded out there and then we have this

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.389

upper<00:00:53.550> left<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:55.140> thought<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.320> worked

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
upper left and we thought that worked

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
upper left and we thought that worked
pretty<00:00:55.710> well<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:57.329> got<00:00:57.360> some

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
pretty well but then we got some

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.770 
pretty well but then we got some
feedback<00:00:57.899> from<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.559> guys<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> forums<00:00:59.370> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
actually somebody else made a mock-up

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
actually somebody else made a mock-up
that<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.520> actually<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:02.910> better<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.809> move

this<00:01:49.460> yeah<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> mean<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
this yeah I mean I we think that the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.539 
this yeah I mean I we think that the
mini-map<00:01:52.289> will<00:01:52.500> really<00:01:52.890> help<00:01:53.039> a<00:01:53.189> lot<00:01:53.310> there

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
mini-map will really help a lot there

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.609 
mini-map will really help a lot there
because<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.359> actually<00:01:54.509> see<00:01:54.719> it's<00:01:55.500> like

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
because you can actually see it's like

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.969 
because you can actually see it's like
easier<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.159> navigating<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.609> map<00:01:56.789> and<00:01:57.979> these

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
easier for navigating the map and these

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.459 
easier for navigating the map and these
are<00:01:59.130> some<00:01:59.280> new<00:01:59.609> changes<00:01:59.869> to<00:02:00.869> summit<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
are some new changes to summit that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.690 
are some new changes to summit that
you're<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.679> to<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.340> there's<00:02:02.609> a

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
you're going to see in here there's a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.980 
you're going to see in here there's a
new<00:02:02.969> flight<00:02:03.569> control<00:02:04.100> but<00:02:05.509> yeah<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.869> think

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
new flight control but yeah so we think

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.940 
new flight control but yeah so we think
this<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.289> to<00:02:07.380> make<00:02:07.679> a<00:02:07.740> big<00:02:07.799> difference

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
this is going to make a big difference

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.609 
this is going to make a big difference
in<00:02:08.549> the<00:02:08.610> game<00:02:08.879> which<00:02:09.149> ignore<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.599> bug<00:02:09.840> at<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
in the game which ignore that bug at the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.140 
in the game which ignore that bug at the
skybox<00:02:11.039> problem<00:02:11.400> we're<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.879> fix<00:02:12.030> that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
skybox problem we're going to fix that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.650 
skybox problem we're going to fix that
poor<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.540> release<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:14.150> yeah<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.480> just
