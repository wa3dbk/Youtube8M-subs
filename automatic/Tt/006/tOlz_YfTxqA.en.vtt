00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.970
 â€œThe future: you shouldn't predict that, 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.350
 make it possible. " 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.540
 Antoine de Saint-Exupery (pilot / writer) 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.920
 Somewhere on the edge of the Melkweg 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.950
 The sun, our star 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.880
 our source of life 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.730
 she provides light and dark 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.690
 a heavenly body, revered and worshiped by people for as long as they exist 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.530
 so close .... yet so far away ..... 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.460
 stand between us and the sun 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.280
 Mercury 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.190
 and Venus 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.550
 the Earth, the blue planet 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.820
 and his satellite; the moon 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.790
 363,000 km from us 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.850
 for humans, the first bridgehead in the unknown 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.360
 our first attempt to defy gravity 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.750
 "A huge step for humanity" 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.580
 it seems so little today, when you compare it to how big it is 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.360
 our solar system 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.020
 Mars, the red planet 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.840
 source of fantasies and fears over the centuries 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.570
 but also the symbol of man's first search for 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.210
 live outside the earth 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.790
 we must investigate to understand 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.420
 to further investigate 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.200
 and research again to finally discover 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.520
 we are not the center of the solar system 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.040
 we are just part of it 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.720
 one of many. 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.980
 Is the solar system - our solar system - just a stepping stone to 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.090
 the unknown? 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.630
 From the infinitely close to the infinitely distant. 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.840
 As we increase the knowledge, we become aware of it 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.790
 how extensive our galaxy is. 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.820
 How big, how complex. 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.490
 Discovering the first planets outside our solar system, exo planets, 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.830
 meant more than discovering something new; 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.400
 a new way of how we understand and experience our galaxy. 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.880
 Their size, their mass, 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.620
 the distance to their suns. 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.120
 So many planets in so many solar systems that are so different from ours, 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.640
 and yet just as organized, 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.240
 and just as beautiful. 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.070
 Solid as the Earth ...... consisting of gas, 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.260
 With or without a satellite, 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.550
 Every new planet that is discovered raises just as many questions 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.500
 if he answers. 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.120
 A search through the infinite, driven by one question: 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.060
 Are we alone? 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.810
 Who are we? Where are we from? 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.970
 As if the answer to the question about the origin of man 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.440
 can also be found far away. 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.290
 Somewhere on the edge of the Melkweg. 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.090
 And so we look, we search, 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.670
 Despite the large distances, 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.870
 On earth and in space 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.640
 Distances where the length of a human life is insignificant. 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.980
 Our imagination can move us to other planetary systems, 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.260
 But in real life it is now impossible to travel that far. 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.830
 And it will stay that way for a while .... 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.780
 But it is ingrained in people to keep searching, 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.630
 Hoping to discover a planet just like ours someday. 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.020
 We may finally find ourselves on that planet. 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.870
 Then we no longer confuse the urge to discover 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.220
 to conquer with the force. 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.070
 And we think back to what our blue planet once was: 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.970
 A complex, fragile balance, 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.690
 the basis of the most precious thing there is: 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.590
 life. 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.100
 So keep dreaming of another world. 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.120
 The earth is the cradle of humanity, but you cannot remain in the cradle forever. 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.470
