perming well first I would like to say

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.009 
perming well first I would like to say
that<00:00:10.950> dread<00:00:11.519> perming<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.450> done<00:00:12.660> for<00:00:12.960> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
that dread perming can be done for a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.110 
that dread perming can be done for a
number<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.500> different<00:00:14.160> reasons<00:00:14.340> I'll<00:00:14.790> give

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
number of different reasons I'll give

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.439 
number of different reasons I'll give
you<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.609> it

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
you two the first is you can it

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.300 
you two the first is you can it
depending<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> texture<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.740> your<00:00:19.770> hair<00:00:19.949> if

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
depending on the texture of your hair if

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.189 
depending on the texture of your hair if
your<00:00:20.520> texture<00:00:21.000> tends<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> little<00:00:21.779> coarse

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
your texture tends to be a little coarse

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.009 
your texture tends to be a little coarse
you<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.850> process<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.539> dread<00:00:24.779> perming

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
you can do this process of dread perming

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.960 
you can do this process of dread perming
to<00:00:25.320> kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.619> even<00:00:25.830> out<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.250> smooth<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.699> your

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
to kind of even out and smooth out your

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.380 
to kind of even out and smooth out your
texture<00:00:28.099> another<00:00:29.099> reason<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.090> dread

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
texture another reason to do to dread

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.280 
texture another reason to do to dread
perming<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.759> promote<00:00:32.759> more<00:00:33.329> lockets<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
perming is to promote more lockets you

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.440 
perming is to promote more lockets you
want<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.829> hair<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.370> lock<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.180> when

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
want the hair to really lock and when

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.229 
want the hair to really lock and when
you<00:00:36.600> perm<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:38.160> hair<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> when<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.090> this

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
you perm the hair and when you do this

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.350 
you perm the hair and when you do this
dread<00:00:39.570> perming<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:41.219> get<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> runoff<00:00:42.030> as

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
dread perming as you get the runoff as

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440 
dread perming as you get the runoff as
you<00:00:42.600> rinse<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> actual<00:00:44.219> chemical<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
you rinse out the actual chemical the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.779 
you rinse out the actual chemical the
hair<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.559> chemical<00:00:47.010> kind<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.489> lock

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
hair and the chemical kind of just lock

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.970 
hair and the chemical kind of just lock
together<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.200> causes<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
together and that causes you to get a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.850 
together and that causes you to get a
tighter<00:00:50.340> lock<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> softer<00:00:52.969> texture<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.239> hair

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
tighter lock on a softer texture of hair

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.139 
tighter lock on a softer texture of hair
but<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.399> process<00:00:56.910> itself<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:58.460> sometimes<00:00:59.460> not

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
but the process itself is sometimes not

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.470 
but the process itself is sometimes not
always<00:01:00.600> recommended<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:03.210> best

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
always recommended and it's not the best

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
always recommended and it's not the best
thing<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.439> dreadlock<00:01:04.799> style<00:01:05.430> because

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
thing for a dreadlock style because

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.500 
thing for a dreadlock style because
dreadlocks<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.450> supposed<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.170> natural

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
dreadlocks are supposed to be natural

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.899 
dreadlocks are supposed to be natural
but<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.290> some<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
but there are some that like to have a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.899 
but there are some that like to have a
more<00:01:12.210> polished<00:01:12.510> natural<00:01:13.320> look<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.580> might

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
more polished natural look so this might

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.060 
more polished natural look so this might
be<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> process<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.900> them<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.500> first<00:01:16.799> start

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
be a process for them you first start

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.310 
be a process for them you first start
out<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.520> using<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:19.040> relaxer<00:01:20.040> known<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.689> bio

kinds of firms and relaxers but this one

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.120 
kinds of firms and relaxers but this one
in<00:01:29.460> particular<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:30.270> more<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.049> an<00:01:31.140> alkaline<00:01:31.770> or

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
in particular is more of an alkaline or

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.700 
in particular is more of an alkaline or
alkaline<00:01:34.280> way<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.520> relaxing<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> hair<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.720> like

alkaline way of relaxing the hair I like

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.130 
alkaline way of relaxing the hair I like
to<00:01:37.860> refer<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.479> step<00:01:39.930> before

quote-unquote jheri curl so what you do

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.840 
quote-unquote jheri curl so what you do
is<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.869> take<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> thio<00:01:55.470> glycolic<00:01:56.189> acid<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
is you take the thio glycolic acid and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.289 
is you take the thio glycolic acid and
you<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> first<00:01:58.469> part<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.070> which<00:01:59.250> is

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
you do the first part of it which is

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.270 
you do the first part of it which is
where<00:02:00.299> rearranges<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.409> bonds<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> kind
