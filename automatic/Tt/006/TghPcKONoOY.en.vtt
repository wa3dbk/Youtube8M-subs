00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.380
 hello how about friends here we are from 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.500
 again and this time I'm going to bring a 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.730
 comparative of the hesperia dream I look at the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 sony xperia type 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.870
 where will you start 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.260
 so doing an overview 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.270
 the size 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.150
 we have cell phones and we see that the dream 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.920
 wait I look a little bit bigger give me 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.920
 a little bit bigger 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.390
 and although I do not appreciate much in the video 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.600
 lessons but I admire a little more 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.740
 thin that the dream waits kind we're going to 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.040
 start first by the battery the 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.040
 drums 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.130
 it's more or less the same 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.130
 it has more or less the same duration 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.280
 and the same amount of a thousand empires 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.780
 that does not vary much as soon as we go 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.230
 to find operating system the system 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.250
 operative is the same for both mobile 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:07.300
 using android 4.0 scripts 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.300
 it's cream sandwich 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.580
 and the whole interface is the same as the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.590
 menu as of 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.590
 as of programs that they can use 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.690
 and we have the same access menus 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.630
 direct for example to activate wifi 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.630
 to activate data to mute 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.000
 the pastor everything works the same I'm 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.160
 testing the play store 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.490
 without saying the problems are all 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.490
 same 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.510
 although it is loading 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.369
 it's all the same 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.159
 what is is the light that has light of 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:07.050
 background so you can see that it looks the same 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:11.360
 there is practically no difference 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.360
 the touch of the screen is very similar 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:19.680
 the way to block it like 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.109
 let's what size by size 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.890
 concretely sony xperia miro es 10 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.940
 millimeters 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.940
 higher 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.970
 because the type 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.700
 as for the width 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.160
 It is 2 millimeters wider 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.140
 and the screen then the screen 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.490
 logically a little bit bigger 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.430
 wait type is 32 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:53.440
 while the look is 3 5 inches 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.440
 It also has antireflection 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.290
 and the creative Estonian has a screen 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.360
 of 262,000 colors while I wait 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.840
 it is says millions of colors the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.450
 resolution in it 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.920
 as to what is the texture of the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.519
 mobile is a bit different hesperia 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.580
 guy is with a velvety tad 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.640
 have a 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.500
 of peeled third gas 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.220
 while hesperia kind of plus a 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.440
 a little more plastic is different 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.930
 it depends on what you like it has a plastic 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.720
 different from the housing 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.550
 in the plastic of the housing of the 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.140
 delmiro a little better because it has 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.140
 anti reflect the screen 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:48.410
 there is a little bigger note 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.780
 that I admire I have a 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.300
 protector good now let's compare 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.150
 the speed the processors are 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.970
 similar but they are not equal I think I do not know 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.250
 in the pages of the features 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.550
 it comes out differently while waiting 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.680
 is 80 800 megahertz that some 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.569
 both are equal 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:16.799
 in mine is what with m5 mz 25 to which no 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:19.560
 is the model of the processor and 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.330
 we snapdragon I have made a 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.500
 speed check 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.500
 let's see now 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.669
 for example the hesperia type loads a 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.750
 little before he looked possibly 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.979
 almost the same because what it took to 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.800
 give the button for more or less what 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.310
 is youtube tested for example I'm going to 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.310
 stop to youtube 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.620
 and let's see what else has taken less 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.800
 possibly less to work in 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.800
 Internet 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.050
 be better but good the company is 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.400
 different because he looks at mine was 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:10.580
 a company starts with hbo 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.610
 the other is me and me 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.360
 then let's say that services 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.360
 different internet 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.500
 the screen handling speed is 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.130
 more or less similar is very comfortable both 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.990
 wait I look like in the wait guy I look 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.070
 more comfortable because the bigger screen 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.160
 then that will have to be had in 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.160
 account 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.669
 what more surprised that the weight is more 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.260
 or less 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.810
 mine weighs only say more 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:50.220
 that is more or less the same although the 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:53.090
 micro weighs more I'm trying that 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.090
 let's make the camera 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.070
 the camera itself is quite different 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.620
 different 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.050
 because even more than by resolution 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.130
 While waiting, I have 5 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.130
 megapixels of 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:14.830
 of resolution 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.830
 the guy has only 32 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.420
 also as we can see has to do 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.580
 Panoramic photos front camera the 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.420
 frontal front camera does not have the 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.420
 hesperia type 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.540
 and 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.050
 there we are going to see her 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:44.750
 It has only small options 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.720
 photo form and in addition 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:51.980
 we do not have flash LED that is 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:56.760
 that in that aspect of camera 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:07:00.240
 multimedia does not have good because with 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:03.510
 this finished the comparative hesperia 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:08.190
 type and hesperia look I hope there 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:10.550
 liked and we do not see the next video 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.550
 see you later
