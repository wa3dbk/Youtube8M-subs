on the open strings now you can see
immediately<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.260> you<00:01:19.260> have<00:01:19.410> to<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.619> very

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
immediately that you have to be very

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.219 
immediately that you have to be very
careful<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.490> technique<00:01:20.940> for<00:01:21.720> example

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
careful with this technique for example

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.109 
careful with this technique for example
if<00:01:22.410> you<00:01:22.530> don't<00:01:22.770> damp<00:01:23.040> immediately<00:01:23.729> well<00:01:24.060> you

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
if you don't damp immediately well you

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.420 
if you don't damp immediately well you
don't<00:01:24.270> damp<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> correct<00:01:25.350> way<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
don't damp in the correct way then the

so it carries the card of a pattern on
the<00:01:38.550> base<00:01:38.729> knows

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.220 

look<00:01:43.460> at<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:44.090> way<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.360> maps<00:01:44.630> played<00:01:45.020> this

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
look at the way that maps played this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.080 
look at the way that maps played this

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
variations as we move through it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.030

make this shape we use F but never a
full<00:02:29.489> F<00:02:30.080> we<00:02:31.080> use<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.470> shape<00:02:35.420> we<00:02:36.420> play<00:02:36.630> this

full F we use this shape we play this
shape<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.650> reason<00:02:38.510> if<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.690> played<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
shape for this reason if it played the
