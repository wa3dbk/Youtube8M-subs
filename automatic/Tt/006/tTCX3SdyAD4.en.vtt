00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
goal like the co of Shane you see he is

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.530 
goal like the co of Shane you see he is
playing<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> confidence<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.540> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
playing with a lot of confidence in the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.830 
playing with a lot of confidence in the
last<00:01:33.750> few<00:01:33.960> games<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:35.360> he<00:01:36.360> came<00:01:36.630> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
last few games and and then he came in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.170 
last few games and and then he came in
the<00:01:36.990> game<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:37.920> 10-12<00:01:38.520> minutes<00:01:38.759> before

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the game I think 10-12 minutes before

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.859 
the game I think 10-12 minutes before
the<00:01:39.329> end<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.720> he's<00:01:40.650> caught<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.509> important<00:01:42.509> 11

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the end and he's caught the important 11

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
the end and he's caught the important 11
against<00:01:43.799> Poland<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.530> brown<00:01:46.530> she<00:01:47.270> finally

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
against Poland and brown she finally

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.690 
against Poland and brown she finally
finally<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.350> he's<00:01:49.979> working<00:01:50.430> hard<00:01:50.579> he's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
finally because he's working hard he's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.830 
finally because he's working hard he's
doing<00:01:51.149> well<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.549> it's<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.700> midfield<00:01:54.119> offensive

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
doing well and it's a midfield offensive

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.039 
doing well and it's a midfield offensive
midfielder<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.680> expect<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:57.180> that

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
midfielder and you expect of that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.350 
midfielder and you expect of that
players<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.860> position<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.850> expect

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
players of that position you you expect

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.170 
players of that position you you expect
as<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> coach<00:02:00.899> scoring<00:02:01.770> calls<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.579> making

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
as a coach scoring calls and making

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.350 
as a coach scoring calls and making
assists<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.930> then<00:02:04.880> maybe<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> little

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
assists and then maybe it was a little

because<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.769> think<00:04:08.829> they<00:04:09.190> they<00:04:09.459> have<00:04:09.760> more

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
because I think they they have more

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.569 
because I think they they have more
confident<00:04:10.600> now<00:04:10.860> they<00:04:11.860> are<00:04:12.010> more<00:04:12.130> confident

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
confident now they are more confident

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.720 
confident now they are more confident
now<00:04:12.700> after<00:04:13.660> two<00:04:13.840> good<00:04:14.110> wins<00:04:14.320> in<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.769> last<00:04:14.799> few

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
now after two good wins in the last few

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.930 
now after two good wins in the last few
games<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:16.840> like<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:18.220> way<00:04:18.370> how<00:04:18.549> they<00:04:18.729> play

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
games and I like the way how they play

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.330 
games and I like the way how they play
football<00:04:19.359> but<00:04:19.750> it's<00:04:19.989> always

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
football but it's always

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.510 
football but it's always
to<00:04:22.060> try<00:04:22.300> scoring<00:04:22.630> calls<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.830> will<00:04:24.100> be<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.280> nice

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
to try scoring calls it will be a nice

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.490 
to try scoring calls it will be a nice
one<00:04:24.760> because<00:04:25.090> we<00:04:25.330> have<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:28.169> confidence<00:04:29.169> as

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
one because we have that confidence as

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.969 
one because we have that confidence as
well<00:04:29.710> we<00:04:30.070> have<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:31.020> way<00:04:32.020> of<00:04:32.199> playing<00:04:32.470> as<00:04:32.740> well

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
well we have that way of playing as well

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.420 
well we have that way of playing as well
and<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:34.090> that<00:04:34.510> means<00:04:34.750> that<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:36.160> will<00:04:36.370> be

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
and that that means that it will be

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.719 
and that that means that it will be
attractive<00:04:37.389> game<00:04:38.350> this<00:04:38.800> Saturday<00:04:39.250> that

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729
