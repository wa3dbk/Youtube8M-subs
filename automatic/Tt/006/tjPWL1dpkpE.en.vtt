00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.110
 6 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.089
 ap 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.959
 what interests me is to try to find the 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.379
 the passage between the slab universe of thought and dream 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.349
 project cost and then hop where I understood those used 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.199
 and that this object is characteristic 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.719
 both of a work 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.769
 and at the goal line 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.179
 the object in e 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.139
 the tempo know adherents 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.469
 but his friends always go for a ride with 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.959
 in his possession I'm going next in almost 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.479
 I liked the sobriety or now the quality of their boat 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:19.219
 teachers an idea 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.019
 maybe a little less optima 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.750
 the lab the boats and at the same time if fresh boats 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.489
 spectacular and especially of very good quality for 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.599
 db Lent which goes very well in water and on earth 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.299
 p the landais march was already close enough to what I wanted to do and 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.299
 then at the beginning I made the mekhissi models 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.349
 it was a model of intention 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.729
 and in fact 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.629
 the corresponding boat size as rare is a size of 3 who knew 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.069
 filming just makes changes by contribution 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.749
 to what it was outside the water 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:58.059
 and all that is to relieve in front of each other 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.279
 it's their fairing and therefore the guarantee of a quality 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:05.149
 it's very important for me to have a boat you're just talking about an idea 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:08.059
 but that it is something that can be used that misleads 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.059
 quality standards what I retain from these aids 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.839
 another quote I would say because I was m sego field 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.969
 but to look at it or three years 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.509
 and at the end 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.009
 2 this is also a way of 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.689
 two emblem demi-sisters in europe dynamic and little aggressive then boat 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.560
 at the same time to recipes and ericsson too 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.689
 and a kind of 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.919
 and to all types of second degree because the universe of 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.770
 of power boating and often with very aggressive image like that 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.990
 I just wanted to move a little bit 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.569
 a sculpture 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.020
 I have since yesterday at the mandible controllers 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.740
 he removed his
