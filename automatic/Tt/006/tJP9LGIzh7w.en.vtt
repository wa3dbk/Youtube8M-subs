00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
think it the actual inside my phone is

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.980 
think it the actual inside my phone is
exposed<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:26.359> I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:27.869> that

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
slide up which it has done a lot of

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.890 
slide up which it has done a lot of
cracks<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:29.000> real<00:01:29.150> panel<00:01:29.509> should<00:01:29.689> just

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
cracks and the real panel should just

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.840 
cracks and the real panel should just
pop<00:01:30.140> off<00:01:30.320> like<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.280> as<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.399> can<00:01:34.520> see<00:01:34.700> in

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
pop off like that so as you can see in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.600 
pop off like that so as you can see in
the<00:01:34.939> inside<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.390> just<00:01:35.540> looks<00:01:35.720> normal<00:01:36.610> it's

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
the inside it just looks normal it's

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.029 
the inside it just looks normal it's
just<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.940> outside<00:01:38.090> bluster<00:01:38.690> smushed<00:01:39.200> okay<00:01:39.979> so

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
just the outside bluster smushed okay so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.820 
just the outside bluster smushed okay so
now<00:01:40.340> let's<00:01:40.930> have<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:42.020> look<00:01:42.049> at<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:42.350> panel<00:01:42.680> that

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
now let's have a look at this panel that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.280 
now let's have a look at this panel that
I've<00:01:42.920> got

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.250 

both<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.260> look

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
both the do look

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:03.340 
both the do look
it's<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.340> much<00:01:55.900> identical<00:01:59.200> in<00:02:00.200> fact<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:02.350> can't

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's a much identical in fact I can't

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.840 
it's a much identical in fact I can't
see<00:02:03.500> anything<00:02:03.650> wrong<00:02:03.860> with<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.040> except<00:02:04.790> this

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
see anything wrong with that except this

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.950 
see anything wrong with that except this
one's<00:02:05.030> got<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.150> stick<00:02:05.390> on<00:02:05.480> this<00:02:05.660> side<00:02:05.810> which

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
one's got a stick on this side which

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.280 
one's got a stick on this side which
mine<00:02:06.140> doesn't<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:07.420> suppose<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:09.080> metal

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
mine doesn't I suppose that the metal

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.030 
mine doesn't I suppose that the metal
inside<00:02:09.590> just<00:02:09.800> look<00:02:09.950> slightly<00:02:10.310> different<00:02:12.040> but

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
inside just look slightly different but

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.200 
inside just look slightly different but
that's<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.310> only<00:02:13.430> they're<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:14.090> only

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
that's the only they're the only

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.990 
that's the only they're the only
difference<00:02:14.480> i<00:02:14.570> can<00:02:14.690> see<00:02:15.670> okay<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:16.730> i'm<00:02:16.880> going

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
difference i can see okay so i'm going

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.830 
difference i can see okay so i'm going
to<00:02:17.060> go<00:02:17.210> ahead<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:17.420> install<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:19.630> should<00:02:20.630> be

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
to go ahead and install this should be

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.340 
to go ahead and install this should be
relatively<00:02:21.230> easy<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:26.690> guess<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.050> just<00:02:27.080> do

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
relatively easy and I guess I just do

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.170 
relatively easy and I guess I just do
there<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.710> reverse<00:02:28.190> what<00:02:28.460> I<00:02:28.490> just<00:02:28.670> did<00:02:28.850> so

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
there is a reverse what I just did so

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.150 
there is a reverse what I just did so
just<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.570> few<00:02:29.600> millimeters<00:02:30.230> up<00:02:30.380> I'll<00:02:30.770> put<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.280> in

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
just a few millimeters up I'll put it in

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.020 
just a few millimeters up I'll put it in
push<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.310> down<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.450> can<00:02:35.570> see<00:02:36.790> it's<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.850> bit

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
push that down as you can see it's a bit

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.360 
push that down as you can see it's a bit
of<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.210> lip<00:02:38.390> at<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.570> top<00:02:38.780> just<00:02:39.650> hangin<00:02:39.920> over<00:02:40.100> and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
of a lip at the top just hangin over and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.940 
of a lip at the top just hangin over and
then<00:02:40.580> just<00:02:40.850> slide<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.240> down<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.480> think<00:02:41.890> okay<00:02:42.890> so

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
then just slide it down I think okay so

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.470 
then just slide it down I think okay so
as<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.340> see<00:02:43.490> now<00:02:43.670> I've<00:02:43.910> now<00:02:44.060> got<00:02:44.240> it<00:02:44.300> lined

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
as you can see now I've now got it lined

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.720 
as you can see now I've now got it lined
up<00:02:44.630> as<00:02:44.900> best<00:02:45.020> as<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.260> can<00:02:45.880> looks<00:02:48.610> even<00:02:49.610> better

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
up as best as I can looks even better

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.220 
up as best as I can looks even better
than<00:02:49.880> before<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.480> much<00:02:50.780> because<00:02:50.959> it's<00:02:51.110> not

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
than before this much because it's not

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.980 
than before this much because it's not
scratched<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.330> let's<00:02:53.330> just<00:02:53.480> get<00:02:53.600> them<00:02:53.750> screws

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
scratched so let's just get them screws

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.390 
scratched so let's just get them screws
back<00:02:54.170> in

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.750 

and<00:03:01.209> there<00:03:01.390> we<00:03:01.450> go

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and there we go

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.949 
and there we go
and<00:03:02.849> now<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.209> new<00:03:03.239> back<00:03:03.629> panel

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
and now I have a new back panel

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.089 
and now I have a new back panel
installed<00:03:04.909> it<00:03:05.909> looks<00:03:06.769> pretty<00:03:07.769> much<00:03:07.950> exactly

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
installed it looks pretty much exactly

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.229 
installed it looks pretty much exactly
as<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.909> did<00:03:08.939> before<00:03:09.269> before<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> smashed<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.650> I

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
as it did before before I smashed it I

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.660 
as it did before before I smashed it I
would<00:03:12.239> say<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.989> apple<00:03:13.439> logo<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:14.159> iPhone

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
would say that the apple logo and iPhone

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.119 
would say that the apple logo and iPhone
textin<00:03:15.120> all<00:03:15.180> night<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.480> slightly<00:03:16.079> less<00:03:16.530> shiny

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
textin all night is slightly less shiny

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.819 
textin all night is slightly less shiny
like<00:03:17.640> slightly<00:03:18.030> less<00:03:18.329> mirrored<00:03:18.709> smaller<00:03:19.709> than

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
like slightly less mirrored smaller than

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.500 
like slightly less mirrored smaller than
that<00:03:19.890> effect<00:03:20.370> but<00:03:20.459> I'm<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:21.030> sure<00:03:21.060> if<00:03:21.329> that's

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
that effect but I'm not sure if that's

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.410 
that effect but I'm not sure if that's
just<00:03:21.840> because<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:23.430> one's<00:03:23.640> smushed<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.269> it's

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
just because this one's smushed so it's

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.190 
just because this one's smushed so it's
been<00:03:24.540> affected<00:03:25.019> by<00:03:25.049> that<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:26.780> I'm<00:03:27.780> really

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
been affected by that but I'm really

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.619 
been affected by that but I'm really
happy<00:03:28.409> with<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.859> looks<00:03:29.269> just<00:03:30.269> as<00:03:30.359> it<00:03:30.540> did

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
happy with that it looks just as it did

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.410 
happy with that it looks just as it did
