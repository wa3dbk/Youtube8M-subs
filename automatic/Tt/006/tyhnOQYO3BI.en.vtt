00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.680
 to put the mayonnaise we are going to add 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.130
 the lemon juice 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.170
 and also the ground chipotle must be 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.470
 grind it with all the seeds 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 that it stings because if not then it stops

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.049
 to incorporate 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.049
 this does not need salt and pepper nor 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.409
 nothing is how it goes and nothing else until 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.350
 incorporate see how rich today if you knew 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.470
 what that chipotle smells 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.780
 this divine smell has truth 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.590
 and then no more what is the Trojan type 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.590
 more you want to eat 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.720
 it's from chipotle's care though now 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.100
 let's mix in another post 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.300

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.730
 find natural so can 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.580
 find artificial 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.080
 this choose the one you want 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.319
 mission is an email because it can be with 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.510

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.670
 can be with you with whatever you want 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.000
 it's not with ground beef we add the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.290
 dry chopped chili let's add 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.860

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.850
 the parsley 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:03.600
 likewise the jícama that I love the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.720
 jícama in this type of food because 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.720
 It gives the crisp effect that I love 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.520
 let's also put celery aiquile then 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.440
 lip has fibrous parts are not 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.950
 remove because exactly this fiber is 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:21.890
 the one that makes us all very happy 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.890
 let's also put the cheese 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.239
 all this this is going to be also 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.319
 an important source of protein and 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.819

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.129
 you have to pour some salt and pepper 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.250
 this definitely has to 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.920
 season and what better to season with 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.950

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.680
 quality of the tomatoes they use in addition 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.409
 they do not add neither conservatives nor 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.299
 specials and is the only brand of 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.730

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.990
 spicy and the organic version 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.430

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.500

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.270

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.030
