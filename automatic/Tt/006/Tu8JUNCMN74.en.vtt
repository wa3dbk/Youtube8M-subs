00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello to all these streets where we go 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.639
 found today for a video in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.520
 one versus 1 in mlg mode on the map 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.990
 sanctuary mlg sanctuary v2 this is one of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.160
 my first games we had one with 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.750
 someone from my team was a little 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.430
 training match I put it to you 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.600
 for those who do not know one 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.090
 it's something that I like 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.470
 I find it much really me his 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.230
 his level forward must think carefully 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.480
 before playing a lot, finally moving 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.059
 this is then unfortunately after 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.020
 leucate has instituted instant spawns 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.100
 I find it quite spoils the 21 that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.000
 really a shame once we have 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.140
 killed someone does not have time to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.719
 really on the spot and it speeds up the game 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 but it's not necessarily good in 1 v1 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.520
 time that pot allowed us to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 replace and especially to resume our 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.730
 shield because there really is killing 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.890
 somebody here for example have some 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:09.150
 caviars more shield he can 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:13.710
 reappear the second after so the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.030
 inverse and above all it takes a lot played 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.320
 on the ground me I play a lot in his 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.700
 time had a mostly in halo 4 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.060
 the spartans have so much noise 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.060
 when they move 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.119
 so sanctuary remained a cellar that 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.630
 had been forged in halo in halo 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:36.100
 reach has been forged the top to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.100
 the origin is a map to the o2 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:45.530
 sanctuary stalled in a dlc of halo 2 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.049
 really at the origin is so here 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.750
 really the key to victory in one 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.259
 against one is the control the control 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.259
 powerful weapons 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.299
 that's really what will do the 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.189
 difference a good control or not the 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.450
 snipe then the sniper l one in each 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.920
 base one on each side 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.399
 normally from memory must connect 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.319
 minutes 30 every two minutes 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:14.569
 you also have a shield in the center of 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:24.769
 the map where I am I also very 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:26.359
 important in one against one to control that 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.340
 in one against one the center of the 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.389
 map especially on sanctuary is great 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.500
 important what it really is from there 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.730
 you have a view of the whole map 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.109
 you can go out a little bit on the side 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.819
 that you want to be able to watch 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.810
 so that's something I like 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.609
 not at all tired of it 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.419
 lost the opponent's eyes we do not know 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.419
 at all where he is 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.260
 and also that they added in halo 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.520
 I do not like that either 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.560
 see the weapons on the Zen card stand 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.760
 distance which means that in one 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.050
 against a camp in the middle of the map there 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.310
 will certainly say more to surprise by 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.890
 the deal in our base taking 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.350
 our sniper by failing to blow 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:30.989
 because the snipe icon disappears as soon as 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:32.850
 he's taking it that's really it 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.260
 it's the weapons icons if I find that 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.630
 really a pity in any case 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.410
 loses some of its charm can more 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.410
 really surprise the opponent 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.730
 so here it's the same huh I'm looking for it 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.780
 the most clicked from where can get 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.810
 find I know he had learned the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.000
 haegen style take the sniper what 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.360
 the iconia not disappear is what will 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.360
 give your position 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.659
 so yes there was a little bug we had 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.099
 a change of position in the course of 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.340
 part 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.340
 nothing serious 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.889
 eliminated the enemy team 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.130
 then you have the scribes in mlg the 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.480
 seats instead of the jet pack 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.600
 finally where he wants jetpack in halo 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.600
 reach 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.270
 and there normally I should have had my 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.560
 Massacre at massac medal for 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.540
 killed 10 people in a row without dying 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.950
 but I did not see because there is a 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.030
 bone change so you hear all 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:19.480
 these medals are reset to this 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.740
 moment there do they also charge 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.700
 a lot his land too much to confess 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.800
 it's the race 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.180
 the spi talent profess print and in halo 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:31.450
 reach but there was no one equipped 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.920
 1,1 at all finally an armor module which 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.960
 had for years that the does it 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.410
 to run in a pseudo mode 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.490
 mlg they really change that a lot 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.510
 change everything because we can really 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.080
 all on a map that is not very big 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.820
 like safari 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.240
 long distance routes have 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.240
 not taken long 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.509
 it changes a lot of things here 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.620
 that's where I got killed I 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.819
 knew they were repairing them and from there 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:02.289
 and in semi automatic and barely of the 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.289
 kill that it was already over for me 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.840
 super beautiful pomegranate pomegranate just 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.500
 fall I lost I do not know where he is 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.220
 I do not hear it I stay covered 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.220
 time to take my son 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.990
 here it is oh it becomes dangerous 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.100
 it's more expensive but he has a sniper can 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.100
 put a ball of super far 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.440
 after I stupidly missed my jump what 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.440
 I had spotted it 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:17.199
 and here I am going to use the sne 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:19.240
 automatic because I saw the armor 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:21.930
 to appear I knew very well that they 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.930
 were going dark on it 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.680
 emma still not seen 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.680
 and the last he 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.830
 and that's it's finished victory so 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.000
 it was really a small part 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.610
 quick to show you what you 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.220
 can give the 1 v1 on halo 4 in mode 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.200
 mlg i thank tubes to what is it 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.310
 who made the game with me here I am 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.310
 tell you a next one it was going
