00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
crashes since I started only a couple

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.010 
crashes since I started only a couple
well<00:01:18.940> broken<00:01:19.180> bones<00:01:19.480> so<00:01:19.690> I'm<00:01:19.750> doing<00:01:19.870> pretty

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
well broken bones so I'm doing pretty

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.620

lucky I have a crush for awhile touch

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.240 
lucky I have a crush for awhile touch
wood<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.170> hopefully<00:01:23.740> we<00:01:23.830> can<00:01:23.950> keep<00:01:24.040> it<00:01:24.220> that

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
wood so hopefully we can keep it that

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:36.600 
wood so hopefully we can keep it that
way

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.610 

now<00:01:37.360> it's<00:01:37.600> really<00:01:37.720> tough<00:01:37.930> actually<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.500> know

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
now it's really tough actually you know

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.920 
now it's really tough actually you know
we<00:01:38.770> train<00:01:39.010> all<00:01:39.310> year<00:01:39.610> just<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.570> go<00:01:40.660> out<00:01:40.690> and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
we train all year just to go out and

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.660 
we train all year just to go out and
ride<00:01:41.050> you<00:01:41.200> know<00:01:41.320> 30<00:01:41.560> seconds<00:01:42.010> worth<00:01:42.160> of<00:01:42.370> event

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
ride you know 30 seconds worth of event

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.610 
ride you know 30 seconds worth of event
so<00:01:42.940> it's<00:01:43.480> quite<00:01:43.660> tough<00:01:43.900> being<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.230> sprinter

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
so it's quite tough being a sprinter

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.740 
so it's quite tough being a sprinter
especially<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.730> offseason<00:01:46.180> for<00:01:46.360> us<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.600> can

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
especially the offseason for us it can

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.360 
especially the offseason for us it can
be<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.870> bit<00:01:47.050> monotonous<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.740> tedious<00:01:48.070> but<00:01:48.280> you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
be a bit monotonous and tedious but you

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.470 
be a bit monotonous and tedious but you
know<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.670> when<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.850> set<00:01:49.030> down<00:01:49.150> onto<00:01:49.450> that

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
know that when you set down onto that

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.520 
know that when you set down onto that
track<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.110> found<00:01:50.290> absolutely

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
track that you found absolutely

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.040 
track that you found absolutely
everything<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.280> can<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:51.910> I<00:01:52.150> guess<00:01:52.810> that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
everything you can so I guess that

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.420 
everything you can so I guess that
feeling<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.470> crossing<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.860> line<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.220> knowing

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
feeling of crossing the line and knowing

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.710 
feeling of crossing the line and knowing
that<00:01:54.490> that's<00:01:54.760> it<00:01:54.970> that's<00:01:55.180> all<00:01:55.300> I<00:01:55.360> could<00:01:55.480> do

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
that that's it that's all I could do

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.570 
that that's it that's all I could do
today<00:01:55.990> he's<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.770> know<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:57.040> best<00:01:57.220> feeling<00:01:57.520> in

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
today he's you know the best feeling in

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.140 
today he's you know the best feeling in
the<00:01:57.610> world

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.950 

I<00:02:06.730> have<00:02:07.730> a<00:02:07.760> really<00:02:07.940> particular<00:02:08.119> routine<00:02:08.780> for

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
I have a really particular routine for

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.960 
I have a really particular routine for
every<00:02:09.170> event<00:02:09.350> so<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:09.890> try<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.400> practice<00:02:10.850> that

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
every event so I try and practice that

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.520 
every event so I try and practice that
is<00:02:11.090> where<00:02:11.240> usually<00:02:11.360> as<00:02:11.630> possible<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:12.110> training

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
is where usually as possible in training

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.370 
is where usually as possible in training
but<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.860> guess<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:14.060> first<00:02:14.270> thing<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.320> think

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
but I guess the first thing that I think

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.650 
but I guess the first thing that I think
he's<00:02:15.830> something<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.250> my<00:02:16.370> first<00:02:16.580> coach<00:02:16.880> my

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
he's something that my first coach my

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.210 
he's something that my first coach my
second<00:02:17.900> coach<00:02:18.050> ever<00:02:18.260> Tommy<00:02:18.470> Gary<00:02:18.740> Sutton<00:02:19.070> and

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
second coach ever Tommy Gary Sutton and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.100 
second coach ever Tommy Gary Sutton and
that<00:02:19.340> was<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.730> take<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.910> deep<00:02:20.120> breath<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.690> go

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
that was to take a deep breath in and go

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.650 
that was to take a deep breath in and go
this<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.070> I've<00:02:22.430> done<00:02:22.550> everything<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.270> to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
this is it I've done everything I can to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.870 
this is it I've done everything I can to
this<00:02:23.780> time<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.230> point<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.890> I've<00:02:25.460> just<00:02:25.700> give

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
this time and point and I've just give

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.289 
this time and point and I've just give
all<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.330> out<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.570> track

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.309 

yeah<00:02:33.299> sometimes<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.900> know<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.049> want<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
yeah sometimes you know you want to

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.050 
yeah sometimes you know you want to
vomit<00:02:34.439> you're<00:02:35.189> hitting<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.459> beam<00:02:35.610> for<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.879> few

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
vomit you're hitting the beam for a few

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.119 
vomit you're hitting the beam for a few
minutes<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:36.709> afterwards<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.769> guess<00:02:37.950> there's

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
minutes but afterwards I guess there's

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.710 
minutes but afterwards I guess there's
that<00:02:38.189> feeling<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.849> know<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.239> that's<00:02:39.480> it

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
that feeling of you know this that's it

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.910 
that feeling of you know this that's it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.589 
I've done everything I can
it's<00:02:41.370> almost<00:02:41.549> like<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.879> sigh<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.150> relief<00:02:42.269> really
