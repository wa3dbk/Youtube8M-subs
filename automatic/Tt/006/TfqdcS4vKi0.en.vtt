in a video I'll be showing you how that

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.360 
in a video I'll be showing you how that
well<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.830> 13-megapixel

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
well so this is in the 13-megapixel

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.390 
well so this is in the 13-megapixel
camera<00:02:53.850> mode<00:02:54.660> CKC<00:02:55.650> doesn't<00:02:55.950> actually<00:02:56.070> fooled

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
camera mode CKC doesn't actually fooled

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.530 
camera mode CKC doesn't actually fooled
the<00:02:56.550> screen<00:02:56.910> when<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:58.140> 13-megapixel

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
the screen when you and a 13-megapixel

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.330 
the screen when you and a 13-megapixel
so<00:03:00.540> let's<00:03:00.690> go<00:03:00.840> into<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.080> stands<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:02.040> see<00:03:02.220> it's

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
so let's go into the stands you see it's

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.080 
so let's go into the stands you see it's
a<00:03:02.400> four<00:03:02.610> by<00:03:02.760> three<00:03:03.530> aspect<00:03:04.530> ratio<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.790> can<00:03:05.850> go

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
a four by three aspect ratio you can go

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.030 
a four by three aspect ratio you can go
down<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.300> this<00:03:06.540> one<00:03:06.780> which<00:03:06.989> falls<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.650> bit<00:03:07.860> more

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
down to this one which falls it bit more

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.550 
down to this one which falls it bit more
but<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.310> not<00:03:08.430> eight<00:03:08.670> megapixel<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.660> 9.6

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
but it's not eight megapixel is 9.6

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.530 
but it's not eight megapixel is 9.6
megapixel<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.520> that's<00:03:11.940> what<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> said<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.510> you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
megapixel and that's what I said to you

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.560 
megapixel and that's what I said to you
by<00:03:12.690> default<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.760> let's<00:03:15.180> take<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.360> little

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
heavy usage so barrel f is pretty good

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.659 
heavy usage so barrel f is pretty good

fine<00:05:18.979> only<00:05:19.979> thing<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.280> didn't<00:05:20.520> know<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:20.700> was<00:05:20.850> a

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
fine only thing I didn't know this was a

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.140 
fine only thing I didn't know this was a
little<00:05:21.180> bit<00:05:21.300> of<00:05:21.360> lag<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:21.720> GTA<00:05:22.260> by<00:05:22.530> sea<00:05:23.150> but

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
little bit of lag and GTA by sea but

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.580
