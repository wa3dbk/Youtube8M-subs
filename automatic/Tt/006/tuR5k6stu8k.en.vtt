00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.940 
but I think I end up at the bottom ball
on

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
to slide it in from the top to the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.870 
to slide it in from the top to the
bottom<00:02:11.030> so

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
first thing I would say to do is check

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.290 
first thing I would say to do is check
the<00:02:37.860> threading<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.490> both<00:02:38.670> your<00:02:38.850> balls<00:02:39.030> if

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
the threading on both your balls if

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.660 
the threading on both your balls if
you've<00:02:39.450> got<00:02:39.660> some<00:02:39.900> dodgy<00:02:40.110> balls<00:02:41.100> actually<00:02:41.520> if

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you've got some dodgy balls actually if

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.160 
you've got some dodgy balls actually if
you<00:02:41.790> even<00:02:42.060> buy<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.240> from<00:02:42.510> anywhere

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
you even buy it from anywhere

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.530 
you even buy it from anywhere
just<00:02:43.770> check<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.280> threading<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.820> it's<00:02:45.000> okay

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
just check the threading that it's okay

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.200 
just check the threading that it's okay
actually<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.380> starting<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:46.860> okay<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:48.180> I

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
actually the starting is okay so I

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.470 
actually the starting is okay so I
should<00:02:48.390> feel<00:02:48.720> good<00:02:48.960> so<00:02:49.830> I'm<00:02:50.820> gonna<00:02:50.970> zoom<00:02:51.090> in

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
