thicker here in the in the ankle support

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
thicker here in the in the ankle support
it<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.310> seems<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:56.880> bit<00:01:57.030> beefier

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it just seems like a little bit beefier

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.710 
it just seems like a little bit beefier
but<00:01:57.810> could<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.080> be<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.380> imagination<00:01:59.570> anyway

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
but could this be my imagination anyway

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.719

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.500 
like I said you got your grey red white
I<00:02:38.010> guess<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.489> believe<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.850> Jordans<00:02:39.239> send<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
I guess I believe the Jordans send it

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.789 
I guess I believe the Jordans send it
down<00:02:39.630> here<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.989> little<00:02:40.110> bit<00:02:40.230> different<00:02:40.650> than

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
down here is a little bit different than

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.570 
down here is a little bit different than
the<00:02:40.890> original<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.700> still<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.269> close

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.220 

that's<00:02:47.580> about<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.060> as<00:02:48.180> far<00:02:48.209> as<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.720> overall

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
that's about it as far as the overall

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.120 
that's about it as far as the overall
look<00:02:49.640> um<00:02:50.640> what<00:02:51.510> else

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
look um what else

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.830

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
time please show it again they go back

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.870 
time please show it again they go back
to<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.620> original<00:02:58.620> box<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.250> came<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.640> it's<00:02:59.790> a

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
to the original box that came in it's a

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.039 
to the original box that came in it's a
little<00:02:59.970> bit<00:03:00.180> different<00:03:00.359> like<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.720> said<00:03:00.900> last

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
little bit different like I said last

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.370 
little bit different like I said last
time<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:03.000> box<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.359> almost<00:03:03.510> like<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.780> it's

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
time the box is almost like that it's

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.289 
time the box is almost like that it's
got<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> machine<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.370> was<00:03:05.790> more<00:03:05.820> cardboard

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
got a machine to it was more cardboard

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.970 
got a machine to it was more cardboard
last<00:03:06.810> time<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.260> more<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> gift<00:03:07.859> box

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
last time this is more like a gift box

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.099 
last time this is more like a gift box
kind<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.310> feel<00:03:08.489> but<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.180> look<00:03:09.359> is<00:03:09.480> still<00:03:09.660> there

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
kind of feel but the look is still there

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.490 
kind of feel but the look is still there
it's<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:10.890> elephant<00:03:11.280> print<00:03:11.459> paper<00:03:11.670> inside

this<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.690> one<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.170> collect<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.530> that

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
this the one is to collect a that

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.849 
this the one is to collect a that
follows<00:03:31.950> what<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.519> always<00:03:32.670> turns<00:03:32.940> yellow<00:03:33.859> it's

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
follows what it always turns yellow it's

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.400 
follows what it always turns yellow it's
just<00:03:35.040> one<00:03:35.130> force<00:03:35.400> now<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.670> blue<00:03:35.910> cool<00:03:36.810> white

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
just one force now it's blue cool white

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.349 
just one force now it's blue cool white
back<00:03:37.650> down<00:03:37.859> in<00:03:37.980> here<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> regular<00:03:38.819> gdv

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
back down in here this is a regular gdv

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.640 
back down in here this is a regular gdv
a<00:03:39.390> missile<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:40.049> is<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.290> polyurethane

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
a missile but this is that polyurethane

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.720 
a missile but this is that polyurethane
mitt<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.459> turns<00:03:41.700> yellow

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
mitt so it turns yellow

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.180 
mitt so it turns yellow
this<00:03:43.420> was<00:03:43.569> a<00:03:43.599> polyurethane<00:03:44.530> he's<00:03:44.950> used

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
this was a polyurethane he's used

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.130 
this was a polyurethane he's used
because<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.760> doesn't<00:03:46.540> give<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:47.050> the
