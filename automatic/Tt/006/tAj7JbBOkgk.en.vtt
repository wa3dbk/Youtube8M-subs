head is on a small ball joint I mean it
doesn't<00:02:34.840> pop<00:02:35.080> off<00:02:35.230> easily<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.890> ball<00:02:36.040> joint

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
doesn't pop off easily so the ball joint

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.050 
doesn't pop off easily so the ball joint
is<00:02:36.400> basically<00:02:36.850> in<00:02:37.060> there<00:02:37.239> on<00:02:37.989> his<00:02:38.230> arm<00:02:38.380> here

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
is basically in there on his arm here

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.789 
is basically in there on his arm here
snaps<00:02:40.060> into<00:02:40.330> place<00:02:40.540> he<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.080> move<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.380> up<00:02:41.500> and

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
that back here is mainly to support

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.020 
that back here is mainly to support
transformation<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.579> everything<00:03:00.880> don't

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
transformation so as is everything don't

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.280

so his friends can fight I don't have

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.390 
so his friends can fight I don't have
fast<00:03:29.890> active<00:03:30.220> either<00:03:30.400> prime<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:31.060> yet

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
fast active either prime just yet

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.599 
fast active either prime just yet
well<00:03:33.400> again<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.970> don't<00:03:34.569> know<00:03:34.870> yet<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:36.459> can

well again I don't know yet and you can
also<00:03:36.730> still<00:03:37.150> shoot<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.600> missile<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:41.170> she

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
also still shoot that missile and so she

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.789 
also still shoot that missile and so she
is<00:03:41.440> such<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.650> strong<00:03:41.799> controller<00:03:42.579> good<00:03:42.760> so<00:03:43.799> well

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
is such a strong controller good so well

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.830 
is such a strong controller good so well
that's<00:03:45.220> basically<00:03:45.430> for<00:03:45.730> fast<00:03:46.209> action<00:03:46.450> battery

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
that's basically for fast action battery

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.220 
that's basically for fast action battery
