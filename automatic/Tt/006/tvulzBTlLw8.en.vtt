lot<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.130> individual<00:01:17.700> skill<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.180> won<00:01:18.570> almost

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
lot of individual skill I won almost

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.640

every one on one battle I played that's

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.109 
every one on one battle I played that's
cuz<00:01:22.890> halo<00:01:23.189> takes<00:01:23.460> longer<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.790> kill<00:01:23.939> somebody

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.340 
pay for my experience is that being a
main<00:01:59.610> Slayer<00:01:59.850> helps<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.390> team<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.110> much

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
main Slayer helps out your team so much

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.139 
main Slayer helps out your team so much
if<00:02:01.560> you're<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.860> pounding<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
if you're just pounding on them the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.990 
if you're just pounding on them the
enemy<00:02:03.750> team<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.020> always<00:02:04.259> dying

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.809 

yeah<00:02:10.000> if<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.569> enemy<00:02:10.750> team<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.989> always<00:02:11.170> dying

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
yeah if the enemy team is always dying

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.759 
yeah if the enemy team is always dying
that's<00:02:12.819> an<00:02:12.940> advantage<00:02:13.060> right<00:02:13.390> there<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
that's an advantage right there and the

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.680 
that's an advantage right there and the
best<00:02:14.950> way<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.099> do<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.400> halo<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.239> know

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
best way to do that in halo is to know

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.589 
best way to do that in halo is to know
the<00:02:16.720> spawns<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:18.340> call<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.670> duty<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.150> match

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
the spawns but call of duty the match

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.460 
the spawns but call of duty the match
our<00:02:19.780> beer<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.920> spawns<00:02:21.190> are<00:02:21.370> more<00:02:22.030> random

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
our beer and the spawns are more random

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.229 
our beer and the spawns are more random
then<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.849> n<00:02:24.849> halo<00:02:25.299> so<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.670> only<00:02:27.819> way<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.030> get

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
then in n halo so the only way to get

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.390 
then in n halo so the only way to get
really<00:02:28.510> spawn<00:02:28.810> rape<00:02:28.959> them<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.709> get<00:02:30.250> some

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
really spawn rape them is to get some

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.559 
really spawn rape them is to get some
kill<00:02:30.580> streaks<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:30.970> that's<00:02:31.120> exactly<00:02:31.239> what<00:02:31.540> I

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
kill streaks and that's exactly what I

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.020 
kill streaks and that's exactly what I
do<00:02:31.629> this<00:02:31.840> game<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:33.280> not<00:02:33.400> trying<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.670> justify

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
do this game I'm not trying to justify

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.089 
do this game I'm not trying to justify
not<00:02:34.450> happening<00:02:35.110> flags<00:02:35.379> I<00:02:35.590> do<00:02:35.650> try<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.890> cap

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
not happening flags I do try to cap

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.680 
not happening flags I do try to cap
flags<00:02:36.400> um<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:38.010> people<00:02:39.010> say<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.690> capturing

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
flags um and people say that capturing

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.050 
flags um and people say that capturing
two<00:02:40.900> flags<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.680> spawn<00:02:42.610> right<00:02:42.760> being<00:02:42.970> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
two flags and spawn right being the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.390 
two flags and spawn right being the
other<00:02:43.239> flag<00:02:43.599> is<00:02:43.900> best<00:02:44.290> tactic<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:44.950> I'd<00:02:45.040> agree

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
other flag is best tactic and I'd agree

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.360 
other flag is best tactic and I'd agree
respectfully<00:02:46.299> um<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:47.349> is<00:02:47.739> if<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.040> want<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> get

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
respectfully um it is if you want to get

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.949 
respectfully um it is if you want to get
kills<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.880> if<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.060> want<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.269> come<00:02:49.420> in<00:02:49.510> an

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
kills and if you want to come in an

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.009 
kills and if you want to come in an
isolated<00:02:50.380> area<00:02:50.670> but<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.880> say<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.450> can<00:02:52.750> do<00:02:52.870> it

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
isolated area but I say if you can do it

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.229 
isolated area but I say if you can do it
why<00:02:53.200> not<00:02:53.230> go<00:02:53.530> for<00:02:53.560> all<00:02:53.829> three<00:02:54.129> that's<00:02:55.060> my

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
why not go for all three that's my

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.110 
why not go for all three that's my
philosophy<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:57.160> that's<00:02:57.280> exactly<00:02:57.430> what<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.060> do

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
philosophy and that's exactly what I do

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.270 
philosophy and that's exactly what I do

to<00:06:21.390> come<00:06:21.630> back<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:25.400> I<00:06:26.400> have<00:06:26.790> not<00:06:27.030> watched<00:06:27.240> the

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
to come back and I have not watched the

to come back and I have not watched the
rest<00:06:27.630> of<00:06:27.810> this<00:06:27.930> video

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
rest of this video

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.120 
rest of this video
a<00:06:29.300> little<00:06:29.510> bit<00:06:29.630> so<00:06:29.870> i<00:06:30.110> might<00:06:30.890> be<00:06:30.980> a<00:06:31.010> little

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
a little bit so i might be a little

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.420 
a little bit so i might be a little
rusty<00:06:31.250> on<00:06:31.580> what<00:06:31.930> plot<00:06:33.040> advancements<00:06:34.040> but<00:06:34.250> i

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
rusty on what plot advancements but i

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.870 
rusty on what plot advancements but i
know<00:06:34.520> its<00:06:34.820> 195<00:06:35.570> didn't<00:06:36.130> 209<00:06:37.130> so<00:06:37.520> I<00:06:37.550> think<00:06:37.790> they

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
know its 195 didn't 209 so I think they

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:46.540 
know its 195 didn't 209 so I think they
captured<00:06:38.360> 0<00:06:41.860> 4<00:06:43.570> 204<00:06:44.570> look<00:06:45.290> at<00:06:45.440> that<00:06:45.620> and<00:06:45.890> I<00:06:46.400> did

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
captured 0 4 204 look at that and I did

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.040 
captured 0 4 204 look at that and I did
well<00:06:46.760> too<00:06:46.970> but<00:06:47.210> that's<00:06:47.360> not<00:06:47.510> a<00:06:47.570> that's<00:06:47.660> not<00:06:47.870> the

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
well too but that's not a that's not the

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.280
