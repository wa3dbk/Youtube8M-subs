something to think about three games
this<00:02:30.150> season<00:02:30.360> not<00:02:31.110> one<00:02:31.440> time<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:31.890> they<00:02:31.980> had

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
this season not one time if they had

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.559 
this season not one time if they had
more<00:02:32.310> than<00:02:32.370> four<00:02:32.700> shots<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.150> goal<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.510> either

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569

to<00:03:19.829> great<00:03:20.069> effect<00:03:20.220> against<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:20.760> Colorado

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
to great effect against the Colorado

to great effect against the Colorado
Rapids<00:03:21.239> perhaps<00:03:21.690> his<00:03:21.870> best<00:03:22.049> game<00:03:22.349> in<00:03:22.530> this

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
Rapids perhaps his best game in this

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.670 
Rapids perhaps his best game in this
regard<00:03:23.069> but<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.180> have<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:25.019> think<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.500> will

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
regard but I have to think that will

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.800 
regard but I have to think that will
Johnson<00:03:26.220> Diego<00:03:26.549> Chara<00:03:26.819> are<00:03:27.030> not<00:03:27.209> going<00:03:27.540> to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
Johnson Diego Chara are not going to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.479 
Johnson Diego Chara are not going to
lose<00:03:28.019> him<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.440> way<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.709> rapids<00:03:29.130> did<00:03:29.310> they're

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
lose him the way the rapids did they're

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.550 
lose him the way the rapids did they're
going<00:03:29.639> to<00:03:29.730> be<00:03:29.819> all<00:03:30.030> over<00:03:30.930> him<00:03:31.079> they're<00:03:31.290> not

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
going to be all over him they're not

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.050 
going to be all over him they're not
going<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.919> give<00:03:32.010> him<00:03:32.310> space<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.790> that's<00:03:32.910> going

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
going to give him space and that's going

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.400 
going to give him space and that's going
to<00:03:33.120> make<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.389> difficult<00:03:33.510> for<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.019> Sounders

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
to make it difficult for the Sounders

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.259 
to make it difficult for the Sounders
we're<00:03:34.829> going<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.010> rely<00:03:35.250> on<00:03:35.280> him<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.609> create<00:03:35.940> let

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
we're going to rely on him to create let

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.909 
we're going to rely on him to create let
me<00:03:36.329> do<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.569> math<00:03:36.780> there<00:03:37.139> so<00:03:37.349> it's<00:03:37.500> Valeri

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
me do the math there so it's Valeri

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.460 
me do the math there so it's Valeri
against<00:03:38.250> Alonso<00:03:38.790> that's<00:03:38.970> 1v1<00:03:39.450> but<00:03:40.319> it's

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
against Alonso that's 1v1 but it's

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.309 
against Alonso that's 1v1 but it's
Dempsey<00:03:40.980> against<00:03:41.370> cha-da<00:03:41.639> and<00:03:41.970> Johnson<00:03:42.810> 1v2

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
Dempsey against cha-da and Johnson 1v2

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.050 
Dempsey against cha-da and Johnson 1v2
that's<00:03:43.799> going<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.069> make<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.430> pretty<00:03:44.790> difficult

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
that's going to make it pretty difficult

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.629 
that's going to make it pretty difficult
ultimately<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.959> think<00:03:46.019> for<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.829> Sounders<00:03:47.459> to

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
ultimately I think for the Sounders to

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.120 
ultimately I think for the Sounders to
find<00:03:47.910> Eddie<00:03:48.090> Johnson<00:03:48.599> get<00:03:48.810> him<00:03:49.079> open<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.980> is

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
find Eddie Johnson get him open it is

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.129 
find Eddie Johnson get him open it is
going<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.459> be<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.579> great<00:03:51.120> game<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.450> remember

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
going to be a great game and remember

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.900 
going to be a great game and remember
this<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.769> first<00:03:53.010> time<00:03:53.280> these<00:03:53.579> two

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910

building<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.190> think<00:03:59.459> since<00:03:59.669> the<00:04:00.120> second<00:04:00.599> half

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840
