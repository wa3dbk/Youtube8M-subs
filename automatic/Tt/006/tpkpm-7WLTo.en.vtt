00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.479 
streaks do you guys think is better do
you<00:03:22.169> think<00:03:22.349> that<00:03:22.469> one<00:03:22.620> was<00:03:22.739> just<00:03:22.919> easier<00:03:23.340> to

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
you think that one was just easier to

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.009 
you think that one was just easier to
use<00:03:23.669> or<00:03:23.879> maybe<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.209> felt<00:03:24.389> that<00:03:24.480> one<00:03:24.689> was<00:03:24.840> more

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
use or maybe you felt that one was more

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.659 
use or maybe you felt that one was more
effective<00:03:25.290> than<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.650> other<00:03:25.859> leave<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.519> as<00:03:26.639> a

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
guys have on which one of these two is a

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.119 
guys have on which one of these two is a
better<00:03:33.090> Street<00:03:33.419> reward<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.590> which<00:03:34.799> one<00:03:34.979> of<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
better Street reward so which one of the

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.550 
better Street reward so which one of the
two<00:03:35.159> versions<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.849> rc-xd<00:03:36.329> was<00:03:36.780> better<00:03:36.989> it

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
two versions of the rc-xd was better it

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.949 
two versions of the rc-xd was better it
was<00:03:37.680> actually<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.129> rc-xd<00:03:38.519> from<00:03:39.389> black<00:03:39.599> ops<00:03:39.810> 1

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
was actually the rc-xd from black ops 1

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.869 
was actually the rc-xd from black ops 1
the<00:03:40.739> reason<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.099> was<00:03:41.190> better<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.519> because<00:03:41.639> it

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
the reason it was better is because it

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.000 
the reason it was better is because it
only<00:03:42.090> took<00:03:42.359> three<00:03:42.419> kills<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.049> get<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.620> wasn't

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
only took three kills to get it wasn't

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.649 
only took three kills to get it wasn't
like<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.220> RC<00:03:44.549> XD<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:44.909> black<00:03:45.090> ops<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.510> took

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
like the RC XD and black ops that took

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.719 
like the RC XD and black ops that took
five<00:03:45.989> kills<00:03:46.349> in<00:03:46.530> order<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.859> get<00:03:47.099> on<00:03:47.310> top<00:03:47.579> of

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
five kills in order to get on top of

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.610 
five kills in order to get on top of
that<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:48.000> was<00:03:48.090> basically<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.750> same<00:03:48.989> thing<00:03:49.049> it

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
that it was basically the same thing it

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.920 
that it was basically the same thing it
only<00:03:49.829> took<00:03:50.069> one<00:03:50.400> shot<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.909> kill<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.599> can<00:03:51.750> only

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
only took one shot to kill you can only

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.839 
only took one shot to kill you can only
use<00:03:52.169> it<00:03:52.319> once<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.739> lasted<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.189> same<00:03:53.430> amount<00:03:53.760> of

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
use it once it lasted the same amount of

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.610 
use it once it lasted the same amount of
time<00:03:53.909> but<00:03:54.479> you<00:03:54.629> were<00:03:54.720> able<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.019> get<00:03:55.259> it<00:03:55.379> almost

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
time but you were able to get it almost

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.679 
time but you were able to get it almost
two<00:03:55.919> kills<00:03:56.250> faster<00:03:56.699> than<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.150> would<00:03:57.359> in<00:03:57.569> the

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
two kills faster than you would in the

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.839 
two kills faster than you would in the
