00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:23.359
 everything went very well we have a good 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.810
 there is a selection to do with my 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.029
 assistants 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.970
 we went on the matches during a 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.400
 month and about a month ago we have 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.350
 spotted players now the door 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.449
 there are twenty-six players who are there the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.559
 door is open also to others it is 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.190
 what I would have said because there are some 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.320
 who can not follow or then there are 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.260
 what will come next because 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.219
 their qualities will be demonstrated 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.840
 chance to have as a trainer 200 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.730
 players at his disposal because a 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.270
 professional league that goes up and this 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.640
 with the professionals takes each 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.210
 week is gaining momentum 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.100
 I think it makes sense to primer 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.470
 looking for my research she's going to be 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.939
 that of a group we have phases that 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.790
 are going to happen who are the cause so 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.710
 that they are the games of the islands that are 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.700
 also mouth qualifying for the chan 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.549
 see the can 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.729
 all of this these are ways going to have to 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.140
 to be very disciplined I do not have to do 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.490
 I may be the policeman 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.710
 players but I'm asking for a 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.150
 self-discipline of the players it's up to them 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.690
 of this too disciplined to be 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.620
 professionals from 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.090
 to think that behind a professional 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.790
 there is work and work and the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.250
 discipline so I played in France 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.410
 I did two training centers 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.790
 then i was in asia and i went 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.300
 by Finland and otherwise I still have 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.680
 summer in France 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.900
 I really hope to be able to bring this 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.460
 that I could learn in France and 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.900
 I arrive on tiptoe of 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.900
 to play is to show the best
