00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
within about an hour but you probably

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.899 
within about an hour but you probably
have<00:01:55.210> taken<00:01:55.899> quicker<00:01:56.110> than<00:01:56.290> Ted<00:01:56.590> but<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.789> know

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909
