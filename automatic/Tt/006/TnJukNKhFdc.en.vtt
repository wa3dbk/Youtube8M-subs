00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.660
 with higher construction density per 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.220
 square meter throughout Mesoamerica 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.480
 we are going to enter the area 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.150
 theological support one of only two 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.590
 accesses I had because we are going to visit 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.500
 the part of ceremony the open part 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.040
 to the public they are like two hectares and the 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.990
 1% of the best in the tradition that has been 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.820
 determined to request a lot 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.810
 chicalcÃ³ was inscribed on the list of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.229
 World Heritage on December 4,

 1999 under criteria 3 and 4 of the 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.080
 world heritage convention 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.500
 xochicalco comes from Nahuatl la 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.810
 application that is scarce calling flower and 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.810
 What do you mean instead of 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.060
 then in water that means in 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.830
 place of the house of flowers here 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.229
 we have a very interesting shot of 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.619
 museum of xochicalco site in the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.530
 first ecological museum in mexico that 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.049
 works with self-sustaining energy 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.710
 and here we are in the plaza de la 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.840
 wake of the two sons 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.840
 after the two taps that the wake has 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.130
 they are the year nine eye of reptile day 10 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.409
 cane 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.270
 it sounds like a spell 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.270
 It is obviously a chalaca 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.190
 and here also applies the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.560
 small steps not to give the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.900
 back or more because they had like 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.050
 different details related to what 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.020
 do not 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.800
 you can turn your back on an object 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.110
 ritual they had a leg 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.410
 you can imagine here our 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.930
 ancestors or chical 15 is as if 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.330
 adjusted girls stepped on these lands 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.330
 in 1934 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:01.209
 and later they separate 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.209
 one observes everything in the most pleasant way 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.860
 after being amazed by the beauty 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.780
 from the observatory and stare at the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.090
 sun to the extent of staying partially 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.739
 blind we decided it was time to 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.079
 leave this important site 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.079
 archaeological to go to cross the skies 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.590
 a half hour from xochicalco is 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.240
 the lake of tequesquitengo and this time 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.000
 we wanted to inject a little speed 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.930
 height and adrenaline to travel 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.700
 sorry I said a lot of adrenaline what 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.610
 that you can see here is an ultralight and 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.010
 is about to get me up with exact marcus 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.480
 in what my pilot does if there are nerves 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.470
 because I have no idea how it's going to be 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.570
 This trip 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.570
 I trust in good hands, right 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.200
 in aerodynamics they have several types of 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.270
 ultralight that can take you to 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.280
 know the tequesquitengo lake from 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.040
 a slightly higher perspective to the 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.200
 You can also make flights 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.550
 longer to other parts of morelos 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.550
 like the ruins of xochicalco 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.030
 it was definitely one of the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.930
 most unique experiences of all 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.180
 our trips 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.009
 we recommend it a lot as it is 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.009
 closest there is to fly 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.719
 the most intense roller coaster many 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.719
 Thank you 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.600
 now we are in the camp that is 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.639
 on one side of cacahuamilpa caves 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.180
 here you can camp for only 50 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.180
 pesos per person 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.630
 I 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.630
 what 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.870
 now if we go into the bowels of 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.980
 this earth the caves of cacahuamilpa 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.140
 considered one of the most 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.670
 awesome of the world we are 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.670
 entering the grottos of cacahuamilpa 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.620
 the caves were discovered in 1834 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.570
 although inside they have been found 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.700
 vestiges of prehispanic cultures that 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.280
 they inhabit them along two kilometers 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.770
 you can meet more than 20 salons 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.409
 open to the public that can reach 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.509
 heights of up to 81 meters 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.759
 the stalactites and stalagmites are 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.949
 mineral formations that grow 13 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.929
 millimeters every 100 years and are the 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:50.729
 responsible for building the figures that 

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:52.319
 they are found in fruits so 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.569
 calculate how many millions of years 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.129
 they had to pass in order to admire 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.939
 these impressive sculptures 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.939
 natural 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.490
 over the years the visitors 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.800
 they have named many of the 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.600
 formations and our guide is about 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.490
 to give us some examples if we are going to 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.200
 observe the formations we can look 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.450
 in front is the half that is 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.080
 illuminated resembles a Chinese tower of 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.840

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.540

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.790
 back gorilla calendar up 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.180
 we also wanted to put the 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.040
 name of some toothbrush 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.560

 karen leaf and where he lives with 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.870
 I did not know how to answer our guide but 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.800
 we keep looking for it and something tells me that 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.800
 we were not far
