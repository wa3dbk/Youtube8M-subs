00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
set because it's just seems so different

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.299 
set because it's just seems so different
now<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> mean<00:00:33.840> we've<00:00:33.989> gotten<00:00:34.350> temples<00:00:34.800> before

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
but this one's different air Jets use a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.540 
but this one's different air Jets use a
whole<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> whole<00:00:37.920> different<00:00:38.040> form<00:00:38.430> of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
whole like a whole different form of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.500 
whole like a whole different form of
Spinjitzu<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.790> may<00:00:42.059> be<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.390> if

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
Spinjitzu now I know that may be like if

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.779 
Spinjitzu now I know that may be like if
we<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> Spinjitzu<00:00:43.140> temple<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.399> could<00:00:44.670> be

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
we get a Spinjitzu temple it could be

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
we get a Spinjitzu temple it could be
like<00:00:44.969> spinners<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> around<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.379> mean

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
a little arena or something but this is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.450 
a little arena or something but this is
different<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.410> airjitzu<00:00:49.770> ear

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
different because it's airjitzu ear

here<00:02:13.319> from

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
here from

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.970 
here from
the<00:02:14.310> riding<00:02:14.580> David<00:02:14.730> shows<00:02:15.060> video<00:02:15.800> about<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the riding David shows video about the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.200 
the riding David shows video about the
confirmation<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:19.310> 7075<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.700> temple<00:02:21.090> of

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
confirmation of the 7075 one temple of

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.950 
confirmation of the 7075 one temple of
airjitzu<00:02:21.890> Tom<00:02:22.890> set<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.930> a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
airjitzu Tom set so it is going to be a

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.890 
airjitzu Tom set so it is going to be a
set<00:02:25.260> released<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.700> summer<00:02:27.150> wave<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.630> think

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
set released for the summer wave I think

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.890 
set released for the summer wave I think
and<00:02:28.910> nothing<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.000> supposed<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.270> be<00:02:30.360> more

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
and nothing is supposed to be more

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.440 
and nothing is supposed to be more
expensive<00:02:31.200> than<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.880> final<00:02:32.880> flight<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
expensive than the final flight for the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.030 
expensive than the final flight for the
Destiny's<00:02:33.900> pounding<00:02:34.260> at<00:02:34.380> least<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.680> think<00:02:34.740> so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
Destiny's pounding at least I think so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.160 
Destiny's pounding at least I think so
it<00:02:35.670> sounds<00:02:35.850> like<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> be<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> really<00:02:36.750> big<00:02:36.870> set

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
it sounds like it to be a really big set

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.610 
it sounds like it to be a really big set
um<00:02:38.510> again<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.690> don't<00:02:39.840> know<00:02:39.930> much<00:02:40.140> about<00:02:40.320> it

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
um again we don't know much about it

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.860 
um again we don't know much about it
honestly<00:02:40.740> but<00:02:41.130> I'm<00:02:41.580> just<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.090> curious<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.660> how

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
honestly but I'm just so curious on how

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.090 
honestly but I'm just so curious on how
they're<00:02:43.110> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.320> build<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.770> setup

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
they're going to build this setup

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.990 
they're going to build this setup
because<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.130> sounds<00:02:47.640> so

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
because it is just so it just sounds so

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.260 
because it is just so it just sounds so
uniquely<00:02:48.690> different<00:02:49.070> because<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.760> temple

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
uniquely different because it's a temple

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.530 
uniquely different because it's a temple
for<00:02:51.420> airjitzu<00:02:52.220> temple<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.490> airjitzu<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.330> mean

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
for airjitzu temple of airjitzu I mean

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.180 
for airjitzu temple of airjitzu I mean
it's<00:02:54.720> obviously<00:02:55.260> has<00:02:55.500> something<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:56.040> with

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
it's obviously has something to do with

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.490 
it's obviously has something to do with
airjitzu<00:02:56.550> but<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.300> don't<00:02:57.510> know<00:02:57.630> how<00:02:57.990> they<00:02:58.320> would

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
airjitzu but I don't know how they would

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.800 
airjitzu but I don't know how they would
put<00:02:58.770> it<00:02:58.860> together<00:02:58.980> because<00:02:59.880> arijit<00:03:00.660> through

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
put it together because arijit through

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.080 
put it together because arijit through
is<00:03:00.900> such<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> unique<00:03:01.350> sort<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.190> function<00:03:02.760> for

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
is such a unique sort of function for

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.470 
is such a unique sort of function for

expensive<00:04:07.950> than<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.370> temples<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.600> usually

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
expensive than the temples so usually

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.330 
expensive than the temples so usually
the<00:04:10.140> temples<00:04:10.440> aren't<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.739> most<00:04:10.890> expensive

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
the temples aren't the most expensive

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.260 
the temples aren't the most expensive
what<00:04:11.610> they<00:04:12.590> usually<00:04:13.590> are<00:04:13.739> um<00:04:14.220> pretty<00:04:15.030> good

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
what they usually are um pretty good

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.590 
what they usually are um pretty good
price<00:04:15.600> or<00:04:16.020> not<00:04:16.290> they<00:04:16.830> got<00:04:17.010> their<00:04:17.880> price<00:04:18.209> pretty

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
price or not they got their price pretty

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.880 
price or not they got their price pretty
high<00:04:18.780> but<00:04:19.020> they're<00:04:19.169> not<00:04:19.290> always<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.859> most

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
high but they're not always the most

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.280 
high but they're not always the most
expensive<00:04:20.520> this<00:04:21.330> one<00:04:21.540> seems<00:04:21.780> like<00:04:21.960> it's<00:04:22.109> going

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
expensive this one seems like it's going

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.110 
expensive this one seems like it's going
to<00:04:22.350> be<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.770> most<00:04:22.890> expensive<00:04:23.280> which<00:04:23.850> means

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
to be the most expensive which means

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.330 
to be the most expensive which means
it's<00:04:24.300> going<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.630> probably<00:04:24.840> be<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.979> be<00:04:26.160> the

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
it's going to probably be to be the

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.260 
it's going to probably be to be the
biggest

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
biggest

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.869 
biggest
so<00:04:27.539> if<00:04:27.930> it's<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.259> biggest<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:29.400> obviously

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
so if it's the biggest it's obviously

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.520 
so if it's the biggest it's obviously
gotta<00:04:30.090> have<00:04:30.330> a<00:04:30.360> lot<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.110> so<00:04:31.860> um<00:04:33.379> what<00:04:34.379> do<00:04:34.440> you

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
gotta have a lot to it so um what do you

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.839 
gotta have a lot to it so um what do you
think<00:04:34.770> how<00:04:34.889> do<00:04:34.949> you<00:04:35.009> think<00:04:35.099> this<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.490> going<00:04:35.759> to

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
think how do you think this is going to

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.730 
think how do you think this is going to
be<00:04:35.940> set<00:04:36.240> up<00:04:36.270> because<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.199> don't<00:04:37.349> know<00:04:37.379> how<00:04:37.590> will

be set up because I don't know how will

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.499 
be set up because I don't know how will

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
this temple of airjitzu is going to be

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.390 
this temple of airjitzu is going to be
set<00:04:39.659> up<00:04:39.750> I'm<00:04:39.900> really<00:04:40.080> curious<00:04:40.259> because<00:04:41.099> it

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
will include leave it will include a

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.290 
will include leave it will include a
special<00:05:15.060> airjitzu<00:05:15.389> um<00:05:16.490> spinner<00:05:17.490> for<00:05:18.240> a

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
special airjitzu um spinner for a

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.180 
special airjitzu um spinner for a
different<00:05:18.599> character<00:05:18.930> like<00:05:19.139> me<00:05:19.800> Lloyd

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
different character like me Lloyd

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.529 
different character like me Lloyd
because<00:05:20.669> they<00:05:20.789> didn't<00:05:20.969> have<00:05:21.000> look<00:05:21.210> for<00:05:21.360> Lloyd

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539

because they didn't have look for Lloyd
so<00:05:22.880> maybe<00:05:23.880> they'll<00:05:24.030> include<00:05:24.270> that<00:05:24.569> but<00:05:24.900> what
