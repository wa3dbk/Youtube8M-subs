on<00:00:08.069> things<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:08.910> going<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.059> make<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.269> polygon

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
on things we're going to make a polygon

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.970 
on things we're going to make a polygon
sphere<00:00:13.940> polygon<00:00:14.940> cube<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.690> mean<00:00:16.230> hit<00:00:16.680> five<00:00:16.949> in

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
sphere polygon cube I mean hit five in

little gizmo here and I can pull it up I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.610 
little gizmo here and I can pull it up I
can<00:00:40.920> pull<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.399> side<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.440> angle<00:00:43.440> it

can pull it to the side and up angle it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.810 
can pull it to the side and up angle it
whatever<00:00:45.020> rotate<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> actually<00:00:47.430> want

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
extension coming up from the center but

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.270 
extension coming up from the center but
not<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.610> flush<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:56.039> I'm<00:00:56.160> actually

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
not just flush like this so I'm actually

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.560 
not just flush like this so I'm actually
going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.610> click<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.270> these<00:00:57.390> little

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
going to click on one of these little

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.750 
going to click on one of these little
squares<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.440> end<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> arrows<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
squares on the end of the arrows it's a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.819 
squares on the end of the arrows it's a
scale<00:01:00.120> Square<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.899> opens<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.620> light

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
scale Square and it opens up a light

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.860 
scale Square and it opens up a light
blue<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> middle<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.719> I'm

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
blue one in the middle here and I'm

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
blue one in the middle here and I'm
actually<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> grab<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.250> you'll

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
actually going to grab that and you'll

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.340 
actually going to grab that and you'll
see<00:01:05.700> what<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> does<00:01:06.799> ok<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
see what it does ok so I'm going to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.450 
see what it does ok so I'm going to
leave<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.860> I'm<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> leave<00:01:11.430> it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
leave that and I'm going to leave it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
leave that and I'm going to leave it
selectively<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
selectively just like it is because the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.600 
selectively just like it is because the
face<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.380> already<00:01:13.710> selected<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.280> why

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
face is already selected so why

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.270 
face is already selected so why
unselected<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.350> go<00:01:16.470> ad<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:16.830> polygons

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
unselected they can go ad at polygons

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.370 
unselected they can go ad at polygons
extrude<00:01:17.909> face<00:01:18.180> again<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.369> I'll<00:01:20.549> just

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
extrude face again and then I'll just

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.429 
extrude face again and then I'll just
pull<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:24.680> pretty<00:01:25.680> cool<00:01:27.049> now<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.080> want<00:01:28.350> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
pull it up pretty cool now I want to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.899 
pull it up pretty cool now I want to
make<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.619> coming<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> side<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
make one coming out of the side but I

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.030 
make one coming out of the side but I
don't<00:01:30.119> want<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.360> touch<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:31.020> don't<00:01:31.829> want<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
don't want it to touch I don't want it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.640 
don't want it to touch I don't want it
to<00:01:32.070> touch<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.610> base<00:01:32.970> bar<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.530> do

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
to touch this base bar here you just do

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.710 
to touch this base bar here you just do
almost<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> same<00:01:35.250> principle<00:01:35.759> again<00:01:36.000> edit

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
almost the same principle again edit

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.319 
almost the same principle again edit

extrude face again pull it up mean if

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.330 
extrude face again pull it up mean if
you're<00:03:25.599> accurate<00:03:25.810> about<00:03:26.349> it<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.769> can<00:03:26.949> go

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
you're accurate about it you can go

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.659 
you're accurate about it you can go
ahead<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.750> make<00:03:29.590> these<00:03:29.829> manual<00:03:30.430> bins

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
ahead and and make these manual bins

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.860 
ahead and and make these manual bins
like<00:03:31.000> this<00:03:31.239> in<00:03:31.449> the<00:03:31.569> pipe<00:03:33.030> some<00:03:34.030> do<00:03:34.269> it<00:03:34.299> oh<00:03:34.569> and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
like this in the pipe some do it oh and

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.449 
like this in the pipe some do it oh and
what<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.079> want<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.349> just<00:03:35.470> redo<00:03:35.949> it<00:03:36.099> instead<00:03:36.340> of

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
what I want to just redo it instead of

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.039 
what I want to just redo it instead of
having<00:03:36.639> to<00:03:36.790> go<00:03:36.939> up<00:03:37.030> here<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.209> extrude<00:03:37.659> face

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
having to go up here to extrude face

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.219 
having to go up here to extrude face
again<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:39.519> redo<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.269> institutional<00:03:40.870> over

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
again and redo the institutional over

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:45.420 
again and redo the institutional over
again<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:42.509> just<00:03:43.509> hit<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:43.659> G<00:03:43.959> key<00:03:44.229> and<00:03:44.560> GK

canceled major command it's not going to
do<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.829> rotation<00:03:55.769> but<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:56.919> look<00:03:57.069> like<00:03:57.250> an<00:03:57.400> a

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579

do the rotation but you look like an a
menu<00:03:57.939> command<00:03:58.359> like<00:03:58.659> the<00:03:58.689> extrusion<00:03:59.469> it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
menu command like the extrusion it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.849 
menu command like the extrusion it
redoes<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.819> see<00:04:01.180> II<00:04:04.469> rotate<00:04:05.469> a<00:04:05.500> little<00:04:05.620> more

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
redoes that see II rotate a little more

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.330 
redoes that see II rotate a little more
no<00:04:08.859> actually<00:04:09.759> I<00:04:09.789> made<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.180> pretty<00:04:10.419> decent<00:04:11.340> been

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
no actually I made a pretty decent been

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.080 
no actually I made a pretty decent been
just<00:04:14.400> go<00:04:15.400> back<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:15.579> object<00:04:15.819> mode<00:04:16.120> yeah<00:04:16.989> that's

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
just go back to object mode yeah that's

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.300 
just go back to object mode yeah that's
not<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.019> really<00:04:19.470> really<00:04:19.650> bad<00:04:19.949> uh<00:04:21.560> bend<00:04:22.560> for

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
not a really really bad uh bend for

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.830 
not a really really bad uh bend for
doing<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:23.910> manually<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:26.600> that's<00:04:27.600> basically

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
doing it manually and that's basically

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.760 
doing it manually and that's basically
how<00:04:28.430> extrusions<00:04:29.430> work
