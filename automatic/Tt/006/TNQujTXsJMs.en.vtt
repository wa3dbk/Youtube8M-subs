00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.390
 present a recipe that in my family 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.209
 I really like to prepare ourselves what 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.050
 we know as a special stream so 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:16.570
 I 'm going to start the ingredients 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.630
 mainly the meat us 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.200
 we use a lot of chopped chicken 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.210
 although it also goes very well with 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.500
 different meats such as rabbit 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.880
 mother in veal pig I will use the 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 chicken as argued 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.900
 next our log as well 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.510
 we know pepper garlic tomato onion yo 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.660
 I already have it crushed 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.660
 we will cut the carrot pea 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.530
 our usual white bean 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:04.030
 roasted red pepper rice white wine 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:09.260
 oil a pill must believe a leaf 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.210
 bay salt pepper and saffron because if 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.640
 it seems good to you I'm not going to show you how 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.680
 prepare in agreement once we have 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.120
 the hot oil are fed 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.120
 the chopped chicken 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.409
 also a bay leaf 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.570
 ah 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.150
 we do not leave any more real 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.899
 a new medium that we have 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.069
 the crushed child 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.370
 I like to use quite a bit 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.370
 more than tomato 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:35.659
 we let them warm up a 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.659
 little goes a little white wine 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.670
 we let them consume 5 minutes 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:54.420
 then we will stunt 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.420
 ah 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.930
 after 10 minutes of cooking 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.459
 that we see that the carrots are 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.459
 find a little soft 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.569
 we add the rice 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.349
 minted by people 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.810
 Hot water 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.110
 and use the average because I've done 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.110
 small amount 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.170
 we know a little more water 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.830
 we'll let it boil a little more 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.610
 about 5 minutes and then we add 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.610
 the next ingredients 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.470
 we have left 15 minutes covered for 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.760
 let him get to know 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:57.510
 and when you see that rice is already 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:00.920
 it's done a little bit we finally add 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.920
 and the other ingredients 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.310
 and they have happened to me 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.620
 ah 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:59.100
 with being all families we will leave them 15 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.630
 20 minutes covered 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.630
 until you are finished 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:08.919
 Well, but what are we going to use? 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.969
 Sometimes thank you very much for everything and we 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.969
 we will see the next day
