00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Welcome to the modest cuisine, sir. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 we will do a kind of garnish in this section 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.440
 especially the meatball ... 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.120
 and grilled meat. 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.600
 we have a nice tomato recipe 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.160
 We will learn the construction of "Meatball Paste" 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
 But if you want to have a look at the necessary materials before 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.120
 1 tomato 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.520
 1 red pepper 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.960
 3 tablespoons of pepper paste 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.480
 1 garlic cloves 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.040
 5 tablespoons olive oil 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.480
 1 teaspoon thyme 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.880
 1 teaspoon black pepper 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.800
 1 teaspoon of cumin 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.080
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.720
 we know the ingredients for meatballs 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.640
 in the meantime we roasted pepper and tomato 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.920
 Now we're peeling tomato and pepper 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.040
 now 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.440
 there is no beis 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.080
 mash 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.040
 Now we're going to remove the peppers 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.440
 in the same way 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.000
 If you remember we had 1 tooth garlic ... 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.280
 we're making it as small as we can 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
 yes we are adding 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.600
 now adding pepper paste on it 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.080
 if children are going to consume, they may also be home tomato paste 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.080
 Add 3 tablespoons 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.200
 5 tablespoons of olive oil on the paste 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.280
 other spices; cumin... 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.040
 black pepper... 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.640
 thyme... 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.640
 And after adding the salt ... 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.640
 we will mix well for a long time 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.120
 eze eze 5 minutes we have mixed up 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.120
 but don't pass it through 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.120
 its feature is granular 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.680
 now let's put it on a serving plate 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.840
 on the edge of the bread 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.840
 a wonderful sofa and a great sauce 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.400
 I wish you good luck 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.480
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.480
 as we can consume by the grids ... 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.480
 as a sofa and we can eat ... 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.520
 we shared a beautiful recipe, we learned the construction of "Meatball Paste" 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.320
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible, sir 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.880
 goodbye...
