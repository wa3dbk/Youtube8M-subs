okay so so of course the question that
we<00:02:01.530> all<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.920> ask<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.369> how<00:02:02.520> does<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
we all have to ask is how does the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.070 
we all have to ask is how does the
second<00:02:03.119> race<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.300> compared<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> first

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
second race of compared to the first

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.260 
second race of compared to the first
first<00:02:04.530> obviously<00:02:05.010> it<00:02:05.190> was<00:02:05.280> great<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.820> set

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
first obviously it was great to get set

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.690 
first obviously it was great to get set
the<00:02:06.360> first<00:02:06.660> goal<00:02:07.050> on<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> wrist<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.830> second

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the first goal on the wrist but second

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.160 
the first goal on the wrist but second
kind<00:02:08.850> of<00:02:08.940> legitimizes<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.720> not<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.110> you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
kind of legitimizes you not that you

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.590 
kind of legitimizes you not that you
needed<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:10.920> compare<00:02:11.790> compare<00:02:12.150> them<00:02:12.450> for

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
needed it but compare compare them for

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.930 
needed it but compare compare them for
me<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.900> don't<00:02:13.500> think<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.740> second<00:02:14.100> legitimizes

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
me I don't think the second legitimizes

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.060 
me I don't think the second legitimizes
me<00:02:15.090> everybody<00:02:15.540> knows<00:02:15.750> I'm<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.350> really<00:02:16.950> good
