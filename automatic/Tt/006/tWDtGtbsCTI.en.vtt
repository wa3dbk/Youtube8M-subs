00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.100

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.570

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.700
 The contest takes so much time 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.620
 would take and therefore I would like her 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.570
 especially and the others 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.610
 Build a big praise and mine 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.900

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.360
 really can invest 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.270

 done now yes I've got that 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.020
 first part with the winchester people 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.600
 in the new neighborhood sunset valley 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.640
 looked at and how you part by how 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.850
 a small child have been looking like expensive 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.470
 all the new impressions and 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.079
 I have to do a lot 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.360
 I found it great to smile and bring 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.280
 I also want to say that right away 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.150
 are you allowed to make your desired changes? 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.950
 make 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.110
 after all, you have to deal with the house 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.150
 feel good and it is your lp yours 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.049
 family and then change there just what 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.299
 you do not like it 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.400
 although I have to say now comes mine 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.500
 defense and my reasons 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.750
 I love the sleep too long why 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.610
 hate all the bedroom i mean 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.260
 I'm not that old right now 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.180
 but if I have a big hut 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.650
 with story drum and on 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.540
 then I would as well with furniture 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.300
 history maybe okay 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.160
 a little bit red can be 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.190
 but with such a house I like it too 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.070
 stale also regardless of how as 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.020
 John and Mary are now the hallway 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.820
 i understand best grabbed 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.800
 the bright living room floor is ryan dunn 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:50.110
 it's bright and you have a flowing one 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.300
 transition into the living room just like you and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.310
 Patrick had the bad talk there 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.500
 I had to laugh because I just 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.750
 finds that a blue pool is not 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.820
 old house fits and I thought so 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.960
 feel a nice part after and 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.720
 make the green one 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.910
 so that it looks like what you are there 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.850
 in and out there was wonderful 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.950
 Of course I found that very amusing now 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.900
 the skill room and its color 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.910
 yes I know is not everyone 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.470
 Taste but I build so many houses 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.940
 I also want that yourself 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.560
 still different in color 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.920
 And then sometimes such colors come 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.990
 like this with green blue mix out 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.090
 if it does not make a party so nothing 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.170
 mine is not stupid then gift 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.930
 just around 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.420
 yes and still to the greenhouse and the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.640
 children and friendly garden 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.440
 greenhouse just make it bigger 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.790
 but I would say put up 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.220
 Greenhouse still a few white 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.170
 walkway plates otherwise fastest in there 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.600
 winter through huge halls 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.340
 but then they plant in the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.650
 it is just too late to fall asleep 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.080
 so that there is no snow there children and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.239
 friendly garden I have none 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.930
 I do not know why I did not think so 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.820
 have 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.040
 I think because I'm the nursery 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.480
 already so full of game options 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.520
 I pumped those 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.180
 outdoor games are due 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.470
 so i'm sorry but you have 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.420
 yes already noted that in 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.270
 garden still enough space for playground equipment 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.709
 yes, so much to share fell then 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.020
