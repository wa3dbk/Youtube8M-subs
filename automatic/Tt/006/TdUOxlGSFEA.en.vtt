00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
was a bit slow in the very beginning I

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.740 
was a bit slow in the very beginning I
was<00:00:30.590> just<00:00:30.739> camping<00:00:31.130> top<00:00:31.310> on<00:00:31.550> a<00:00:31.579> lot<00:00:31.939> in<00:00:32.509> the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
beginning and I after that I think I

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.630 
beginning and I after that I think I
like<00:00:35.660> just<00:00:35.900> I'm<00:00:36.050> rotated<00:00:36.650> towards<00:00:36.949> like<00:00:37.129> a<00:00:37.160> Tom

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
cutting down a little bit of the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.780 
cutting down a little bit of the
beginning<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.440> game<00:00:46.070> flake<00:00:46.370> is<00:00:46.610> the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
chemistry streak well is pretty slow

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.750 
chemistry streak well is pretty slow

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
if there wasn't like a nuclear Moab cam

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
feel like the game will be a lot more

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.960 
feel like the game will be a lot more
stale<00:01:12.289> because<00:01:12.800> all<00:01:13.070> they<00:01:13.310> would<00:01:13.580> really

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
stale because all they would really

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.880 
stale because all they would really
would<00:01:14.149> be<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.570> get<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:14.960> like<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.140> hundred<00:01:15.380> pluses

and<00:01:15.920> stuff<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.490> it's<00:01:16.729> not<00:01:16.850> really<00:01:17.090> is<00:01:17.179> fun<00:01:17.450> to

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
and stuff and it's not really is fun to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.080 
and stuff and it's not really is fun to
go<00:01:18.200> for<00:01:18.530> compared<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.070> like<00:01:19.190> new<00:01:19.460> clears<00:01:19.789> and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
go for compared to like new clears and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.719 
go for compared to like new clears and
like<00:01:20.240> mobs<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.750> stuff<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.560> at<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.250> same<00:01:22.459> time

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
like mobs and stuff but at the same time

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.210 
like mobs and stuff but at the same time
like<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.479> nuclear<00:01:24.170> it's<00:01:24.619> not<00:01:24.770> going<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:24.979> blow<00:01:25.069> up

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
like a nuclear it's not going to blow up

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.980 
like a nuclear it's not going to blow up
the<00:01:25.340> map<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:25.729> just<00:01:25.910> a<00:01:26.000> metal<00:01:26.270> that's

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
the map it's just a metal that's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.919 
the map it's just a metal that's
returning<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.979> I<00:01:28.280> feel<00:01:29.240> like<00:01:29.330> if<00:01:29.509> them<00:01:29.720> I'd

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
returning and I feel like if them I'd

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.630 
returning and I feel like if them I'd
like<00:01:30.200> blew<00:01:30.440> up<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.649> map<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.069> like<00:01:31.190> killed<00:01:31.489> a

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
like blew up the map and like killed a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.249 
like blew up the map and like killed a
whole<00:01:31.849> entire<00:01:32.119> enemy<00:01:32.360> team<00:01:32.509> like<00:01:32.989> it<00:01:33.140> would<00:01:33.229> be

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
whole entire enemy team like it would be

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.469 
whole entire enemy team like it would be
a<00:01:33.349> lot<00:01:33.500> more<00:01:33.530> rewarding<00:01:34.190> but<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:35.060> feel<00:01:35.330> like<00:01:35.360> I

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
a lot more rewarding but I feel like I

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.359 
a lot more rewarding but I feel like I
shouldn't<00:01:35.750> like<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.830> game<00:01:37.009> or<00:01:37.160> whatever

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
shouldn't like and the game or whatever

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.339 
shouldn't like and the game or whatever
like<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.610> tactical<00:01:38.239> nuke<00:01:38.270> in<00:01:38.569> them<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.989> be<00:01:39.110> too

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:39.349 
like a tactical nuke in them to be too

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.100 
like a tactical nuke in them to be too
but<00:01:40.190> another<00:01:40.550> thing<00:01:40.819> that's<00:01:41.030> really<00:01:41.119> stupid

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
but another thing that's really stupid

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.960 
but another thing that's really stupid
honestly<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.069> I<00:01:43.160> found<00:01:43.399> out<00:01:43.640> about<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
honestly that I found out about the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.600 
honestly that I found out about the
nuclear<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.450> advanced<00:01:44.690> warfare<00:01:45.140> is<00:01:45.610> that

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
nuclear and advanced warfare is that

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.880 
nuclear and advanced warfare is that
apparently<00:01:47.479> killstreak<00:01:48.110> eels<00:01:48.289> count<00:01:48.560> towards

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
apparently killstreak eels count towards

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.469 
apparently killstreak eels count towards
your<00:01:48.950> nuclear<00:01:49.429> which<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.700> said<00:01:49.849> I<00:01:49.970> just<00:01:50.030> find

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
your nuclear which I said I just find

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.050 
your nuclear which I said I just find
ridiculous<00:01:51.229> is<00:01:51.920> like<00:01:52.489> let's<00:01:52.759> say<00:01:52.849> if<00:01:53.030> you

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
ridiculous is like let's say if you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.210 
ridiculous is like let's say if you
gonna<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.509> 10<00:01:53.780> gunstreak<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.800> like<00:01:55.099> you

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
gonna like a 10 gunstreak and like you

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.790 
gonna like a 10 gunstreak and like you
get<00:01:55.369> some<00:01:55.550> random<00:01:55.849> assault<00:01:56.209> streak<00:01:56.599> and<00:01:56.840> I'm

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
get some random assault streak and I'm

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.589 
get some random assault streak and I'm
that<00:01:58.310> soul<00:01:58.580> streak<00:01:58.849> just<00:01:59.060> goes<00:01:59.209> completely

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
that soul streak just goes completely

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.809 
that soul streak just goes completely
off<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.379> it<00:02:00.440> gets<00:02:00.560> like<00:02:00.709> you<00:02:00.950> 20<00:02:01.310> kills<00:02:01.550> and

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
off and it gets like you 20 kills and

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.419 
off and it gets like you 20 kills and
you<00:02:02.720> don't<00:02:02.899> die<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.530> time<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:04.190> I

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
you don't die in the time that I

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.609 
you don't die in the time that I
killstreak<00:02:05.390> goes<00:02:05.569> up<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:05.989> feel<00:02:06.289> like<00:02:06.440> that

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
killstreak goes up I feel like that

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.229 
killstreak goes up I feel like that
would<00:02:06.679> be<00:02:06.739> like<00:02:07.069> not<00:02:07.489> is<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:07.729> like<00:02:07.970> really

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
would be like not is that like really

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.680 
would be like not is that like really
rewarding<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.080> get<00:02:09.349> a<00:02:09.379> nuclear<00:02:09.619> for<00:02:10.239> is<00:02:11.239> like

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
rewarding to get a nuclear for is like

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.089 
rewarding to get a nuclear for is like
also<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.260> could<00:02:12.379> probably<00:02:12.560> just<00:02:12.800> like<00:02:12.920> you're

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
also you could probably just like you're

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.070 
also you could probably just like you're
like<00:02:13.250> five<00:02:13.520> kills<00:02:13.970> with<00:02:14.330> your<00:02:14.540> gun<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:14.930> like

tactical nuke I feel like the game would

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.910 
tactical nuke I feel like the game would
be<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.549> a<00:03:04.580> lot<00:03:04.819> more<00:03:04.940> fun<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.360> go<00:03:05.480> for<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.989> feel

a<00:03:19.819> nuclear<00:03:20.420> cuz<00:03:21.110> like<00:03:21.260> instead<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.620> only<00:03:21.739> going

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
a nuclear cuz like instead of only going

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.440 
a nuclear cuz like instead of only going
for<00:03:22.099> a<00:03:22.160> nuclear<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.670> could<00:03:22.819> also<00:03:23.000> go<00:03:23.239> for<00:03:23.269> a

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
for a nuclear you could also go for a

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.050 
for a nuclear you could also go for a
MOAB<00:03:23.870> or<00:03:24.140> like<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.470> tactical<00:03:25.160> nuke<00:03:25.190> which<00:03:25.580> would

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
MOAB or like a tactical nuke which would

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.500 
MOAB or like a tactical nuke which would
be<00:03:26.209> really<00:03:26.390> fun<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.930> do<00:03:27.080> in<00:03:27.110> my<00:03:27.410> opinion<00:03:27.709> and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
be really fun to do in my opinion and

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.660 
be really fun to do in my opinion and
overall<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.540> think<00:03:29.810> if<00:03:30.530> they<00:03:30.769> do<00:03:30.830> all<00:03:31.220> if<00:03:31.519> they

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
overall I think if they do all if they

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.610 
overall I think if they do all if they
put<00:03:31.819> all<00:03:31.940> three<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.269> those<00:03:32.569> things<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.019> how<00:03:33.590> I

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
put all three of those things and how I

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.740 
put all three of those things and how I
said<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.489> should<00:03:34.700> be<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.880> feel<00:03:35.150> like<00:03:35.390> it'd<00:03:35.630> be

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
said it should be I feel like it'd be

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.050 
said it should be I feel like it'd be
pretty<00:03:35.930> balanced<00:03:36.590> in<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.829> way<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.910> game

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
pretty balanced in a way and the game

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.759 
pretty balanced in a way and the game
would<00:03:38.209> be<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.390> lot<00:03:38.540> more<00:03:38.600> fun<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.380> as<00:03:39.560> my
