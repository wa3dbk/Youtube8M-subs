00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
common with him I'm probably when it

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.750 
common with him I'm probably when it
took<00:01:55.710> school<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.100> serious

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
took school a serious

took school a serious
I<00:01:56.960> probably<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.260> stop<00:01:58.500> playing<00:01:58.770> sports

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
I probably would stop playing sports

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.300 
I probably would stop playing sports
probably<00:02:00.500> would<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.590> been<00:02:01.680> doing<00:02:02.010> things<00:02:02.190> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
probably would have been doing things I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.160 
probably would have been doing things I
wasn't<00:02:02.520> supposed<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.940> be<00:02:03.060> doing<00:02:03.180> well<00:02:03.510> at

wasn't supposed to be doing well at

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
wasn't supposed to be doing well at
other<00:02:04.320> schools<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.010> got<00:02:05.940> kids<00:02:06.270> like

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
other schools you know got kids like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.030 
other schools you know got kids like
they<00:02:07.080> got<00:02:07.200> their<00:02:07.320> cliques<00:02:07.650> they're<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.010> a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
they got their cliques they're like a

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.630 
they got their cliques they're like a
little<00:02:08.280> small<00:02:08.490> gang<00:02:08.760> small<00:02:09.330> stuff<00:02:09.570> like<00:02:09.720> that

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
little small gang small stuff like that

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.460 
little small gang small stuff like that
new<00:02:11.640> kids<00:02:11.940> come<00:02:12.600> into<00:02:12.780> schools<00:02:13.140> like<00:02:13.290> that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
new kids come into schools like that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.530 
new kids come into schools like that
it's<00:02:14.220> not<00:02:14.400> pretty<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.700> they<00:02:14.940> get<00:02:15.090> picked<00:02:15.330> on

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
it's not pretty like they get picked on

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.130 
it's not pretty like they get picked on
cedra<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:17.010> come<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.760> see<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:19.110> a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
cedra you come here you see this it's a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.080 
cedra you come here you see this it's a
lot<00:02:19.260> easier<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.680> fit<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.190> wonder<00:02:20.850> I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
lot easier to fit in up here wonder I

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.870 
lot easier to fit in up here wonder I
think<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> opportunities<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:22.890> Wando<00:02:23.610> kids

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
think the opportunities that Wando kids

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.150 
think the opportunities that Wando kids
get<00:02:24.180> really<00:02:25.140> makes<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.590> difference<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.070> our

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
get really makes a difference in our

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.450 
get really makes a difference in our
school<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.080> outstanding<00:02:28.080> faculty<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
school we have outstanding faculty and a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.670 
school we have outstanding faculty and a
really<00:02:30.000> great<00:02:30.300> community<00:02:30.570> surrounding<00:02:31.560> us

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
really great community surrounding us

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.550 
really great community surrounding us
that<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.670> very<00:02:32.880> open<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.810> helping<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that is very open to helping and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.290 
that is very open to helping and
participating<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.280> high<00:02:35.430> school<00:02:35.760> events<00:02:36.180> and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
participating in high school events and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.390 
participating in high school events and
activities<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.680> think<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.190> makes

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
activities and I think that really makes

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.180 
activities and I think that really makes
the<00:02:38.550> difference<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:39.810> because<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.890> all<00:02:41.040> this

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the difference we because of all this

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.980 
the difference we because of all this
involvement<00:02:41.850> we're<00:02:42.780> able<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.200> really<00:02:44.990> excel

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
involvement we're able to really excel

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.590 
involvement we're able to really excel
in<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.800> many<00:02:46.920> different<00:02:47.100> areas<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.940> athletics

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
in so many different areas in athletics

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.650 
in so many different areas in athletics
and<00:02:48.990> fine<00:02:49.290> arts<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.950> academics<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.450> guys

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
and fine arts and academics the guys

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.190 
and fine arts and academics the guys
come<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.200> an<00:02:52.470> opening<00:02:52.800> helped<00:02:53.370> put<00:02:53.640> me<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:53.880> a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
come to an opening helped put me in a

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.290 
come to an opening helped put me in a
medical<00:02:55.200> program<00:02:55.440> which<00:02:55.950> could<00:02:56.850> help<00:02:57.120> me

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
medical program which could help me

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.520 
medical program which could help me
later<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.900> life<00:02:58.080> which<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.650> do<00:02:58.709> at<00:02:58.920> em<00:02:59.070> ESC<00:02:59.610> and

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
later in life which I do at em ESC and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.020 
later in life which I do at em ESC and
they're<00:03:01.530> really<00:03:01.890> caring<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.489> they<00:03:02.670> help<00:03:02.910> you

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
future I mean my major of biomedical

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.120 
future I mean my major of biomedical
science<00:03:08.580> I've<00:03:08.760> taken<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:10.410> first<00:03:10.440> program

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
science I've taken the first program

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.729 
science I've taken the first program
which<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.459> biomedical<00:03:12.180> science<00:03:12.600> then<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
which is biomedical science then the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.520 
which is biomedical science then the
second<00:03:14.220> year<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.459> human<00:03:15.450> body<00:03:15.660> systems<00:03:15.989> and

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
second year to human body systems and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.580 
second year to human body systems and
then<00:03:16.650> next<00:03:17.580> year<00:03:17.820> as<00:03:18.330> much<00:03:18.630> as<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.019> junior<00:03:19.410> I'll

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
then next year as much as a junior I'll

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.190 
then next year as much as a junior I'll
be<00:03:19.739> taking<00:03:20.220> medical<00:03:21.120> interventions<00:03:21.900> and

be taking medical interventions and

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.490 
be taking medical interventions and
there<00:03:22.890> are<00:03:23.010> other<00:03:23.160> programs<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.959> will<00:03:25.290> help

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
there are other programs that will help
