just go exploring and I'm not worried

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.510

about<00:01:05.640> dragging<00:01:06.570> or<00:01:06.780> running<00:01:07.140> aground<00:01:07.400> at<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
about dragging or running aground at the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880 
about dragging or running aground at the
bottom<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.970> tough<00:01:09.240> I've<00:01:09.990> never<00:01:10.350> had<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> problem

bottom is tough I've never had a problem

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.700 
bottom is tough I've never had a problem
so<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> could<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.060> cruise<00:01:12.510> where<00:01:12.900> most<00:01:13.530> boats

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so I could just cruise where most boats

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
so I could just cruise where most boats
are<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.119> pull<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.390> out

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
are not going and I can pull it out

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.170 
are not going and I can pull it out

in a recent trip on the San Juan River I

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.610 
in a recent trip on the San Juan River I

brought my 420 and loaded up pretty good
on<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:56.060> trip<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.720> was<00:02:57.019> experimenting<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.920> I

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
on that trip I was experimenting and I

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.610 
on that trip I was experimenting and I
slept<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.820> boat<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.900> everybody<00:03:00.290> started

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
coming over to my boat and that became

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.470 
coming over to my boat and that became
the<00:03:03.890> Hangout<00:03:04.370> because<00:03:04.579> it<00:03:04.760> was<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.940> nice<00:03:05.120> soft

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
the Hangout because it was a nice soft

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.600 
the Hangout because it was a nice soft
seat<00:03:05.810> one<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.860> things<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.130> really<00:03:07.370> liked

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
seat one of the things I really liked

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
seat one of the things I really liked
about<00:03:07.730> having<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.680> 420<00:03:09.700> kayak<00:03:10.700> was<00:03:11.000> being

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
about having the 420 kayak was being

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.860 
about having the 420 kayak was being
able<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.959> go<00:03:12.140> in<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.590> slot<00:03:12.799> canyons<00:03:13.780> where<00:03:14.780> the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
able to go in the slot canyons where the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.470 
able to go in the slot canyons where the
rafts<00:03:15.079> can't<00:03:15.380> fit<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.180> can<00:03:17.329> do

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
rafts can't fit and so I can do

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.440 
rafts can't fit and so I can do
exploring<00:03:18.049> off<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.250> river<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.820> lot<00:03:20.060> easier

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
exploring off the river a lot easier

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.210 
exploring off the river a lot easier
which<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.260> always<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.560> lot<00:03:21.769> of<00:03:21.860> fun

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.800 

when<00:03:26.220> I'm<00:03:26.370> running<00:03:26.520> a<00:03:26.700> river<00:03:26.940> you've<00:03:27.450> got<00:03:27.660> to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
when I'm running a river you've got to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.260 
when I'm running a river you've got to
see<00:03:27.990> where<00:03:28.200> you're<00:03:28.350> going<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.700> get<00:03:30.030> up<00:03:30.120> on

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
see where you're going and I get up on

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.740 
see where you're going and I get up on
my<00:03:30.420> knees<00:03:30.660> or<00:03:31.080> even<00:03:31.890> stand<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.490> tubes<00:03:32.760> to

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
my knees or even stand on the tubes to

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.290 
my knees or even stand on the tubes to
look<00:03:33.930> down<00:03:34.080> river<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.770> that<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.310> see<00:03:36.090> which

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
look down river so that I can see which

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.820 
look down river so that I can see which
way<00:03:36.510> where<00:03:36.690> I'm<00:03:36.780> gonna<00:03:36.870> have<00:03:36.960> to<00:03:37.140> run<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
way where I'm gonna have to run the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.300 
way where I'm gonna have to run the
river<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.400> feel<00:03:39.330> very<00:03:39.660> safe<00:03:40.020> even<00:03:40.740> standing<00:03:41.160> up

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
river I feel very safe even standing up

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.790 
river I feel very safe even standing up
on<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.850> going<00:03:42.450> down<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.750> river<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.530> holds

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
on it and going down the river it holds

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.350 
on it and going down the river it holds
me<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.110> see<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.410> lot<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.680> rafters<00:03:50.460> who<00:03:51.120> want

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
me so I see a lot of rafters who want

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.400 
me so I see a lot of rafters who want
more<00:03:51.570> independence<00:03:52.350> would<00:03:53.250> get<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.460> 420<00:03:54.410> then

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
more independence would get a 420 then

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.380 
more independence would get a 420 then
they're<00:03:55.650> more<00:03:55.920> independent<00:03:56.130> rather<00:03:56.940> than<00:03:57.210> the

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
they're more independent rather than the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.070 
they're more independent rather than the
big<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:58.020> know<00:03:58.080> 14<00:03:58.830> or<00:03:59.010> 18<00:03:59.100> foot<00:03:59.610> raft<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.870> sea

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
big you know 14 or 18 foot raft the sea

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.140 
big you know 14 or 18 foot raft the sea
eagle<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.440> sort<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.830> mix<00:04:02.340> between<00:04:02.460> a<00:04:02.670> kayak

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
eagle is sort of a mix between a kayak

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.650 
eagle is sort of a mix between a kayak
and<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.540> raft<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.490> it<00:04:05.490> gives<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:06.300> lot<00:04:06.600> more

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
and a raft and it gives you a lot more

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.100 
and a raft and it gives you a lot more
flexibility<00:04:07.410> on<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.590> river<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.510> tell<00:04:09.990> them

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
flexibility on the river so I tell them

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.670 
flexibility on the river so I tell them
go<00:04:10.620> with<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:10.950> sea<00:04:11.130> equal<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.670> 20<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.560> get<00:04:13.560> on

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
go with the sea equal for 20 and get on

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:52.350 
go with the sea equal for 20 and get on
the<00:04:13.800> river

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.389 

Oh
