Atlantis<00:00:29.010> actually<00:00:29.190> got<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.730> done<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.150> place

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
Atlantis actually got it done at a place

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.080 
Atlantis actually got it done at a place
called<00:00:31.010> American<00:00:32.090> natural<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.630> Smyrna<00:00:34.610> um

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
called American natural and Smyrna um

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.450 
called American natural and Smyrna um
but<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> actually<00:00:36.810> think<00:00:37.170> if<00:00:37.800> you're<00:00:38.040> savvy

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
but I actually think if you're savvy

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
but I actually think if you're savvy
with<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:39.000> hair<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.660> could<00:00:40.170> probably<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.770> it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
with your hair you could probably do it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.970 
with your hair you could probably do it
yourself<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.400> think<00:00:41.460> she<00:00:41.850> used<00:00:42.590> what<00:00:43.590> they<00:00:43.620> call

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
yourself I think she used what they call

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.130 
yourself I think she used what they call
Marley<00:00:44.489> hair<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:45.030> something<00:00:45.330> like<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
Marley hair or something like that

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.320 
Marley hair or something like that
I<00:00:46.170> used<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.130> braid<00:00:47.370> back<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> day<00:00:48.090> in

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
I used to braid back in the day in

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.900 
I used to braid back in the day in
college<00:00:48.540> so<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.650> bit<00:00:49.800> about<00:00:49.910> you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
know how to attach the braid but if you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.500 
know how to attach the braid but if you
know<00:00:52.650> how<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.970> is<00:00:54.330> its

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
know how to do that all it is is its

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.210 
know how to do that all it is is its
braid<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.080> as<00:00:55.200> soon<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.559> stop<00:00:55.770> again<00:00:55.800> I'll

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
braid it as soon as I stop again I'll

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.030 
braid it as soon as I stop again I'll
show<00:00:56.400> you<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.330> braided<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.470> root<00:00:58.769> of

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
show you but it's braided at the root of

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.670 
show you but it's braided at the root of
my<00:00:59.280> hair<00:00:59.540> just<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:00.660> couple<00:01:00.900> of<00:01:01.110> strokes<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
my hair just a couple of strokes and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.549 
my hair just a couple of strokes and
then<00:01:01.830> the<00:01:01.920> rest<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.519> is<00:01:03.140> twisted<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.320> like

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
then the rest of it is twisted just like

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.550 
then the rest of it is twisted just like
any<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.129> strand<00:01:05.519> twists<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.870> way<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
any two strand twists all the way to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.260 
any two strand twists all the way to
begin<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.190> gives<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> illusion<00:01:08.580> almost

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
begin and it gives the illusion almost

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.090 
begin and it gives the illusion almost
like<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.690> your<00:01:09.900> hair<00:01:10.520> see<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:14.070> see

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
like it's your hair see you can see

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.370 
like it's your hair see you can see
where<00:01:14.550> it's<00:01:14.640> attached<00:01:15.000> I've<00:01:15.690> had<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.200> for

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
where it's attached I've had it in for

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
where it's attached I've had it in for
like<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> month<00:01:16.860> now<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.370> it's<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.790> old

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
like a month now so it's a little old

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.840 
like a month now so it's a little old
but<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> me<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:19.020> style<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.920> looks<00:01:20.280> looks

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
but to me a style like this looks looks

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.840 
but to me a style like this looks looks
better<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.510> they<00:01:21.870> get<00:01:22.020> Toni<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.700> only

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
better as they get Toni and the only

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.730 
better as they get Toni and the only
thing<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> wouldn't<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.810> able<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.620> I

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
thing that I wouldn't be able to do if I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.050 
thing that I wouldn't be able to do if I
did<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> myself<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.880> shave<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.810> this

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.390 

you<00:01:32.570> know<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:32.840> it's<00:01:32.960> very<00:01:33.040> very<00:01:34.040> light<00:01:34.369> and

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
you know and it's very very light and

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.130 
you know and it's very very light and
looks<00:01:34.790> like<00:01:34.970> it'd<00:01:35.119> be<00:01:35.299> heavy<00:01:35.540> but<00:01:35.659> it's<00:01:35.930> not

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
looks like it'd be heavy but it's not

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.170 
looks like it'd be heavy but it's not
it's<00:01:36.350> very<00:01:36.590> very<00:01:36.830> light<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.760> would<00:01:37.909> not<00:01:38.000> be

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
it's very very light but I would not be

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.520 
it's very very light but I would not be
able<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:38.570> she<00:01:38.690> didn't<00:01:38.960> cut<00:01:39.170> it

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
able to and she didn't cut it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.910 
able to and she didn't cut it
she<00:01:39.890> kind<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.220> put<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.850> shape<00:01:41.119> my<00:01:41.330> face

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
she kind of put it in to shape my face

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.039 
she kind of put it in to shape my face
to<00:01:42.920> accentuate<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.640> shape<00:01:43.790> of<00:01:44.150> my<00:01:44.360> face
