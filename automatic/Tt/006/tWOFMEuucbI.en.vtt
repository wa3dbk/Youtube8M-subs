00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
and decide that I should probably start

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.590

my<00:01:19.940> homework

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
my homework

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.240 
my homework
so<00:01:20.780> here<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.049> was<00:01:21.320> studying<00:01:21.650> for<00:01:21.799> a<00:01:21.890> history

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
so here I was studying for a history

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.610 
so here I was studying for a history
test<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.670> had<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.180> also<00:01:23.479> writing<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:24.020> paper<00:01:24.320> in

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
French which I know is probably not

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.960 
French which I know is probably not
correct<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.049> my<00:01:27.229> French<00:01:27.440> viewers<00:01:27.670> don't<00:01:28.670> judge
