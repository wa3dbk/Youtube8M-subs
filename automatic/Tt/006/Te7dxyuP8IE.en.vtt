00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.450 
maintenance on alfrid publishing we've
got<00:00:20.180> this<00:00:20.300> guitar<00:00:20.510> that's<00:00:20.960> having<00:00:21.560> kind<00:00:22.220> of<00:00:22.340> a

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
got this guitar that's having kind of a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.790 
got this guitar that's having kind of a
common<00:00:22.789> problem<00:00:23.179> it<00:00:23.810> has<00:00:23.990> corrosion<00:00:24.619> and

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
common problem it has corrosion and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.380 
common problem it has corrosion and
because<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.279> that<00:00:25.429> when<00:00:25.730> you<00:00:25.820> turn<00:00:26.000> the<00:00:26.150> pots

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
because of that when you turn the pots

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.910 
because of that when you turn the pots
or<00:00:26.689> you<00:00:26.810> activate<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:27.380> switch

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
or you activate the switch

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.189 
or you activate the switch
it<00:00:28.279> makes<00:00:28.519> crackling<00:00:29.000> noises<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:29.630> sometimes

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
it makes crackling noises and sometimes

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.380 
it makes crackling noises and sometimes
it<00:00:30.349> even<00:00:30.380> doesn't<00:00:30.740> while<00:00:31.009> you're<00:00:31.160> playing<00:00:31.390> the

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
it even doesn't while you're playing the

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.760 
it even doesn't while you're playing the
other<00:00:32.540> thing<00:00:32.750> is<00:00:32.870> sometimes<00:00:33.080> the<00:00:33.350> jack<00:00:33.560> gets

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
other thing is sometimes the jack gets

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.500 
other thing is sometimes the jack gets
quoted<00:00:34.010> also<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:34.730> we're<00:00:34.940> going<00:00:35.060> to<00:00:35.120> take<00:00:35.330> it

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
quoted also so we're going to take it

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.550 
quoted also so we're going to take it
apart<00:00:35.810> and<00:00:35.930> we're<00:00:36.080> going<00:00:36.200> to<00:00:36.230> take<00:00:36.380> some

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
apart and we're going to take some

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.770 
apart and we're going to take some
contact<00:00:37.010> cleaner<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.430> clean<00:00:37.610> it<00:00:37.760> up<00:00:37.880> make<00:00:38.600> it

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
contact cleaner and clean it up make it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.110 
contact cleaner and clean it up make it
so<00:00:38.930> that<00:00:39.080> works<00:00:39.320> properly<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.460> step<00:00:40.700> one<00:00:40.880> is<00:00:41.000> we

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
so that works properly so step one is we

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.820 
so that works properly so step one is we
need<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.390> take<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.020> strings<00:00:42.320> off<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:42.680> see

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
need to take the strings off and you see

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.980 
need to take the strings off and you see
we<00:00:42.950> already<00:00:43.190> have<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:43.580> step<00:00:44.330> two<00:00:44.510> as<00:00:44.660> we<00:00:44.810> can

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
we already have that step two as we can

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.810 
we already have that step two as we can
either<00:00:45.170> use<00:00:45.410> a<00:00:45.440> screw<00:00:45.860> driver<00:00:45.890> or<00:00:46.310> we<00:00:46.640> can<00:00:46.790> use

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
either use a screw driver or we can use

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.440 
either use a screw driver or we can use
electric<00:00:47.980> screwdriver<00:00:48.980> to<00:00:49.130> remove<00:00:49.450> the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
electric screwdriver to remove the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:01:04.780 
electric screwdriver to remove the
screws<00:01:02.830> now<00:01:03.830> you<00:01:03.890> only<00:01:04.100> need<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.460> remove<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
screws now you only need to remove the

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.130 
screws now you only need to remove the
screws<00:01:05.030> on<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.269> outside<00:01:05.600> perimeter<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.990> the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
screws on the outside perimeter of the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.779 
screws on the outside perimeter of the
picker<00:01:06.320> don't<00:01:06.679> mess<00:01:07.130> with<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.460> ones<00:01:07.609> that

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
picker don't mess with the ones that

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.490 
picker don't mess with the ones that
hold<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.270> switch<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.689> place<00:01:08.869> or<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:09.259> hold

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
hold the switch in place or that hold

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:24.399 
hold the switch in place or that hold
two<00:01:09.590> pickups<00:01:09.920> in<00:01:10.070> place<00:01:22.749> as<00:01:23.749> you<00:01:23.840> can<00:01:24.109> see<00:01:24.259> the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
two pickups in place as you can see the

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.870 
two pickups in place as you can see the
electric<00:01:24.710> screwdriver<00:01:25.130> saves<00:01:25.429> a<00:01:25.549> lot<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.759> time

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
electric screwdriver saves a lot of time

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.810 
electric screwdriver saves a lot of time
now<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.899> notice<00:01:27.170> we<00:01:27.320> have<00:01:27.350> three

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
now you notice we have three

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.660 
now you notice we have three
potentiometers<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:28.969> those<00:01:29.420> are<00:01:29.570> parts<00:01:29.990> that

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
potentiometers and those are parts that

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.819 
potentiometers and those are parts that
get<00:01:31.670> corroded<00:01:32.569> or<00:01:32.689> contaminated<00:01:33.499> and<00:01:33.710> then

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
get corroded or contaminated and then

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:34.929 
get corroded or contaminated and then
when<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:34.009> turn<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.310> knob<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.640> makes<00:01:34.819> a

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
when you turn the knob it makes a

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.300 
when you turn the knob it makes a
scratchy<00:01:35.240> sound<00:01:35.659> also<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.679> switch<00:01:36.920> can<00:01:37.159> have

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
scratchy sound also the switch can have

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.950 
scratchy sound also the switch can have
the<00:01:37.429> same<00:01:37.640> problem<00:01:38.030> inside<00:01:38.749> of<00:01:38.869> a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
the same problem inside of a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.120 
the same problem inside of a
potentiometer<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.740> have<00:01:39.920> like<00:01:40.100> a

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
potentiometer you have like a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.919 
potentiometer you have like a
horseshoe-shaped<00:01:40.579> carbon<00:01:41.359> track<00:01:41.630> and

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
horseshoe-shaped carbon track and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.480 
horseshoe-shaped carbon track and
there's<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.649> part<00:01:42.920> called<00:01:43.069> the<00:01:43.159> wiper<00:01:43.340> that

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
there's a part called the wiper that

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.399 
there's a part called the wiper that
rubs<00:01:43.789> against<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.450> if<00:01:44.539> it<00:01:44.659> gets<00:01:44.780> material

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
rubs against it and if it gets material

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.109 
rubs against it and if it gets material
between<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.189> track<00:01:46.520> then<00:01:46.819> it<00:01:46.939> makes

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
between it and the track then it makes

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.149 
between it and the track then it makes
that<00:01:47.299> scratchy<00:01:47.630> sound<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.319> so<00:01:48.859> what<00:01:49.009> we're

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
that scratchy sound and so what we're

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.709 
that scratchy sound and so what we're
really<00:01:49.340> doing<00:01:49.579> is<00:01:49.729> we're<00:01:49.909> taking<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.240> contact

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
really doing is we're taking the contact

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.459 
really doing is we're taking the contact
cleaner<00:01:50.990> which<00:01:51.829> I<00:01:51.979> put<00:01:52.219> over<00:01:52.700> here<00:01:52.999> and<00:01:53.869> we

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
cleaner which I put over here and we

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.109 
cleaner which I put over here and we
basically<00:01:54.979> apply<00:01:55.310> some<00:01:55.549> of<00:01:55.639> the<00:01:55.700> contact

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
basically apply some of the contact

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.599 
basically apply some of the contact
cleaner<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.569> the<00:01:56.600> track<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.319> we<00:01:58.189> can<00:01:58.340> do<00:01:58.429> it<00:01:58.520> by

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
cleaner to the track and we can do it by

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.099 
cleaner to the track and we can do it by
just<00:01:58.819> putting<00:01:58.969> a<00:01:59.119> drip<00:01:59.329> at<00:01:59.479> one<00:01:59.630> in<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.020> then

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
just putting a drip at one in and then

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.199 
just putting a drip at one in and then
by<00:02:00.259> actually<00:02:00.619> turning<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:01.009> knob<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.999> will

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
by actually turning the knob that will

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.760 
by actually turning the knob that will
spread<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.600> out<00:02:02.719> over<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.139> whole<00:02:03.259> track<00:02:03.560> and

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
spread it out over the whole track and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.830 
spread it out over the whole track and
that<00:02:03.859> cleans<00:02:04.130> all<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.459> residue<00:02:05.329> off<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:05.749> it

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
that cleans all the residue off and it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.590 
that cleans all the residue off and it
leaves<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.200> nice<00:02:06.409> sort<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.219> film<00:02:08.119> on<00:02:08.270> there<00:02:08.450> that

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
leaves a nice sort of film on there that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.790 
leaves a nice sort of film on there that
protects<00:02:08.990> it<00:02:09.140> from<00:02:09.289> getting<00:02:09.440> further

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
protects it from getting further

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.190 
protects it from getting further
corroded<00:02:10.430> so<00:02:10.580> I'm<00:02:11.510> going<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.720> turn<00:02:11.840> over<00:02:11.900> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
corroded so I'm going to turn over the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.660 
corroded so I'm going to turn over the
pit<00:02:12.380> guard<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:12.800> we<00:02:13.070> can<00:02:13.250> see<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.520> other

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
pit guard so that we can see the other

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.830 
pit guard so that we can see the other
side

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
side

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.120 
side
gain<00:02:15.830> access<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.580> pots<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.470> over<00:02:18.740> here<00:02:18.980> we

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
gain access to the pots so over here we

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.770 
gain access to the pots so over here we
have<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.610> three<00:02:19.850> potentiometers

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
have the three potentiometers

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.250 
have the three potentiometers
and<00:02:21.110> over<00:02:21.770> here<00:02:21.980> we<00:02:22.069> have<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.760> switch<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:24.230> we

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and over here we have the switch so we

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.100 
and over here we have the switch so we
would<00:02:24.530> take<00:02:24.709> our<00:02:24.860> contact<00:02:25.370> cleaner<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.630> we

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
would take our contact cleaner and we

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.870 
would take our contact cleaner and we
would<00:02:27.260> very<00:02:27.470> carefully<00:02:27.650> drip<00:02:28.160> some<00:02:28.459> with<00:02:28.730> this

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
would very carefully drip some with this

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.800 
would very carefully drip some with this
little<00:02:29.090> needle<00:02:29.240> applicator<00:02:30.280> right<00:02:31.280> into<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
little needle applicator right into the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.640 
little needle applicator right into the
potentiometer<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.020> gets<00:02:33.200> on<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.410> track

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
potentiometer so it gets on the track

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.830 
potentiometer so it gets on the track
now<00:02:34.489> this<00:02:34.670> one<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:34.970> called<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.450> tbx

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
now this one is called the tbx

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.600 
now this one is called the tbx
controller<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.410> has<00:02:36.470> stacked<00:02:36.890> pots<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.489> we

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
controller it has stacked pots so we

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.960 
controller it has stacked pots so we
have<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.880> put<00:02:38.150> some<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.840> each<00:02:39.050> one<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.970> then

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
have to put some on each one and then

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.180 
have to put some on each one and then
finally<00:02:41.660> we'll<00:02:41.780> get<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.080> volume<00:02:42.590> over<00:02:42.739> here

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
finally we'll get the volume over here

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.460 
finally we'll get the volume over here
drip<00:02:43.819> some<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.150> there<00:02:44.330> if<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.110> tilt<00:02:45.319> their

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
drip some in there if you tilt their

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.690 
drip some in there if you tilt their
guard<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.770> certain<00:02:46.010> way<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.160> can<00:02:46.250> use<00:02:46.489> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
guard a certain way you can use the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.300 
guard a certain way you can use the
force<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.090> gravity<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.830> help<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.980> apply<00:02:49.250> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
force of gravity to help you apply the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.810 
force of gravity to help you apply the
liquid<00:02:49.580> then<00:02:50.300> finally<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.930> switch<00:02:51.140> a

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
liquid then finally on the switch a

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.340 
liquid then finally on the switch a
plate<00:02:52.820> that's<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.390> traveling<00:02:53.870> plate<00:02:54.110> that

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
plate that's a traveling plate that

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.130 
plate that's a traveling plate that
connects<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.920> wiper<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.519> whatever<00:02:56.420> pickup

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
connects the wiper and whatever pickup

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.390 
connects the wiper and whatever pickup
selected<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.739> we'll<00:02:57.830> just<00:02:57.980> put<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.160> little<00:02:58.280> bit

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
selected and we'll just put a little bit

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.120 
selected and we'll just put a little bit
on<00:02:58.519> on<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.410> track<00:03:00.410> there's<00:03:00.680> another<00:03:00.920> one<00:03:01.100> on

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
on on that track there's another one on

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.650 
on on that track there's another one on
the<00:03:01.340> other<00:03:01.370> side<00:03:01.550> right<00:03:01.970> here<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.239> can<00:03:02.390> see

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the other side right here you can see

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.729 
the other side right here you can see
it's<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.959> little<00:03:03.110> metal<00:03:03.319> plate<00:03:03.440> right<00:03:03.680> there

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
it's a little metal plate right there

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.400 
it's a little metal plate right there
put<00:03:04.610> some<00:03:04.640> on<00:03:04.910> there<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:05.269> now<00:03:05.450> what<00:03:06.050> we<00:03:06.170> want<00:03:06.290> to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
put some on there so now what we want to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.920 
put some on there so now what we want to
do<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:06.650> we<00:03:06.769> want<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.010> activate<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.550> switch<00:03:07.930> run

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
do is we want to activate the switch run

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.600 
do is we want to activate the switch run
it<00:03:09.050> through<00:03:09.200> all<00:03:09.350> its<00:03:09.530> motion<00:03:09.980> several<00:03:10.340> times

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
it through all its motion several times

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.449 
it through all its motion several times
and<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.030> will<00:03:11.500> spread<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.920> cleaner<00:03:13.190> over

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
and that will spread the cleaner over

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.670 
and that will spread the cleaner over
the<00:03:13.730> surface<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.390> contacts<00:03:14.900> then<00:03:15.500> we'll

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
the surface of the contacts then we'll

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.100 
the surface of the contacts then we'll
take<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.040> knobs<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.610> we'll<00:03:17.180> actually<00:03:17.420> rotate

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
take the knobs and we'll actually rotate

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.550 
take the knobs and we'll actually rotate
them<00:03:18.350> so<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.860> we're<00:03:19.579> spreading<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:21.079> contact

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
them so that we're spreading the contact

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.800 
them so that we're spreading the contact
cleaner<00:03:22.150> throughout<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.299> carbon<00:03:23.660> track<00:03:24.370> and

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
cleaner throughout the carbon track and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.319 
cleaner throughout the carbon track and
that<00:03:26.810> should<00:03:27.220> solve<00:03:28.220> our<00:03:28.430> problem<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.030> then<00:03:29.209> we

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
that should solve our problem so then we

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.970 
that should solve our problem so then we
can<00:03:29.480> put<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.690> guitar<00:03:29.840> back<00:03:30.140> together<00:03:30.350> it's

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
can put the guitar back together it's

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.860 
can put the guitar back together it's
very<00:03:31.190> common<00:03:31.610> on<00:03:31.670> these<00:03:31.850> guitars<00:03:32.239> for<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
very common on these guitars for the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.960 
very common on these guitars for the
jack<00:03:33.140> also<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.680> either<00:03:34.010> gets<00:03:34.220> primer<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.820> get

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
jack also to either gets primer to get

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.970 
jack also to either gets primer to get
corroded<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.140> want<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.590> make<00:03:36.680> sure<00:03:36.709> that

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
corroded so you want to make sure that

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.920 
corroded so you want to make sure that
the<00:03:37.160> jack<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.549> tight<00:03:37.850> if<00:03:38.060> not<00:03:38.299> why<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.570> got<00:03:38.810> it

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
the jack is tight if not why you got it

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.110 
the jack is tight if not why you got it
apart<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.470> can<00:03:39.650> take<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:39.890> socket<00:03:40.489> driver<00:03:40.730> and

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
apart you can take a socket driver and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.509 
apart you can take a socket driver and
tighten<00:03:41.450> up<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.690> nut<00:03:41.900> now<00:03:42.799> if<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.250> notice

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
tighten up the nut now if you notice

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:44.890 
tighten up the nut now if you notice
down<00:03:43.549> here<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.269> part<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:44.690> actually

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
down here this is the part that actually

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.780 
down here this is the part that actually
makes<00:03:45.380> contact<00:03:45.560> with<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.040> plug<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:46.549> when<00:03:46.700> you

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
makes contact with the plug so when you

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.120 
makes contact with the plug so when you
take<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.239> plug<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:47.900> want<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:48.920> plug<00:03:49.070> in

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
take the plug that you want to plug in

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.210 
take the plug that you want to plug in
the<00:03:50.090> guitar<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.630> with<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:51.109> plug<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.680> into<00:03:51.829> here

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
the guitar in with I plug it into here

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.220 
the guitar in with I plug it into here
you<00:03:52.489> can<00:03:52.640> see<00:03:52.820> that<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.209> tip<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:54.019> plug

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
you can see that the tip of the plug

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.789 
you can see that the tip of the plug
actually<00:03:55.100> makes<00:03:55.280> contact<00:03:55.489> with<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.299> jack<00:03:56.799> and

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
actually makes contact with the jack and

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.620 
actually makes contact with the jack and
if<00:03:57.980> this<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.310> corroded<00:03:58.790> or<00:03:58.910> isn't<00:03:59.420> making

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
if this is corroded or isn't making

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.300 
if this is corroded or isn't making
enough<00:03:59.959> pressure<00:04:00.260> here<00:04:00.680> then<00:04:00.890> you'll<00:04:01.130> have<00:04:01.250> a

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
enough pressure here then you'll have a

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.949 
enough pressure here then you'll have a
bad<00:04:01.549> connection<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:02.150> will<00:04:02.359> cut<00:04:02.540> in<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.870> out

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
bad connection it will cut in and out

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.240 
bad connection it will cut in and out
and<00:04:03.049> make<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.230> disturbing<00:04:03.799> sound<00:04:03.950> while<00:04:04.130> you're

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
and make a disturbing sound while you're

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.670 
and make a disturbing sound while you're
playing<00:04:04.430> or<00:04:04.700> recording<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:05.959> sometimes<00:04:06.470> it's<00:04:06.620> a

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
playing or recording so sometimes it's a

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.530 
playing or recording so sometimes it's a
good<00:04:06.709> idea<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.190> just<00:04:07.549> slightly<00:04:07.730> bend<00:04:08.269> this<00:04:08.420> so

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
good idea to just slightly bend this so

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.360 
good idea to just slightly bend this so
we<00:04:08.660> actually<00:04:09.019> bend<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.530> in<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.680> little<00:04:10.010> bit<00:04:10.190> so

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
we actually bend it in a little bit so

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.680 
we actually bend it in a little bit so
it<00:04:10.430> has<00:04:10.549> more<00:04:10.730> pressure<00:04:11.060> on<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.390> because<00:04:11.540> after

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
it has more pressure on it because after

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.300 
it has more pressure on it because after
a<00:04:11.870> while<00:04:11.930> they<00:04:12.170> tend<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.440> get<00:04:12.560> bent<00:04:12.799> down<00:04:13.040> and

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
a while they tend to get bent down and

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.890 
a while they tend to get bent down and
then<00:04:13.400> they<00:04:13.519> don't<00:04:13.730> push<00:04:14.299> as<00:04:14.480> hard<00:04:14.690> as<00:04:14.780> they

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
then they don't push as hard as they

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.870 
then they don't push as hard as they
should<00:04:15.109> on<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.320> cord<00:04:15.620> then<00:04:16.489> we<00:04:16.579> can<00:04:16.729> put<00:04:16.850> a

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
should on the cord then we can put a

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.099 
should on the cord then we can put a
little<00:04:16.970> bit<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.180> that<00:04:17.239> same<00:04:17.479> contact<00:04:17.930> cleaner

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
little bit of that same contact cleaner

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.240 
little bit of that same contact cleaner
right<00:04:18.320> on<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.590> tip<00:04:18.769> of<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:18.979> jack<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:20.829> then<00:04:21.829> we

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
right on the tip of the jack and then we

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.880 
right on the tip of the jack and then we
can<00:04:22.430> put<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.700> back<00:04:22.880> in<00:04:23.060> place<00:04:23.590> we'll<00:04:24.590> put<00:04:24.770> the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
can put it back in place we'll put the

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.890 
can put it back in place we'll put the
screws<00:04:25.159> back<00:04:25.190> into<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.849> pit<00:04:26.030> garden<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.750> the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
screws back into the pit garden to the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.600 
screws back into the pit garden to the
jack<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.349> then<00:04:27.470> we'll<00:04:27.650> be<00:04:27.770> ready<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.070> do

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
jack and then we'll be ready to do

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.659 
jack and then we'll be ready to do
our<00:04:28.639> cleanup<00:04:29.000> on<00:04:29.150> our<00:04:29.330> guitar
