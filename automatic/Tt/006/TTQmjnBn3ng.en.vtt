00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 but in general actually 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.830
 no answer at all 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:22.240
 definitely it seems to me knowledge is when 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:25.700
 you are a large number of different parties 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.950
 you know because there is no unequivocal say 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.660
 definitely pair shit can not be said 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.660
 clearly that all this is right in general 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.340
 Yenna and the truth also can not be said and therefore 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.260
 here everything is like good people just 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.500
 the correct proportions are certain there and 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.890
 fairy tales 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.790
 There are sellers on the skirt who 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.710
 sometimes due to his desire 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.660
 mean to make you sometimes they 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.550
 due to the fact that it has already made one 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.980
 then he already retells on the machine 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.140
 what's he got there in perley here but so on 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.170
 this chain may be a two-door 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.830
 three-door then you here and all this in 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.590
 the result 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.659
 in fact, and makes power the way 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.460
 say incredibly just at the very 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.280
 interesting game because you can't 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.650
 not really when operation on either 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.960
 which of the following such established 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.680
 clear and hard solid algorithms 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.680
 Allods Online 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.350
 junior bad never do 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.479
 the only thing that happens to you is 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.550
 trained by your personal gongfu 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.010
 which all ends all the same 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:37.000
 most phrases and starts driving djidan 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:40.430
 drank and understood drank felt shit 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.409
 felt that shit tasted and no matter 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.670
 that he is already looking at you for 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.670
 epic eyes are fighting 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.790
 feeling 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:59.009
 and you now began to talk about yourself bayonets 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:03.890
 then him and so on so the letter and 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.890
 quietly shish as a file transportation
