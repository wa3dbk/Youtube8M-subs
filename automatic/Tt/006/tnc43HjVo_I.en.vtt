00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
retrained to not over train it's very

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.089 
retrained to not over train it's very
rare<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.360> see<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.690> highly<00:00:13.139> high<00:00:13.530> level<00:00:13.830> athlete

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
rare to see a highly high level athlete

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.379 
rare to see a highly high level athlete
that's<00:00:14.280> not<00:00:14.490> over<00:00:14.820> trained

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
that's not over trained

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.990 
that's not over trained
they're<00:00:15.630> almost<00:00:15.750> they're<00:00:16.379> all<00:00:16.560> basically

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
they're almost they're all basically

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000 
they're almost they're all basically
completely<00:00:18.000> burned<00:00:18.330> out<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:19.830> need<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
completely burned out and so they need a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.700 
completely burned out and so they need a
reorientation<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.000> know<00:00:21.230> well<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
reorientation you know well one of the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.679 
reorientation you know well one of the
things<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.980> would<00:00:23.160> say<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:24.269> know<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> took

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
things I would say about you know I took

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.490 
things I would say about you know I took
had<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.260> similar<00:00:25.880> education<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.960> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
had that similar education and that I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.620 
had that similar education and that I
thought<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.340> diet<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.760> everything<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.539> then

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
thought the diet was everything and then

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.880 
thought the diet was everything and then
then<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> started<00:00:31.109> looking<00:00:31.289> more<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
then I started looking more at the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.190 
then I started looking more at the
exercise<00:00:32.550> component<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.930> saw<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
exercise component and I saw a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930 
exercise component and I saw a
tremendous<00:00:34.890> improvement<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.640> there's<00:00:35.760> two

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
tremendous improvement and there's two

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.229 
tremendous improvement and there's two
ways<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.149> get<00:00:36.660> looking<00:00:37.620> good<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.340> look<00:00:38.670> good

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
ways to get looking good to look good

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.840 
ways to get looking good to look good
lab<00:00:39.480> values<00:00:39.989> either<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:41.070> which<00:00:41.399> means<00:00:41.640> we

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
lab values either one which means we

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
lab values either one which means we
have<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> screw<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.450> double<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> young

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
have to screw up double as a young

have to screw up double as a young
person<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> when<00:00:46.170> you're<00:00:46.260> talking<00:00:46.320> about

people need to go for it with their

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
people need to go for it with their
exercises<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> build<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> muscle

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
exercises you got to build the muscle

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
exercises you got to build the muscle
mass<00:01:29.009> because<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:30.540> what

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
mass because that's what that's what

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.539 
mass because that's what that's what
really<00:01:30.900> changes<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:31.530> metabolism<00:01:32.310> you've

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
really changes your metabolism you've

really changes your metabolism you've
got<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> good<00:01:33.000> muscle<00:01:33.450> mass<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:34.890> happens

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
got a good muscle mass then what happens

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.510 
got a good muscle mass then what happens
when<00:01:35.430> sugar<00:01:35.729> goes<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.720> very<00:01:37.020> easy<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.860> for

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
when sugar goes up it's very easy to for

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.270 
when sugar goes up it's very easy to for
the<00:01:38.579> body<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.060> deal<00:01:39.329> out<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:40.259> sugar<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.130> those

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the body to deal out that sugar to those

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.160 
the body to deal out that sugar to those
empty<00:01:41.640> muscle<00:01:42.090> cells<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.630> they're<00:01:42.810> full<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
empty muscle cells if they're full of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.359 
empty muscle cells if they're full of
sugar<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.710> haven't<00:01:43.979> worked<00:01:44.159> them

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
sugar and you haven't worked them

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.130 
sugar and you haven't worked them
because<00:01:44.520> you're<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> couch<00:01:44.909> potato<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.840> takes<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
because you're a couch potato it takes a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.230 
because you're a couch potato it takes a
lot<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.350> insulin<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.250> keep<00:01:47.399> pushing<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:48.060> into

lot of insulin to keep pushing it into

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.940 
lot of insulin to keep pushing it into
those<00:01:48.479> cells<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> keep<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.649> blood

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
those cells and keep get your blood

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.700 
those cells and keep get your blood
levels<00:01:50.369> down<00:01:50.899> insulin<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.110> released<00:01:52.500> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
levels down insulin is not released in

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.280 
levels down insulin is not released in
the<00:01:52.770> linear<00:01:53.189> fashion<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.720> blood<00:01:54.960> sugar

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the linear fashion as your blood sugar

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.090 
the linear fashion as your blood sugar
goes<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.640> insulin<00:01:57.210> does<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.140> so

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
goes up the insulin does this and so

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.789 
goes up the insulin does this and so
that's<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.360> don't<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that's what you don't want because that

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
that's what you don't want because that
does<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> lot<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> things<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.969> are<00:02:03.329> very

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
does a lot of things that are very

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240 
does a lot of things that are very
detrimental<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.409> that's<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.770> we're<00:02:04.979> seeing

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
detrimental and that's what we're seeing

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.160 
detrimental and that's what we're seeing
the<00:02:05.430> results<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.149> most<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.540> our<00:02:06.689> people

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the results of and most of our people

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
the results of and most of our people
today<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> high<00:02:08.069> insulin<00:02:08.550> levels<00:02:08.970> high

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
today as the high insulin levels high

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.600 
today as the high insulin levels high
sugar<00:02:09.539> levels<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.140> later<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.500> before<00:02:11.430> a

its damage and when I was in residency
you<00:02:21.340> would<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.730> would<00:02:21.910> find<00:02:22.150> someone<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.660> they

you would I would find someone and they

you would I would find someone and they
weren't<00:02:22.870> diabetic<00:02:23.470> because<00:02:23.530> you're<00:02:23.770> checking

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
weren't diabetic because you're checking

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.950 
weren't diabetic because you're checking
their<00:02:24.280> hemoglobin<00:02:24.790> a1c<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.510> next<00:02:25.780> year

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.900 
their hemoglobin a1c and the next year
it<00:02:26.050> jumps<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.830> if<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.490> looked<00:02:27.760> you

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
it jumps up and if you looked you

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.080 
it jumps up and if you looked you
started<00:02:28.270> finding<00:02:28.690> signs<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:30.130> vascular

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
started finding signs of vascular

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.000 
started finding signs of vascular
disease<00:02:31.150> well<00:02:31.840> where'd<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.110> come<00:02:32.380> from<00:02:32.440> and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
disease well where'd that come from and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.410 
disease well where'd that come from and
you<00:02:33.220> know<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.460> attending<00:02:33.820> physician<00:02:34.270> say

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
you know the attending physician say

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.440 
you know the attending physician say
well<00:02:34.660> well<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.980> that's<00:02:36.370> they<00:02:36.820> probably<00:02:37.150> had

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
well well that that's they probably had

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.360 
well well that that's they probably had
spikes<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:38.020> sugar<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.470> we<00:02:38.590> didn't<00:02:38.890> catch<00:02:39.130> or

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
spikes of sugar that we didn't catch or

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.920 
spikes of sugar that we didn't catch or
something<00:02:39.790> along<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.060> line<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.420> pretty<00:02:40.720> weak

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
something along that line a pretty weak

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.390 
something along that line a pretty weak
answer<00:02:41.380> but<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.620> real<00:02:41.800> answer<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
answer but the real answer is the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.730 
answer but the real answer is the
insulin<00:02:42.910> was<00:02:43.630> narrowing<00:02:44.080> those<00:02:44.350> arteries

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
insulin was narrowing those arteries

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.920 
insulin was narrowing those arteries
because<00:02:45.280> insulin<00:02:45.640> tells<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.270> cells<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
because insulin tells the cells in the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.630 
because insulin tells the cells in the
middle<00:02:47.200> layer<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.710> your<00:02:47.830> artery<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.370> grow<00:02:48.520> and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
middle layer of your artery to grow and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.640 
middle layer of your artery to grow and
to<00:02:48.670> multiply<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.900> get<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.050> thickening<00:02:50.500> of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
to multiply so you get a thickening of

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.650 
to multiply so you get a thickening of
the<00:02:50.680> middle<00:02:50.980> layer<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.520> your<00:02:51.850> arteries<00:02:52.360> long

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
the middle layer of your arteries long

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.300 
the middle layer of your arteries long
before<00:02:53.020> your<00:02:53.170> sugars<00:02:53.500> go<00:02:53.710> up<00:02:56.130> insulin<00:02:57.130> has<00:02:57.250> a

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
before your sugars go up insulin has a

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.660 
before your sugars go up insulin has a
tremendous<00:02:58.270> impact<00:02:58.690> on<00:02:59.440> all<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.130> hormones<00:03:00.340> in

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
tremendous impact on all the hormones in

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.910 
tremendous impact on all the hormones in
the<00:03:00.790> body
