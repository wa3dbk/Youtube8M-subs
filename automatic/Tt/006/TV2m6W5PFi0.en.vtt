00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.830
 leiweke so that the fundamental chemical reactions of our organism 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.310
 the amount of various substances in the blood 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.930
 and in the liquids that will be born it is maintained if we, for example, manage 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.499
 To much salt 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.499
 the excess will be that eliminated in the urine 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:21.900
 there are two forms of expression 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.009
 although our support is not the same as the order 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.759
 I know that one of the functions of foreigner substances 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.409
 but the main one 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.120
 he did daily keep body temperature 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.420
 Oh my God 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.660
 alone 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.040
 knew that when the body produces a higher amount of heat 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.890
 the necessary one to maintain its temperature the organism loses heat 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.500
 through his mother and eulina 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.380
 made to much urine 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.530
 who is the result of this case and explosives 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.520
 with the urine are eliminated all those substances that will not be 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.840
 used by our body 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.450
 and how line was formed 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.220
 the formation of urine occurs in the river which is the main organ of the apparatus 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.890
 excretory 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.360
 works as a filter is very sophisticated 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.910
 which selects the substances to be disposed of 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.960
 those who should 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.960
 stay in the saints 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.500
 In addition to selecting the substances the river is the one that establishes the quantity 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.330
 of each one that will remain anonymous and the excess that will be named 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.310
 by the squid 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.110
 let's take a closer look at how it works 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.520
 the retired for ages called fruits reaping in the subway that occurs the process 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.540
 filtering 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.240
 through a statement 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.310
 I was connected by a huge amount of blood capillaries 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.620
 production for the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.340
 part of the plasma goes to the Cubans 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.340
 and the other part cb through the capillaries 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.830
 during the passage of the filtered blood flow through the tubes occurs a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.830
 exchange of substances with the capillaries 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:14.059
 what is needed is that it is absorbed by the body through the 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.029
 capillaries 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.689
 will form the villain who will follow the broker duct to be eliminated 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.069
 in this process of reabsorption elimination of substances the control 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.440
 of the match 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.059
 the entity of water that remains what leaves 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:33.369
 has to be very accurate as you now know fundamentally because it is a medium 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.369
 where all the chemical reactions of our organism take place 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.010
 part of the water and always eliminated by the urine it is replaced by the ingestion of 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.179
 liquids containing foods containing water 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:49.420
 when there is little water in the blood and reabsorption of the kidneys is greater 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.130
 and decreases the amount of water eliminated by the urine. 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.390
 process is done by a hormone to the diuretic lens 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:01.939
 this antidiuretic hormone is called a bh 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.580
 our body needs to recover the shape 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.349
 I have released 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.009
 and the dcs agency 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.949
 when our blessing is full of water or bhp ceases to be 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:14.720
 released 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.849
 and this pm routine 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.469
 I was quite human very much. 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.549
 Why is this happening to me this year? 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.189
 is inhibited by the government 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.380
 the hull assuming the production of algarve arh 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.480
 The result is that without this hormone your secretariat there is no control over 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.990
 the amount of water that must be resolved by the body 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.529
 even if the amount of water in the blood is small 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:46.139
 the target makes hobby h not a secretary and therefore hoskins leave 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.829
 that more water six called on the web 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.080
 the increase in the penalty 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.700
 the entity to ben ali né this is another effect of alcohol in the organism a 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.940
 beer has a lot of water so the increase in the amount of urine is still 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.520
 This is bigger because when you have a lot of beer, you get that will. 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.800
 persistent urine other drinks such as wine whiskey the pinga also increased the 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.960
 amount of urine because of the effect of alcohol on the a bhp these drinks 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.400
 have less water than beer but higher alcoholic concentration 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.450
 increasing the risk of dehydration because the amount of water eliminated 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.440
 is the largest without increasing the amount of water ingested but all beverages 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.870
 have the same effect 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.229
 I arrived at the other body of the actress 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.669
 in six days this is one of the characteristics of the hangover 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.400
 I think now everything starts I went to the bathroom to throw up 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.550
 And when you 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.940
 and manage sponsorship of the amount of water 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.440
 leonine in your body as a lack of water and now manifests itself through 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.659
 accident 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.659
 I do not know how I got to stay this way. 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.589
 47 '- trails are good too 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.020
 but I also posted all the time like everyone else 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.809
 that's due place 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:09.229
 euclides and hence I found that this year eliminated the high 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.879
 only a very small amount of ingested alcohol 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.719
 eliminated by the application process 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:23.080
 in the case it rains only about 2% of the high eliminated 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.919
 if we count the elimination through the urine the percentage will be of 4 10% 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.849
 the effects of motorsport are the same for those who are sitting at a table 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.849
 and here to be summing up behind the electric trio 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.729
 if only a small part of the something we manage the writing of the beach where this 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.199
 something in the body 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.539
 I do not know very well, I think she's after her. 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.650
 in the head the son 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.240
 but in the head because I get my baby, it's okay 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.039
 of blood 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.210
 not that the liver 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.629
 most of the alcohol circulating in the blood of those who drank goes to the end 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:02.909
 in the liver 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.189
 alcohol is metabolized which results in bark water and energy curriculum 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:13.180
 when the staff rather placid something and turned into fat they will be 

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:16.180
 stored the renault rider the extra pounds 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:21.429
 despite energy, alcohol does not provide what our body needs to 

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:22.430
 to function 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.910
 like vitamins proteins iron and other compounds all this is fruit 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:31.770
 provided by the food ally being well fed a good way to 

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:35.809
 the effects of alcohol but the album should be consumed with 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:40.370
 moderation who drinks a lot and can often cause many 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:45.099
 serious health problems as if they were living liver cancer damage 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.099
 and heart problems 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.530
 recovery is well-fed and a better way to avoid the effects of 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.210
 hull noxious 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.210
 It's good that we reviewed 

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.999
 is the reaction binds itself that it is time for revision 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.069
 in the soul of today's soul you learned that the alcórcon interferes in the passage of 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:12.050
 nervous impulses through the neurons causing several sensations that go 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.839
 give euphoria treat depression diogo which is the excretory apparatus and how alcohol 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.580
 acts on it 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.669
 learned that it is a small matter that we filter substances that will be dispatched 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:24.379
 urine 

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:29.219
 and that the drink interferes with the secretion said slowly by increasing the amount of 

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:30.339
 water in the urine 

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:34.839
 It is obvious that ingested alcohol is metabolized by the body but 

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.809
 present in the liver 

00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:39.580
 now it's time to take this dress up 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.699
 brother of air where the plane should have done it 

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:44.080
 I will work 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.770
 And this is very important 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.919
 first of all our safety 

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:50.849
 why 25% of occupational accidents 

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:52.849
 are caused by drinking 

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:55.209
 be strong and also until the next
