00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.040
 Hello everyone when it comes to 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.440
 permitting nearly three thousand letters to 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.169
 one and a half 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.400
 many understand what they say there makbuk 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.810
 just tap to find nato 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.210
 but we already had a review of the 15 inch version 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.170
 our three cards announced in total 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.890
 a week ago 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 a week ago 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.710
 the trip 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 P 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.140
 n 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 if you compare it with a 15 inch I can 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.240
 veterans then change how it 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.960
 even less and can not 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.050
 much more interesting to compare it with 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.110
 ordinary alphabet 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.650
 the most noticeable differences here are the places 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.170
 inscriptions macbook pro 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 shorter if the inscription is not 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.930
 it means usually exercise g if the inscription is not 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.690
 does it mean rivkina but or just means inscription 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.720
 houses 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.040
 much more important difference is the size 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.390
 and weight is simple training to the resulting 24 meters and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.040
 weighing 2 kilograms 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.930
 hole retailer thickness of 19 millimeters 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.450
 and weighs 1 6 kilograms 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.110
 many people compare macbook pro 13 3 tina 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.640
 smartbook north believe feeling 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.920
 totally different it's 11 movies but he's all 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.430
 equals presentation gives 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.950
 macbook pro 13 3 tina really harder 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.320
 are you really getting the 13 inch version of macbook 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.540
 opera 220 300 grams less so i think 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.260
 nobody killed anyone 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.490
 The third most noticeable difference in the ports at macbook 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.080
 pro 13 nerd connectors how many eyes 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.540
 run up with some of them 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.650
 honestly don't even know what to do 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.340
 with this country mourns etc engines but also 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.260
 so unusual for this connector and dima 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.010
 but forward removed 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.270
 From this country, somewhere for headphones 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.440
 one of the children on the street and two ports sata inflated 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.550
 to be honest, many preferred to see 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.519
 everywhere one more of them 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.719
 charging socket and of course a lot 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.900
 matrix 2 recall adapter composition 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.129
 worth dropped out sport is sport 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.449
 but nevertheless it is here 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:20.139
 as for the rest looks and 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.179
 here everything is unchanged 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.299
 the case checked for years specially 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.829
 aluminum release glass touchpad 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.199
 very accurate and island-style keys 100 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.169
 Colour 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.340
 but also the most interesting this screen is screen 13 and 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:33.949
 do not delay a little 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.870
 resolution up to screen 15 and my version 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.500
 that's 2560 by 1600 against 2880 on the 800 thousand 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.399
 the picture is bright juicy but for many of her 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.439
 charms will still not be seen and not 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.129
 noticeable 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.680
 because in the browser this permission is not 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.409
 you can see and many of its programs are just 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:54.949
 I do not support 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.219
 principal technical 3 4 on 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.849
 the junction of the 15 inch version is what's here 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.559
 the video card is slim and in tag it 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.669
 discrete quite powerful 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.999
 mean by performance 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.639
 This gadget is closer in spirit to the Russian Federation 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.189
 This promises 7 hours of work offline 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.659
 Novatek mode 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.040
 This indicator is very difficult to obtain. 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.150
 much more real 6 hours if not 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.409
 limit yourself in terms of screen brightness 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.279
 and using my projects 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:25.249
 speak with this laptop really 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.519
 convenient to work long if you put it on 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.109
 knees because vent 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.969
 lattice is located and the bottom and the side and in 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.649
 even with very long work hours 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.349
 gets very hot 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.009
 In Russia, the macbook pro 13 3 3 sent 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.250
 mainly with a core i5 processor 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.420
 of two variations create a drive 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.130
 128 or 256 gigabyte 8 gigabytes of RAM and 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.469
 dad silence 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:51.109
 price reference 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.249
 80 90 thousand 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.629
 version soon 7 kopecks 512 gigabytes in place 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.989
 for drives also available in a couple of places 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.010
 will cost 130 thousand rubles 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.589
 it's time 5 too 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:09.079
 the truth is no less here and it doesn't smell but everything 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:09.979
 twenty 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:10.819
 about it in the comments
