00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.520
 eating at night can do it 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.280
 get fat but it 's more what you eat 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.000
 when 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.860
 I am sudhum barmen registered dietitian and 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.650
 It is common to hear that if you eat in the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.920
 late you put on weight 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.170
 this makes a bit of sense after 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.930
 all yes consumes calories at night it 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.880
 go to bed and sleep and logic we 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.310
 says that we do not have an opportunity to 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.130
 burn those calories so we went up from 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.830
 weight but the truth is that your body does not 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.559
 he knows what time it is so if he eats more 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.100
 calories at 8 o'clock at night or at 8 o'clock 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.380
 the morning will save those extra calories 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.180
 in your fat cells 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.430
 so because the myth persists 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.260
 well I think the reason more 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.630
 important is that many people when 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.850
 try to lose weight make the decision 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.340
 of not eating at certain times for example 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.860
 at 7 or 8 at night and when 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.600
 they see they have lost weight but 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.350
 it's not because they stopped eating at 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.840
 7 or 8 is why they used to do what 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.690
 that they did from 7 or until 8 of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.970
 the night was eating they ate all afternoon 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.610
 so if they stop consuming all those 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.520
 calories that they ate during the afternoon that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.410
 is the reason why they lose weight 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.390
 now if the time of day does not do the 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.420
 difference there are many reasons for 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.490
 distribute your calories during the day what 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.860
 principal is that if you want to maintain your 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.229
 physical and corporal energy will have to 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.340
 distribute your calories between 7 meals and 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.950
 snacks during the day 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.320
 another thing is that people who eat the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.840
 night has to relax and reduce its 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.170
 stress and the types of food they eat 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.920
 are usually high in caloric content what 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.299
 which can produce a weight gain 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.270
 so he's trying to keep his 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.610
 physical and mental energy distribute their 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.250
 calories during the day in seven meals 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.859
 and snacks can help you control 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.509
 your portions and can help you 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.509
 control your weight too
