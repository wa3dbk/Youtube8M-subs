alright guys so welcome to the second
part<00:00:01.860> of<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.159> shipbuilding<00:00:03.120> guide<00:00:03.330> so<00:00:03.720> in

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
part of this shipbuilding guide so in

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.940 
part of this shipbuilding guide so in
this<00:00:03.899> one<00:00:04.080> I'm<00:00:04.200> going<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.440> be<00:00:04.529> showing<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.859> how

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
this one I'm going to be showing you how

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.720 
this one I'm going to be showing you how
to<00:00:04.980> make<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.490> frame<00:00:06.140> for<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> ship<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.670> the

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
to make a frame for a ship so in the

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.950 
to make a frame for a ship so in the
previous<00:00:09.059> video<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.360> showed<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.660> how<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.780> make

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
previous video I showed you how to make

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.669 
previous video I showed you how to make
the<00:00:10.260> plans<00:00:11.509> so<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.660> included<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.170> sideways

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the plans so that included a sideways

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.269 
the plans so that included a sideways
plan<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.700> bird's<00:00:15.089> eye<00:00:15.240> view<00:00:15.269> plan<00:00:16.250> so<00:00:17.250> you

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
plan and a bird's eye view plan so you

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.500 
plan and a bird's eye view plan so you
now<00:00:17.430> want<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.640> start<00:00:17.880> implementing<00:00:18.300> that

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
now want to start implementing that

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.179 
now want to start implementing that
bird's<00:00:18.750> eye<00:00:18.900> view<00:00:18.930> plan<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.890> you've<00:00:19.980> made

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
bird's eye view plan that you've made

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.359 
bird's eye view plan that you've made
you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:22.580> just<00:00:23.580> make<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.269> plan<00:00:25.369> but

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
you can just make one with that plan but

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.130 
you can just make one with that plan but
I<00:00:26.400> would<00:00:26.640> suggest<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.330> where<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.720> used<00:00:27.869> upon

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I would suggest to where it's used upon

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.919 
I would suggest to where it's used upon
for<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.410> stage<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:29.189> start<00:00:29.460> each<00:00:30.210> end<00:00:30.539> so

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
for this stage to start each end so

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.610 
for this stage to start each end so
start<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> highest<00:00:31.740> point<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.820> hole<00:00:33.620> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
start the highest point of the hole and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.750 
start the highest point of the hole and
just<00:00:34.829> start<00:00:35.100> adding<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.760> plan<00:00:37.610> get<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
just start adding in the plan get this

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.130 
just start adding in the plan get this
the<00:00:38.910> same<00:00:39.120> height<00:00:40.610> same<00:00:41.610> level<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.840> yeah<00:00:42.960> it's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the same height same level so yeah it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.830 
the same height same level so yeah it's
quite<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.860> bit<00:00:43.980> easy<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> start<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
quite a bit easy if you start at the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.139 
quite a bit easy if you start at the
ends<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.649> don't<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> count<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.340> long

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
ends you don't have to count this long

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
ends you don't have to count this long
section<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.390> repeat<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.170> onto<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
section here so repeat that onto the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
section here so repeat that onto the
other<00:00:52.860> side<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.100> you'll<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> stage

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
other side and you'll get to the stage

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.779 
other side and you'll get to the stage
so<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.050> probably<00:00:55.260> best<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.890> install

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
so it's probably best if you do install

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.250 
so it's probably best if you do install
well<00:00:56.969> done<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> from<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.910> stage<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:01.109> want

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
well done it so from this stage you want

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.810 
well done it so from this stage you want
to<00:01:01.320> start<00:01:01.620> bringing<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.789> down<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.239> level

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
to start bringing it down to this level

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.800 
to start bringing it down to this level
she'll<00:01:05.820> be<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.420> final<00:01:06.750> level<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.400> and

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
she'll be the the final level for and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.090 
she'll be the the final level for and
I'm<00:01:09.810> using<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> full<00:01:10.320> rig<00:01:10.530> finished<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.010> this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
I'm using the full rig finished for this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.179 
I'm using the full rig finished for this
plan<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.030> demonstration<00:01:12.510> rather<00:01:13.189> as

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
plan for this demonstration rather as

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.320 
plan for this demonstration rather as
it's<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.729> pretty<00:01:15.210> average<00:01:15.420> looking<00:01:15.720> ship<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
it's a pretty average looking ship so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.219 
it's a pretty average looking ship so
make<00:01:18.330> sure<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.509> good<00:01:18.659> example<00:01:18.990> basically<00:01:24.229> so

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
make sure a good example basically so

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.190 
make sure a good example basically so
you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.710> pull<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.610> pull<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.390> down<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you can see pull in pull and get down to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.950 
you can see pull in pull and get down to
this<00:01:28.320> level<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.390> if<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> want<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> make<00:01:30.930> any

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
this level and if you want to make any

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.370 
this level and if you want to make any
modifications<00:01:32.810> for<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:33.900> there<00:01:34.110> sort<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
modifications for out there sort of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.859 
modifications for out there sort of
building<00:01:35.540> process<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.619> course<00:01:38.869> again

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
building process you can of course again

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.660 
building process you can of course again
like<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> said<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> previous<00:01:40.680> video<00:01:40.979> it's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
like I said in the previous video it's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
like I said in the previous video it's
probably<00:01:41.939> best<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.200> looks<00:01:43.380> over

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
probably best if you go for looks over

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.160 
probably best if you go for looks over
realism<00:01:45.079> that's<00:01:46.079> down<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.799> course

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.100 

there<00:01:51.170> we<00:01:51.229> go<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.680> can<00:01:51.830> then<00:01:51.920> remove<00:01:52.280> this

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.580 

spam<00:01:57.110> these<00:01:57.290> blocks<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:59.229> you<00:02:00.229> can<00:02:00.350> start

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
spam these blocks and you can start

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.800 
spam these blocks and you can start
adding<00:02:00.710> in<00:02:00.920> these<00:02:01.070> sort<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.840> sideways<00:02:03.100> pieces

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
adding in these sort of sideways pieces

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.090 
adding in these sort of sideways pieces
where<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.900> DAX<00:02:06.110> are<00:02:06.290> going<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.470> be<00:02:06.590> sort<00:02:07.040> of

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
where the DAX are going to be sort of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.480 
where the DAX are going to be sort of
cut<00:02:07.310> off<00:02:07.490> just<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:08.570> that<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.500> once<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.770> once

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
cut off just like that so once you once

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.070 
cut off just like that so once you once
you've<00:02:10.640> then<00:02:10.820> repeated<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.450> on<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.990> the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
you've then repeated that on to the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.320 
you've then repeated that on to the
other<00:02:12.200> side<00:02:12.350> or<00:02:12.590> copied<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.520> over<00:02:13.580> you'll

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
other side or copied it over you'll

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.670 
other side or copied it over you'll
you'll<00:02:14.959> get<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.320> stage<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.230> now<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.410> want

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
you'll get to this stage so now you want

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.760 
you'll get to this stage so now you want
to<00:02:18.709> start<00:02:18.980> adding<00:02:19.160> in<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.670> ribs<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:21.500> usually

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
to start adding in the ribs so I usually

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:29.470 
to start adding in the ribs so I usually
start<00:02:21.950> here<00:02:27.850> now<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:28.910> want<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.150> make<00:02:29.270> these

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
start here now you want to make these

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.530 
start here now you want to make these
ribs<00:02:29.720> sort<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.230> quite<00:02:30.980> round<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:32.330> want<00:02:32.480> to

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
ribs sort of a quite round you want to

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.930 
ribs sort of a quite round you want to
aim<00:02:32.690> for<00:02:32.720> them<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.410> end<00:02:33.890> up<00:02:34.400> looking<00:02:34.520> sort<00:02:34.880> of

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
aim for them to end up looking sort of

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.900 
aim for them to end up looking sort of
pear<00:02:35.390> shape<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.950> actually<00:02:36.950> think<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.520> as<00:02:37.640> say

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
pear shape I actually think of it as say

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.780 
pear shape I actually think of it as say
an<00:02:38.510> upside<00:02:38.870> down<00:02:38.900> light<00:02:39.350> bulb<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:40.610> want<00:02:40.730> to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
an upside down light bulb so you want to

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.479 
an upside down light bulb so you want to
aim<00:02:40.880> for<00:02:41.170> ya<00:02:42.170> aim<00:02:42.320> for<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:43.010> sort<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.280> shape

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
aim for ya aim for that sort of shape

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.540 
aim for ya aim for that sort of shape
sort<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:43.940> around<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.510> pear<00:02:44.900> or<00:02:45.310> light<00:02:46.310> bulb

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
sort of around a pear or light bulb

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.650 
sort of around a pear or light bulb
shape<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:49.700> like<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.390> want<00:02:50.510> to

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
shape so just like that and you want to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.380 
shape so just like that and you want to
put<00:02:51.560> these<00:02:51.680> ribs<00:02:51.950> every<00:02:52.340> uh<00:02:52.370> two<00:02:53.120> or<00:02:53.150> three

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
put these ribs every uh two or three

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.289 
put these ribs every uh two or three
blocks<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.930> am<00:02:54.580> at<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.730> ends<00:02:56.000> where<00:02:56.030> there's

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
blocks I am at the ends where there's

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.660 
blocks I am at the ends where there's
more<00:02:56.480> sort<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:56.840> change<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.500> usually<00:02:58.160> go<00:02:58.310> for<00:02:58.340> a

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
more sort of change I usually go for a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.600 
more sort of change I usually go for a
two<00:02:59.209> block<00:02:59.420> gap<00:02:59.709> so<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.769> can<00:03:00.920> add<00:03:01.010> in<00:03:01.130> more<00:03:01.340> sort

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
two block gap so I can add in more sort

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.340 
two block gap so I can add in more sort
of<00:03:02.410> detail<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.799> plan<00:03:05.049> so<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.079> want<00:03:06.290> to

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
of detail to the plan so you want to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.190 
of detail to the plan so you want to
repeat<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.739> over<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.130> can<00:03:07.280> actually<00:03:08.200> get

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
repeat this over you can actually get

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.110 
repeat this over you can actually get
the<00:03:09.260> sacks<00:03:09.530> whoops

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the sacks whoops

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.360 
the sacks whoops
can<00:03:11.120> actually<00:03:11.360> use<00:03:11.480> well<00:03:11.660> done<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.370> make

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
can actually use well done it to make

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.580 
can actually use well done it to make
this<00:03:13.519> process<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:14.030> bit<00:03:14.180> faster

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.979 

perfect<00:03:19.590> free<00:03:20.060> -<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> free<00:03:21.360> blocks<00:03:21.599> it<00:03:21.780> doesn't

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
perfect free - a free blocks it doesn't

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:29.530 
perfect free - a free blocks it doesn't
really<00:03:22.110> matter<00:03:22.319> at<00:03:23.099> this<00:03:23.310> stage<00:03:23.569> this<00:03:24.569> section

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:44.390 

just<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.659> that

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.830 

okay<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:45.459> like<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.819> said<00:03:45.970> earlier<00:03:46.120> try<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.659> go

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
okay so like I said earlier try to go

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.229 
okay so like I said earlier try to go
for<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.140> sort<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.440> round<00:03:47.849> shape<00:03:48.849> so<00:03:49.060> it's

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
for that sort of round shape so it's

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.119 
for that sort of round shape so it's
quite<00:03:49.420> should<00:03:50.049> be<00:03:50.170> quite<00:03:50.409> steep<00:03:50.680> here<00:03:50.920> and

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
quite should be quite steep here and

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.530 
quite should be quite steep here and
then<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.340> should<00:03:51.489> sort<00:03:51.849> of<00:03:51.970> bulge<00:03:52.150> out<00:03:52.360> like

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
then it should sort of bulge out like

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:17.300 
then it should sort of bulge out like
that<00:03:53.430> like<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.459> pair<00:03:55.390> or<00:03:55.569> light<00:03:56.349> bulb<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.890> sad

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.650 

okay<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:18.370> towards<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:18.940> end<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.269> might<00:04:19.419> get<00:04:19.600> a

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
okay so towards the end it might get a

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
okay so towards the end it might get a
lot<00:04:19.810> bit<00:04:20.019> tricky<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:22.630> just<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:22.990> try<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.440> best

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
lot bit tricky so just a try it best

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.320 
lot bit tricky so just a try it best
really<00:04:23.949> you<00:04:24.039> cannot<00:04:24.250> obviously<00:04:24.580> fix<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.180> later

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
really you cannot obviously fix it later

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.450 
really you cannot obviously fix it later
on<00:04:25.740> try<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.830> get<00:04:26.919> it<00:04:27.010> as<00:04:27.130> good<00:04:27.340> as<00:04:27.430> possible

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
on try and get it as good as possible

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.320 
on try and get it as good as possible
obviously

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
obviously

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.500 
obviously
so<00:04:29.199> yeah<00:04:29.680> base<00:04:29.979> once<00:04:30.789> you've<00:04:30.940> done<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.270> you

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
so yeah base once you've done that you

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.879 
so yeah base once you've done that you
can<00:04:32.160> flip<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.190> over<00:04:33.340> like<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.300> said<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.889> you'll

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
can flip it over like I said and you'll

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.400 
can flip it over like I said and you'll
get<00:04:35.979> to<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.220> stage<00:04:36.510> so<00:04:37.510> once<00:04:38.139> you've<00:04:38.289> done

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
get to the stage so once you've done

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.520 
get to the stage so once you've done
that<00:04:38.470> you<00:04:38.770> can<00:04:38.950> sort<00:04:39.700> of<00:04:39.760> look<00:04:39.910> down<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.530> ribs

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
that you can sort of look down the ribs

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.370 
that you can sort of look down the ribs
look<00:04:41.950> down<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.310> hole<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.840> make<00:04:43.930> sure<00:04:44.139> that

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
look down the hole and make sure that

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.770 
look down the hole and make sure that
it's<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.740> like<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.400> said<00:04:45.700> sort<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.270> pair<00:04:46.510> or<00:04:46.720> a

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
it's a like I said sort of pair or a

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.469 
it's a like I said sort of pair or a
light<00:04:46.990> bulb<00:04:47.169> shape<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:48.880> will<00:04:49.030> depend<00:04:49.210> on

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
light bulb shape and it will depend on

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.540 
light bulb shape and it will depend on
which<00:04:49.780> boat<00:04:50.620> or<00:04:50.889> ship<00:04:50.919> that<00:04:51.280> you're<00:04:51.430> actually

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
which boat or ship that you're actually

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.430 
which boat or ship that you're actually
making<00:04:51.789> but<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.690> generally<00:04:53.080> want<00:04:53.169> to<00:04:53.289> get

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
making but you generally want to get

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.089 
making but you generally want to get
that<00:04:53.620> shape<00:04:53.860> so<00:04:54.960> I'll<00:04:55.960> show<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.530> few

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
that shape so I'll show you a few

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.430 
that shape so I'll show you a few
examples<00:04:57.130> because<00:04:57.760> like<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.030> said<00:04:58.360> every<00:04:59.260> arm

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
examples because like I said every arm

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.219 
examples because like I said every arm
boat<00:05:00.130> or<00:05:00.370> ship<00:05:00.400> will<00:05:00.880> be<00:05:01.030> different<00:05:01.389> so<00:05:01.930> when

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
boat or ship will be different so when

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.670 
boat or ship will be different so when
this<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:02.590> a<00:05:02.620> tartan<00:05:03.780> so<00:05:04.780> it's<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.960> bit<00:05:05.110> sort<00:05:05.590> of

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
this is a tartan so it's a bit sort of

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.730 
this is a tartan so it's a bit sort of
wider<00:05:06.099> looking<00:05:07.060> than<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.300> four<00:05:08.139> repents<00:05:08.560> that

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.129 
wider looking than the four repents that
I've<00:05:08.860> shown<00:05:09.099> shown<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:09.669> there

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.550 

shoot<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:13.230> up<00:05:13.350> from<00:05:13.680> down<00:05:14.400> here<00:05:14.639> actually

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
shoot you up from down here actually

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.610 
shoot you up from down here actually
it's<00:05:16.560> quite<00:05:16.740> quite<00:05:17.160> round<00:05:17.400> as<00:05:17.580> well<00:05:19.340> and<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
it's quite quite round as well and the

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.140 
it's quite quite round as well and the
black<00:05:22.620> galleon<00:05:22.979> that<00:05:23.130> I've<00:05:23.190> recently<00:05:23.370> made<00:05:23.699> so

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
black galleon that I've recently made so

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.969 
black galleon that I've recently made so
this<00:05:24.360> is<00:05:24.479> probably<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.930> most<00:05:25.050> sort<00:05:25.889> of

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
this is probably the most sort of

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.300 
this is probably the most sort of
average<00:05:26.310> looking<00:05:27.620> shaped<00:05:28.620> it<00:05:28.770> that<00:05:29.160> you'll

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
average looking shaped it that you'll

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.000 
average looking shaped it that you'll
see<00:05:29.550> so<00:05:30.360> quite<00:05:30.540> like<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.080> said<00:05:31.380> pair<00:05:31.710> or

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
see so quite like I said pair or

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.719 
see so quite like I said pair or
lightbulb<00:05:32.729> looking<00:05:34.220> look<00:05:35.220> at<00:05:35.310> it<00:05:35.430> from<00:05:35.520> down

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
lightbulb looking look at it from down

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.469 
lightbulb looking look at it from down
here<00:05:36.470> quite<00:05:37.470> round<00:05:37.740> again<00:05:38.010> quite<00:05:38.940> a<00:05:38.970> quite

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
here quite round again quite a quite

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.900 
here quite round again quite a quite
straight<00:05:39.780> as<00:05:39.930> well<00:05:40.080> compared<00:05:40.949> to<00:05:40.979> a<00:05:41.100> lot<00:05:41.280> lot

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
straight as well compared to a lot lot

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.060 
straight as well compared to a lot lot
of<00:05:41.970> ships<00:05:42.260> from<00:05:43.260> here<00:05:43.470> that's<00:05:43.620> quite<00:05:43.889> a<00:05:43.919> nice

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
of ships from here that's quite a nice

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.030 
of ships from here that's quite a nice
angle<00:05:44.450> and<00:05:45.450> the<00:05:45.930> Floyd<00:05:46.139> it's<00:05:46.380> quite<00:05:46.590> quite<00:05:46.950> an

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
angle and the Floyd it's quite quite an

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.590 
angle and the Floyd it's quite quite an
odd<00:05:47.160> example<00:05:47.669> it's<00:05:47.820> probably<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.150> most<00:05:48.300> pear

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
odd example it's probably the most pear

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.140 
odd example it's probably the most pear
shape<00:05:48.840> it's<00:05:49.080> got<00:05:49.200> quite<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.520> flat<00:05:50.520> bottom<00:05:50.729> to<00:05:51.030> it

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
shape it's got quite a flat bottom to it

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.950 
shape it's got quite a flat bottom to it
as<00:05:51.720> you<00:05:51.870> can<00:05:51.990> see<00:05:52.229> and<00:05:53.479> it's<00:05:54.479> probably<00:05:54.720> got

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
as you can see and it's probably got

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.170 
as you can see and it's probably got
it's<00:05:55.650> probably<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.040> straightest<00:05:56.669> ship<00:05:56.970> that

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
it's probably the straightest ship that

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.340 
it's probably the straightest ship that
I've<00:05:57.300> made<00:05:57.750> recently<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:59.990> this<00:06:00.990> is<00:06:01.139> quite<00:06:01.320> a

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
I've made recently and this is quite a

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.850 
I've made recently and this is quite a
nice<00:06:01.500> angle<00:06:01.770> from<00:06:02.010> here<00:06:02.840> so<00:06:03.840> I<00:06:04.200> hope<00:06:04.380> this<00:06:04.620> sort

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
nice angle from here so I hope this sort

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.050 
nice angle from here so I hope this sort
of<00:06:04.919> a<00:06:05.100> guide<00:06:05.940> or<00:06:05.970> tutorial<00:06:06.780> is<00:06:07.160> helped<00:06:08.160> you<00:06:08.220> out

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
so this will be the last example but I

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.640 
so this will be the last example but I
will<00:06:11.070> leave<00:06:11.250> some<00:06:11.580> pictures<00:06:12.270> of<00:06:12.660> examples<00:06:13.380> too

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
will leave some pictures of examples too

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.400 
will leave some pictures of examples too
to<00:06:14.039> end<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.250> video<00:06:14.340> so<00:06:14.820> as<00:06:15.510> usual<00:06:15.870> guys<00:06:16.050> hope
