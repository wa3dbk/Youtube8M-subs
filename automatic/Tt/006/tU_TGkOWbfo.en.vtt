for over 20 years one of the most common
questions<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.150> patients<00:00:12.630> asked<00:00:12.960> when<00:00:13.080> we

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
questions the patients asked when we

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.860 
questions the patients asked when we
first<00:00:13.500> began<00:00:13.830> was<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.849> long<00:00:15.000> will<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.269> last

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
first began was how long will it last

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.320 
first began was how long will it last
back<00:00:16.410> then<00:00:16.650> all<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.250> knew<00:00:17.430> was<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.850> patients

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
back then all we knew was that patients

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.269 
back then all we knew was that patients
treated<00:00:18.600> overseas<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> initial

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
treated overseas and in the initial

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.279 
treated overseas and in the initial
clinical<00:00:20.670> trials<00:00:21.270> were<00:00:21.449> quite<00:00:21.660> stable<00:00:21.990> from

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
clinical trials were quite stable from

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.420 
clinical trials were quite stable from
one<00:00:22.500> year<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> next

one year to the next

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.370 
one year to the next
but<00:00:23.820> we'd<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.779> 20<00:00:25.050> years<00:00:25.230> of

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
but we'd not have the 20 years of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.859 
but we'd not have the 20 years of
follow-up<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.160> today<00:00:26.539> when<00:00:27.539> LASIK

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869

procedures<00:00:28.349> were<00:00:28.680> first<00:00:29.039> being<00:00:29.369> performed<00:00:29.789> we

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
procedures were first being performed we

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.600 
procedures were first being performed we
understood<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.230> way<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> cornea<00:00:31.890> healed<00:00:32.189> and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
understood the way the cornea healed and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.069 
understood the way the cornea healed and
we<00:00:32.759> had<00:00:32.850> experience<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> host<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.960> other

we had experience with a host of other
corneal<00:00:34.559> procedures<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:35.670> today<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.120> know

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
corneal procedures but today we know

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.500 
corneal procedures but today we know
LASIK<00:00:37.079> does<00:00:37.380> remain<00:00:37.800> stable<00:00:38.100> year<00:00:38.790> after<00:00:39.239> year

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
LASIK does remain stable year after year

continued change for example let's say

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.830 
continued change for example let's say
you're<00:00:53.820> 20<00:00:54.270> years<00:00:54.360> old

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you're 20 years old

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
