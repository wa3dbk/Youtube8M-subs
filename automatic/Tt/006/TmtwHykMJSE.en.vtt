one an octave higher and again we want

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.510 
one an octave higher and again we want
some<00:00:14.839> separation<00:00:15.559> here<00:00:15.799> we<00:00:15.919> don't<00:00:16.040> want<00:00:16.160> to<00:00:16.400> be

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
some separation here we don't want to be

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.519 
some separation here we don't want to be

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
you can mix and match these things to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.519 
you can mix and match these things to
the<00:00:23.630> track<00:00:23.930> that<00:00:24.109> you're<00:00:24.199> going<00:00:24.349> to<00:00:24.410> be

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
hear this part in isolation so you can

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.130 
hear this part in isolation so you can
really<00:00:40.640> get<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:40.970> grips<00:00:41.180> with<00:00:41.300> that<00:00:41.450> before<00:00:42.020> you

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
really get to grips with that before you

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.200 
really get to grips with that before you
put<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.410> into<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.680> jam<00:00:43.010> session<00:00:43.460> situation

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
put it into the jam session situation

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.330 
put it into the jam session situation
anyway<00:00:45.020> let's<00:00:45.290> pull<00:00:45.500> up<00:00:45.530> that<00:00:45.800> track<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:46.100> I'm

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
anyway let's pull up that track and I'm

00:00:46.340 --> 00:01:10.090 
anyway let's pull up that track and I'm
going<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.490> show<00:00:46.700> you<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:46.970> single<00:00:47.360> note<00:00:47.540> line

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.740 

okay<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.160> that's<00:01:11.490> our<00:01:11.640> third<00:01:11.940> guitar<00:01:12.420> part

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
okay so that's our third guitar part

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.780 
okay so that's our third guitar part
that<00:01:13.440> we're<00:01:13.590> playing<00:01:13.770> over<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> first<00:01:14.490> two

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that we're playing over the first two

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.360 
that we're playing over the first two
and<00:01:15.690> what<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.870> decided<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.710> was<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.220> other

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
and what I decided to do was the other

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.270 
and what I decided to do was the other
two<00:01:17.640> parts<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.180> chordal<00:01:18.630> parts<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.980> thought

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
two parts are chordal parts so I thought

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280 
two parts are chordal parts so I thought
it<00:01:20.520> would<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.700> nice<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:20.910> we<00:01:21.240> created<00:01:21.660> a<00:01:21.930> riff

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it would be nice if we created a riff

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.860 
it would be nice if we created a riff
kind<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.010> a<00:01:23.100> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.550> effect<00:01:23.850> over<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
kind of a kind of effect over this and

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.620 
kind of a kind of effect over this and
I've<00:01:25.230> based<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.710> riff<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.970> crossroads

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I've based this riff on the crossroads

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 
I've based this riff on the crossroads
the<00:01:27.960> Eric<00:01:28.170> Clapton<00:01:28.560> crossroads<00:01:29.070> riff<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the Eric Clapton crossroads riff and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.180 
the Eric Clapton crossroads riff and
we're<00:01:30.510> basically<00:01:30.690> using<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.980> minor

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
we're basically using the minor

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.820 
we're basically using the minor
pentatonic<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.240> minor<00:01:33.510> pentatonic<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.350> open

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
pentatonic of a minor pentatonic in open

pentatonic of a minor pentatonic in open
position<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:36.600> first<00:01:36.870> part<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.230> that<00:01:37.290> leg

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
position and the first part of that leg

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.570 
position and the first part of that leg
we're<00:01:38.610> using<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.120> open<00:01:39.510> E<00:01:39.750> string<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.580> we're

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
we're using the open E string and we're

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.310 
we're using the open E string and we're
playing<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> octave<00:01:42.510> above<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:43.020> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
then you're hammering the open a to a B

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.470 
then you're hammering the open a to a B

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:33.080 
you've got this so far then you've got
an<00:02:25.080> open<00:02:25.350> D<00:02:25.500> sore<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.950> between<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.430> okay<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
an open D sore in between this okay and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.030 
an open D sore in between this okay and
then<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.300> repeat<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.050> first<00:02:34.350> part<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.860> lick

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
then I repeat the first part of the lick

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.820 
then I repeat the first part of the lick
again<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.810> then<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.930> play<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.140> second<00:02:37.650> part

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
again and then you play the second part

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:48.009 
again and then you play the second part
again<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.490> we've<00:02:38.640> got<00:02:38.790> this

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.320 

okay<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.080> that's<00:02:49.409> the<00:02:49.680> Rif<00:02:49.950> part<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
okay so that's the Rif part of this and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.550 
okay so that's the Rif part of this and
then<00:02:52.110> what<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.349> do<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.830> slide<00:02:53.280> up<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.230> see

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
then what I do is I slide up to a see

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.000 
then what I do is I slide up to a see
sharpening<00:02:56.159> Andy<00:02:56.640> here<00:02:57.030> which<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.540> implying

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
sharpening Andy here which is implying

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.440 
sharpening Andy here which is implying
the<00:02:59.010> third<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.549> fifth<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.940> our<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> chord

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
the third and the fifth of our a chord

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.890 
the third and the fifth of our a chord
and<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:02.580> attack<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.120> C<00:03:03.299> sharp<00:03:03.540> first<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:06.390> then

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
and I attack the C sharp first and then

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.400 
and I attack the C sharp first and then
the<00:03:07.230> E<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.650> then<00:03:07.799> back<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.220> C<00:03:08.400> sharp

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.600 

slide<00:03:12.250> down<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.820> be

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
slide down to be

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.940 
slide down to be
and<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.210> D<00:03:15.390> here<00:03:15.720> which<00:03:15.990> is<00:03:16.140> implying<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
and the D here which is implying the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.980 
and the D here which is implying the
third<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.640> fifth<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.270> G<00:03:18.450> chord<00:03:18.660> so

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
third and the fifth of the G chord so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.069 
third and the fifth of the G chord so
we've<00:03:19.140> got<00:03:19.290> this

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.630 

so<00:03:24.079> we've<00:03:24.230> got<00:03:24.379> a<00:03:24.409> double<00:03:24.769> stop<00:03:25.010> idea<00:03:25.459> that

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
so we've got a double stop idea that

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.699 
so we've got a double stop idea that
really<00:03:25.939> sings<00:03:26.450> out<00:03:26.689> nicely<00:03:26.959> against<00:03:27.560> the

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
really sings out nicely against the

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.229 
really sings out nicely against the
chordal<00:03:28.129> part<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.609> we're<00:03:28.730> playing<00:03:29.030> in<00:03:29.209> the

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
chordal part that we're playing in the

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.509 
chordal part that we're playing in the
other<00:03:29.420> guitars<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.739> here's<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.099> riff<00:03:31.250> again

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
other guitars so here's the riff again

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.309 
other guitars so here's the riff again
really<00:03:31.849> slow<00:03:32.329> okay<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:32.900> watch<00:03:33.019> what<00:03:33.230> I'm

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
really slow okay and watch what I'm

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.500 
really slow okay and watch what I'm
doing<00:03:33.590> with<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.829> picking<00:03:34.219> and<00:03:35.180> what<00:03:35.359> you

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
doing with the picking and what you

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.420 
doing with the picking and what you
might<00:03:35.719> have<00:03:35.870> noticed<00:03:36.349> when<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.560> got<00:03:36.650> more<00:03:37.099> into

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
might have noticed when I got more into

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.569 
might have noticed when I got more into
playing<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.969> part<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.650> put<00:03:39.650> these<00:03:39.769> grace<00:03:40.220> notes

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
playing the part I put these grace notes

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.759 
playing the part I put these grace notes
in<00:03:40.909> my<00:03:41.090> picking<00:03:41.569> as<00:03:41.720> well<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.170> you'll<00:03:42.470> start

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
in my picking as well and you'll start

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.890 
in my picking as well and you'll start
to<00:03:42.890> do<00:03:43.099> those<00:03:43.280> things<00:03:43.640> as<00:03:43.819> well<00:03:44.030> I'm<00:03:44.510> trying<00:03:44.870> to

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
to do those things as well I'm trying to

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.630 
to do those things as well I'm trying to
keep<00:03:45.049> them<00:03:45.230> concise<00:03:45.739> for<00:03:46.069> you<00:03:46.159> but<00:03:46.430> also

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
keep them concise for you but also

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.339 
keep them concise for you but also
you're<00:03:46.970> going<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.180> start<00:03:47.450> putting<00:03:47.599> stylistic

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
you're going to start putting stylistic

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.379 
you're going to start putting stylistic
approaches<00:03:48.859> into<00:03:49.040> these<00:03:49.280> things<00:03:49.549> too<00:03:49.790> so

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
approaches into these things too so

00:03:50.389 --> 00:04:15.820 
approaches into these things too so
here's<00:03:50.599> the<00:03:50.720> riff<00:03:50.900> slow

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:26.030 

and<00:04:16.370> here's<00:04:16.730> more<00:04:16.970> tempered

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.850 

okay<00:04:26.970> now<00:04:27.510> you<00:04:27.570> can<00:04:27.840> pull<00:04:28.410> up<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.680> original

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
okay now you can pull up the original

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.860 
okay now you can pull up the original
track<00:04:29.370> which<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.580> just<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.030> bass<00:04:30.180> &amp;<00:04:30.420> Drums<00:04:30.450> and

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
track which is just the bass &amp; Drums and

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.440 
track which is just the bass &amp; Drums and
practice<00:04:31.260> this<00:04:31.470> part<00:04:31.800> in<00:04:31.950> isolation<00:04:32.490> over

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
practice this part in isolation over

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.480 
practice this part in isolation over
that<00:04:33.600> track<00:04:33.930> as<00:04:34.110> well<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.860> also<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:35.250> could

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
that track as well and also you could

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.790 
that track as well and also you could
play<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:35.790> against<00:04:36.450> part<00:04:36.720> number<00:04:37.020> one<00:04:37.170> or

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
play that against part number one or

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.160 
play that against part number one or
part<00:04:38.220> number<00:04:38.280> two<00:04:38.700> independently<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.690> then

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
part number two independently and then

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.840 
part number two independently and then
put<00:04:40.350> all<00:04:40.440> three<00:04:40.740> together<00:04:40.890> as<00:04:41.280> well<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:41.730> we've

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
put all three together as well so we've

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.520 
put all three together as well so we've
given<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.210> those<00:04:42.390> things<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.080> can<00:04:43.290> jam

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
given you those things that you can jam

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.860 
given you those things that you can jam
against<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.730> come<00:04:45.120> up<00:04:45.270> with<00:04:45.300> some<00:04:45.540> ideas

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
against and to come up with some ideas

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.020 
against and to come up with some ideas
of<00:04:46.020> your<00:04:46.200> own<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.590> also<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.250> practice<00:04:47.550> these

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
of your own and also to practice these

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.530 
of your own and also to practice these
parts<00:04:48.480> as<00:04:48.630> well<00:04:48.810> fantastic
