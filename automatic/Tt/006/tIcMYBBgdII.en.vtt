00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Our job is usually to praise 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.060
 the athletes who do things well 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.069
 but we take Fridays to 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.679
 relax a bit and have fun without 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.259
 intention to offend anyone but today 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.089
 we have perhaps separated the funniest 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.910
 of all our year's not 'top 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.289

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.510

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.090
