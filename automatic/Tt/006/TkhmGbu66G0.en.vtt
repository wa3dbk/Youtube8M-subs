00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.260 
this is some nice styrofoam yep there's
that<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.130> casing<00:03:47.610> we<00:03:47.730> can<00:03:47.910> see<00:03:48.060> it's

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
that so in a casing we can see it's

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.890 
that so in a casing we can see it's
silver<00:03:48.860> 17.3<00:03:49.860> inches<00:03:50.360> it's<00:03:51.360> got<00:03:51.540> some<00:03:51.720> tape

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:03.229 
about the back we will go over all that
in<00:03:54.690> specifics<00:03:55.260> in<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.530> second<00:03:56.780> let<00:03:57.780> me<00:04:02.239> tape

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
in specifics in a second let me tape

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.960 
in specifics in a second let me tape
that<00:04:03.420> down<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.810> doesn't<00:04:03.870> hit<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.230> thing

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
that down so it doesn't hit the thing
