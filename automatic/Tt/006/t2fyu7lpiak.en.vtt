00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.200
 Women donated by the son daughter 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.650

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:50.870
 That's why an outdoor camera from Panasonic 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:55.660
 here it is and that is the dm cft 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.739

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.260
 bay is in there and in connection 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.509
 maybe a short test outside 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.390
 Furthermore, I would like to completely 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.469
 Welcome to the new subscribers

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.959
 say something 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:32.689
 First of all , the battery sticks in the eye completely 

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:36.130
 normal battery then here we have that 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:41.659
 Charger the charging cradle for the battery 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:48.859
 brings the power connection to the battery and 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:53.899
 the network here is the delicate fabrics the 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:58.609
 krages bend what we have here yes 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:03.819
 this is the connection between the camera 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.819
 and pc usb 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:21.490
 Here is the camera is not bad mr 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:26.610
 woodpecker looks in a beautiful blue 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:33.510
 really great for something special here 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:37.560
 This camera is equipped with GPS 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:46.090
 So high-tech of the finest 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:54.400
 the objective is absolute in the camera 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:59.280
 waterproof and shockproof good 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.280
 that we still have the cd-rom for 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.820
 Photo fans studio and the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.850
 instructions for use here is the 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.910
 manual in german yes good 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:23.170
 but now I'll be right in 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:24.459
 connecting the battery and then loading 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.959
 I'll march out and 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.959
 make trial recordings 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.090
 Hello 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.120
 Now we are on the way now 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:51.209
 awful the camera off all the time 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:51.209
 Checking through less is the way to go 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.480
 I do not need such a visa 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.540
 I also did not care about it because 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:09.220
 when it comes but actually 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:16.370
 not on this ability but 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:19.510
 finally on the detail recording will 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:24.919
 After looking at it on the pc 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:30.830
 and as I said that should only be in advance 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:34.510
 first small short test are but 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.020
 So far I am absolutely convinced 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.200
 SchÃ¶neben with this camera 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:46.690
 the iaa is waterproof and therefore 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.760
 also certainly protected dust 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.770
 because that was the problem with mine 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.669
 last channel 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:02.090
 that was the camera of sony cybershot 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:06.979
 like 730 with a great camera you can 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:16.430
 not at all but unfortunately unfortunately 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:25.130
 not so author justice yes there is the 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:28.820
 small dose freezes chf off yes that was 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:32.080
 for today I say goodbye 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.650
 as normal and are not at 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.650
 the acting
