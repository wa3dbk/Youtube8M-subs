00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.780
 and like here today with a new trick 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.160
 thought to make a trick 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.779
 using products with a good in c 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.430
 natural products we say that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.770
 lately I'm getting closer to these 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.960
 products and greeting changes 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.489
 although I still have pimples 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.070
 because in any case they do not depend only 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.500
 of cosmetics but also from the style of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.330
 life that from the power of many 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.090
 factors, however, are just so for the 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.500
 skin and less suffering in this trick 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.989
 used all the products with a good one 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.909
 starting from the base blush la 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.470
 pencil mascara to all eyeshadows 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.350
 how many natural products and the effect 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.330
 according to me very cool very portable 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.940
 maybe for girls who go to school 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.769
 going to work at the university that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 they have little time so they want a 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.940
 nice simple makeup that you make 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.010
 in a few minutes and this is 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.560
 really just that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.390
 the effect may please you like a kiss e 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.240
 leaves you guys making for 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.880
 first we go to the base and go 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.100
 to use this powder foundation 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.830
 foundation of good a few meters to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.950
 miller al power and mine and la 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.200
 live set tone 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.260
 so what do I do towards some of the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.550
 produced in Beijing as needed then 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.880
 obviously this was a junta it was 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.130
 inserted and apply it with this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.510
 brush then snow cosmetics that the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.870
 red alpi fi that practically one of the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.970
 new brushes from the new collection 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.970
 with circular movements 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.649
 this foundation is very very light 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.460
 and practically does not layer it is not 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.039
 feel opaque good does not create 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.470
 obviously the problems of forette 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.959
 despite having a skin very much 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.940
 delicate very sensitive I must say that 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.380
 I really like it a lot 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.590
 especially for the very effect 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.010
 natural that knows why very often the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.920
 foundation especially those a little more 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.680
 more opaques give a skin effect 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.599
 more perfect, however, it is noted is known 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.690
 obviously also our skin because 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:35.140
 what can not be more keys 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.980
 I really find that it's great 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.510
 and because it is very, very, very, very very much 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.099
 light as far as coverage is concerned 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.849
 you see, however, that I have perfection 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:53.440
 immediately not just perfect face though 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:57.220
 that little bit of opacity from one 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.019
 light covering has power from 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.180
 read at medium from the snow palette 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.670
 elegant cosmetics I go to 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.720
 apply this color here you see 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.630
 this is practically a cream 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.840
 Satin obviously the most common one 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.910
 use flat brush in this case 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.720
 this period therefore saved this 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:26.819
 color on the eyelid 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.819
 you see that it is very very very bright 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.579
 and in spite of the trick that 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.079
 I want to do if a natural makeup 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.310
 I really like to give this effect 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.319
 bright 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.530
 ok at this point i make a mix of 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.989
 these two colors therefore of this 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.310
 apricot and this peach color 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.069
 I apply the color that comes out with 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.870
 this brush here with snow cosmetics 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:04:03.079
 which is of the new collection and is the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:06.829
 denning throw then I apply the color la 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:10.340
 folds in a very very delicate way 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:13.099
 so I make a very very nuance 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.729
 delicate because the makeup anyway 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:23.139
 I want it to be very very natural 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:26.360
 so I leave the national start effect 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.550
 go apply the white below 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.560
 an eyebrow arch and in the corner 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.690
 inside the eye more faded contrite 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.400
 don't have a white chalk effect too 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.949
 too obvious at the beginning of the eye 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.440
 in the inner corner to give even more 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.870
 brightness to the look from the palette of 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.510
 Czech confusion collection I take this 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.460
 color here that a brownish with a good 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.710
 the pen these of course zoeva 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.320
 you can use any colors you 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.520
 you have the brownish or more 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.860
 dark 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.930
 I take it with a pen and go 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.020
 to draw a line at the hairline 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.449
 of the upper lashes to crack up 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.740
 this line 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:13.430
 obviously made with eyeshadow then 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.979
 very nuanced to give a little more 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.030
 definition to the eye since not 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:27.740
 I will go to use a pencil or a 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:30.889
 heir then I bring this line 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.840
 I am going to step up slightly 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:38.449
 trick then doing this line 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:42.469
 at this point pencil point 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:46.460
 use this brown that the ebony 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:48.759
 of snow cosmetics and labicum inside 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.759
 eye 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.090
 you can of course also use one 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.620
 pencil 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.570
 if you want black a butter- colored pencil or 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.970
 that at this point mascara and use 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:10.540
 this is the snow eyes 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.200
 rich cosmetics are in the wake 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.200
 superior 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.590
 guys at this point I'm going to apply 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.900
 blush and I apply this so well 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:32.880
 cost that is practically in natural power 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:35.820
 blush the color if it is salmon like 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.970
 you can see a peach color you can 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:42.810
 apply with the skipper brush of f 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:47.600
 this brush here is therefore an obligation 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.600
 to give just a little color to the face 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:58.339
 as for the lips I go 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.449
 first come back with the snow pencil 

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:10.909
 cosmetics and pastel this is the 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:13.479
 whale and then then the lines or 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:13.479
 another 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:30.710
 and smoke from the inside and then beat a 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:34.159
 lipstick always good so this is the 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:37.300
 pin cones that practically this that a 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:37.300
 very natural color 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.699
 girls this is the final trick 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.699
 I hope you enjoyed a big kiss
