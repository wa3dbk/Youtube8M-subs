00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it it wouldn't be viable why wouldn't it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.670 
it it wouldn't be viable why wouldn't it
be<00:01:31.049> viable<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.710> would<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> 17<00:01:32.909> country<00:01:33.680> on

27 European countries I think the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.420 
27 European countries I think the
situation<00:01:39.150> now<00:01:39.780> isn't<00:01:40.229> viable<00:01:40.920> anymore

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
situation now isn't viable anymore

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.910 
situation now isn't viable anymore
why<00:01:42.299> because<00:01:42.899> Belgium<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.439> an<00:01:43.560> artificial

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
why because Belgium is an artificial

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.999 
why because Belgium is an artificial
state<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:45.540> Flemish<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.290> Walloon<00:01:46.590> people

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the political process I mean doesn't

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.190 
the political process I mean doesn't
that<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.390> tell<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.720> something<00:02:16.080> about

that really tell you something about

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.650 
that really tell you something about
Belgian<00:02:16.830> independence<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.090> either<00:02:18.300> your

Belgian independence and either your
calls<00:02:18.990> for<00:02:19.170> Flemish<00:02:19.530> independence<00:02:20.010> well<00:02:20.310> I

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
calls for Flemish independence well I

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.699 
calls for Flemish independence well I
think<00:02:20.520> it's<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.060> best<00:02:21.209> proof<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.750> Belgium

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
think it's the best proof that Belgium

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.150 
think it's the best proof that Belgium
is<00:02:23.280> no<00:02:24.240> democratic<00:02:24.870> country<00:02:25.230> anymore<00:02:25.709> we

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
is no democratic country anymore we

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.190 
is no democratic country anymore we
represent<00:02:26.580> about<00:02:26.670> 20%<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.690> people<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
represent about 20% of the people and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.190 
represent about 20% of the people and
what's<00:02:29.160> more<00:02:29.400> important<00:02:29.940> at<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> moment

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
what's more important at the moment

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.530 
what's more important at the moment
different<00:02:31.200> opinion<00:02:31.890> polls<00:02:32.130> showed<00:02:32.370> that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
different opinion polls showed that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.150 
different opinion polls showed that
almost<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.600> majority<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.830> Flemish

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
almost the majority of the Flemish

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.040 
almost the majority of the Flemish
people<00:02:35.520> are<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.850> favor<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.480> Flemish<00:02:37.020> and

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
people are in favor of Flemish and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.260 
people are in favor of Flemish and
dependency<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:37.890> our<00:02:38.100> solution<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.700> well<00:02:39.120> if

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
dependency so our solution is well if

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.900 
dependency so our solution is well if
the<00:02:39.390> politicians<00:02:39.900> can't<00:02:40.170> decide<00:02:40.560> after<00:02:41.280> 170

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the politicians can't decide after 170

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.080 
the politicians can't decide after 170
