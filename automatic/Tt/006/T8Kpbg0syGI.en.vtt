00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to all these waves and welcome to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.680
 this video presentation of the hull 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.750
 ratchel to buy htc one and tier one 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.120
 so this shell is just 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.650
 spectacular already it's htc who the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.570
 manufactures for the htc one 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 so that's saying she's perfect 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.320
 in we have as to the name of the box 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.529
 question is how do we discover that we have 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.090
 more than one hull protection for 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.119
 protect the htc one 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.490
 we expect more of that a protective film 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.689
 for the screen but not just and who 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.250
 die regrets that the train is over 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.600
 protector that fits perfectly to 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.710
 the screen unlike anything we 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.469
 can find right on the left 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.149
 so this one is delivered in this 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.480
 little pouch with two little ones 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.460
 accessories a little a little wipe 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.940
 to clean his screen siglÃ© htc thank you 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.610
 just thank you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.940
 and on top of that another little one 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.379
 accessory which is a squeegee for 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.640
 scrape actually when you install the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.109
 protection of new forces never 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 does sometimes there are bubbles by his 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.820
 little reminder on which we also find 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.070
 the acronym htc is made to remove these 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.200
 goals then frankly than say htc 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.369
 is doing something about you 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.530
 so with the screen protector that 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.140
 fits perfectly on the screen but the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.090
 more important is this hull 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.610
 this ultra thin shell and very 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.680
 resistant like the power that is a 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.450
 little the target that we can position 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.909
 on the htc hero so first of all I 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.359
 do not know if you see it well you 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.759
 photo and on my blog the site htc on 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.920
 this shell that is not a hole but 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.229
 a difference in color and a hull 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.240
 which is a little bit by opaque badging 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.100
 and that it is transparent the htc 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.859
 so when you install it you have 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.049
 just to the police there like this and to 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.270
 position them we have access to Bhutan 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.810
 power to odja we only have access to Bhutan 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.009
 did not want to micro sd so alain 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.840
 not change every day usually 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.549
 and then she's so easy to put 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.310
 and remove that it's a problem at 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.959
 microphone down to the micro usb to the device 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.090
 flash photo to the other micro that's getting 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.250
 behind while already 7 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.709
 as this shell is very very pretty 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.000
 very fine bank is she finally like 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.159
 you see that does not change the thickness 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.250
 someone from the phone on the front 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.959
 absolutely nothing absolutely nothing is to 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.730
 say that the hull is set back from 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.370
 we will say something like a half 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.019
 mm a friend m so apple she 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.430
 really protects every angle that's 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.200
 true that if you have phone so 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.879
 of face anyway he is screwed to 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.170
 a function no I have already dropped 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.510
 two faces and he survived 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.569
 so he's not fucking screwed up but I had 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.849
 the double dip then that one not protect 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.980
 the front angles but the really 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.340
 finally that I would truly sublime 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.150
 simcock so small so fine and who holds 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.280
 so much of the winners gm 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.660
 general is fantastic so this is the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.130
 presentation of the shell art checks 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.410
 to buy her on a hull that is 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.299
 very resistant and that seems a low 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.739
 price to have the phone well protected 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.720
 with a screen protector 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.769
 which is still a little more then 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.579
