Miami<00:00:48.780> again<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.379> think<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> be

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the schedule a big test right away there

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.389 
the schedule a big test right away there
in<00:02:03.869> week<00:02:04.020> number<00:02:04.170> two<00:02:04.469> against<00:02:04.890> Florida<00:02:05.250> so

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
in week number two against Florida so

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.490 
in week number two against Florida so
how<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.670> they<00:02:05.939> fare<00:02:06.270> will<00:02:06.570> they<00:02:06.689> win<00:02:06.899> more<00:02:07.170> than

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
how do they fare will they win more than

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.199 
how do they fare will they win more than
the<00:02:07.979> seven<00:02:08.280> games<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.610> they<00:02:08.729> want<00:02:08.910> line<00:02:09.060> well

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
the seven games that they want line well

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.430 
the seven games that they want line well
I<00:02:09.239> think<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.629> one<00:02:09.780> more<00:02:09.959> than<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.140> seven

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
I think that one more than the seven

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.600 
I think that one more than the seven
games<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.709> last<00:02:10.830> year<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.099> don't<00:02:11.340> think<00:02:11.520> they

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
games of last year I don't think they

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.340 
games of last year I don't think they
beat<00:02:11.819> Florida<00:02:12.239> but<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> key<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.780> game

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
beat Florida but the key to that game

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.050 
beat Florida but the key to that game
if<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.830> get<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.130> early<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.610> mean<00:02:14.820> floor

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
if they can get up early I mean floor

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.700 
if they can get up early I mean floor
does<00:02:15.210> not<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.660> high<00:02:15.870> octane<00:02:16.230> passing

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
does not have a high octane passing

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.200 
does not have a high octane passing
attack<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.190> they<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.490> somehow<00:02:17.700> make<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
attack if they can somehow make the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.210 
attack if they can somehow make the
Gators<00:02:18.570> try<00:02:18.840> them<00:02:19.020> form<00:02:19.650> some<00:02:19.860> sort<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.130> a

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
Gators try them form some sort of a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.620 
Gators try them form some sort of a
comeback<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.760> keep<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.240> shootout<00:02:21.570> I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
comeback and keep up in a shootout I

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.690 
comeback and keep up in a shootout I
don't<00:02:21.900> think<00:02:22.110> Florida<00:02:22.320> can<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.860> however<00:02:23.220> i

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
don't think Florida can do it however i

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580 
don't think Florida can do it however i
don't<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.390> Miami<00:02:25.050> defense<00:02:25.350> are<00:02:25.500> gonna

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
don't think the Miami defense are gonna

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.810 
don't think the Miami defense are gonna
be<00:02:25.680> able<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.890> hold<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.130> against<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.520> power<00:02:26.700> of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
be able to hold up against the power of

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.730 
be able to hold up against the power of
the<00:02:26.940> Gators<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:27.780> interesting<00:02:28.350> schedule

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740
