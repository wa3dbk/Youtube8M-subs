 expert on companies can province 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.539
 and 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.939
 certify ump negotiation as you 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.680

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.360
 master class city of Moscow in two 1 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.770
 theme 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.989
 The first topic of public exchange for concrete 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.800
 fight will be dedicated to shape and 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.570
 perennial business models second day 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.719
 the gymnasium will be dedicated again and you will 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.309
 as if its duplicate process modeler and 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.020
 answer and very important they complement 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.789
 each other precisely because if you 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.370
 created no competitor for you to watch and 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.810
 and correctly your readak pavilion 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.760
 competitors can take advantage of this 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.320
 the advantage if you didn't get it right 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.880
 penny and let's say and copy you 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.910
 be in this first world you understand 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.300
 If anyone read traut that rules and for 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.190
 this being the first people will be dedicated to it 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.950
 known about the company to market and 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.479
 your particular model 3 will be dedicated 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.329
 negotiations about 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.250
 double spending is not a guarantee that I immediately 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.700
 never gave guarantees for my courses 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.360
 for one simple reason these courses are not 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.460
 for let's say so mean minds 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.740
 these mustaches aren't that simple 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.170
 how many of you know because if 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.750
 want to walk to the bakery find a toilet 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.550
 there you can be brought by the hand if you 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.610
 want to achieve really 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.800
 results that are above average ambitions 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.660
 date of articles in Everest or go to some 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.400
 then a serious peak then guarantees 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.900
 nobody gives yes that is there only 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.920
 guarantees that you can give you 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.990
 with yourself 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.590
 your personal ambitions of exterminating apple trees 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.390
 so your guarantee is in your hands 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.740
 Well, since colleagues are sorry 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.690
 there will be no time and record 2 videos 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.250
 as I fly to Kaliningrad right now 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.850
 trampled there will not be another for refinement 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.229
 production surely saw it right away 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.729
 I will say that March 20 is already in 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.020
 St. Petersburg will take ten days 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.330
 master class in non-competitive business 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.410
 models there it will all be more 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.000
 advanced more let's say working 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.830
 story order well there will be two days 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.380
 dedicated to non-competitive business models 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.540
 and strategies the formation of these models 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.770
 because those are not so little but mine 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.780
 the task is to make each of you 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.250
 kona when working and formed not 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.590
 competitive strategy for your 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.840
 business two days we urinate tightly 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.700
 bringing the company to the market in not 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.410
 competitive non specific strategy 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.970
 the company's entry into the market you have seen 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.070
 how is it done before doing so 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.450
 bring your company to the neighboring market 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.340
 There your company has grown stronger in this 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.230
 have already earned money and thus already 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.459
 are being rivaled probably already more 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.940
 strong companies where you can serve 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.880
 competitors also have to be some 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.829
 time is dedicated to shaping 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.329
 directly against the packages is that 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.730
 you will need to scale too 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.799
 showed how this is done immediately say that 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.049
 these are not farewell packages 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.420
 of that level who saw where 5 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.190
 pages and a miserable likeness of a brand book 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.510
 there will directly be realized burning 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.549
 we just do it 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.010
 this model of speech yes how do we shoot 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.050
 successful strategies let's say your 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.900
 workers 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.450
 this is directly partially plus 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.990
 human imitation machines that i'm into 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.090
 including used for work 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.830
 the formation of other things while there well and very 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.530
 a lot of interesting things like this 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.220
 usually we also dedicate to 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.980
 some time 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.650
 directly there leadership 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.300
 business models yes where directly 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.220
 the man is the leader of his company 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.810
 and you will be the same leader of his 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.580
 companies how to do it right i 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.090
 also I tell you everything is also some 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.010
 strategies 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.320
 but just before the part 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.600
 negotiation which selection is very much 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.950
 will give exactly to work with your 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.540
 team to work with your 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.760
 partners for your company 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.980
 A powerful course is all my knowledge 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.710
 which I know to you for years and with wine 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.480
 block you will have them if you have 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.400
 enough strength ambition moisture aspirations 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.380
 any product is still the same business and 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.440
 the same skills as I have 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.060
 again, I will say what guarantee he does not give 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.100
 because there is a local guarantee 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.840
 do it yourself you just take 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.010
 gives a guarantee to himself 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.890
 we are not managers we are not you 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.019
 what little ambitious people there are more accurate 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.519
 maybe took out an ambitious man yes 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.049
 that is , it is clear that you are waving 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.880
 on serious tops if there is this 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.810
 course a respectively swipe 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.610
 serious top 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.050
 understand that only personal responsible 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.090
 gives you the result and 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.190
 having a personal responsibility there is no 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.169
 no guarantees no one ever give 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.250
 I can never half took guarantees 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.910
 that's why I achieved such 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.130
 results 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.430
 actually if you have many desires and 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.450
 aspirations are the most important ambitions and 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.490
 successful action you will achieve 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.510
 the result will be at the top of the mountain 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.580
 Everest 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.240
 waiting for you at the master classes all good 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.240
 bye everyone
