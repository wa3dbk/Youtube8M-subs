a third person and first person sort of
camera<00:00:18.180> switch<00:00:18.449> almost<00:00:19.289> something<00:00:19.500> that

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
camera switch almost something that

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.450 
camera switch almost something that
you'd<00:00:19.830> find<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:21.859> desi<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.070> stuff<00:00:23.310> like

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
you'd find in like desi and stuff like

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.580 
you'd find in like desi and stuff like
that<00:00:23.699> where<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.750> run<00:00:24.900> around<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.350> a

that where you can run around in a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.529 
that where you can run around in a
first-person<00:00:26.070> mode<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.640> where<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:27.060> shoe<00:00:27.330> or

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to run around and look behind and do all

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
to run around and look behind and do all
that<00:00:31.500> sort<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.040> good<00:00:32.250> stuff<00:00:32.750> now<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.110> is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that sort of good stuff now this is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.540 
that sort of good stuff now this is
going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.530> really<00:00:34.829> basic<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.309> I'm<00:00:35.370> just

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
going to be really basic and I'm just

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.920 
going to be really basic and I'm just
going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.700> use<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> first-person<00:00:36.390> controller

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
going to use a first-person controller

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.950 
going to use a first-person controller
for<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.399> gonna<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.910> simple<00:00:39.329> but

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
for that so it's gonna be simple but

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.690 
for that so it's gonna be simple but
just<00:00:39.989> show<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> basics<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.129> doing<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> so

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
just show you the basics of doing it so

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.030 
just show you the basics of doing it so
you've<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> first-person<00:00:43.110> controller<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you've got a first-person controller and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.160 
you've got a first-person controller and
it'll<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.399> main<00:00:44.760> camera<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
it'll have main camera on it and the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.869 
it'll have main camera on it and the
main<00:00:46.350> camera<00:00:46.590> will<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.730> suggests

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
main camera will just be as it suggests

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.490 
main camera will just be as it suggests
you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> first-person<00:00:48.870> control<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
you know the first-person control of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.830 
you know the first-person control of
will<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.860> know<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.700> could<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.120> some<00:00:51.329> arms<00:00:51.660> or

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
will you know you could see some arms or

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720 
will you know you could see some arms or
whatever<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:53.489> what

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
whatever you going to see there now what

whatever you going to see there now what
I've<00:00:53.850> done<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.480> I've<00:00:54.750> gone<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> game<00:00:55.289> object

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
I've done is I've gone to game object

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.529 
I've done is I've gone to game object
create<00:00:56.160> other<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.270> I'm<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
create other and then I'm going to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.599 
create other and then I'm going to
create<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.050> camera<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> I've<00:00:59.160> created<00:00:59.399> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
create it in a camera and I've created a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.130 
create it in a camera and I've created a
camera<00:00:59.879> and<00:00:59.969> called<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> TP<00:01:00.690> underscore

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
camera and called it TP underscore

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
camera and called it TP underscore
camera<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.590> third-person<00:01:01.980> camera<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.879> I've

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
camera for third-person camera and I've

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.579 
camera for third-person camera and I've
just<00:01:03.239> positioned<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
just positioned it as you can see in the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.520 
just positioned it as you can see in the
preview<00:01:04.979> slightly<00:01:05.939> behind<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:07.080> actual

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
preview slightly behind my actual

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.770 
preview slightly behind my actual
character<00:01:08.130> object<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.420> we'll<00:01:09.570> do

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
character object and then what we'll do

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.810 
character object and then what we'll do
is<00:01:09.810> we'll<00:01:10.229> parent<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.130> first-person

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
is we'll parent it to the first-person

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.359 
is we'll parent it to the first-person
controller<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.170> will<00:01:13.470> always<00:01:13.920> follow<00:01:14.159> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
controller so it will always follow you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.700 
controller so it will always follow you
around<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.570> when<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.869> switch<00:01:16.110> between<00:01:16.290> them

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
around so when we switch between them

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
around so when we switch between them
you<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.490> switch<00:01:17.820> between<00:01:18.000> whatever

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
you know you can switch between whatever

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.730 
you know you can switch between whatever
you<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.960> it'll<00:01:19.110> always<00:01:19.409> follow<00:01:19.590> your

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
you want and it'll always follow your

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.600 
you want and it'll always follow your
pal<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.580> we'll<00:01:20.700> create<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.090> new<00:01:21.119> JavaScript<00:01:22.610> and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
pal so we'll create a new JavaScript and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.420 
pal so we'll create a new JavaScript and
call<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.060> view<00:01:25.020> switch<00:01:25.439> our<00:01:25.799> camera<00:01:26.189> switch

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
call this view switch our camera switch

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.310 
call this view switch our camera switch
or<00:01:26.700> whatever<00:01:27.030> you're<00:01:27.180> gonna<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.900> then

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
or whatever you're gonna have and then

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.940 
or whatever you're gonna have and then
we'll<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:28.979> develop<00:01:30.740> once<00:01:31.740> that's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
we'll all but on one develop once that's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
we'll all but on one develop once that's
open<00:01:32.159> we'll<00:01:32.579> delete<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> two<00:01:33.150> scripts<00:01:33.600> here

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
open we'll delete the two scripts here

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.770 
open we'll delete the two scripts here
and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.560> we'll<00:01:34.710> save<00:01:35.009> variable<00:01:35.549> fps<00:01:36.210> camera

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and then we'll save variable fps camera

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.280 
and then we'll save variable fps camera
as<00:01:37.640> type<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.939> camera<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.049> we'll<00:01:40.170> have

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
as type of camera and then we'll have

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590

then I'll write a start function and

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.480 
then I'll write a start function and
then<00:01:58.079> where<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.290> two<00:01:58.500> curly<00:01:58.860> brackets<00:01:59.280> and

what our boolean set up as then we'll

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.509 
what our boolean set up as then we'll

like two curly brackets and then say
that<00:03:04.879> we'll<00:03:05.720> just<00:03:05.750> take<00:03:06.319> these<00:03:06.680> two<00:03:06.739> lines<00:03:07.670> up

that we'll just take these two lines up

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.520 
that we'll just take these two lines up
here<00:03:08.290> copy<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.560> paste<00:03:09.829> them<00:03:10.010> in<00:03:11.200> let's<00:03:12.200> make

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
here copy and paste them in let's make

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.680 
here copy and paste them in let's make
sure<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.799> organize<00:03:13.190> them<00:03:13.220> properly<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.910> then

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
sure I organize them properly and then

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.319 
sure I organize them properly and then
we'll<00:03:14.840> say<00:03:15.079> 30fps<00:03:16.040> can<00:03:16.459> trump<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.849> camera<00:03:17.180> is

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
we'll say 30fps can trump a camera is

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.160 
we'll say 30fps can trump a camera is
false<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.859> other<00:03:19.010> camera<00:03:19.609> is<00:03:19.819> true<00:03:20.299> and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
false and the other camera is true and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.530 
false and the other camera is true and
then<00:03:21.440> what<00:03:21.650> I'll<00:03:21.769> do<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.220> all<00:03:22.790> right<00:03:22.850> under

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
then what I'll do is all right under

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.920 
then what I'll do is all right under
here<00:03:23.840> else<00:03:24.380> add<00:03:25.310> two<00:03:25.850> curly<00:03:26.150> brackets<00:03:26.420> under

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
here else add two curly brackets under

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.099 
here else add two curly brackets under
there<00:03:27.579> tablet<00:03:28.579> out<00:03:28.609> and<00:03:28.970> I'll<00:03:29.389> copy<00:03:29.630> these<00:03:29.870> two

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
there tablet out and I'll copy these two

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.460 
there tablet out and I'll copy these two
lines<00:03:30.410> again<00:03:30.799> add<00:03:31.489> those<00:03:31.880> in<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.599> just<00:03:33.290> make

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
lines again add those in and just make

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.650 
lines again add those in and just make
sure<00:03:33.500> that's<00:03:33.920> organized<00:03:34.549> there<00:03:34.849> and<00:03:35.420> what

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
sure that's organized there and what

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.430 
sure that's organized there and what
we'll<00:03:35.810> do<00:03:36.019> is<00:03:36.349> we'll<00:03:36.620> change<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:38.440> true

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
we'll do is we'll change that to true

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.819 
we'll do is we'll change that to true
and<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.919> false<00:03:44.169> so<00:03:45.169> we'll<00:03:45.380> save<00:03:45.620> that

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
and this to false so we'll save that

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.259 
and this to false so we'll save that
I'll<00:03:45.889> walk<00:03:46.099> so<00:03:46.310> what<00:03:46.430> we're<00:03:46.579> doing<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:47.000> were

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
I'll walk so what we're doing is were

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.629 
I'll walk so what we're doing is were
saying<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.169> camera<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:49.130> first<00:03:49.340> person

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
saying the camera the first person

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.370 
saying the camera the first person
determines<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:50.120> true<00:03:50.359> as<00:03:50.510> soon<00:03:50.690> as<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:50.959> starts

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
determines to true as soon as it starts

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.599 
determines to true as soon as it starts
if<00:03:51.560> we<00:03:51.680> press<00:03:51.950> C<00:03:52.220> we<00:03:52.819> sit<00:03:53.120> a<00:03:53.269> switch<00:03:54.280> can<00:03:55.280> switch

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
if we press C we sit a switch can switch

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.729 
if we press C we sit a switch can switch
from<00:03:55.639> false<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.329> true<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.720> if<00:03:56.959> it<00:03:57.049> equals<00:03:57.410> true

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
from false to true and if it equals true

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.849 
from false to true and if it equals true
we'll<00:03:58.370> swap<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:58.910> third-person<00:03:59.419> camera

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
we'll swap to the third-person camera

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.870 
we'll swap to the third-person camera
then<00:04:00.859> if<00:04:01.010> we<00:04:01.099> press<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.430> again<00:04:01.669> we'll

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
then if we press it again we'll

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.970 
then if we press it again we'll
obviously<00:04:02.000> be<00:04:02.239> switching<00:04:02.810> what<00:04:03.470> comes<00:04:03.739> which

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
obviously be switching what comes which

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.250 
obviously be switching what comes which
is<00:04:04.130> equal<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.549> true<00:04:04.760> back<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.120> false<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:06.019> if<00:04:06.109> we

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
is equal to true back to false so if we

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.199 
is equal to true back to false so if we
do<00:04:06.440> anything<00:04:06.829> else<00:04:06.980> than<00:04:07.220> true<00:04:07.430> we'll<00:04:07.880> switch
