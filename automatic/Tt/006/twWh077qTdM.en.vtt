audi<00:01:09.510> section<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> creative

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
audi section with the creative

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.160 
audi section with the creative
soundblaster<00:01:11.369> ship<00:01:11.820> set<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.390> us<00:01:12.990> also

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
soundblaster ship set on it and us also

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920 
soundblaster ship set on it and us also
split<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> take<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> look<00:01:14.729> into<00:01:14.930> through

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
split it if you take a look into through

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.480 
split it if you take a look into through
cysts<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.799> audio<00:01:17.070> section<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
cysts you see the audio section is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.770 
cysts you see the audio section is
really<00:01:18.049> split<00:01:19.049> from<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> regular<00:01:20.270> PCB<00:01:21.270> so

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
really split from the regular PCB so

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.420 
really split from the regular PCB so
that<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.080> no<00:01:22.290> interference<00:01:22.740> from<00:01:22.890> from

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that we have no interference from from

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.820 
that we have no interference from from
the<00:01:23.610> electronically<00:01:24.119> sync<00:01:24.390> tues<00:01:24.630> audio<00:01:24.930> very

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the electronically sync tues audio very

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
the electronically sync tues audio very
important<00:01:26.250> also<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.110> OPM

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
important also that we have a OPM

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.080 
important also that we have a OPM
chipset<00:01:28.530> which<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.159> removable<00:01:29.939> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
chipset which is which is removable so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.380 
chipset which is which is removable so
the<00:01:30.479> gamma<00:01:31.020> saves<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.439> chance<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.920> adjust<00:01:32.520> their

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the gamma saves a chance to adjust their

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.890 
the gamma saves a chance to adjust their
own

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
own

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.070 
own
music<00:01:35.860> style<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:36.550> just<00:01:36.910> to<00:01:37.000> remove<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:37.570> in<00:01:37.930> the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
music style so just to remove and in the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.320 
music style so just to remove and in the
box<00:01:38.230> is<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.440> second<00:01:38.920> chipset<00:01:39.220> included<00:01:39.730> so<00:01:40.120> it's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
box is a second chipset included so it's

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.780 
box is a second chipset included so it's
easy<00:01:40.870> to<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.290> better<00:01:41.620> sound<00:01:41.980> and<00:01:42.250> virus<00:01:42.640> on

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
easy to have a better sound and virus on

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.510 
easy to have a better sound and virus on
tour<00:01:43.000> more<00:01:43.180> crystal<00:01:43.540> clear<00:01:43.720> sound<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.520> an

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
tour more crystal clear sound and an

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.040 
tour more crystal clear sound and an
optional<00:01:45.940> kid<00:01:46.090> we<00:01:46.240> have<00:01:46.390> as<00:01:46.510> well<00:01:46.720> where<00:01:47.020> you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
optional kid we have as well where you

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.130 
optional kid we have as well where you
can<00:01:47.290> have<00:01:47.470> three<00:01:48.070> more<00:01:48.400> OPM's<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:49.480> everybody

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
can have three more OPM's so everybody

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.860 
can have three more OPM's so everybody
should<00:01:50.350> find<00:01:50.560> his<00:01:51.040> wave<00:01:51.280> for<00:01:51.850> this<00:01:51.970> nice<00:01:52.420> music

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
should find his wave for this nice music

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.050 
should find his wave for this nice music
you<00:01:53.410> see<00:01:53.560> also<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.920> gold-plated<00:01:54.310> connectors

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
you see also the gold-plated connectors

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.920 
you see also the gold-plated connectors
which<00:01:55.750> gives<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.110> better<00:01:56.640> quality<00:01:57.640> better

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
which gives a better quality better

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.950 
which gives a better quality better
connectivity<00:01:58.930> also<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.630> cables<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.780> to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
connectivity also to the cables and to
