well<00:00:41.770> I<00:00:42.220> love<00:00:42.580> this<00:00:42.760> tool<00:00:43.000> so<00:00:43.450> if<00:00:43.810> we're<00:00:44.350> going

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
well I love this tool so if we're going

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.990 
well I love this tool so if we're going
to<00:00:44.530> first<00:00:44.710> talk<00:00:44.800> about<00:00:44.950> half<00:00:45.670> square

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
to first talk about half square

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.230 
to first talk about half square
triangles<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.720> if<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:47.740> want<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.310> triangle

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
triangles and if you want a triangle

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.860 
triangles and if you want a triangle
square<00:00:49.420> that<00:00:49.720> finishes<00:00:51.000> four<00:00:52.000> inches<00:00:52.630> you

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
square that finishes four inches you

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.210 
square that finishes four inches you
would<00:00:52.930> cut<00:00:53.140> your<00:00:53.230> strip<00:00:53.560> four<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.160> a<00:00:54.190> half

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
would cut your strip four and a half

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.970 
would cut your strip four and a half
inches<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.060> you<00:00:55.180> just<00:00:55.390> add<00:00:55.540> a<00:00:55.570> half<00:00:55.840> inch<00:00:56.110> so<00:00:56.830> we

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
inches so you just add a half inch so we

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.560 
inches so you just add a half inch so we
have<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.130> four<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:57.490> a<00:00:57.550> half<00:00:57.580> inch<00:00:57.880> strip<00:00:58.180> here

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
have a four and a half inch strip here

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.800 
have a four and a half inch strip here
I've<00:00:59.170> straightened<00:00:59.830> up<00:01:00.040> the<00:01:00.250> end<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:01.570> going

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
I've straightened up the end I'm going

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.900 
I've straightened up the end I'm going
to<00:01:02.050> take<00:01:02.320> my<00:01:02.530> half<00:01:02.830> and<00:01:02.980> quarter<00:01:03.100> ruler<00:01:03.670> and

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
to take my half and quarter ruler and

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.779 
to take my half and quarter ruler and
look<00:01:04.750> along<00:01:05.079> the<00:01:05.350> edge<00:01:05.530> here<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.219> I<00:01:06.340> see<00:01:06.609> the

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
look along the edge here and I see the

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:08.940 
look along the edge here and I see the
four<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.179> a<00:01:07.210> half<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.350> I'm<00:01:08.439> going<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.649> put<00:01:08.799> that

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
four and a half so I'm going to put that

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.580 
four and a half so I'm going to put that
right<00:01:09.250> along<00:01:09.549> the<00:01:09.789> bottom<00:01:10.600> edge<00:01:10.929> of<00:01:11.140> my<00:01:11.259> strip

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
right along the bottom edge of my strip

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.639 
right along the bottom edge of my strip
lining<00:01:12.369> up<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:13.240> other<00:01:13.390> edge<00:01:13.780> with<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.439> cut

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
lining up the other edge with the cut

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.029 
lining up the other edge with the cut
edge<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:15.219> I<00:01:15.250> just<00:01:15.520> straightened<00:01:15.939> up<00:01:16.090> and

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
edge that I just straightened up and

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.730 
edge that I just straightened up and
then<00:01:18.039> I'm<00:01:18.130> just<00:01:18.159> going<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:19.210> cut<00:01:20.200> along<00:01:20.439> the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
then I'm just going to cut along the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.399 
then I'm just going to cut along the
angled<00:01:21.249> edge<00:01:21.549> now<00:01:22.390> you'll<00:01:22.600> notice<00:01:22.990> there's<00:01:23.350> a

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
angled edge now you'll notice there's a

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.179 
angled edge now you'll notice there's a
little<00:01:23.649> yellow<00:01:23.950> tip<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:25.119> sticks<00:01:25.570> out<00:01:25.840> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
little yellow tip that sticks out and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.889 
little yellow tip that sticks out and
that<00:01:27.189> should<00:01:27.579> do<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:27.999> it's<00:01:28.539> supposed<00:01:28.810> to

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
that should do that it's supposed to

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.690 
that should do that it's supposed to
hang<00:01:29.079> out<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.229> end<00:01:29.469> so<00:01:29.890> your<00:01:30.130> point<00:01:30.579> is

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
hang out the end so your point is

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.969 
hang out the end so your point is
trimmed<00:01:30.969> off<00:01:31.119> there<00:01:31.359> exactly<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:32.380> directions

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
trimmed off there exactly the directions

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.580 
trimmed off there exactly the directions
on<00:01:33.219> how<00:01:33.249> to<00:01:33.490> calculate<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.359> sizes<00:01:34.869> by<00:01:35.380> using

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
on how to calculate the sizes by using

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.859 
on how to calculate the sizes by using
the<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.280> dots<00:01:36.670> with<00:01:37.060> numbers<00:01:37.509> in<00:01:37.659> them<00:01:37.780> you

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
the the dots with numbers in them you

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.870 
the the dots with numbers in them you
want<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.170> four-inch<00:01:38.499> follow<00:01:38.920> down<00:01:39.249> the<00:01:39.640> row<00:01:39.850> of

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
want to four-inch follow down the row of

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.239 
want to four-inch follow down the row of
dots<00:01:40.359> that<00:01:40.630> says<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.079> 4-inch<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:41.649> it'll<00:01:42.130> tell

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
dots that says to 4-inch and it'll tell

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.580 
dots that says to 4-inch and it'll tell
you<00:01:42.399> exactly<00:01:42.759> how<00:01:42.969> wide<00:01:43.569> to<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.289> four<00:01:44.499> is

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
you exactly how wide to the four is

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.109 
you exactly how wide to the four is
right<00:01:44.740> here<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.219> it<00:01:45.310> says<00:01:45.340> four<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:45.969> a<00:01:45.999> half

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
right here and it says four and a half

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.239 
right here and it says four and a half
for<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.840> strips<00:01:47.229> so<00:01:47.469> now<00:01:47.679> what<00:01:47.889> I've<00:01:48.009> done<00:01:48.039> is

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
for the strips so now what I've done is

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.609 
for the strips so now what I've done is
flip<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.850> ruler<00:01:49.119> around<00:01:49.240> with<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.200> four<00:01:50.499> and

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
flip the ruler around with that four and

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.349 
flip the ruler around with that four and
a<00:01:50.649> half<00:01:50.710> inch<00:01:50.979> line<00:01:51.249> on<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.609> top<00:01:51.850> edge<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.240> the

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
a half inch line on the top edge of the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.739 
a half inch line on the top edge of the
strip<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:54.159> other<00:01:54.310> angled<00:01:55.090> line<00:01:55.299> on<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
strip the other angled line on the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.899 
strip the other angled line on the
angled<00:01:56.109> cut<00:01:56.319> that<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.560> just<00:01:56.889> made<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.459> that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
angled cut that I just made and that

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.179 
angled cut that I just made and that
little<00:01:58.209> triangle<00:01:58.479> of<00:01:58.929> yellow<00:01:59.590> hangs<00:01:59.829> down<00:02:00.039> to

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
little triangle of yellow hangs down to

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.249 
little triangle of yellow hangs down to
the<00:02:00.280> bottom<00:02:00.549> right<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.420> there<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.810> can<00:02:01.840> see

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
the bottom right so there you can see

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.319 
the bottom right so there you can see
now<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.159> would<00:02:03.399> just<00:02:03.579> flip<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.999> ruler<00:02:04.179> around

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
now you would just flip the ruler around

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.599 
now you would just flip the ruler around
and<00:02:04.719> continue<00:02:05.229> like<00:02:05.409> that<00:02:05.469> cutting<00:02:06.159> as<00:02:06.310> many

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
and continue like that cutting as many

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.120 
and continue like that cutting as many
as<00:02:06.819> you<00:02:06.939> want<00:02:06.969> now<00:02:07.719> we<00:02:07.780> have<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> strip<00:02:08.680> folded

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
as you want now we have a strip folded

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.980 
as you want now we have a strip folded
in<00:02:09.250> half<00:02:09.520> so<00:02:09.880> you're<00:02:10.030> getting<00:02:10.330> two<00:02:10.510> at<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.720> time

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
in half so you're getting two at a time

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.280 
in half so you're getting two at a time
you<00:02:11.800> could<00:02:11.980> also<00:02:12.160> if<00:02:13.060> you're<00:02:13.780> making<00:02:13.930> try

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
you could also if you're making try

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.839 
you could also if you're making try
squares<00:02:14.680> put<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> two<00:02:15.189> fabrics<00:02:15.610> right<00:02:15.790> sides

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
squares put the two fabrics right sides

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.550 
squares put the two fabrics right sides
together<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.540> cut<00:02:16.840> them<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.140> then<00:02:17.290> all<00:02:17.439> you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
together and cut them and then all you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.020 
together and cut them and then all you
have<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.709> do<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.010> take<00:02:18.219> them<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.549> right<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.000> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
have to do is take them to right to the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.030 
have to do is take them to right to the
sewing<00:02:19.269> machine<00:02:19.420> instead<00:02:20.290> really<00:02:20.620> yes

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
sewing machine instead really yes

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.399 
sewing machine instead really yes
exactly<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.150> next<00:02:22.450> we're<00:02:22.719> going<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.170> show<00:02:23.349> you

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
exactly so next we're going to show you

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.259 
exactly so next we're going to show you
how<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.620> use<00:02:23.829> this<00:02:23.950> ruler<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.430> cut<00:02:24.459> quarter

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
how to use this ruler to cut quarter

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.770 
how to use this ruler to cut quarter
square<00:02:25.540> triangles<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.939> the<00:02:28.150> there's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
square triangles so this is the there's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.229 
square triangles so this is the there's
two<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.260> get<00:02:29.409> kind<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.859> double<00:02:30.340> value<00:02:31.090> on

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
two you get kind of a double value on

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.759 
two you get kind of a double value on
this<00:02:31.390> ruler<00:02:31.659> because<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.930> shows<00:02:32.109> it<00:02:32.349> has<00:02:32.470> two

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
this ruler because it shows it has two

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.710 
this ruler because it shows it has two
different<00:02:33.040> things<00:02:33.189> on<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:34.120> again<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.599> have

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
different things on it so again we have

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.750 
different things on it so again we have
a<00:02:34.750> four<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> half<00:02:35.230> inch<00:02:35.560> strip<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.579> your

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
a four and a half inch strip so your

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.869 
a four and a half inch strip so your
triangle<00:02:37.180> will<00:02:37.359> finish<00:02:37.569> eight<00:02:37.870> inches<00:02:38.879> so

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
triangle will finish eight inches so

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.509 
triangle will finish eight inches so
we're<00:02:40.359> going<00:02:40.689> to<00:02:40.989> put<00:02:41.680> four<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:42.099> a<00:02:42.129> half<00:02:42.280> inch

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
we're going to put four and a half inch

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.970 
we're going to put four and a half inch
line<00:02:42.959> right<00:02:43.959> across<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.409> bottom<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.859> this

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
line right across the bottom of this

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.300 
line right across the bottom of this
strip<00:02:45.579> and<00:02:46.319> I'm<00:02:47.319> just<00:02:47.530> going<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.680> let<00:02:47.859> the<00:02:47.980> ends

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
strip and I'm just going to let the ends

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.009 
strip and I'm just going to let the ends
hang<00:02:48.549> off<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.560> cut<00:02:50.560> along<00:02:50.829> that<00:02:51.340> angled<00:02:51.760> line

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
hang off and cut along that angled line

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.099 
hang off and cut along that angled line
now<00:02:53.019> on<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.470> one<00:02:53.829> because<00:02:54.639> you<00:02:54.840> need<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.930> cut

now on this one because you need to cut

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.020 
now on this one because you need to cut
on<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.379> left<00:02:56.620> edge<00:02:56.859> you<00:02:57.430> really<00:02:57.730> need<00:02:57.909> to

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
on that left edge you really need to

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.449 
on that left edge you really need to
flip<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:58.720> around<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:59.379> always<00:02:59.590> would<00:02:59.769> prefer

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459

now we'll bring our strip back in and
I'm<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.079> going<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.290> flip<00:03:17.590> my<00:03:17.859> ruler<00:03:18.280> put<00:03:19.090> the

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
I'm just going to flip my ruler put the

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.539 
I'm just going to flip my ruler put the
four<00:03:19.479> and<00:03:19.599> a<00:03:19.629> half<00:03:19.659> inch<00:03:20.139> line<00:03:20.470> along<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.280> top

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
four and a half inch line along the top

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.659 
four and a half inch line along the top
of<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.849> strip<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.919> you'll<00:03:23.919> see<00:03:24.159> again<00:03:24.400> here

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
of the strip and you'll see again here

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.580 
of the strip and you'll see again here
this<00:03:24.849> has<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> little<00:03:25.389> tip<00:03:25.659> that<00:03:25.930> sticks<00:03:26.290> off

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
this has a little tip that sticks off

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.319 
this has a little tip that sticks off
and<00:03:26.949> that's<00:03:27.129> supposed<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.639> be<00:03:27.729> that<00:03:28.000> way<00:03:28.120> it's

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
and that's supposed to be that way it's

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.689 
and that's supposed to be that way it's
about<00:03:28.479> an<00:03:28.569> eighth<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.840> an<00:03:28.959> inch<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:30.370> you're

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
about an eighth of an inch and you're

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.449 
about an eighth of an inch and you're
just<00:03:30.879> going<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.090> cut<00:03:31.299> along<00:03:31.569> there<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.459> then

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
just going to cut along there and then

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.140 
just going to cut along there and then
again<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.209> would<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:34.780> flip<00:03:35.260> my<00:03:35.470> ruler<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.150> I'm

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150
