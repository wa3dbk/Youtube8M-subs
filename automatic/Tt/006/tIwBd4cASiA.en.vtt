 I will tell you about training today 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.020
 I have a lot of questions like these video blogs 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.960
 I will do 2 times a week for this 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.460
 I will answer all the thoughts that today 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.590
 I will not say I will say sure next 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.780
 so why not panic don't pick it up 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.980
 not the same questions i'm telling you 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.480
 I'll tell you today about the training as 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.860
 need to train for osd ethics 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.690
 for symmetry how to build 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.120
 proportional body exists because 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.820
 that a lot of different techniques 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.920
 plans in different approaches different myth of 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.780
 about the training, I will say that the most 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.340
 the main thing in bodybuilding is not the muscles the most 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.869
 main bodybuilding then brains 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.729
 because you need to approach training 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.590
 reasonable to approach training wisely 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.060
 thoughtful need to raise so that 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.770
 happens at every workout you need 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.200
 understand how muscles work 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.850
 in the corners which most include 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.420
 tule another muscle to which you 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.220
 are trying 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.650
 who is trying to isolate because 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.750
 bodybuilding bodybuilding is insulating 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.880
 Sport is not a power sport strength 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.100
 here she is very important on fobbing 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.110
 fundamentally but this is not the key point 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.490
 if you are just starting to fall 3 not 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.180
 train just come in 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.740
 bodybuilding 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.090
 Yes, and in principle, if you are now 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.740
 train trained for a long time 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.690
 need to mainly rely on 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.640
 free weights from the barbell to the dumbbell 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.920
 because they best allow 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.920
 work out the muscles it's more like that 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.369
 natural choose natural angle for 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.500
 myself 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.510
 because in the car we are fixed in 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.280
 free weight simulator 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.869
 play with choose that google which 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.970
 will work for you advise 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.979
 lightweight starts 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.460
 to learn technology to learn 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.619
 breathe correctly learn correctly 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.240
 move the iron correctly 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.780
 train properly 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.090
 to avoid injury you need to learn 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.489
 choose the angle that will work 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.260
 therefore for you I advise starting from the lungs 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.069
 weights with basic exercises of course with 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.319
 deadbolt 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.160
 I advise you to start with squats and press 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.620
 lying down 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.660
 we head over with the wiring from very important 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.960
 this is a basic exercise they will help you 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.380
 develop such can tell about the general 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.210
 power so connect more with your 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.650
 body with your body because 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.080
 the connection between muscles and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.810
 and the mind here is the mind it is the key 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.030
 bodybuilding because all the most so 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.140
 bodybuilding legends talked about this and 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.490
 talked about it he arnold that 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.830
 must be present during 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.660
 training your mind so that if his mind 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.270
 flies some other place he loses 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.740
 pump so always think what is with you 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.180
 going workout always be 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.540
 very attentive focus on 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.240
 focus on each approach 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.610
 exercise on each repetition 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.250
 invest every repetition because 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.840
 this is the only way to progress further 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.390
 push yourself further after exercise 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.340
 further after the pain barrier because 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.780
 only this way you can raise your will 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.930
 only this way you can progress only 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.210
 so you can grow strength approach and and 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.960
 workouts they must be present in 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.970
 bodybuilding 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.780
 probably six to eight 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.190
 weeks in the whole year and again must 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.440
 agree to observe the intensity 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.090
 observe the correct form, you should 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.490
 control weight and not allow weight 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.220
 controlling you downstairs is a lot 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.570
 questions about what deadlift and 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.740
 squats for these exercises waist if 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.390
 crouch super heavy weight and pull 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.630
 also with heavy weight 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.760
 same 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.530
 the waistline will be u spread 700 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.170
 take out a belt or not what if 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.989
 look at all bodybuilders and general 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.850
 lifters silovik which often on 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.280
 competition that lifts in 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.450
 the foundation of all is very bloated 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.000
 the abdominal cavity is very large 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.970
 waist swollen muscles and how that 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.040
 stabilize further stabilize altogether 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.080
 core body 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.330
 so even the belt does not save them if 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.280
 you train with relatively heavy 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.169
 weight which allows you to perform 8 12 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.200
 reps to 7 screams where 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.940
 you work out your muscles well 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.470
 feel a pump then with such exercises 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.600
 need to wear a belt I advise you to wear 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.220
 the belt is always on every workout even 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.650
 if you train your lower leg or biceps then 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.220
 will come into your habit you keep 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.350
 you safety and 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.570
 keep your share can say 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.950
 contracted muscle will not contract 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.170
 you will not increase accordingly 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.630
 I did point it works 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.970
 causes all principle professionals in 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.130
 America and and in principle so old 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.640
 school reception a lot of people 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.130
 for some reason focuses on hover on scales 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.070
 when there is such a point of progress, that is, if 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.810
 I weigh 80 5 tomorrow 97 then I scored 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.220
 a lot of progress I think that yes 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.440
 wrong approach and if you 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.820
 train proportions to aesthetics need 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.890
 take pictures of yourself every two weeks 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.780
 evaluate your progress based on 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.790
 photos of course if you do not invest 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.430
 don't practice cindy wrong 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.440
 eat or do it at 50 percent 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.570
 meaning there's no being photographed on 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.580
 if you lie down a hundred percent each 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.780
 aspect that is your food your 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.270
 workout your rest 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.430
 then you will progress to 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.380
 you can see where you have what 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.270
 lags behind what muscles need to fit 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.010
 very often people who are developed 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.990
 ok hands like to train your hands 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.390
 they focus more on hands since 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.280
 and breasts like that there are 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.990
 I think this trend is what you need 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.970
 to approach oneself consciously 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.400
 recognize yourself as there are weaknesses 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.080
 sacrifice time from the chest or from 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.000
 biceps that you have well developed 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.740
 spend more time over the back 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.710
 delta and either above the shin he either above 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.360
 triceps because we still 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.570
 working on the proportions of working on 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.240
 symmetry and the most important thing is aesthetics 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.790
 they are size so take pictures of yourself 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.520
 evaluate your progress on 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.010
 photos it seems to me so 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.590
 much clearer you can see it better than you 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.510
 symmetry in principle on this all i can 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.950
 I have a lot more to say 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.360
 I want a lot of information very much 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.729
 I will share with you 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.190
 video 5-6 minutes and 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.780
 so that it is very short and clear hope 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.010
 what information did you like that 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.530
 you can apply it 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.390
 what can you succeed what will 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.370
 train wisely not 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.110
 wasting time did not comprehend simply 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.360
 when you come to the hall you will wear 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.100
 belt to take pictures of yourself and you will 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.900
 move farther good 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.680
 see you soon my name is Artem Dolgin 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.680
 until
