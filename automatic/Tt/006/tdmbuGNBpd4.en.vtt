00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
five foot five so it's like probably

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.400 
five foot five so it's like probably
around<00:03:41.490> six<00:03:41.820> feet<00:03:41.940> tall<00:03:42.300> it's<00:03:42.510> huge<00:03:42.990> and<00:03:43.260> he's

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
around six feet tall it's huge and he's

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.180 
around six feet tall it's huge and he's
gonna<00:03:43.590> love<00:03:43.980> it

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
gonna love it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.420 
gonna love it
um<00:03:45.170> I'm<00:03:46.170> just<00:03:46.230> holding<00:03:46.770> off<00:03:46.890> on<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.220> for<00:03:47.400> a

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
um I'm just holding off on it for a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.390 
um I'm just holding off on it for a
little<00:03:47.610> bit<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.270> he<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.780> grow<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.650> get<00:03:49.980> big

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
little bit so he can grow and get big

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.160 
little bit so he can grow and get big
enough<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.940> go<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.240> there<00:03:51.450> cuz<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.750> don't<00:03:51.900> want

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
enough to go in there cuz I don't want

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.800 
enough to go in there cuz I don't want
to<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:53.280> know<00:03:53.310> give<00:03:53.730> him<00:03:53.820> too<00:03:54.300> much<00:03:54.420> room<00:03:54.660> to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
to you know give him too much room to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.480 
to you know give him too much room to
get<00:03:54.900> lost<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.470> or<00:03:55.560> anything<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:56.010> want<00:03:56.190> him<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.370> be

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
get lost in or anything I want him to be

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.550 
get lost in or anything I want him to be
able<00:03:56.550> to<00:03:56.730> find<00:03:56.970> his<00:03:57.120> heat<00:03:57.300> source<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.870> I'm

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
able to find his heat source and I'm

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.590 
able to find his heat source and I'm
probably<00:03:58.800> going<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.280> have<00:03:59.520> one<00:04:00.000> heat<00:04:00.270> source

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
probably going to have one heat source

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.300 
probably going to have one heat source
on<00:04:00.870> each<00:04:01.050> level<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.620> top<00:04:01.830> one's<00:04:02.070> going<00:04:02.280> to

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
on each level and the top one's going to

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.250 
on each level and the top one's going to
be<00:04:02.430> UVB<00:04:02.910> because<00:04:03.240> he'll<00:04:03.570> probably<00:04:03.750> spend<00:04:04.140> most

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
be UVB because he'll probably spend most

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.070 
be UVB because he'll probably spend most
of<00:04:04.470> his<00:04:04.560> time<00:04:04.620> at<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.010> top<00:04:05.160> one<00:04:05.450> but<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.870> is

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
of his time at the top one but that is

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.660 
of his time at the top one but that is
all<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.380> have<00:04:07.530> planned<00:04:07.920> for<00:04:08.100> this<00:04:08.220> cage<00:04:08.460> right

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
all I have planned for this cage right

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.880
