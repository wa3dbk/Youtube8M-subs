in the pink battle with yellow writing
and<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:06.710> pink<00:01:06.980> punch<00:01:07.220> is<00:01:07.520> just<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.060> really<00:01:08.480> pretty

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
and a pink punch is just a really pretty

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.590 
and a pink punch is just a really pretty
pink<00:01:09.140> color<00:01:09.350> I've<00:01:10.040> had<00:01:10.550> this<00:01:10.670> one<00:01:10.880> forever<00:01:11.120> so

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
pink color I've had this one forever so

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.800 
pink color I've had this one forever so
there's<00:01:11.840> barely<00:01:12.200> any<00:01:12.530> left<00:01:12.920> but<00:01:13.330> it's<00:01:14.330> just<00:01:14.720> a

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
there's barely any left but it's just a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.180 
there's barely any left but it's just a
really<00:01:15.050> pretty<00:01:15.440> color<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:15.800> know<00:01:15.980> some<00:01:16.160> people

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
really pretty color I know some people

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.130 
really pretty color I know some people
don't<00:01:16.490> like<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.970> because<00:01:17.090> it's<00:01:17.360> really<00:01:17.720> bright

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
don't like it because it's really bright

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.230 
don't like it because it's really bright
but<00:01:18.710> I<00:01:18.740> think<00:01:18.980> that<00:01:19.040> it's<00:01:19.280> perfect<00:01:19.730> for<00:01:19.790> the

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
but I think that it's perfect for the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.480 
but I think that it's perfect for the
summer<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.930> spring<00:01:21.140> time<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.800> think<00:01:22.010> that<00:01:22.160> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
summer and spring time I think that and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.550 
summer and spring time I think that and
it's<00:01:22.730> a<00:01:22.820> nice<00:01:22.970> pop<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.420> color<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.900> your<00:01:24.320> lips

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
it's a nice pop of color to your lips

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.270 
it's a nice pop of color to your lips
and<00:01:25.300> I<00:01:26.300> think<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.380> these<00:01:27.710> are<00:01:27.980> very

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
and I think that these are very

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.010 
and I think that these are very
moisturizing<00:01:28.550> this<00:01:29.270> one<00:01:29.420> is<00:01:29.540> moisturizing

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
moisturizing this one is moisturizing

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.580 
moisturizing this one is moisturizing
and<00:01:30.320> it's<00:01:30.500> not<00:01:30.890> sure<00:01:31.250> at<00:01:31.400> all<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:32.210> like<00:01:32.510> it<00:01:33.050> when

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
and it's not sure at all it like it when

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.560 
and it's not sure at all it like it when
you<00:01:33.680> put<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:33.980> on<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.310> can<00:01:34.520> see<00:01:34.760> it<00:01:34.880> if<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.360> like

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
you put it on you can see it if you like

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.220 
you put it on you can see it if you like
damn<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:36.020> Alan<00:01:36.230> and<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.470> go<00:01:36.620> home<00:01:36.940> then<00:01:37.940> um<00:01:38.390> you

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
damn it Alan and I go home then um you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.960 
damn it Alan and I go home then um you
won't<00:01:39.740> be<00:01:39.950> able<00:01:40.010> to<00:01:40.220> see<00:01:40.370> it<00:01:40.430> as<00:01:40.520> much<00:01:40.670> as<00:01:40.730> if

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
won't be able to see it as much as if

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.560 
won't be able to see it as much as if
you<00:01:41.090> go<00:01:41.210> like<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:41.900> that<00:01:42.710> but<00:01:43.400> this<00:01:44.330> is

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
you go like that and that but this is

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.560 
you go like that and that but this is
not<00:01:44.780> very<00:01:45.380> sure<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:46.100> mean<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.850> pretty<00:01:47.360> much

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
not very sure I mean it pretty much

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.120 
not very sure I mean it pretty much
comes<00:01:47.810> out<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.140> color<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.590> shows<00:01:48.860> here

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
comes out the color that shows here

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.100 
comes out the color that shows here
might<00:01:49.310> be<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.610> little<00:01:50.000> more<00:01:50.210> sure<00:01:50.450> than<00:01:50.690> this

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
might be a little more sure than this

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.800 
might be a little more sure than this
but<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.830> definitely<00:01:52.070> is<00:01:52.700> like<00:01:53.830> right<00:01:54.830> there<00:01:55.040> um

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
and um I know I don't use it as often as

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.130 
and um I know I don't use it as often as
a<00:02:37.620> couple<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.219> other<00:02:38.340> ones<00:02:38.609> but<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.750> use

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
a couple of the other ones but I do use

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.619 
a couple of the other ones but I do use
this<00:02:40.319> one<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.980> really<00:02:41.280> pretty<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.849> just

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
this one it is really pretty I just

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.759 
this one it is really pretty I just
don't<00:02:43.230> use<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.799> as<00:02:44.129> much<00:02:44.159> um<00:02:45.230> I'd<00:02:46.230> say<00:02:46.530> that

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
don't use it as much um I'd say that

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.050 
don't use it as much um I'd say that
this<00:02:47.159> isn't<00:02:47.760> sure<00:02:48.420> either<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:49.230> mean<00:02:49.859> if<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.790> jab

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
this isn't sure either I mean if you jab

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.890 
this isn't sure either I mean if you jab
down<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.599> going<00:02:51.780> then<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:53.099> um<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:54.720> be

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
down and going then it is um it can be

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.830 
down and going then it is um it can be
sheer<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.909> just<00:02:57.150> depends<00:02:57.569> on<00:02:57.629> how<00:02:57.780> many

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
sheer but it just depends on how many

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.929 
sheer but it just depends on how many
layers<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.409> put<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.859> pretty<00:02:59.069> much<00:02:59.220> for<00:02:59.790> all

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
layers you put on it pretty much for all

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.789 
layers you put on it pretty much for all
of<00:02:59.970> them<00:03:00.389> it<00:03:00.569> depends<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.109> how<00:03:01.290> many<00:03:01.349> layers

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
of them it depends on how many layers

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.619 
of them it depends on how many layers
you<00:03:02.010> put<00:03:02.159> on<00:03:02.310> if<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.519> put<00:03:02.669> one<00:03:02.819> layer<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.480> not

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
you put on if you put one layer it's not

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.080 
you put on if you put one layer it's not
going<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:03.989> too<00:03:04.319> noticeable<00:03:05.129> if<00:03:05.639> you<00:03:05.730> put<00:03:05.909> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
going to be too noticeable if you put a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.119 
going to be too noticeable if you put a
lot<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:06.959> layers<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.530> then<00:03:07.769> you're<00:03:07.950> definitely
