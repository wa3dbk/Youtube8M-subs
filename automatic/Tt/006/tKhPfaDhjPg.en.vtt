00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.590
 portal glass and finger 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.790
 all mobile entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.010
 I finally managed to fix my 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.490
 a tablet that decided that it is no longer 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.980
 bucket 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.960
 and the log and refused to record fights for 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.539
 my reviews but today there was an update 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
 for video capture program and creepy 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.070
 reboot freezes have ended so 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.689
 that hello everyone with you again huvs and we 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.080
 We continue to talk about vale of tanks 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.690
 blitz 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.610
 today the object of our conversation will be 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.820
 American medium tank of the fifth level 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.980
 m4 sherman what good is this unit 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 Well, if you met Sherman in a battle, you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.910
 definitely answer and his 100 five 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.440
 millimeter fugacer capable 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.930
 send to the hangar from one to two 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.829
 shots otherwise m4 is not 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.840
 something special 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.239
 so today we'll mainly talk 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.100
 just about cool sherman gun well 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 background as always will be cutting failures in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.510
 which the candidates were very much so 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 how almost every fight on this tank had 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 beautiful moment where I am very much 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.979
 afflict team enemy Well 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.530
 let's start so obstetrician to have a competitor 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.780
 the fifth level in the face of 4 lashes which 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.600
 it is worth exactly the same tool and therefore 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 to compare 134 and landfill will not mind 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.830
 the fact that thirty-four is perfect 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.420
 another gameplay and they i will tell you soon 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.430
 of time 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 alpha damage 400 high explosive and 300 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.689
 units of cumulative shells is something 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.400
 unique to medium tanks 5 leveled 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.500
 only here is a heavy tank one 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.520
 has a large value of 50 units 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.759
 from his land mine 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.320
 but about him later, be sure to talk 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.540
 m4 sherman is capable of one shot 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 issue a vault ticket to a third 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.369
 worried and if you're lucky even fourth 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.710
 Imagine how much is breaking through. 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.420
 mine will upset your opponent and you 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.189
 meanwhile viciously rubbing big 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 fingers go for the next 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.060
 adversary but that's it 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.979
 armor penetration has its own characteristics and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.570
 they are connected with the mechanic and high-explosive 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.130
 cumulative shells which 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.979
 significantly different from armor-piercing 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.560
 or subcaliber my story about mechanics 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.790
 It will be delayed by 10-15 minutes, no less so 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.920
 what if you're interested in reading 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.349
 in detail about her in the description will be 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.720
 references on the passport 100 5 millimeter 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.300
 M4 cannon has 50 three elements 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.520
 armor penetration with high-explosive shells and 102 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.080
 millimeter cumulative but if a mine 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.520
 will be able to do a little damage when 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.680
 non penetration cumulative shells 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.390
 must be used extremely carefully 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.239
 what you see in the fight after 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.069
 discuss the performance and accuracy 055 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.840
 imposes an aggressive style of play in 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.849
 melee fight because 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.920
 vulnerabilities for land mines can be very 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.410
 difficult especially if the opponent is standing 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.910
 forehead low rate of fire is not 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.160
 a nuisance yes as a big indicator 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.620
 alpha damage and displays the total potential 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.510
 damage per minute to leadership position with 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.400
 Target corners, too, full order 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.810
 Sherman is able to effectively play from 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.730
 its tower which has quite 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.120
 small size and large cannon mask 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.360
 M4 Sherman and there is a top gun 6 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.340
 left logan m1a one which stands on p1 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.500
 heavy on which I recently reviewed 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.959
 but the rate of fire is much 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.730
 below the heavy fellow therefore use 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.800
 seventy six millimeter guns on 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.300
 Sherman due to low dbm and much 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.760
 less pleasure from lack 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.700
 opportunities to give a splash on 450 units with 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.379
 I don't recommend an explosion 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.720
 the remaining indicators sherman they are 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.640
 Outstanding can be noted quite good 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.590
 head-to book at least keyway 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.720
 millimeters thicker armor will be angles 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.730
 tilt are crucial 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.349
 therefore, given armor rates 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.780
 can be called the same 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.640
 but the shaman breaks easily in the NLD and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.230
 so try to hide it behind 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.150
 destroyed by our mine blasters 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.640
 opponents of the board and feed armored 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.739
 better lashes but on that and thanks as 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.510
 says armor thickness is still not 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.489
 enough to repel shells 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.500
 tanks of the third level at right angles 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.489
 try to search for a diamond not much 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.950
 substituting boards 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.930
 the specific speed of almost 15 horses is not 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.700
 allows you to quickly accelerate and climb 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.590
 on a hill last value 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.870
 maximum speed of 48 kilometers 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.209
 chan grabbed is comfortable but from 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.610
 t-34 and the like and if i leave not 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.769
 will turn the hull too 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.680
 the best but the turning of the tower 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.629
 and at all the worst but still it is 37 degrees 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.549
 per second therefore come up and hull 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.290
 problems will never arise 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.480
 you know personally, I canâ€™t wait 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.040
 go to battle and show action 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.260
 ode 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.420
 on the sherman cannon so you move 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.000
 straight to the duct card where me 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.500
 I threw in the top and even before the start of the battle I 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.600
 began to viciously lose his big 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.700
 fingers anticipating delicious buns 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.410
 400 alpha 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.990
 it is useless to drag the tower to the bridge 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.150
 so I am going to my favorite route 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.220
 mine base to a small gorge where 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.710
 and already expect to meet 4 panic from 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.440
 enemy teams if you notice 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.120
 there are 4 heavy tanks in the team therefore 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.370
 cumulative shells needed 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.680
 save and that's not the lashes 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.150
 wait I immediately noted that he was like 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.400
 beginner rides 7 and a half 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.830
 centimeters kai and therefore danger a 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.990
 is not as well as he 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.840
 no desire to come after me for a stone i 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.970
 I decide to grieve T28 first and don't notice 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.610
 that I have loaded cumulative projectile 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.180
 Accuracy 055 does not allow to get with 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.580
 the guard 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.590
 we are not on the Soviet tank yet evil 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.860
 the projectile's low speed played a joke 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.750
 in combination with the correct caviar t28 2 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.300
 cumulative does not penetrate side armor 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.550
 kv-1 and since the tram is already out of 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.550
 lit up, I decide to deal with the keyway 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.100
 after seeing the impending square-1 my decision 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.780
 it becomes clear that the tongue should 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.300
 quickly go to the hangar and not 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.580
 interfere not to destroy the square-1 shoot 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.440
 cumulative for it would not be desirable as well 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.200
 he has only 20 millimeters of armor behind him 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.760
 I charge a mine 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.340
 354 alpha blows him half HP 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.100
 and the second landmine breaks down for 4 in 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.080
 chips the next opponent has good 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.080
 armor therefore shoot bombs 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.970
 useless 1 cumulative goes to the harp and 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.280
 damage they do as she is 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.560
 screen on the way to the tank's main armor 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.330
 the second shot successfully hits the target and 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.630
 increase my chances of surviving this 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.970
 a scrum kv-1 turned to me a diamond and 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.250
 punch it was impossible here I was already 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.680
 hesitated but the commander of whom one did 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.780
 mistake and turned the tank so framed 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.030
 lower angle front tank armor 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.280
 so immediately got the next spank 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.380
 which entered either under the tower either in 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.860
 small pixel of vulnerable frontal part 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.600
 armor 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.850
 A shot of land mines sends 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.720
 the next enemy in the hangar and I'm going to 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:31.360
 searching for new victims further 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:33.670
 and here he is next apt-1 costs a bit 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.360
 at an angle and 1 cumulative flies him 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.160
 taste not ksu 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.500
 while I'm recharging, I'm a little bit 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:48.970
 driving up a square-1 and reducing the angle of entry 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:50.830
 my rounds yet and not of cumulative 2 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.710
 able to penetrate thick armor 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.870
 so I drive up even closer and convince 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.910
 the fact that the master thickness of armor does not have 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.100
 and a hint of red and release 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.220
 third projectile invulnerable whom I am alone and 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.960
 not breaking again if I thought better 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.510
 you could not spend gold 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.490
 shoot heavy bombs but unfortunately 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.530
 for my wallet this thought does not come 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.530
 only three shots after gold 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.230
 the last landmine flies right in garm 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.910
 kv-1 and brings me the third frag and how are you 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.580
 think who will be my next 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:30.580
 the enemy is still visible on the horizon 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.320
 one damn square-1 and tram if by 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.360
 I donâ€™t really want to shoot first 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.170
 since I'm already tired of me 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.270
 alone in this fight 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.120
 but t28 has a weak reservation 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.280
 immediately catches the splash of a high-explosive and goes 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.470
 I only have a battle from the combat 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.200
 one cumulative therefore use it 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.480
 need extreme caution so i
