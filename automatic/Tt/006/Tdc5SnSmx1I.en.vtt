use<00:01:42.820> when<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.120> want<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.360> reset<00:01:43.810> your<00:01:43.990> phone

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
use when you want to reset your phone

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.380 
use when you want to reset your phone
then<00:01:44.770> after<00:01:45.100> this<00:01:45.280> we<00:01:45.520> usually<00:01:45.670> have<00:01:46.060> versions

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
then after this we usually have versions

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.510 
then after this we usually have versions
info<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.260> this<00:01:47.440> tells<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.890> some<00:01:48.160> basic

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
info so this tells you some basic

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.070 
info so this tells you some basic
information<00:01:48.580> about<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.450> phone<00:01:49.660> system

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
information about the phone system

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.110 
information about the phone system
software<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.740> last<00:01:51.340> but<00:01:51.550> not<00:01:51.640> least<00:01:51.850> we<00:01:52.090> have

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
software and last but not least we have

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.390 
software and last but not least we have
reboot<00:01:52.720> so<00:01:52.990> you<00:01:53.050> can<00:01:53.290> reboot<00:01:53.650> your<00:01:53.860> phone<00:01:53.920> and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
reboot so you can reboot your phone and

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.180 
reboot so you can reboot your phone and
you<00:01:55.000> can<00:01:55.030> use<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.690> power<00:01:55.900> button<00:01:56.350> or<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.950> home

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
you can use the power button or the home

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.250 
you can use the power button or the home
button<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.790> enter<00:01:58.180> any<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.480> those<00:01:58.630> options<00:01:58.870> so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
button to enter any of those options so

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.500 
button to enter any of those options so
this<00:01:59.440> depends<00:01:59.830> on<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.100> phone<00:02:00.280> model<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.850> I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
this depends on the phone model and I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.330 
this depends on the phone model and I
have<00:02:01.660> now<00:02:01.840> entered<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.410> individual<00:02:03.070> test

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
have now entered the individual test

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.610 
have now entered the individual test
mode<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.760> this<00:02:03.910> phone<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.420> now<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.140> can<00:02:05.440> use

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
mode of this phone and now you can use

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.680 
mode of this phone and now you can use
the<00:02:05.770> home<00:02:05.920> button<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.400> enter<00:02:07.180> those<00:02:07.300> test

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
the home button to enter those test

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.690 
the home button to enter those test
modes<00:02:07.990> for<00:02:08.289> instance<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.769> LED<00:02:09.129> tests<00:02:09.580> and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
modes for instance the LED tests and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.030 
modes for instance the LED tests and
let's<00:02:10.390> try<00:02:10.719> this<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.109> as<00:02:11.439> you<00:02:11.469> can<00:02:11.620> see<00:02:11.769> the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
let's try this and as you can see the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.309 
let's try this and as you can see the
LED<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.609> the<00:02:12.909> left<00:02:13.090> top<00:02:13.299> corner<00:02:13.329> here<00:02:13.689> flashes

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
LED on the left top corner here flashes

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.120 
LED on the left top corner here flashes
in<00:02:14.439> different<00:02:14.769> color

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
in different color

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.000 
in different color
so<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.760> working<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.470> test<00:02:17.740> mode

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
so it is working and in this test mode

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.890 
so it is working and in this test mode
here<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.580> test<00:02:18.880> out<00:02:19.060> various<00:02:19.090> things<00:02:19.720> of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
here you can test out various things of

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.480 
here you can test out various things of
your<00:02:20.200> phone<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:20.650> they<00:02:20.800> work<00:02:20.980> or<00:02:21.160> if<00:02:21.250> they<00:02:21.370> do

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
your phone if they work or if they do

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.760 
your phone if they work or if they do
not<00:02:21.640> work<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.690> cannot<00:02:23.110> explain<00:02:23.500> what

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
not work and I cannot explain what

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.470 
not work and I cannot explain what
everything<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.340> because<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.940> would<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.210> too

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
everything is because it would be too

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.660 
everything is because it would be too
long<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.960> also<00:02:26.140> sometimes<00:02:26.590> don't<00:02:27.100> know<00:02:27.400> what

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
long and also sometimes don't know what

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.760 
long and also sometimes don't know what
those<00:02:27.880> Chinese<00:02:28.360> things<00:02:28.600> are<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.050> some<00:02:29.500> things

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
those Chinese things are and some things

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.130 
those Chinese things are and some things
are<00:02:29.920> easy<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.370> read<00:02:30.550> like<00:02:30.790> emmc<00:02:31.390> for<00:02:31.780> instance

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
are easy to read like emmc for instance

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.780 
are easy to read like emmc for instance
basically<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.920> tells<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.490> how<00:02:33.640> much

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
basically that tells you how much

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.970 
basically that tells you how much
internal<00:02:34.240> memory<00:02:34.630> your<00:02:34.810> phone<00:02:34.990> has<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.500> those

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
internal memory your phone has and those

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.770 
internal memory your phone has and those
are<00:02:36.100> some<00:02:36.250> other<00:02:36.430> things<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:36.970> just<00:02:37.330> try<00:02:37.600> them

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
are some other things so just try them

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.020 
are some other things so just try them
out<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.930> won't<00:02:38.380> break<00:02:38.650> your<00:02:38.890> phone<00:02:39.130> then<00:02:39.790> here

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
out you won't break your phone then here

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.090 
out you won't break your phone then here
we<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:40.270> test<00:02:40.600> results<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:41.620> shows<00:02:41.890> you

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
we have test results so this shows you

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.430 
we have test results so this shows you
test<00:02:42.520> results<00:02:43.060> if<00:02:43.210> you<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.480> auto<00:02:43.780> test<00:02:44.200> on

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
test results if you have auto test on

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.320 
test results if you have auto test on
your<00:02:44.590> phone<00:02:44.770> if<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.160> have<00:02:45.190> tested<00:02:45.790> stuff<00:02:46.060> and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
your phone if you have tested stuff and

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.140 
your phone if you have tested stuff and
that<00:02:47.020> turns<00:02:47.320> green<00:02:47.710> or<00:02:47.980> red<00:02:48.010> depending<00:02:48.520> if<00:02:49.030> it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
that turns green or red depending if it

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.270 
that turns green or red depending if it
has<00:02:49.330> worked<00:02:49.630> or<00:02:49.780> not<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.800> fourth<00:02:51.070> or

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
has worked or not and the fourth or

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.640 
has worked or not and the fourth or
fifth<00:02:51.310> option<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.210> usually<00:02:52.570> debug<00:02:53.350> test

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
fifth option is usually debug test

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.560 
fifth option is usually debug test
options<00:02:54.130> as<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.400> can<00:02:54.670> see<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.030> has<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.270> little

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
options as you can see it has a little

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.440 
options as you can see it has a little
bit<00:02:55.690> more<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:56.050> those<00:02:56.230> Chinese<00:02:56.560> signs<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.450> here

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
bit more of those Chinese signs and here

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.910 
bit more of those Chinese signs and here
you<00:02:58.540> have<00:02:58.690> test<00:02:59.020> options<00:02:59.440> with<00:02:59.590> debug

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
you have test options with debug

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.590 
you have test options with debug
purposes<00:03:00.490> but<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.910> won't<00:03:01.120> need<00:03:01.300> that

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
purposes but you won't need that

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.260 
purposes but you won't need that
and<00:03:02.230> then<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.710> fifth<00:03:03.040> or<00:03:03.280> sixth<00:03:03.670> option<00:03:04.090> which

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
and then the fifth or sixth option which

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.650 
and then the fifth or sixth option which
has<00:03:04.300> emmc<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.710> line<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.190> wipe<00:03:06.610> emmc<00:03:07.240> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
has emmc in the line is wipe emmc and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.050 
has emmc in the line is wipe emmc and
you<00:03:08.530> use<00:03:08.770> that<00:03:08.950> when<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.250> want<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.490> factory

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
you use that when you want to factory

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.210 
you use that when you want to factory
reset<00:03:10.150> your<00:03:10.630> phone<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.680> will<00:03:11.920> do<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.160> later

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
and then we will see if it has worked

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.220 
and then we will see if it has worked
and<00:03:14.410> here<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.460> seventh<00:03:15.940> or<00:03:16.210> sixth<00:03:16.720> one<00:03:16.930> is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
and here the seventh or sixth one is

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.110 
and here the seventh or sixth one is
version<00:03:17.680> info<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.310> here<00:03:18.490> you<00:03:18.550> can<00:03:18.700> find<00:03:18.940> some
