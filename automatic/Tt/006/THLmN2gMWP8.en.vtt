I don't think it's over for the other
taker<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.290> for<00:00:34.290> him<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> send-off

taker I think for him to have a send-off
for<00:00:35.340> him<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:35.670> leave<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.510> gonna<00:00:36.660> be

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
for him to actually leave it's gonna be

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.900 
for him to actually leave it's gonna be
I<00:00:37.230> think<00:00:37.620> bigger<00:00:37.950> than<00:00:38.190> Ric<00:00:38.340> Flair<00:00:38.550> because<00:00:38.879> I

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
I think bigger than Ric Flair because I

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.490 
I think bigger than Ric Flair because I
think<00:00:39.270> Undertaker<00:00:40.489> not<00:00:41.489> only<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.290> ring

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
think Undertaker not only in the ring

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
think Undertaker not only in the ring
but<00:00:43.680> backstage<00:00:44.160> has<00:00:44.399> made<00:00:44.579> more<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.850> an<00:00:45.000> impact

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
but backstage has made more of an impact

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.510 
but backstage has made more of an impact
on<00:00:45.570> wrestling<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.200> Ric<00:00:46.350> Flair<00:00:46.590> has<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:47.010> the

was such a rookie rookie Cena and now

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.370 
was such a rookie rookie Cena and now
you've<00:02:02.759> seen<00:02:02.969> him<00:02:03.119> grow<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.540> evolve<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.079> he

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you've seen him grow and evolve and he

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.520 
you've seen him grow and evolve and he
is<00:02:04.640> bigger<00:02:05.640> than<00:02:05.880> life<00:02:06.060> now<00:02:06.329> Cena<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.869> like<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
is bigger than life now Cena is like the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.279 
is bigger than life now Cena is like the
Hulk<00:02:07.740> Hogan<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.459> era<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.629> never<00:02:09.840> got

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
Hulk Hogan of this era and we never got

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.559 
Hulk Hogan of this era and we never got
to<00:02:10.530> see<00:02:10.739> Undertaker<00:02:11.430> vs<00:02:11.970> hulk<00:02:12.120> hogan<00:02:12.480> at

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
to see Undertaker vs hulk hogan at

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.680 
to see Undertaker vs hulk hogan at
WrestleMania<00:02:13.110> but

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
WrestleMania but

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.110 
WrestleMania but
we<00:02:14.200> could<00:02:14.530> see<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.070> pretty<00:02:15.580> much<00:02:15.850> through

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
we could see that pretty much through

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.820 
we could see that pretty much through
John<00:02:16.360> Cena<00:02:16.690> him<00:02:17.080> being<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.410> biggest<00:02:17.710> guy<00:02:17.800> in

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
John Cena him being the biggest guy in

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.220 
John Cena him being the biggest guy in
the<00:02:17.920> company<00:02:18.340> um<00:02:18.550> he<00:02:19.540> has<00:02:19.720> nothing<00:02:19.900> else<00:02:20.110> to

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
the company um he has nothing else to

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.960 
the company um he has nothing else to
really<00:02:20.440> prove<00:02:20.740> except<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.430> Undertaker's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
really prove except the Undertaker's

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.640 
really prove except the Undertaker's
streak<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:23.050> think<00:02:23.230> that's<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.440> perfect

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
streak and I think that's the perfect

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.860 
streak and I think that's the perfect
way<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:23.980> Cena<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.490> really<00:02:24.820> lay<00:02:25.510> out<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
way for Cena to really lay out the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.870 
way for Cena to really lay out the
challenge<00:02:26.290> for<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.650> Undertaker<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.820> think

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
challenge for the Undertaker and I think

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.040 
challenge for the Undertaker and I think
that's<00:02:28.120> what<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.270> lot<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.450> people<00:02:28.540> would<00:02:28.900> like

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
that's what a lot of people would like

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.860 
that's what a lot of people would like
to<00:02:29.170> see<00:02:29.320> is<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.590> Cena<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.130> Undertaker<00:02:31.090> just

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
to see is the Cena and Undertaker just

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.590 
to see is the Cena and Undertaker just
to<00:02:32.170> end<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.500> all<00:02:32.850> but<00:02:33.850> I<00:02:33.880> have<00:02:34.000> seen<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.240> beat'em

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
to end it all but I have seen a beat'em

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
put it together but in a way where you

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.820 
put it together but in a way where you
would<00:02:46.270> know<00:02:46.450> an<00:02:46.660> undertaker<00:02:47.110> with<00:02:47.410> somehow

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
would know an undertaker with somehow

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.890 
would know an undertaker with somehow
announce<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.150> know<00:02:49.240> this<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.720> that's

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
announce that you know this is it that's

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.080 
announce that you know this is it that's
it<00:02:50.110> I'm<00:02:50.440> done<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:52.110> yeah<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.850> don't<00:02:55.030> know

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
it I'm done and yeah and I don't know

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.190 
it I'm done and yeah and I don't know
but<00:02:55.270> when<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.570> think<00:02:55.810> about<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.020> it's

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
but when you think about it it's

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.680 
but when you think about it it's
WrestleMania<00:02:56.500> 29<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.070> think<00:02:57.460> he<00:02:58.450> would<00:02:58.600> either

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
WrestleMania 29 I think he would either

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.990 
WrestleMania 29 I think he would either
end<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.140> at<00:02:59.290> like<00:02:59.800> WrestleMania<00:03:00.160> 30<00:03:00.580> like<00:03:00.850> an

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
end it at like WrestleMania 30 like an

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.090 
end it at like WrestleMania 30 like an
even<00:03:01.270> number<00:03:01.600> or<00:03:01.810> history<00:03:02.470> being<00:03:02.740> at<00:03:02.890> an<00:03:02.980> even

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
even number or history being at an even

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.280 
even number or history being at an even
number<00:03:03.580> so<00:03:03.730> obviously<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.600> wasn't<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.960> streak

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
number so obviously it wasn't the streak

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.790 
number so obviously it wasn't the streak
thing<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:05.980> it's<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.310> think<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:07.230> general<00:03:08.230> maybe

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
thing so it's I think it's general maybe

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.250 
thing so it's I think it's general maybe
he'd<00:03:09.010> ended<00:03:09.220> at<00:03:09.370> 30<00:03:09.670> that's<00:03:10.180> really<00:03:10.450> two<00:03:10.990> years

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
he'd ended at 30 that's really two years

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.200 
he'd ended at 30 that's really two years
from<00:03:11.410> now<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.710> kind<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.070> saurian<00:03:12.760> yeah

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
from now is kind of a saurian yeah

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.600 
from now is kind of a saurian yeah
pretty<00:03:13.390> much<00:03:13.800> yeah<00:03:14.800> well<00:03:15.070> I<00:03:15.100> knew<00:03:15.370> that's<00:03:15.460> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
pretty much yeah well I knew that's a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.180 
pretty much yeah well I knew that's a
different<00:03:15.880> video<00:03:16.320> but<00:03:17.320> seeing<00:03:17.770> it<00:03:17.860> for<00:03:18.010> one

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190
