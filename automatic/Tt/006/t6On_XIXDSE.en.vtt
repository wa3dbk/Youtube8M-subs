00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.210
 do not 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.210
 crisis 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.560
 to see - again to schedule another 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.710
 I'm very happy 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.929
 for pretexting 1 900 of vials that have asked me are the first clubs that I 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:23.659
 they ask 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.069
 and good as you see here 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:29.259
 the robson kohat program 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.900
 good this program 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.900
 is to work with 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 this month 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.740
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.740
 this is loading our good let's go for 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.080
 to our preferred browser and 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.970
 our 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.910
 preferred search engine 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.910
 also played in the inmates we will have 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.220
 quito 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.510
 oltra 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.780
 i as always 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.190
 well as almost always the first entry is the official page 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.950
 and from here in 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.460
 We can see 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.700
 cookers 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.210
 here we have the free download and you can buy 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.020
 1 70 dollars 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.340
 good at the moment the two arrested for free 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.680
 that will give us a time 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.320
 from e15 them to another 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.890
 he also has other products like prosoc own floor shows 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.500
 this protocol is more than anything for the normal user for a person who does not 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.570
 have 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.930
 that is not commercial and the rest for giving 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.870
 more than anything for anything commercial that needs the inkwell to go up and 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.240
 now a thing like that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
 in sewers this program is the calls and has made you are 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.270
 with photos and the Pyrenees and so 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.050
 you can pass not like your own 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.700
 your own mix 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 with sounds or with a musician anything 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.770
 and one thing that is to say boast of units this summer 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.319
 believe 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.739
 to leave Mubarak Alaa 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.189
 for each product be for 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.269
 for others a goal to protect and promote 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.139
 and good if he wins Iraqi 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:28.219
 you can see for these days that is the demo are pretty well done and 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.419
 basically present what you can do 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.439
 each product 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.549
 most important death for us is the discharge so we are here 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:42.059
 we puncture broken tendon that we the brazen thing and here we unload it 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.829
 I will see excavated 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.979
 peer then nothing I will not click 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.149
 Once downloaded, we give it to you 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.189
 they have shown him 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.049
 to install it 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.639
 is already installed 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.749
 they have given us something like that 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.889
 so I'm going to double-click 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.889
 israel protocol 4 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.929
 good that we have a first selection that we were told in it in the pp 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.239
 a file has already perceived 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.060
 there was a blank file 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.030
 in potosÃ­ nothing for us to prepare everything 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.319
 or if we already have some file done 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.359
 in some it has been done that we have done is not what we want to open 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:29.519
 me for the moment the trajectory 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.399
 percent 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.029
 now that you can 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.919
 good to add videos 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.019
 if you want protested court costa takes advantage but entered by tevez 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.419
 what it is 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.619
 it was the program itself 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.690
 One drawback that this program has is that it is in English 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.929
 not everyone 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:52.709
 9 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.509
 so much English 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:59.089
 but hey it's pretty easy to use siave I used already for example things 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.979
 like the muvim and that the gafi 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:05.089
 it's quite intuitive most things work by the way 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:06.589
 drag 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:11.709
 basically kopecek a picture the harrows some orchards to her and this one 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.319
 and good 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.069
 as discussed before 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.669
 that at least the time we do stay in the e15-day trial version 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.949
 but then as there are out there 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.980
 on the internet or telephone another mess because I did not want to but it gave me 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.830
 so long 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.749
 lazaro minka other video 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.659
 between that you can download 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.370
 certain programs for 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.740
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.740
 so that the trial version becomes a depression 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.219
 durable 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.339
 for the fact there is a test version expressed that only this version 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:51.330
 complete but that stops us from using 15 days 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.610
 so 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.539
 I 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.159
 petrova of the file that stalin that has given in that other video that went to 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.659
 inside 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.960
 and of course the antivirus and it seems that it has no address on the bass and has 

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:05.779
 worked perfectly so 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.360
 try it 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.159
 nothing if those tutorial gifts 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.129
 comment 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:14.590
 and subscribe 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.870
