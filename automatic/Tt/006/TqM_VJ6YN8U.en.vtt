00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
philosophy is that you don't you don't

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.660 
philosophy is that you don't you don't
build<00:01:36.409> if<00:01:36.620> you<00:01:36.740> don't<00:01:36.920> have<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.159> money<00:01:37.370> to<00:01:37.490> pay

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
build if you don't have the money to pay

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.110 
build if you don't have the money to pay
for<00:01:37.729> it

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
for it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.880 
for it
so<00:01:38.299> everything<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:38.870> we<00:01:39.170> have<00:01:39.350> here<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.620> paid

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
so everything that we have here is paid

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.860 
so everything that we have here is paid
for<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.460> we<00:01:40.520> didn't<00:01:40.850> build<00:01:41.060> until<00:01:41.390> we<00:01:41.540> had<00:01:41.720> the

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
for and we didn't build until we had the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.420 
for and we didn't build until we had the
money<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.170> pay<00:01:42.290> for<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:43.570> with<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.770> amount<00:01:46.280> of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
money to pay for it with the amount of

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.880 
money to pay for it with the amount of
tax<00:01:46.880> value<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.630> we<00:01:47.810> have<00:01:48.049> here<00:01:48.260> in<00:01:48.409> Mumford<00:01:48.770> I

tax value that we have here in Mumford I

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.160 
tax value that we have here in Mumford I
see<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.700> bond<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.240> she<00:01:50.450> just<00:01:50.659> really<00:01:50.930> wouldn't

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
see a bond is she just really wouldn't

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.070 
see a bond is she just really wouldn't
do<00:01:51.350> us<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.830> lot<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.369> good<00:01:52.640> we<00:01:53.600> couldn't<00:01:53.900> generate

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
do us a lot of good we couldn't generate

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.260 
do us a lot of good we couldn't generate
enough<00:01:54.560> money<00:01:54.770> for<00:01:55.159> a<00:01:55.220> bond<00:01:55.490> issue<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.000> we<00:01:56.119> have

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
enough money for a bond issue so we have

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.180 
enough money for a bond issue so we have
to<00:01:56.420> save<00:01:56.659> our<00:01:56.869> money<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.260> ever<00:01:57.440> as<00:01:57.740> we<00:01:57.770> save

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
to save our money and ever as we save

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.310 
to save our money and ever as we save
and<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:59.420> we<00:01:59.600> can<00:01:59.780> build<00:01:59.930> them

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
and then we can build them

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.080 
and then we can build them
you<00:02:00.440> figure<00:02:00.770> Mumford<00:02:01.190> would<00:02:01.369> have<00:02:01.549> nothing

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
you figure Mumford would have nothing

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
contributed a lot of the savings to the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.770 
contributed a lot of the savings to the
fact<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.150> don't<00:02:50.270> have<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> lot<00:02:50.660> of

necessarily have to be maybe you know
within<00:04:05.329> school<00:04:05.780> but<00:04:06.140> we<00:04:06.379> do<00:04:06.739> get<00:04:06.890> what<00:04:07.040> we<00:04:07.129> need

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
within school but we do get what we need

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.789 
within school but we do get what we need
so<00:04:07.760> that's<00:04:08.030> very<00:04:08.239> surprising<00:04:08.480> why<00:04:09.319> is<00:04:09.379> mom

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
so that's very surprising why is mom

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.920 
so that's very surprising why is mom
foreign<00:04:10.069> able<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.579> get<00:04:11.090> better<00:04:11.269> results<00:04:11.480> with

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
foreign able to get better results with

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.170 
foreign able to get better results with
less<00:04:12.530> money<00:04:12.829> I<00:04:13.069> think<00:04:13.220> as<00:04:13.459> they<00:04:13.579> give<00:04:13.819> their

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
less money I think as they give their

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.439 
less money I think as they give their
teachers<00:04:14.689> more<00:04:14.989> freedom<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:16.190> actually<00:04:17.030> be

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
teachers more freedom to actually be

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.699 
teachers more freedom to actually be
teachers<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.199> teach<00:04:18.470> instead<00:04:19.070> of<00:04:19.310> putting

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
teachers and teach instead of putting

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.430 
teachers and teach instead of putting
specific<00:04:22.510> constraints<00:04:23.510> on<00:04:23.660> them<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:24.080> you

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
specific constraints on them that you

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.689 
specific constraints on them that you
have<00:04:24.650> everyone<00:04:25.100> has<00:04:25.280> different<00:04:25.430> like

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
have everyone has different like

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.760 
have everyone has different like
teaching<00:04:26.060> styles<00:04:26.479> and<00:04:26.660> so<00:04:26.780> what<00:04:26.990> might<00:04:27.440> work

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
teaching styles and so what might work

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.159 
teaching styles and so what might work
for<00:04:27.800> one<00:04:28.160> person<00:04:28.370> or<00:04:29.210> one<00:04:29.479> group<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.810> kids<00:04:29.870> is

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
for one person or one group of kids is

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.689 
for one person or one group of kids is
not<00:04:30.350> necessarily<00:04:30.919> always<00:04:31.070> going<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.460> be<00:04:31.610> the

not necessarily always going to be the

not necessarily always going to be the
same<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.270> there's<00:04:32.449> a<00:04:32.510> lot<00:04:32.840> more<00:04:33.220> freedom<00:04:34.220> I

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.960 
same and so there's a lot more freedom I
feel<00:04:34.669> like<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.979> make<00:04:36.979> those<00:04:37.190> adjustments<00:04:37.340> to

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
system and I think that that we're

surviving<00:05:23.810> here<00:05:23.960> simply<00:05:24.440> a<00:05:24.590> month<00:05:25.280> will<00:05:25.400> exist

a<00:05:58.789> little<00:05:59.090> more<00:05:59.210> competition<00:05:59.960> and<00:06:00.050> there's

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
a little more competition and there's

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.379 
a little more competition and there's
nothing<00:06:00.500> wrong<00:06:00.710> with<00:06:00.979> that<00:06:01.190> undoubtedly<00:06:02.090> the

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
nothing wrong with that undoubtedly the
