00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.400 
texture in the hair is by point cutting
with<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.960> pair<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.500> shooter<00:00:18.260> one<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.350> the

with a pair of shooter one of the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
easiest ways to create texture in the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.330 
easiest ways to create texture in the
hair<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.600> by<00:00:21.720> point<00:00:22.199> cutting<00:00:22.439> using<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.010> regular

hair is by point cutting using a regular
pair<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.699> shears<00:00:24.470> by<00:00:25.470> doing<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.890> will

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
pair of shears by doing this will

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.550 
pair of shears by doing this will
actually<00:00:26.400> use<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.180> vertical<00:00:27.720> type<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.140> section

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
actually use a vertical type of section

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.620 
actually use a vertical type of section
because<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> vertical<00:00:29.880> section<00:00:30.090> creates

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
because the vertical section creates

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.020 
because the vertical section creates
elongation<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:32.040> don't<00:00:32.219> necessarily<00:00:32.399> want<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
elongation we don't necessarily want to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.990 
elongation we don't necessarily want to
create<00:00:33.270> any<00:00:33.540> more<00:00:33.809> weight<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> hair<00:00:35.489> we

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
create any more weight in the hair we

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.840 
create any more weight in the hair we
just<00:00:36.030> want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> create<00:00:36.809> simple<00:00:37.170> easy<00:00:37.850> very

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
just want to create simple easy very

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.380 
just want to create simple easy very
very<00:00:38.969> soft<00:00:39.510> layers<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.860> we'll<00:00:41.040> use<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.550> vertical

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
very soft layers so we'll use a vertical

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.110 
very soft layers so we'll use a vertical
type<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.020> section<00:00:43.440> holding<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> section<00:00:44.940> out

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
type of section holding the section out

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.299 
type of section holding the section out
and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:45.809> fanning<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> hair<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.100> our

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and then fanning the hair out with our

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
and then fanning the hair out with our
fingers<00:00:47.760> by<00:00:47.940> rounding<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.950> now<00:00:49.950> I'll

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
fingers by rounding them out now I'll

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.049 
fingers by rounding them out now I'll
use<00:00:50.160> my<00:00:50.550> shears<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.660> come<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.410> point<00:00:52.829> cut

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
use my shears to come in and point cut

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.630 
use my shears to come in and point cut
be<00:00:54.059> careful<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.809> close<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:56.010> into

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
be careful not to close on the way into

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
be careful not to close on the way into
the<00:00:56.760> fingers<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.510> may<00:00:57.809> cut<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.170> finger

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the fingers as you may cut your finger

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.240 
the fingers as you may cut your finger
what<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.520> want<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.850> do<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.210> actually<00:01:01.039> place<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
what we want to do is actually place the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.429 
what we want to do is actually place the
shears<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.420> cut<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.960> we're<00:01:04.229> coming

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
shears in and then cut as we're coming

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.429 
shears in and then cut as we're coming
out

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.710 

so<00:01:10.439> we'll<00:01:10.619> fan<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> hair<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:14.450> again<00:01:15.450> I'm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
so we'll fan the hair out again I'm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.469 
so we'll fan the hair out again I'm
cutting<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.350> my<00:01:16.530> way<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:23.180> just<00:01:24.180> working

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
cutting on my way out and just working

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
cutting on my way out and just working
around<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:27.210> hair<00:01:27.799> that<00:01:28.799> I've<00:01:28.950> pulled<00:01:29.189> out

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
around the hair that I've pulled out

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.780 
around the hair that I've pulled out
that<00:01:30.150> creates<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.659> nice<00:01:30.900> soft<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.549> see

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that creates a nice soft but you can see

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.719 
that creates a nice soft but you can see
the<00:01:32.939> layers<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.420> I've<00:01:33.570> created<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> hair

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
the layers that I've created in the hair

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.730 
the layers that I've created in the hair
but<00:01:35.729> by<00:01:36.060> doing<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.630> fanning<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
but by doing that and fanning it out it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
but by doing that and fanning it out it
actually<00:01:38.130> creates<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.610> nice<00:01:38.820> soft<00:01:39.240> effect

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
actually creates a nice soft effect

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.080 
actually creates a nice soft effect
rather<00:01:40.259> than<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> heart<00:01:40.950> effect<00:01:41.340> where<00:01:41.909> we'll

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
rather than a heart effect where we'll

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
rather than a heart effect where we'll
get<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.720> cut<00:01:42.960> layers<00:01:43.259> into<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> hair

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
get when we cut layers into the hair

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.520 
get when we cut layers into the hair
that<00:01:44.399> look<00:01:44.640> more<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:44.909> steps<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.170> very

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that look more like steps this is very

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.969 
that look more like steps this is very
soft<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.420> just<00:01:48.420> tends<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> blend<00:01:49.380> into<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
soft and just tends to blend into the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.819 
soft and just tends to blend into the
hair<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> really<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> layers

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
hair so as not to really see the layers

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.490 
hair so as not to really see the layers
but<00:01:53.460> once<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:53.880> push<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.570> hair<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.990> we'll<00:01:55.380> be

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
but once we push the hair up we'll be

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.280 
but once we push the hair up we'll be
able<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.799> see<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> them<00:01:56.689> as<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:58.079> lay

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
able to see more of them as they lay

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.100 
able to see more of them as they lay
softer<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.219> tends<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> tends<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.869> melt

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
softer and it tends to tends to melt

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:48.290 
softer and it tends to tends to melt
into<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.710> hair

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.880 

we<00:02:49.300> still<00:02:49.540> maintain<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.140> length<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> hair

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
we still maintain the length of the hair

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.220 
we still maintain the length of the hair
but<00:02:51.310> now<00:02:51.460> we've<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:51.670> added<00:02:52.090> some<00:02:52.480> nice<00:02:52.660> very

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
but now we've just added some nice very

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.590 
but now we've just added some nice very
very<00:02:53.440> soft<00:02:53.770> layering<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.700> hair<00:02:54.910> that

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
very soft layering to the hair that

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.850 
very soft layering to the hair that
gives<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.930> hair<00:02:56.140> an<00:02:56.710> extra<00:02:57.160> bit<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.340> movement
