00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello guys, I want to start this video 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.099
 with quite unpleasant for many news 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.530
 the era of the discs is finally over 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.990
 the fact that buyers of mgs 5 drives for pc 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.059
 sticking it into the drive of your computer 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 saw that the disc is recorded only 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.369
 9 Mb Steam Installer More 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 there is nothing on the disk that is now if 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.720
 you buy some novelty for entered 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.170
 yet on physical media inside you 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.660
 will see 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.510
 lawsuit with the installer Steam and paper with 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.579
 key to activate the same mgs5 and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.010
 it turns out that the sense of the disks themselves 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.680
 completely lost everything is now needed 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.450
 will constantly download from the network 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.760
 and yes most likely near future 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.590
 disks will disappear altogether and on the shelves 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.719
 stores will stand let's say stiu 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.000
 beeches because many people like to buy 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.160
 physical media and stuck bukaf a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.780
 inside there will be a normal piece of paper 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.120
 with a key written on it for 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.250
 activate your novelty steamer and this 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 most likely will touch and console but about 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.829
 a little later but why 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.140
 made 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.149
 and why drives as such dpk more 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.909
 will not let us remember the situation 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.610
 let's say from gta 5 to pc and where is included 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.189
 They gave 7 9 disks and all of them 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.140
 it was written in parts by gta 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.270
 it's not particularly profitable for publishers. 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.540
 because in any case 9 drives something 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.250
 worth plus you need a lot of money to 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.619
 print to burn to these discs 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.869
 files on it all takes a lot of time and 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.939
 it all costs a lot of money and quite 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.549
 logical and the creators will refuse to print 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.070
 disks they will be able to reduce prices and for y 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.570
 It will be a big plus for us 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.520
 The situation is only on PK 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.710
 and the most important thing in this news is how 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.049
 pros and cons pros are quite 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.600
 logical and lower prices for all sorts of new items 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.970
 let's say mgs5 at current prices for now 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 is really cheap for steelbook and 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.500
 key you need to give only a thousand 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.420
 minus three hundred but in this, too, there is still 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.970
 not many have fast internet 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.340
 to download 60 gigabyte estima 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.799
 I will say for myself I do not buy discs already 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.420
 a very long time and as long as and to the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.909
 console and two years of use 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.380
 consoles new generation i never 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.580
 bought a single physical 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.890
 carrier 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.200
 and I buy everything exactly in a figure for me personally 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.500
 so much more convenient therefore the era of disks 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.610
 ends and soon their fate awaits 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.190
 videotapes which also in due time 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.290
 were at their peak they used absolutely 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.900
 all and yes guys I want to remind you that already 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.390
 rumors of playstation 4 have been around for over a year 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.250
 slim and in the new model of the console will not be 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.470
 drive and due to which it will be possible 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.350
 save on the cost of the console itself 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.870
 and reduce its size and it turns out that 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.430
 drives on until we no longer have 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.100
 activation keys only 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.260
 and with the release of the new model ps4 slim into it 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.700
 you canâ€™t insert discs at all 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.220
 we will download all the news 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.780
 It is from psn, but this is the future of us 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.360
 waiting for the guys thank you so much 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.360
 watched this video all good luck and bye
