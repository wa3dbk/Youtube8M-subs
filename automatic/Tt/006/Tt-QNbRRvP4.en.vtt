00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
little kind of spanish-style beginning

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.150 
little kind of spanish-style beginning
and<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.630> finger<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.439> fingering<00:00:17.890> is<00:00:17.949> very

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
and the finger the fingering is very

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.829 
and the finger the fingering is very
easy<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.609> picking<00:00:18.970> is<00:00:19.089> what<00:00:19.300> you<00:00:19.449> have<00:00:19.630> to<00:00:19.720> get

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:19.839 
easy the picking is what you have to get

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:24.529 
easy the picking is what you have to get
down<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:22.060> more<00:00:22.449> of<00:00:22.539> a<00:00:22.630> rhythm<00:00:23.289> rhythm<00:00:23.949> thing

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
down is more of a rhythm rhythm thing

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.440 
down is more of a rhythm rhythm thing
but<00:00:25.539> the<00:00:25.689> pattern<00:00:26.499> is<00:00:26.679> very<00:00:26.769> easy<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:34.300> you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
but the pattern is very easy then you

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.090 
but the pattern is very easy then you
can<00:00:34.630> you<00:00:34.870> can<00:00:35.050> move<00:00:35.260> around<00:00:35.440> these<00:00:35.890> notes<00:00:41.100> now

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
can you can move around these notes now

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.280 
can you can move around these notes now
what<00:00:42.310> makes<00:00:42.520> us<00:00:42.760> complicated<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.870> I'm<00:00:44.110> using

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
what makes us complicated is I'm using

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.260 
what makes us complicated is I'm using
my<00:00:44.740> finger<00:00:45.220> my<00:00:45.820> thumb<00:00:46.090> on<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:48.100> D<00:00:48.340> my<00:00:49.000> first

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
my finger my thumb on the D my first

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.240 
my finger my thumb on the D my first
finger<00:00:49.540> on<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.750> B<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.080> my<00:00:50.620> second<00:00:51.010> finger<00:00:51.130> on

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
finger on the B and my second finger on

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.700 
finger on the B and my second finger on
the<00:00:51.370> E<00:00:51.670> so<00:00:52.270> we're<00:00:52.480> skipping<00:00:52.720> our<00:00:53.020> g<00:00:53.290> string<00:00:53.320> all

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
the E so we're skipping our g string all

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.619 
the E so we're skipping our g string all
together

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.540 

so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:29.420 

that's<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:07.210> pattern<00:01:07.420> I'll<00:01:07.750> play<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.960> verse

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.490 

if<00:01:29.760> you<00:01:29.940> just<00:01:30.120> move<00:01:30.330> around<00:01:30.540> those<00:01:30.870> notes<00:01:31.230> but

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
if you just move around those notes but

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800 
if you just move around those notes but
you<00:01:31.620> have<00:01:31.800> to<00:01:31.920> keep<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.280> room<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.510> now<00:01:33.660> I'm

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you have to keep that room and now I'm

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.150 
you have to keep that room and now I'm
keeping<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.350> rhythm<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.710> know<00:01:34.860> you're

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
keeping that rhythm you know you're

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.610 
keeping that rhythm you know you're
going<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:36.150> minute<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.080> keeping<00:01:37.230> I

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
going in a minute but I'm keeping I

00:01:37.620 --> 00:02:02.950 
going in a minute but I'm keeping I
mostly<00:01:38.370> keep<00:01:38.610> my<00:01:38.880> my<00:01:39.540> rhythm<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:39.990> my<00:01:40.140> thumb

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.210 

so<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.230> do<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.860> kind<00:02:05.160> of

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
so you can do that like that kind of

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.540 
so you can do that like that kind of
thing<00:02:05.370> just<00:02:06.470> wherever<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.680> want<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.429> I'm

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
thing just wherever you want then I'm

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.020 
thing just wherever you want then I'm
doing<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:12.800> it's<00:02:13.800> kind<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.310> Spanish<00:02:14.820> style

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
doing this it's kind of a Spanish style

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.100 
doing this it's kind of a Spanish style
like<00:02:15.390> I'm<00:02:15.600> starting<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> e<00:02:17.780> going<00:02:18.780> e

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
like I'm starting on the e going e
