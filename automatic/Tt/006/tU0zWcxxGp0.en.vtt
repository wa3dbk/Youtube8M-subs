tues campaign now the locusts are back
and<00:00:22.040> they're<00:00:22.580> meaner<00:00:22.820> than<00:00:22.910> ever<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:23.509> they've

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
and they're meaner than ever and they've

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.269 
and they're meaner than ever and they've
brought<00:00:24.290> with<00:00:24.439> them<00:00:24.470> a<00:00:24.619> force<00:00:24.890> that<00:00:25.099> can

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
brought with them a force that can

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.100 
brought with them a force that can
essentially<00:00:25.610> sink<00:00:26.029> entire<00:00:26.450> cities<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:27.020> it's

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
essentially sink entire cities and it's

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.080 
essentially sink entire cities and it's
not<00:00:27.259> just<00:00:27.739> a<00:00:27.890> little<00:00:28.099> emergence<00:00:28.520> hole<00:00:28.730> it's<00:00:28.970> an

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
not just a little emergence hole it's an

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.089 
not just a little emergence hole it's an
entire<00:00:29.360> city<00:00:29.660> going<00:00:29.869> down<00:00:30.110> at<00:00:30.259> once<00:00:30.470> so

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
entire city going down at once so

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.130 
entire city going down at once so
humanity's<00:00:31.640> back<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.059> against<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.419> wall<00:00:32.509> and

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
humanity's back is against the wall and

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.510 
humanity's back is against the wall and
we<00:00:33.260> need<00:00:33.380> to<00:00:33.440> strike<00:00:33.770> back<00:00:33.980> against<00:00:34.399> these

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
guys so the way that we do that is by

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.530 
guys so the way that we do that is by

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.299 
to depths of the underground and they
fight<00:00:47.210> back<00:00:47.420> against<00:00:47.809> these<00:00:47.929> bad<00:00:48.109> guys<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.100> the
