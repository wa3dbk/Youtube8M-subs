we were demonstrating the use of uh of a
the<00:00:57.150> guitar<00:00:57.629> bug<00:00:57.840> which<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> very<00:00:59.040> compact

the guitar bug which is a very compact

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880 
the guitar bug which is a very compact
wireless<00:01:00.329> system<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.020> will<00:01:01.410> transmit<00:01:01.739> to

wireless system that will transmit to
one<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> these<00:01:02.489> receivers<00:01:03.030> over<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
one of these receivers over here this is

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.050 
one of these receivers over here this is
something<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.890> embraced<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.940> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
something that we have embraced with the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.290 
something that we have embraced with the
group<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:06.479> also<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> way<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.650> reducing<00:01:08.300> the

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
group now also as a way of reducing the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.930 
group now also as a way of reducing the
use<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.660> many<00:01:10.009> channels<00:01:11.009> so<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.759> actually

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
use of many channels so we can actually

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.620 
use of many channels so we can actually
plug<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:13.020> walkaround<00:01:13.890> stage<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.700> find<00:01:15.479> an

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
plug this walkaround stage and find an

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.260 
plug this walkaround stage and find an
instrument<00:01:15.930> plug<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.090> it'll<00:01:18.090> come

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
instrument plug in and it'll come

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.900 
instrument plug in and it'll come
through<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.740> system<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.340> saves<00:01:20.729> our

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
through this the system this saves our

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.330 
through this the system this saves our
