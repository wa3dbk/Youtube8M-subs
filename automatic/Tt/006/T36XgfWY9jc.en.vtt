00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
comparison with the two ball many bikes

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.010 
comparison with the two ball many bikes
are<00:00:09.740> both<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.100> same<00:00:10.280> except<00:00:10.790> for<00:00:10.820> this<00:00:11.780> one's

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.020 
are both the same except for this one's

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.799 
are both the same except for this one's
mine<00:00:12.350> it<00:00:12.680> has<00:00:13.580> like<00:00:13.910> it's<00:00:14.119> all<00:00:14.299> completely

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
mine it has like it's all completely

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.200 
mine it has like it's all completely
stock<00:00:15.379> except<00:00:15.859> for<00:00:16.039> in<00:00:16.160> my<00:00:16.279> previous<00:00:16.640> video<00:00:17.000> of

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
stock except for in my previous video of

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.779 
stock except for in my previous video of
the<00:00:17.390> setscrew<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:18.529> just<00:00:18.859> completely<00:00:19.400> took<00:00:19.640> it

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
the setscrew I just completely took it

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.839 
the setscrew I just completely took it
out<00:00:20.199> yeah<00:00:21.199> it's<00:00:21.470> all<00:00:21.679> stock<00:00:22.160> it's<00:00:22.460> in<00:00:22.550> actually

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
so this is my buddy's his is in a little

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.280 
so this is my buddy's his is in a little
worse<00:00:32.180> condition

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
worse condition

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.640 
worse condition
I<00:00:33.320> try<00:00:34.130> to<00:00:34.160> mean<00:00:34.489> anyway<00:00:34.940> some<00:00:35.290> his<00:00:36.290> is<00:00:36.500> all

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
I try to mean anyway some his is all

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
stock except for he got the tiv2 torque

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.840 
stock except for he got the tiv2 torque
converter<00:00:40.610> like<00:00:41.150> a<00:00:41.650> there<00:00:42.650> it<00:00:42.800> is<00:00:42.980> there<00:00:43.640> and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
converter like a there it is there and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.900 
converter like a there it is there and
he's<00:00:43.970> got<00:00:44.180> a<00:00:44.240> couple<00:00:44.420> days<00:00:44.720> ago<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.260> his<00:00:46.040> top

speed is 50 climbers all 51 yeah 51

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.740 
speed is 50 climbers all 51 yeah 51
kilometers<00:00:50.960> an<00:00:51.080> hour<00:00:51.200> and<00:00:51.760> yes<00:00:52.760> that's<00:00:53.150> his<00:00:53.450> in

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
kilometers an hour and yes that's his in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.910 
kilometers an hour and yes that's his in
mine<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.170> twenty<00:00:55.070> twenty<00:00:55.940> five<00:00:55.970> point<00:00:56.600> five

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
mine is twenty twenty five point five

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.550 
mine is twenty twenty five point five
kilometers<00:00:57.920> an<00:00:58.100> hour<00:00:58.220> so<00:00:59.230> yeah<00:01:00.230> there's<00:01:00.470> quite

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
kilometers an hour so yeah there's quite

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.200 
kilometers an hour so yeah there's quite
a<00:01:00.770> bit<00:01:00.950> of<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.100> difference<00:01:01.460> with<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:01.820> one

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
a bit of a difference with that one

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.090 
a bit of a difference with that one
adjustment<00:01:02.690> there<00:01:03.140> with<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.530> torque

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
adjustment there with the torque

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.719 
adjustment there with the torque
converter<00:01:04.869> he<00:01:05.869> bought<00:01:06.049> on<00:01:06.229> eBay<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:06.890> go<00:01:07.490> check

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
converter he bought on eBay so go check

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.029 
converter he bought on eBay so go check
it<00:01:07.850> out<00:01:08.200> alright

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
it out alright

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.880 
it out alright
I'll<00:01:10.520> do<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:10.729> driver<00:01:11.320> doesn't<00:01:12.320> matter<00:01:12.469> okay

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
I'll do that driver doesn't matter okay

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.610 
I'll do that driver doesn't matter okay
well<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.310> go<00:01:13.460> giver<00:01:13.700> with<00:01:13.969> yours<00:01:14.270> and

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.880 

quilty<00:01:19.520> with<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.060> torque<00:01:20.510> converter<00:01:20.570> it's<00:01:21.170> on

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
quilty with a torque converter it's on

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.980 
quilty with a torque converter it's on
those<00:01:22.280> slower<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:23.030> not<00:01:23.300> very<00:01:23.540> good<00:01:23.660> low<00:01:23.810> in

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
those slower it's not very good low in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.830 
those slower it's not very good low in
speed<00:01:24.260> a<00:01:24.410> lot<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.710> torque<00:01:24.980> but<00:01:25.160> lotta<00:01:26.000> hi<00:01:28.840> there

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
speed a lot of torque but lotta hi there

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.640 
speed a lot of torque but lotta hi there
he<00:01:29.930> goes<00:01:34.750> it's<00:01:35.750> you're<00:01:35.930> out<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.110> an<00:01:36.200> eyes<00:01:36.380> at

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
he goes it's you're out of an eyes at

he goes it's you're out of an eyes at
pole<00:01:37.040> around<00:01:37.190> 50<00:01:37.700> now<00:01:39.430> very<00:01:40.430> fast<00:01:47.200> but<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
pole around 50 now very fast but the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.620 
pole around 50 now very fast but the
throttle<00:01:48.740> response<00:01:48.800> is<00:01:49.310> not<00:01:49.970> as<00:01:50.180> good<00:01:50.450> as<00:01:50.600> a

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
throttle response is not as good as a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.220 
throttle response is not as good as a
regular<00:01:51.260> centrifugal<00:01:52.100> clutch<00:01:52.960> just<00:01:53.960> going

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
regular centrifugal clutch just going

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:03.680 
regular centrifugal clutch just going
back<00:01:54.380> now

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:19.020
