about<00:00:16.830> some<00:00:17.490> individual<00:00:18.480> performances<00:00:19.230> from

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
about some individual performances from

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.920 
about some individual performances from
the<00:00:19.920> games<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> countdown<00:00:20.850> now<00:00:21.330> starting

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the games of the countdown now starting

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.019 
the games of the countdown now starting
with<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.560> worst<00:00:22.800> player<00:00:23.100> from<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.609> week<00:00:23.820> I

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
with the worst player from this week I

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.910 
with the worst player from this week I
don't<00:00:24.330> think<00:00:24.390> he<00:00:24.600> had<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.930> particularly<00:00:25.619> bad

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
don't think he had a particularly bad

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.099 
don't think he had a particularly bad
performance<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.210> more<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.930> he

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
performance but it's more about what he

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
performance but it's more about what he
didn't<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.490> take<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.699> look<00:00:29.939> at

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
didn't do and we have to take a look at

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.479 
didn't do and we have to take a look at
bars<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:30.869> from<00:00:31.109> cloud<00:00:31.380> nine<00:00:31.710> because<00:00:31.980> I'm

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
bars here from cloud nine because I'm

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.340 
bars here from cloud nine because I'm
still<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.329> thought<00:00:33.570> where<00:00:33.809> I'm<00:00:33.960> harping

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
still on this thought where I'm harping

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.500 
still on this thought where I'm harping
on<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.530> lot<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.829> these<00:00:34.920> na<00:00:35.190> top<00:00:35.430> players<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
on a lot of these na top players but it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.150 
on a lot of these na top players but it
really<00:00:36.780> did<00:00:37.020> make<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.260> difference<00:00:37.710> starting

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
really did make a difference starting

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.670 
really did make a difference starting
out<00:00:38.309> balls<00:00:39.149> fell<00:00:39.780> behind<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.469> bit<00:00:40.559> in

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
out balls fell behind a little bit in

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
out balls fell behind a little bit in
lane<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:41.070> disastrously<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.059> anything<00:00:42.390> like

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
lane not disastrously or anything like

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.440 
lane not disastrously or anything like
that<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.530> actually<00:00:44.309> take<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> look<00:00:45.210> at

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that but if we actually take a look at

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.299 
that but if we actually take a look at
Balls's<00:00:46.079> individual<00:00:46.739> performance

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
Balls's individual performance

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.369 
Balls's individual performance
particularly<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:48.059> teamfights<00:00:48.329> he<00:00:49.110> just

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
particularly in teamfights he just

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.799 
particularly in teamfights he just
wasn't<00:00:49.739> providing<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.940> backline<00:00:51.420> threat

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
wasn't providing the backline threat

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.229 
wasn't providing the backline threat
that<00:00:51.989> he<00:00:52.050> absolutely<00:00:52.289> had<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:52.980> I'm<00:00:53.280> alki<00:00:53.699> we

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
that he absolutely had to I'm alki we

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.020 
that he absolutely had to I'm alki we
didn't<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.750> very<00:00:55.590> many<00:00:55.770> good<00:00:55.920> attempts<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
didn't see very many good attempts for a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.450 
didn't see very many good attempts for a
teleport<00:00:57.809> engage<00:00:58.289> which<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.739> crucial<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
teleport engage which is crucial to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
teleport engage which is crucial to
playing<00:00:59.820> an<00:00:59.940> alki<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.840> top<00:01:01.050> professional

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
playing an alki at the top professional

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.920 
playing an alki at the top professional
level<00:01:01.890> these<00:01:02.039> days<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> top

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
level these days you have to have a top

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.210 
level these days you have to have a top
laner<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.589> want<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.949> compete

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
laner if you want to compete

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.700 
laner if you want to compete
internationally<00:01:05.460> who<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.510> actually<00:01:07.170> execute

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
internationally who can actually execute

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
internationally who can actually execute
these<00:01:08.159> engages<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.970> we're<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.750> seeing

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
these engages and we're just not seeing

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
these engages and we're just not seeing
it<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.380> balsa<00:01:10.740> from<00:01:10.920> any<00:01:11.130> other<00:01:11.220> top<00:01:11.610> laner

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it from balsa from any other top laner

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.899 
it from balsa from any other top laner
really<00:01:12.810> an<00:01:12.930> NA<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.680> example<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.520> think<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
really an NA for example I think the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.370 
really an NA for example I think the
closest<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.420> could<00:01:15.600> actually<00:01:15.750> say<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.229> maybe

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
closest you could actually say is maybe

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.929 
closest you could actually say is maybe
Tamsui<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:18.290> executing<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.320> well<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.340> they

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
Tamsui to executing that well but they

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
Tamsui to executing that well but they
have<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.720> set<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.110> step<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.799> up

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
have really have to set up step it up

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.890 
have really have to set up step it up
balls<00:01:23.220> included<00:01:23.790> even<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.509> can't<00:01:24.750> engage

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
balls included even if you can't engage

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
balls included even if you can't engage
in<00:01:25.380> these<00:01:25.590> teamfights<00:01:26.040> he<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.280> not<00:01:26.430> doing<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in these teamfights he was not doing a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.609 
in these teamfights he was not doing a
very<00:01:26.850> good<00:01:27.150> job<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.479> peeling<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.320> its<00:01:28.439> back

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
very good job of peeling for its back

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.560 
very good job of peeling for its back
line<00:01:28.890> either<00:01:29.070> which<00:01:29.340> caused<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.000> flank

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
line either which caused see the flank

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.679 
line either which caused see the flank
collapses<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.650> wall<00:01:31.890> c19<00:01:32.610> fights<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.210> that's

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
collapses that wall c19 fights so that's

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.270 
collapses that wall c19 fights so that's
something<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.229> needs<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.619> shape<00:01:35.070> up

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
something that really needs to shape up

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.340 
something that really needs to shape up
for<00:01:35.759> cloud<00:01:36.180> nine<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:36.840> many<00:01:36.900> other<00:01:37.110> teams

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
for cloud nine and for many other teams

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.170 
for cloud nine and for many other teams
in<00:01:37.530> general<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.070> that's<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.880> kind<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
in general but that's that's kind of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.700 
in general but that's that's kind of
what<00:01:39.329> i<00:01:39.360> noticed<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.750> week<00:01:40.049> about<00:01:40.259> pulses
