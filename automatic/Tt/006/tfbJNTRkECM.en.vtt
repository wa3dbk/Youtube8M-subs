00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
word availability which is good and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.420 
word availability which is good and
stops<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.260> from<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.590> treatment<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.039> two<00:01:02.190> turns

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
stops you from a treatment for two turns

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.230 
stops you from a treatment for two turns
but<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.600> does<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:04.680> last<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.159> Earth<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.760> goes

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
but it does good last for Earth it goes

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.679 
but it does good last for Earth it goes
before<00:01:06.540> two<00:01:07.500> turns<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.610> blasts<00:01:09.150> so

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
before two turns and then it blasts so

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.870 
before two turns and then it blasts so
you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.200> pretty<00:01:10.650> much<00:01:10.740> avoid<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.640> are

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you can pretty much avoid it if you are

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.510 
you can pretty much avoid it if you are
clever<00:01:12.479> enough<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.960> he<00:01:13.799> also<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> heating

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
clever enough and he also has a heating

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.460 
clever enough and he also has a heating
we<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.270> exactly<00:01:15.780> why<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> feel<00:01:16.320> I'm

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
we have that is exactly why I feel I'm

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.890 
we have that is exactly why I feel I'm
familiar<00:01:16.680> insight<00:01:17.220> because<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:18.420> had<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> call

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
familiar insight because he had to call

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.990 
familiar insight because he had to call
darkness<00:01:19.320> ability<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.400> pretty

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
darkness ability and that will pretty

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.359 
darkness ability and that will pretty
much<00:01:21.090> make<00:01:21.810> hidden<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.860> lesser

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
much make hidden we have a lesser

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.410 
much make hidden we have a lesser
ability<00:01:23.759> even<00:01:23.939> though<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.479> he<00:01:24.810> was<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:26.240> 700<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
ability even though it he was for 700 to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.380 
ability even though it he was for 700 to
800<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.170> you're<00:01:29.009> still<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.369> minimizing<00:01:30.119> not

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
800 and you're still just minimizing not

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.710 
800 and you're still just minimizing not
thereby<00:01:30.750> free<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.530> 400<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.430> he's<00:01:33.390> still<00:01:33.540> gonna

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
thereby free the 400 so he's still gonna

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.100 
thereby free the 400 so he's still gonna
make<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.860> let's<00:01:35.250> start<00:01:35.880> off<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:36.509> rel

let's<00:01:56.729> get<00:01:57.000> our<00:01:57.240> call<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.600> darkness<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.140> go

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
let's get our call of darkness on the go

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.870 
let's get our call of darkness on the go
and<00:01:58.500> hopefully<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.890> does<00:01:59.130> quite<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> lot<00:01:59.850> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and hopefully this does quite a lot of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.570 
and hopefully this does quite a lot of
damage<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
damage and

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.510 
damage and
he<00:02:00.640> just<00:02:00.850> healed<00:02:01.060> himself<00:02:01.180> for<00:02:01.990> nothing<00:02:02.770> which

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
he just healed himself for nothing which

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.580 
he just healed himself for nothing which
was<00:02:03.730> very<00:02:04.000> smart<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.570> we<00:02:04.930> had<00:02:05.080> him<00:02:05.170> for<00:02:05.230> a

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
was very smart and we had him for a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.130 
was very smart and we had him for a
whole<00:02:06.490> lot<00:02:06.760> there<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.150> that's<00:02:07.750> pretty<00:02:07.960> good

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
whole lot there so that's pretty good

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.390 
whole lot there so that's pretty good
and<00:02:08.320> we<00:02:08.560> will<00:02:08.770> get<00:02:09.360> Onix<00:02:10.360> bite<00:02:10.570> off<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.400> I
