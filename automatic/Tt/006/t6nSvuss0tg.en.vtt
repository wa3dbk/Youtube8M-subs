anybody are trying to see how the key
looks<00:00:21.529> I'm<00:00:21.800> quite<00:00:22.040> big<00:00:22.220> on<00:00:22.340> that<00:00:22.520> so<00:00:23.470> there's

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
looks I'm quite big on that so there's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.030 
looks I'm quite big on that so there's
the<00:00:24.680> key<00:00:25.239> so<00:00:26.239> this<00:00:26.360> is<00:00:26.540> a<00:00:26.739> tooling<00:00:27.739> but<00:00:27.770> not<00:00:28.009> I

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
the key so this is a tooling but not I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.249 
the key so this is a tooling but not I
think<00:00:28.220> it's<00:00:28.520> not<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.730> biggest<00:00:29.079> screen<00:00:30.079> you

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
think it's not the biggest screen you

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.950 
think it's not the biggest screen you
can<00:00:30.439> get<00:00:30.590> I<00:00:31.060> think<00:00:32.060> it<00:00:32.270> looks<00:00:32.390> pretty<00:00:32.630> cool<00:00:32.810> on

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
can get I think it looks pretty cool on

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.120 
can get I think it looks pretty cool on
the<00:00:33.050> bike<00:00:34.630> it<00:00:35.630> is<00:00:35.750> quite<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.050> decent<00:00:36.560> job<00:00:36.739> Ashley

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
the bike it is quite a decent job Ashley

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.189 
the bike it is quite a decent job Ashley
at<00:00:37.340> least<00:00:37.550> pushing<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.329> wind<00:00:38.600> out<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:38.870> the

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
at least pushing the wind out of the

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.830 
at least pushing the wind out of the
chest<00:00:39.879> but<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.000> downside<00:00:41.180> being<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.629> feel<00:00:41.809> a

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
chest but the downside being you feel a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.900 
chest but the downside being you feel a
little<00:00:42.019> bit<00:00:42.109> on<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.320> tall<00:00:42.530> side<00:00:42.670> might<00:00:43.670> push

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
little bit on the tall side might push

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.819 
little bit on the tall side might push
it<00:00:44.090> up<00:00:44.210> straight<00:00:44.420> into<00:00:44.690> your<00:00:44.780> head<00:00:45.019> which

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
it up straight into your head which

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.669 
it up straight into your head which
creates<00:00:46.219> quite<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.460> lot<00:00:46.609> of<00:00:46.730> turbulence

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
creates quite a lot of turbulence

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.040 
creates quite a lot of turbulence
otherwise<00:00:48.679> it's<00:00:49.090> fantastic<00:00:50.090> I<00:00:50.300> love<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:50.899> I

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
otherwise it's fantastic I love it I

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.340 
otherwise it's fantastic I love it I
mean<00:00:51.109> the<00:00:51.350> looks<00:00:51.910> it's<00:00:52.910> really<00:00:53.780> great<00:00:54.019> and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
mean the looks it's really great and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.610 
mean the looks it's really great and
also<00:00:54.679> overall<00:00:55.519> makes<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.239> screen<00:00:57.019> more

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
also overall makes the screen more

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.650 
also overall makes the screen more
visible<00:00:58.249> especially<00:00:58.429> if<00:00:58.879> you<00:00:58.969> have<00:00:59.120> like<00:00:59.329> some

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
visible especially if you have like some

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.130 
visible especially if you have like some
through<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.739> front<00:01:01.100> coming<00:01:01.749> alright<00:01:02.749> so<00:01:03.019> this

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
through the front coming alright so this

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.390 
through the front coming alright so this
is<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.350> girl<00:01:03.649> second<00:01:04.250> off<00:01:05.860> screen<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.100> this<00:01:07.280> is

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
is a girl second off screen so this is

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.730 
is a girl second off screen so this is
how<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.610> windscreen<00:01:08.480> for<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.780> car<00:01:09.080> at<00:01:09.230> 1200

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
how the windscreen for the car at 1200

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
how the windscreen for the car at 1200
and<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:09.980> think<00:01:10.190> for<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.430> 21<00:01:10.820> is<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.030> same<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:13.070> think

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
and I think for a 21 is the same I think

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.410 
and I think for a 21 is the same I think
it's<00:01:13.880> pretty<00:01:14.090> great

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
it's pretty great

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.600 
it's pretty great
next<00:01:14.840> back<00:01:15.050> looks<00:01:15.260> a<00:01:15.350> lot<00:01:15.530> better<00:01:15.800> and

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
next back looks a lot better and

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.580 
next back looks a lot better and
especially<00:01:16.940> like<00:01:17.300> but<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.990> course<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.380> only

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
especially like but of course the only

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.400 
especially like but of course the only
opinions<00:01:18.980> people<00:01:19.220> saying<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.260> naked<00:01:21.260> is

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
opinions people saying that the naked is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.880 
opinions people saying that the naked is
still<00:01:21.650> a<00:01:21.680> naked<00:01:23.500> but<00:01:24.500> I<00:01:24.530> think<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.860> really

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
still a naked but I think it really

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.790 
still a naked but I think it really
makes<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.610> look<00:01:25.760> cooler<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.750> also<00:01:27.050> or<00:01:27.260> it

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
makes you look cooler and also or it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.470 
makes you look cooler and also or it
takes<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.280> lot<00:01:28.370> of<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.550> wind<00:01:28.730> from<00:01:28.820> my<00:01:29.000> chest<00:01:29.300> I

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
takes a lot of the wind from my chest I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.850 
takes a lot of the wind from my chest I
don't<00:01:29.660> feel<00:01:29.840> any<00:01:29.990> heat<00:01:30.320> coming<00:01:30.350> from<00:01:30.650> a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
don't feel any heat coming from a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.720 
don't feel any heat coming from a
superbike<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.610> don't<00:01:32.600> feel<00:01:32.720> much<00:01:32.960> different<00:01:33.730> do

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
superbike I don't feel much different do

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.780 
superbike I don't feel much different do
I<00:01:34.760> feel<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.270> little<00:01:35.330> bit<00:01:35.480> of<00:01:35.570> turbulence

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
I feel a little bit of turbulence

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.160 
I feel a little bit of turbulence
towards<00:01:37.790> my<00:01:37.910> helmet<00:01:38.270> so<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:38.510> guess<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.990> whole

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
towards my helmet so I guess the whole

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.400 
towards my helmet so I guess the whole
hair<00:01:39.440> will<00:01:39.770> be<00:01:39.860> pushed<00:01:40.160> towards<00:01:40.580> my<00:01:40.730> helmet

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
hair will be pushed towards my helmet

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.660 
hair will be pushed towards my helmet
but<00:01:42.410> maybe<00:01:42.740> that's<00:01:42.920> something<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.310> can<00:01:43.490> live

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
but maybe that's something you can live

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.080 
but maybe that's something you can live
with<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:44.540> do<00:01:45.260> rather<00:01:46.130> not<00:01:46.340> having<00:01:46.640> all<00:01:46.790> over<00:01:46.970> my

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
with I do rather not having all over my

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.510 
with I do rather not having all over my
body<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.470> definitely<00:01:48.770> looks<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:49.100> lot

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
body but it definitely looks a lot

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.900 
body but it definitely looks a lot
better

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
better

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.180 
better
I<00:01:50.120> think<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:50.930> bike<00:01:51.170> looks<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.560> lot<00:01:51.740> sexier

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
I think this bike looks a lot sexier

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.560 
I think this bike looks a lot sexier
with<00:01:52.760> it<00:01:53.680> yeah<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.890> just<00:01:55.610> love<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.180> think<00:01:56.210> it's

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
with it yeah I just love it I think it's

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.300 
with it yeah I just love it I think it's
it's<00:01:56.930> it's<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.380> must<00:01:57.650> for<00:01:57.740> people<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:58.250> really

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
it's it's a must for people that really

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.540 
it's it's a must for people that really
don't<00:01:58.760> like<00:01:58.910> too<00:01:59.210> much<00:01:59.330> wind<00:01:59.600> okay<00:02:02.410> so<00:02:03.410> this<00:02:04.370> is

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
don't like too much wind okay so this is

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.949 
don't like too much wind okay so this is
my<00:02:04.580> 1200<00:02:05.570> monster

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.309 

it<00:02:10.920> has<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> stock<00:02:11.609> exhaust<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.329> remains<00:02:13.109> to<00:02:13.290> be
