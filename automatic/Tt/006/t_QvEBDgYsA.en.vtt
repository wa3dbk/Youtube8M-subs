items<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:07.510> I<00:05:07.720> can<00:05:08.290> imagine<00:05:08.680> what<00:05:08.800> it<00:05:08.890> would<00:05:08.980> be

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
items so I can imagine what it would be

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.410 
items so I can imagine what it would be
like<00:05:09.130> whenever<00:05:09.520> they<00:05:09.700> add<00:05:09.850> all<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.120> new<00:05:10.270> ones

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
like whenever they add all the new ones

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.020 
like whenever they add all the new ones
in<00:05:10.860> but<00:05:11.860> hopefully<00:05:12.190> they'll<00:05:12.340> get<00:05:12.460> that<00:05:12.580> fixed

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
in but hopefully they'll get that fixed

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.150 
in but hopefully they'll get that fixed
