the popsicle stick on top now you have
two<00:01:14.350> x's<00:01:17.550> now<00:01:18.550> get<00:01:18.910> anything<00:01:19.210> that<00:01:19.720> straight

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
two x's now get anything that straight

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.249 
two x's now get anything that straight
and<00:01:20.350> mock<00:01:20.830> off<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.790> tips<00:01:22.119> so<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.450> we<00:01:22.780> can<00:01:23.020> cut

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
and mock off the tips so that we can cut

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:32.200 
and mock off the tips so that we can cut
them<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:25.479> cut<00:01:25.750> off<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.050> tips

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
stick over and measure it and mark it

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.710 
stick over and measure it and mark it
then<00:01:48.020> cut<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:49.930> put<00:01:50.930> glue<00:01:51.260> on<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.830> edges<00:01:52.010> and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.970 

glue<00:01:56.720> them<00:01:56.869> on<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.320> exes

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.990 

and<00:02:02.380> do<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.950> both<00:02:04.160> sides<00:02:06.370> now<00:02:07.370> there<00:02:07.850> is

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
and do this to both sides now there is

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.450 
and do this to both sides now there is
two<00:02:08.390> sides<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.960> point<00:02:09.230> cut<00:02:09.740> off<00:02:09.950> one<00:02:10.220> side

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
two sides of the point cut off one side

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:20.610 
two sides of the point cut off one side
of<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.730> point

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.890 

now<00:02:21.280> get<00:02:21.700> your<00:02:21.819> felt<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:24.150> measure<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.569> your

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
now get your felt and measure it on your

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.680 
now get your felt and measure it on your
seats<00:02:27.300> cut<00:02:28.300> out<00:02:28.569> your<00:02:28.959> measurement

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.370 

and<00:02:34.780> then<00:02:35.500> glue<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.890> on<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:37.360> your<00:02:37.540> chair

put<00:02:41.380> glue<00:02:41.710> on<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.340> edge<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:44.500> glue<00:02:44.710> it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
put glue on the edge and glue it

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.220 
put glue on the edge and glue it
underneath<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:46.090> chair<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.780> will<00:02:49.990> look

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
underneath the chair and it will look

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.770 
underneath the chair and it will look
something<00:02:50.740> like<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:53.760> now<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.510> might

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
something like this and now you might

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.040 
something like this and now you might

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
fold the felts over so it is stuck to

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:14.100 
fold the felts over so it is stuck to
the<00:03:07.390> popsicle<00:03:07.990> stick<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.920> now<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:13.030> need<00:03:13.750> to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
the popsicle stick and now you need to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.770 
the popsicle stick and now you need to
fold<00:03:14.710> over<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:16.510> felt<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:18.090> put<00:03:19.090> glue<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.690> that

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780
