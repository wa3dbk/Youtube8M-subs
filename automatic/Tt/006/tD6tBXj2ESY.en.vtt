00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.509
 Okazaki Integrated Bioscience Lab's air is Kageyama's former laboratory 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.820
 is 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.989
 We studied this time 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.759
 What in the circle is another very small different gene 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.759
 It is what you do 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:31.039
 The development of a new store with a decline in profit in the recent period 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.059
 There are so many forms in the win 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.100
 about it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.430
 What was previously considered is the protein encoding part 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.290
 There 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.280
 From there 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.140
 There are 10 movies 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.200
 Furthermore, it was a scheme that has been translated into protein from the US 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.760
 But when I actually study it 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.090
 I also want to do something while thinking that I'm encoding a protein 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 I understand that the sister of Ms. 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.410
 This is a federation 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.780
 Probably not encoding a protein 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.260
 I was thinking 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.560
 When we actually study 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.300
 I know I'm trying to keep it very small 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.300
 came 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.490
 Go out like this and don't code the protein 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.590
 Those that are translated into small text for such genes 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.710
 US rate cut 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.090
 Specialized by government authorities and sole top responsibility official approval 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.870
 It is known what is done 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.840
 This study is one of them 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.820
 For small iron etc 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.820
 It is this research result 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.710
 We have found one of the genes is 4 tri-paddy 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.150
 Mr. is very small and has improved brightness 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.230
 The team reduced the poison and the team is 81.5 kilobases 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.830
 It is transcribed at messenger rate, but in it 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.470
 Found a very small hometown 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.710
 This way 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.530
 The first four are actually translated and act as gene products 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.440
 I know that 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.230
 Especially the first network communication 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.880
 It is advanced of 3 notch Sapporo city of only 11r 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.440
 This small text shows this whole city car stereo 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 Known to be essential to 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.869
 This gene's 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.509
 In the mutant depicting completion 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.859
 Tiny to be seen in the belly of Drosophila larvae 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.859
 The last winter will be completely gone 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.630
 from these things 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.660
 We are good at actually having this gene at 13 o'clock the same school 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.660
 I concluded that I mean that it is a gene 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.629
 There are two wins in this analysis 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.999
 One is what this little peptide is doing 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.290
 This peptide is actually called what component db 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.609
 I used the sensibility of transcription factors 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.209
 The ingredient daily works to suppress 10 companies as it is 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.969
 It is a transcription factor that can finally be considered 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.049
 When a stone and rice work 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.949
 Of these 10 from the end which contains the repression domain 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.839
 Being disconnected 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.839
 20 people who work for our activation will be returned 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.339
 from these things 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:22.699
 Hoist rice gene is a gene through the activation of component db 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.699
 I understood that it works as a switch of expression 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:32.969
 At the same time, this component is usually divided into dots in each 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:34.449
 But 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.099
 When Hori pro see works 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.289
 Expanded throughout the cabinet, students will be returned to the 10-company world 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:44.649
 I understand that 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:48.699
 From these experimental results, we 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.589
 It is Konishi and rice gene to act 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:54.989
 Through regulation of net transcription factor expression 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.229
 Regarding the activation of many genes 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.589
 Involved in the development of beta cells 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.589
 Showed that it can work as a station and a switch 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.209
 The result of this research is a small peptide gene 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.159
 Showing that biology plays a very important role 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.869
 doing 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:17.709
 Until now it's a going on work and can't be made small and gene and importance 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.279
 Was not recognized very much 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.479
 On the occasion of this research result 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.300
 That more research is being done on smaller 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.679
 We expect
