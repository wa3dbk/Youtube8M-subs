00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.290
 very good to all kids how about 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:09.110
 you are greetings from cancer belly 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.880
 cancer playing to advance with is equal 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.830
 greetings to all kids that you are 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.139
 good welcome to this new little game 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.760
 free to play as you know me from time to time 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.619
 when I take a look at the 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.960
 free to play I say to see what I can play 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.580
 what can I try and in this case I have 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.800
 decided to try to pass 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.810
 Well I do not know what I liked the pint 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.350
 what he has is the typical player 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.480
 massive multiplayer but I saw a video and I 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.820
 it seemed super nice super nice 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.190
 graphically and it did not seem so 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.220
 complicated and very important everything in 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.410
 Spanish the menus the dialogues that is me 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.120
 It has seemed super interesting to try it and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 Well, here I bring you all 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.230
 you this game so good if you 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.800
 fancy as it is free then what 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.360
 download and try it 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.340
 well, well, kids, this is a 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.200
 small tutorial that we have before 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.020
 start playing the multiplayer so 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.820
 we're going to do today in the tutorial and if 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.769
 we see that we like it and maybe like it 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.720
 we will play some multiplayer games 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.150
 but as I say the first thing we're going to see 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.159
 How is everything going if you do not like it? 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.440
 such which with this little tutorial 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.790
 we will see a little bit how is the game in 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.790
 yes come let's pay attention 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.280
 do not you think 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.890
 you all think you are great warriors but 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.160
 when things get ugly it 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.070
 turn into puddings if you can save the 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.990
 gap between the two worlds is that you know 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.710
 defend yourself 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.210
 take it as a test I'll wait for you 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.110
 other side 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.240
 good luck do not give up 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.980
 no friend no surrender is the last 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.600
 Well, well, let's see how 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.420
 this is for now you see the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.270
 basic movements 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.400
 w to that of or is the typical movement of 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.930
 any shooters 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.180
 cif to sprint consumes energy put 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.020
 macho juice as goye all motivated 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.020
 with the mallet here 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.830
 it's worth the left click we give a blow 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.780
 and with the right I think that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.780
 with the right we give you to attack you 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.700
 we go 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.349
 look good here, good 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.490
 three have come and we have loaded them 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.940
 easy we can not see 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.170
 today 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.170
 can not by what 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.560
 oh by the way if you see some small 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.090
 pull cillo and such in the game a part 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.130
 I'm playing it graphically 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.099
 it is spectacular this game I already tell you 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.810
 the midis action will not let me record 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.220
 I know why so I'm recording with the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.260
 phrases that consume enough more 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.720
 resources but good if you see tugs 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.850
 that's why 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.290
 these are friends too 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.890
 take to give the door 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:11.200
 help us to reject them 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.200
 that is done by them 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.010
 you deal with the deck you do not see 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.110
 before 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.110
 nobody is left 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.060
 to controls 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.350
 until this age is controls for 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.270
 cover yourself with the blows of them 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.200
 worth so good easy tasks 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.200
 zoom out list 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.570
 we passed 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.070
 It is very good graphically the game is 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.820
 the truth that is very very well very 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.820
 super nice to see him up 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.540
 we will guide you the forests are 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.070
 scrambled lately follow us good 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.380
 I suppose also that this at the end 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.880
 then you'll end up to the balls 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.740
 because you'll find yourself out there in the 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.890
 multiplayer I say people who go super 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.670
 equipped because it pays but well 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.670
 until you reach that moment 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.010
 in that you have a special blow against 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.930
 the one that there is no defense yes sir I have it 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.130
 just what we need in these 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.049
 forests, as I was telling you, that's what 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.570
 in the end this is free to play only if you 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.070
 play between quotes is not because 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.710
 end here the one who pays is the one who wins 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.320
 normally or that or you put a million 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.350
 hours in the game and you're unlocking 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.650
 things based on playing and not paying but 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.650
 good 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.390
 let's come hit here jackal 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.630
 the special blow that will be then that 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.630
 I do not know 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.940
 it's more here 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.270
 ok easy easy voucher because I know of 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.310
 I only have two hits 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.260
 the left button and the right button 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.950
 of the mouse one softer and one more 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:06.070
 powerful I do not know 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:09.470
 but what happens to you you need 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.370
 good luck, recover, friend, hold on 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.370
 it came right away 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.349
 I will not play if any game 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.720
 multiplayer that sure but good today 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.470
 we are going to steal better to show off 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:28.990
 animal, I'm going to make you my hair 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:34.659
 you are here how fast you have been 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:37.659
 seemed more fierce brothers dad 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:40.539
 there's no time to lose if you've arrived 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:44.930
 until here they will be of vouchers for the 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:49.870
 combat let's love it 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:53.900
 the name of the four gods the fifth 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:58.100
 etc from this moment I declare you 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:01.819
 defender of the fake tree dream of 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:06.050
 heart forged in chaos 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.050
 referred to winter 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.100
 by bush 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.450
 Get moving to for staff 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.450
 The front 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.180
 Okay, it 's already grown and now 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.180
 that I have to do 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.750
 I do not know what I have to do 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.220
 it looks like it's already 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.560
 good for kids up here the 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.270
 tutorial how did you see a tutorial 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.980
 easy simple and such but good we 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.960
 it's good to see if the game pulls us well 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.480
 we do well if we like a little 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.310
 setting the type of game what is 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.070
 the multiplayer I already know that there 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.410
 enough more things and there are successes 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.540
 you have to gain skills in 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.510
 enough little things you can even up 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.460
 go creating little things and such but good 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.320
 and we will see in a next 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.630
 chapter that is going to see that they will already be 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.550
 a game already in multiplayer so 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.500

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.210
