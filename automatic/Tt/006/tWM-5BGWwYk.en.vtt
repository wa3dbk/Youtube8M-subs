 Hello and welcome again to 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.380
 our channel loquendo paranormal where 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.080
 Events or things will be discussed 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.410
 surprising the subject of today is the 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.760
 mysterious triangle of Bermuda 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.500
 we started the 'triangle of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.809
 Bermuda 'is an area in the ocean 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.940
 Atlantic located between the florida 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.980
 Bermuda and Puerto Rico, which is often 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.750
 crossed by cargo ships and cruises 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.480
 of pleasure as well as being an area 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.370
 hot air traffic with the years 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.800
 a large number of boats and aircraft 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.930
 large and small have disappeared in 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.720
 the triangle area the most famous 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.540
 are the 19 be tiger ariel be ice 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.670
 cycles the first problem was reported 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.500
 by Christopher Columbus himself who said 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.390
 that the compass does not work well in the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.670
 area and that there were fire rays that 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.100
 the first person in 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.840
 make a documented mention was beyond 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.410
 a journalist of the associated press 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.270
 who in 1951 spoke of what for him 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.070
 they were mysterious disappearances of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.080
 boats in an area of ​​the Bahamas to the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.200
 which he baptized as the triangle of the devil 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.210
 then george sand reaffirmed in the magazine 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.530
 esoteric destiny the question of 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.390
 disappearances and plants 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.400
 a way for the area to talk about a 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.070
 triangle whose vertices were located in 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.380
 florida bermuda and puerto rico 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.509
 However, the inventor of the term was the 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.030
 sensational writer vincent vallies 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.860
 who in the poule magazine argos and spoke 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.460
 of disappearances in an article 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.100
 published in 1964 titled the mortal 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.799
 Bermuda triangle likewise 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.159
 inside the invisible book horizon web

 mystery those that was published in 1965 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.080
 davis included a chapter entitled the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.640
 deadly triangle of Bermuda there 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.050
 that in general is the one that is 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.900
 consider the creator of the famed 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.940
 triangle was not however gadis who 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.280
 came to turn the matter into a myth 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.489
 but charles berlitz science writer 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.769
 fiction that in 1974 wrote the best 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.630
 seller the 'triangle of shorts' a 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.640
 book that sold around 20 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.190
 million copies and in which 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.500
 collected cases of disappearances sometimes 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.080
 manipulated and poorly presented and copied 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.569
 Pretty text of ladis explanations 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.340
 fanciful some of the theories that 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.050
 could explain the mystery of 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.210
 'Bermuda Triangle' 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.160
 in science fiction and although they explain 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.470
 almost all cases 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.330
 disappearances belong more to the field 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.880
 of the legends that to the investigation 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.440
 a wormhole could be the cause 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.750
 of disappearances according to one of the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.330
 theories a leap in spacetime 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.550
 there are those who say that in the triangle 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.010
 there could be a wormhole 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.880
 singularity in the tissue 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.860
 space-time under which 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.140
 the missing ships and planes 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.690
 they could have been transported to another 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.880
 universe UFOs and aliens has 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.650
 suggested that the triangle could be 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.930
 functioning as a station 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.640
 extraterrestrials in which people boats 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.290
 and missing aircraft would be 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.510
 kidnapped in order to be 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.880
 studied or maybe at least in certain 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.640
 cases in order to be saved from a 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.130
 holocaust marine monsters one of the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.470
 most fanciful theories is that according to 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.750
 which sea monsters type the kraken 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.340
 they would be responsible for so much ship 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.890
 sunk rays of death of the 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.840
 atlantis this theory was largely 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.030
 catapult by the psychic edgar cayce 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.070
 which was a great defender of the 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.230
 existence of the atlantis and said 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.890
 possess premonitory and 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.500
 communication 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.180
 with the dead among them some who 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.550
 according to him they identified themselves as 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.069
 reincarnations of the ancient atlantes 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.080
 said the above and it was believed that the 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.630
 Atlanteans had a technology that 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.060
 among other things it included some powerful 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.430
 fire crystals that were used to 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.500
 get energy here and it was said that the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.420
 use of those crystals came out of 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.610
 control and ended up being the cause of 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.020
 sinking of the atlantis until now 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.660
 albeit still active 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.820
 intermittent and to a lesser degree thus 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.680
 energy fields emitted by said 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.960
 crystals would interfere with the 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.940
 operation of ships and aircraft a 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.160
 huge sea monster like the kraken 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.169
 would make the boats disappear according to another 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.720
 of the most fanciful theories and without 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.210
 doubt less likely explanations more 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.220
 realistic explanations that although not 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.380
 could explain all the cases of 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.630
 disappearances are at least more credible 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.430
 and possibly related to 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.470
 many of the cases of ships and aircraft 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.020
 that effects never appeared 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.300
 climatological it is known that the 'triangle 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.370
 Bermuda 'is an area with strong 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.140
 winds and in the child's season 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.009
 numerous hurricanes have lashed their 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.779
 waters 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.759
 itself is a known area of 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.889
 unfavorable turbulence for the 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.050
 flights have also been documented 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.719
 big waves and some swirls 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.879
 giant piracy it is thought that the 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.069
 piracy could be the cause of many 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.990
 cases of ships but this certainly is not 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.180
 could explain the disappearance of 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.610
 aircraft bombs and mines that have been 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.319
 without deactivating it is thought that they could 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.539
 there are many water mines that 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.999
 placed in periods of war tension 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.580
 when Cuba was a colony of Spain or the 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.430
 cold war for example still persist and 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.749
 they are a threat to ships 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.430
 electromagnetism apparently in the 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:33.499
 'Bermuda triangle' there 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.360
 particular properties in the field 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.430
 magnetic properties that are usually 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.800
 disorient many of the compasses and 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.689
 navigation artifacts theories of 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.759
 why does this happen they involve everything 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.189
 from bags of gas remains of the 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.349
 technology of the atlantic as well as the 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.169
 extraterrestrial theories or a break 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.699
 interdimensional however some 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.249
 experts say that the disappearances 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.559
 of the triangle can be explained by 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.259
 hurricanes submarine earthquakes and 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:01.160
 naturally the magnetic fields without 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.140
 But it is 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.720
 much more interesting to think that they were 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.740
 devoured by a giant tortoise 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.290
 aspired to another dimension or 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.110
 kidnapped by aliens the 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.910
 mystery continues leave your comment of 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.760
 what you think or know what happens there 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.730
 thanks for watching the video if you liked it 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.620
 I like to share and subscribe 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.070
 have a good night see you at the 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.070
 next
