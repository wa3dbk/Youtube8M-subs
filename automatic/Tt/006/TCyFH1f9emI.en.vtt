a<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.740> think<00:00:11.280> it's<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> 40<00:00:11.940> gallon<00:00:12.599> drum

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900

that I got off Craigslist and it was my

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.060 
that I got off Craigslist and it was my
first<00:00:17.730> attempt<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.470> wrote<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.830> didn't

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
first attempt and I just wrote I didn't

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.620 
first attempt and I just wrote I didn't
have<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> removable<00:00:20.490> top<00:00:20.910> set<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.300> drilled<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
hole in the top and then I converted the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.919 
hole in the top and then I converted the
bottom<00:00:26.849> space<00:00:27.240> into<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> flow<00:00:28.380> three<00:00:28.710> bin<00:00:28.890> by

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
kind of got a hole and then I drilled

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.209 
kind of got a hole and then I drilled
some<00:00:35.010> holes<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.480> inserted<00:00:37.290> some<00:00:37.620> coated

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
some holes in and inserted some coated

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
some holes in and inserted some coated
laundry<00:00:38.730> line<00:00:38.910> all<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:39.660> across<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.469> make

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
laundry line all the way across to make

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
laundry line all the way across to make
a<00:00:40.649> screen<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.370> don't<00:00:41.879> think<00:00:42.239> we're<00:00:42.540> gonna<00:00:42.600> be

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
a screen I don't think we're gonna be

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.350 
a screen I don't think we're gonna be
able<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.860> bit<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.969> made<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
able to see this bit I just made a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.110 
able to see this bit I just made a
screen<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> bottom<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.940> way<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
screen at the bottom and that way the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
screen at the bottom and that way the
finished<00:00:48.390> compost<00:00:48.870> kind<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.379> falls<00:00:49.800> through

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
finished compost kind of falls through

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
finished compost kind of falls through
but<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.360> I'm<00:00:51.480> discovering<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.320> these

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
but what I'm discovering with these

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.209 
but what I'm discovering with these
particular<00:00:53.300> type<00:00:54.300> homemade<00:00:55.079> blow<00:00:55.739> three<00:00:56.039> bins

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
particular type homemade blow three bins

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.250 
particular type homemade blow three bins
is<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.809> compost<00:00:58.289> gets<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:59.870> dense<00:01:00.870> at

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
is that the compost gets pretty dense at

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.439 
is that the compost gets pretty dense at
the<00:01:01.379> bottom<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.280> use<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.879> tool<00:01:03.120> that

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the bottom so I have to use a tool that

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.000 
the bottom so I have to use a tool that
I<00:01:03.480> got<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.049> dollar<00:01:04.229> store<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
I got at the dollar store it's like a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.140 
I got at the dollar store it's like a
pasta<00:01:05.280> fork<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:09.619> scrape<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
pasta fork and I use that to scrape the

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.219 
pasta fork and I use that to scrape the
castings<00:01:12.150> down<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.080> fall

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
castings down and get them to fall

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.170 
castings down and get them to fall
through<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> bottom<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.610> then<00:01:14.970> they're

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
through at the bottom and then they're

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
through at the bottom and then they're
still<00:01:15.479> pretty<00:01:15.600> wet<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.930> fudgy<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> allow

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
still pretty wet and fudgy so I allow

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
still pretty wet and fudgy so I allow
them<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.820> sit<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> bottom<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> couple

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
them to sit at the bottom for a couple

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.560 
them to sit at the bottom for a couple
weeks<00:01:19.229> before<00:01:19.890> moving<00:01:20.729> over<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.460> bucket

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
weeks before moving over to my bucket

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
weeks before moving over to my bucket
store<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:24.869> castings<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.950> five-gallon

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
store at my castings in a five-gallon

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.640 
store at my castings in a five-gallon
bucket<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:27.119> easy<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.570> me<00:01:27.720> take<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
bucket was easy for me take out to the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.460 
bucket was easy for me take out to the
garden<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.189> use<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:30.869> also<00:01:31.020> helps<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.409> keep

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
garden to use it it also helps to keep

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.830 
garden to use it it also helps to keep
it<00:01:31.650> moist<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.970> particular<00:01:33.270> bin<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it moist so with this particular bin I

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.649 
it moist so with this particular bin I
like<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.320> said<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.710> cut<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> top<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.659> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
like I said I just cut out the top and I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.300 
like I said I just cut out the top and I
use<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> old<00:01:37.259> piece<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.470> carpet<00:01:38.360> has<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> lid<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
use a old piece of carpet has a lid and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.850 
use a old piece of carpet has a lid and
then<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.460> feed<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> top<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.740> very

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
then I feed from the top so it's very

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 
then I feed from the top so it's very
simple<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.610> feed<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.509> would<00:01:45.659> any

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
simple you just feed like you would any

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.710 
simple you just feed like you would any
other<00:01:46.070> worm<00:01:47.070> bin<00:01:47.399> you're<00:01:48.090> gonna<00:01:48.180> use<00:01:48.420> fiber

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
other worm bin you're gonna use fiber

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
other worm bin you're gonna use fiber
like<00:01:49.170> paper<00:01:50.070> or<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.970> straw<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.189> then<00:01:53.189> you're

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
like paper or a straw and then you're

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.730 
like paper or a straw and then you're
gonna<00:01:53.579> use<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:53.880> feed<00:01:54.149> stock<00:01:54.479> which<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.649> be

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
gonna use your feed stock which can be

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
gonna use your feed stock which can be
food<00:01:56.070> scraps<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.700> compost<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.630> whatever<00:01:59.479> this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.510 
Walmart for like 15 bucks and did the
exact<00:02:10.349> same<00:02:10.379> thing<00:02:10.619> with<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.039> bottom<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.430> make

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
exact same thing with the bottom to make

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.130 
exact same thing with the bottom to make
it<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.730> flow<00:02:11.879> through<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.390> has<00:02:12.540> wheels<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
it a flow through it has wheels on it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.640 
it a flow through it has wheels on it
and<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.440> thought

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and I thought

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.910 
and I thought
that<00:02:13.739> would<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:13.950> awesome<00:02:14.659> because<00:02:15.920> thought

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
that would be awesome because thought

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.319 
that would be awesome because thought
it'd<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.040> easy<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.430> move<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.670> around<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.209> what

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
it'd be easy to move it around but what

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.179 
it'd be easy to move it around but what
I've<00:02:18.450> discovered<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.110> after<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.799> bin<00:02:19.950> gets

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
I've discovered is after the bin gets

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.429 
I've discovered is after the bin gets
about<00:02:20.340> half<00:02:20.549> way<00:02:20.730> full<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.900> too<00:02:22.110> heavy

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
about half way full it's too heavy

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.309 
about half way full it's too heavy
for<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.980> wheels<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.370> work<00:02:24.209> it's<00:02:24.959> just<00:02:25.019> not

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
for the wheels to work it's just not

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.160 
for the wheels to work it's just not
heavy-duty<00:02:25.799> enough<00:02:26.189> up<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.459> bin<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.930> this

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
heavy-duty enough up a bin I like this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.530 
heavy-duty enough up a bin I like this
bin<00:02:28.409> better<00:02:28.680> than<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.610> converted<00:02:30.180> barrel

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
bin better than a converted barrel

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.289 
bin better than a converted barrel
because<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.079> the<00:02:31.170> lid<00:02:31.609> the<00:02:32.609> moisture<00:02:32.970> level

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
because of the lid the moisture level

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.509 
because of the lid the moisture level
seems<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.629> say<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.170> lot<00:02:34.379> better<00:02:34.799> with<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
seems to say a lot better with the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.360 
seems to say a lot better with the
plastic<00:02:35.970> lid<00:02:36.650> irrigation<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.829> not<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> problem

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
plastic lid irrigation is not a problem

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.809 
plastic lid irrigation is not a problem
I<00:02:38.819> just<00:02:39.689> drill<00:02:40.079> holes<00:02:40.349> again<00:02:40.829> through<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.640> bin

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
I just drill holes again through the bin

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.030 
I just drill holes again through the bin
if<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.450> bin<00:02:42.599> does<00:02:42.840> get<00:02:43.109> a<00:02:43.290> little<00:02:43.530> bit<00:02:43.650> too<00:02:43.829> wet

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
if the bin does get a little bit too wet

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.039 
if the bin does get a little bit too wet
I<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.670> leave<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.000> top<00:02:45.450> off<00:02:45.659> for<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.959> couple

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
I just leave the top off for a couple

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.860 
I just leave the top off for a couple
hours<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.670> again<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.150> feed<00:02:48.450> from<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.690> top

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
hours and again I just feed from the top

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.599 
hours and again I just feed from the top
and<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.560> put<00:02:49.799> in<00:02:49.950> whatever<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.909> have<00:02:51.269> on<00:02:51.299> hand

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
and I put in whatever I have on hand

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.819 
and I put in whatever I have on hand
these<00:02:53.609> bins<00:02:53.940> each<00:02:54.359> I<00:02:54.720> would<00:02:55.139> guess<00:02:56.329> have<00:02:57.329> about

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
these bins each I would guess have about

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.949 
these bins each I would guess have about
probably<00:02:58.829> 8<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.519> 10<00:02:59.849> pounds<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.299> worms<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:00.810> them

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
probably 8 to 10 pounds of worms in them

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.800 
probably 8 to 10 pounds of worms in them
apiece<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.459> started<00:03:02.819> with<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.120> 2<00:03:03.359> pounds

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
apiece and I started with just 2 pounds

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.520 
apiece and I started with just 2 pounds
of<00:03:03.870> worms<00:03:04.049> per<00:03:04.470> bin<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.420> now<00:03:06.420> they<00:03:07.049> go<00:03:07.230> through

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
of worms per bin and now they go through

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.030 
of worms per bin and now they go through
about<00:03:07.950> Oh<00:03:08.370> 10<00:03:09.359> to<00:03:09.510> 15<00:03:09.840> pounds<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.409> scraps<00:03:10.739> per

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
about Oh 10 to 15 pounds of scraps per

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.119 
about Oh 10 to 15 pounds of scraps per
week<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:12.989> use<00:03:13.459> compost<00:03:14.459> manure<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:16.129> table

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
week and I use compost manure and table

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.420 
week and I use compost manure and table
scraps<00:03:17.430> from<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.730> house<00:03:18.919> see<00:03:19.919> if<00:03:19.949> we<00:03:20.069> can<00:03:20.250> find

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
scraps from the house see if we can find

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.390 
scraps from the house see if we can find
a<00:03:20.699> big<00:03:21.000> pile<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.389> worms<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.040> use<00:03:23.040> my<00:03:23.220> bare

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
a big pile of worms and I use my bare

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.280 
a big pile of worms and I use my bare
hands<00:03:23.669> because<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.269> don't<00:03:24.449> care<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:30.870> think

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
hands because I don't care you think

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.319 
hands because I don't care you think
I've<00:03:31.769> had<00:03:31.949> the<00:03:32.069> lid<00:03:32.280> off<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.549> while<00:03:32.879> and<00:03:33.209> they're

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
I've had the lid off a while and they're

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.210 
I've had the lid off a while and they're
not<00:03:33.480> happy<00:03:33.930> with<00:03:34.049> me<00:03:34.290> right<00:03:34.470> now<00:03:34.500> let's<00:03:34.949> see<00:03:35.129> if

not happy with me right now let's see if

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.780 
not happy with me right now let's see if
we<00:03:35.340> can<00:03:35.489> find<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.879> big<00:03:36.120> clump<00:03:36.840> over<00:03:37.169> here<00:03:37.790> guess

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
we can find a big clump over here guess

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.159 
we can find a big clump over here guess
some<00:03:39.000> pumpkin<00:03:39.620> puree<00:03:40.620> there<00:03:41.810> yeah<00:03:42.810> here's<00:03:43.109> a

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
some pumpkin puree there yeah here's a

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:49.369 
some pumpkin puree there yeah here's a
but<00:03:43.440> big<00:03:44.090> male<00:03:45.090> worms<00:03:45.569> here<00:03:47.629> I'm<00:03:48.629> screwed<00:03:49.109> on

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
but big male worms here I'm screwed on

00:03:49.379 --> 00:04:01.680 
but big male worms here I'm screwed on
the<00:03:49.500> see<00:03:53.000> ya<00:03:56.060> nice<00:03:57.060> healthy<00:03:57.449> worms

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.250 

I<00:04:04.860> think<00:04:05.860> I<00:04:05.980> see<00:04:06.250> any<00:04:06.840> cocoons<00:04:07.840> there's<00:04:08.200> a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
I think I see any cocoons there's a

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.300 
I think I see any cocoons there's a
cocoon<00:04:08.650> right<00:04:08.860> there<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:11.230> they're<00:04:11.560> laying<00:04:11.800> all

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
cocoon right there so they're laying all

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.560 
cocoon right there so they're laying all
kinds<00:04:12.820> of<00:04:12.910> eggs<00:04:13.120> it's<00:04:13.540> early<00:04:15.180> early<00:04:16.180> spring

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
kinds of eggs it's early early spring

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.300 
kinds of eggs it's early early spring
here<00:04:17.049> I'm<00:04:17.920> recording<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.760> mid-march<00:04:19.239> and

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
here I'm recording this in mid-march and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.710 
here I'm recording this in mid-march and
the<00:04:21.310> temperatures<00:04:21.730> have<00:04:21.940> still<00:04:22.180> been<00:04:22.210> pretty

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
the temperatures have still been pretty

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.340 
the temperatures have still been pretty
cool<00:04:22.960> here<00:04:23.290> in<00:04:23.380> Texas<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.660> I'm<00:04:25.660> guessing<00:04:26.140> once

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
cool here in Texas so I'm guessing once

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.050 
cool here in Texas so I'm guessing once
we<00:04:26.500> start<00:04:26.800> having<00:04:26.950> some<00:04:27.280> consistent<00:04:27.910> days

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
we start having some consistent days

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.700 
we start having some consistent days
this<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.390> just<00:04:28.570> full<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.870> eggs<00:04:29.170> I'm<00:04:29.440> seeing

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
this is just full of eggs I'm seeing

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.670 
this is just full of eggs I'm seeing
eggs<00:04:29.860> all<00:04:30.100> over<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.370> place<00:04:30.580> or<00:04:30.760> cocoons<00:04:31.680> once

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
eggs all over the place or cocoons once

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.670 
eggs all over the place or cocoons once
we<00:04:32.800> get<00:04:32.890> some<00:04:33.070> warmer<00:04:33.340> temperatures<00:04:34.440> here<00:04:35.440> in

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
we get some warmer temperatures here in

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.940
