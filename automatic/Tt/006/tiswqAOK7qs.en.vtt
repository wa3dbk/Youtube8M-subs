 Anglo-Saxon tradition of the wealthy

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.510
 without frames for the windows they give 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.180
 more lightness to this line 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:05.940
 car from you when this is spacious 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.820

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.600
 superior with a price aligned to the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.840
 competition but with so many 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.209
 equipment included as standard 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.250

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.820
 a further reading 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.799
 a reading that does not exist on the market 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.850

 Welsh movie content brega 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.880
 the number of engines we pass 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.440
 from the four-cylinder 250 diesel syria e 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.510
 authorization we call a friend 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.970
 of the 204 horse tax that even 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.400
 manages to travel up to 20 km with a 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.190
 liter and emits only 139 grams of co2 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.019
 per kilometer and of course we arrive 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.370
 passing through the six-cylinder diesel six 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.019
 the eight- cylinder petrol cylinders 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.050
 petrol we get up to the versions 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.819
 also from 557 horses yes if externally 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.790
 the concrete shooting break is appreciated 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.280
 for the design and the proportions of coffee 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.750
 and internally perfection is the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.239
 quality of materials that amazes 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.190
 so we have ceramic coatings 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.080
 included in the package up and 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.489
 we even get to transform the 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.730
 car in one of the eight four-wheelers 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.920
 as we say, covering the canal 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.069
 of the load compartment in authentic wood of 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.440
 cherry all these materials and the 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.320
 perfection of 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.090
 of assembly are in perfect style 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.830
 mercedes of the superior categories of 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.239
 we take everything from the class you know 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.700
 that our flagship and we report it 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.160
 an experiment insert the version that 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.710
 does the lion's share in Italy 256 that 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.540
 will be available at 65 thousand euros 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.220
 we also like to emphasize presence 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.830
 of four-wheel drive on six cylinders 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.550
 diesel and on the eight-cylinder petrol with 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.550
 only 2 thousand euros of difference compared 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.950
 rear-wheel drive and today with the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.170

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.010
 sportsmanship also exists in a pepper with 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.010
 four doors 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:55.600
 indicates how fast it speeds up 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.600
 no 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.890
 but how wonderful 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.280
 and the first thing I do when I enter 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.920
 in a note stroking the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.920
 yet really beautiful 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.460
 look at how wonderful security is 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.980
 of the concrete the foot is the village of 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.210
