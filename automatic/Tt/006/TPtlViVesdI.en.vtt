00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
see on the cuff it's really not going to

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.760 
see on the cuff it's really not going to
be<00:00:28.090> too<00:00:28.420> much<00:00:28.600> of<00:00:28.660> a<00:00:28.869> curve<00:00:29.110> although<00:00:29.529> it<00:00:29.590> does

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
be too much of a curve although it does

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.560 
be too much of a curve although it does
curve<00:00:30.070> up<00:00:30.250> kind<00:00:30.520> of<00:00:30.580> a<00:00:30.670> little<00:00:31.060> bit<00:00:31.210> towards

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
curve up kind of a little bit towards

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.270 
curve up kind of a little bit towards
that<00:00:31.750> point<00:00:32.020> but<00:00:32.590> this<00:00:32.649> is<00:00:32.829> going<00:00:33.100> to<00:00:33.190> be<00:00:33.250> a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
that point but this is going to be a

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.190 
that point but this is going to be a
little<00:00:33.579> bit<00:00:33.670> more<00:00:33.940> of<00:00:34.090> a<00:00:34.180> flat<00:00:34.480> cuff<00:00:34.960> right

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
little bit more of a flat cuff right

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.470 
little bit more of a flat cuff right
there<00:00:35.380> compared<00:00:35.770> to<00:00:35.829> most<00:00:35.980> catchers<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.880> then

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
there compared to most catchers and then

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.569 
there compared to most catchers and then
going<00:00:37.960> into<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.739> break<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.280> catcher

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
going into the the break of the catcher

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.340 
going into the the break of the catcher
this<00:00:40.239> one's<00:00:40.480> actually<00:00:40.600> going<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:40.960> be<00:00:40.989> using<00:00:41.200> a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
this one's actually going to be using a

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.930 
this one's actually going to be using a
nice<00:00:41.530> wide<00:00:41.890> break<00:00:42.250> so<00:00:42.489> it's<00:00:42.610> going<00:00:42.700> to<00:00:42.760> give

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
nice wide break so it's going to give

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.370 
nice wide break so it's going to give
you<00:00:43.030> a<00:00:43.120> little<00:00:43.360> bit<00:00:43.480> more<00:00:43.690> control<00:00:44.020> with<00:00:44.260> the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
you a little bit more control with the

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.069 
you a little bit more control with the
hand<00:00:44.649> on<00:00:44.860> this<00:00:45.340> one<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.760> also<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:46.630> can<00:00:46.870> see

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
hand on this one and also you can see

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.990 
hand on this one and also you can see
they're<00:00:47.260> using<00:00:47.530> that<00:00:48.130> foam<00:00:48.460> protection

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
they're using that foam protection

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.280 
they're using that foam protection
pretty<00:00:49.270> much<00:00:49.390> throughout<00:00:49.690> in<00:00:49.840> here<00:00:50.050> as<00:00:50.140> well

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
pretty much throughout in here as well

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.870 
pretty much throughout in here as well
so<00:00:50.559> it's<00:00:50.620> going<00:00:50.770> to<00:00:50.829> help<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.070> dampen<00:00:51.550> all<00:00:51.730> the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
so it's going to help to dampen all the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.220 
so it's going to help to dampen all the
shots<00:00:52.149> you're<00:00:52.329> going<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.540> take<00:00:52.719> to<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.899> hand

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
shots you're going to take to the hand

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.930 
shots you're going to take to the hand
right<00:00:53.410> there<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:54.010> then<00:00:54.430> going<00:00:54.579> into<00:00:54.790> the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
right there and then going into the

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.310 
right there and then going into the
pocket<00:00:55.360> you<00:00:55.480> can<00:00:55.510> see<00:00:55.840> they're<00:00:55.989> using<00:00:56.230> their

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
pocket you can see they're using their

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.979 
pocket you can see they're using their
TT<00:00:56.920> pocket<00:00:57.399> design<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:58.030> what<00:00:58.570> that<00:00:58.719> does<00:00:58.930> is

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
TT pocket design and what that does is

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.450 
TT pocket design and what that does is
just<00:00:59.320> makes<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.680> pocket<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.100> little<00:01:00.340> bit

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
just makes the pocket a little bit

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.040 
just makes the pocket a little bit
deeper<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.059> little<00:01:01.090> bit<00:01:01.390> wider<00:01:01.629> so<00:01:01.960> it's

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
deeper and a little bit wider so it's

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.180 
deeper and a little bit wider so it's
going<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.260> allow<00:01:02.379> for<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.739> little<00:01:02.890> bit<00:01:03.039> better

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
going to allow for a little bit better

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.460 
going to allow for a little bit better
control<00:01:03.789> when<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:04.600> do<00:01:04.750> take<00:01:04.960> shots<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.409> the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
control when you do take shots to the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.020 
control when you do take shots to the
pocket<00:01:05.890> right<00:01:06.010> there<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.549> can<00:01:06.700> see<00:01:06.729> they're

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
pocket right there you can see they're

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.210 
pocket right there you can see they're
using<00:01:07.270> their<00:01:07.390> segmented<00:01:08.049> backhand<00:01:08.590> design<00:01:08.890> so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
using their segmented backhand design so

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.430 
using their segmented backhand design so
as<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.909> can<00:01:10.000> see<00:01:10.240> as<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.570> open<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.020> close<00:01:11.080> the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
as you can see as you open and close the

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.690 
as you can see as you open and close the
catcher<00:01:11.650> you're<00:01:12.040> still<00:01:12.280> going<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.520> remain

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
catcher you're still going to remain

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.219 
catcher you're still going to remain
completely<00:01:13.240> covered<00:01:13.780> so<00:01:13.960> it's<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.110> nice

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
completely covered so it's a nice

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.170 
completely covered so it's a nice
feature<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.650> see<00:01:14.860> on<00:01:14.979> this<00:01:15.130> one<00:01:15.369> now<00:01:15.549> taking<00:01:16.150> a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
feature to see on this one now taking a

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.789 
feature to see on this one now taking a
look<00:01:16.360> at<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.540> inside<00:01:16.869> of<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.110> catcher<00:01:17.320> right

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
look at the inside of the catcher right

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.020 
look at the inside of the catcher right
here<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.159> fingers<00:01:18.520> they're<00:01:18.700> going<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.939> be

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
here in the fingers they're going to be

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.149 
here in the fingers they're going to be
using<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:19.420> kind<00:01:19.689> of<00:01:19.810> basic<00:01:20.260> mesh<00:01:20.500> finger

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
using that kind of basic mesh finger

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.500 
using that kind of basic mesh finger
gusset<00:01:21.549> in<00:01:21.640> there<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.000> it's<00:01:22.119> going<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.299> allow<00:01:22.420> a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
gusset in there so it's going to allow a

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.149
