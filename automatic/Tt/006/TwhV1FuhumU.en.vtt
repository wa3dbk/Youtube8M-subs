Scott's got some really interesting new

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.210 
Scott's got some really interesting new
lights<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.630> are<00:00:21.810> designed<00:00:22.320> for<00:00:22.439> crew

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
lights that are designed for crew

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.220 
lights that are designed for crew
overboard<00:00:23.730> use<00:00:23.939> Scott<00:00:24.449> tell<00:00:24.660> me<00:00:24.779> about<00:00:24.869> these

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
overboard use Scott tell me about these

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.019 
overboard use Scott tell me about these
well<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> great<00:00:26.099> thing<00:00:26.130> about<00:00:26.340> these<00:00:26.699> check

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
well the great thing about these check

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.460 
well the great thing about these check
are<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.449> two<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:29.240> seamy<00:00:30.240> smart<00:00:31.019> intelligent

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
are the two the seamy smart intelligent

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.470 
are the two the seamy smart intelligent
lights<00:00:32.009> meaning<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.630> new<00:00:33.809> LED<00:00:34.649> lights

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
lights meaning that the new LED lights

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.040 
lights meaning that the new LED lights
the<00:00:36.480> operation<00:00:37.140> time<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.649> about<00:00:37.920> ten<00:00:38.670> days

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
the operation time is about ten days

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
the operation time is about ten days
versus<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.230> regular<00:00:40.530> standard<00:00:41.059> c<00:00:42.059> strobe

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
versus your regular standard c strobe

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.479 
versus your regular standard c strobe
light<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:42.989> they<00:00:43.710> come<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.040> two<00:00:44.250> different

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
light but they come in two different

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.319 
light but they come in two different
types<00:00:44.969> become<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:47.039> strobe<00:00:47.820> light<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
types become one in a strobe light and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.740 
types become one in a strobe light and
one<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.710> solid<00:00:50.129> light<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:51.180> how<00:00:51.390> does<00:00:51.449> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
one in a solid light now how does that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.600 
one in a solid light now how does that
strobe<00:00:52.079> light<00:00:52.260> differ<00:00:52.500> from<00:00:52.770> normal<00:00:52.860> strobe

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
strobe light differ from normal strobe

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.450 
strobe light differ from normal strobe
lights<00:00:53.850> well<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.129> because<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.340> an

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
lights well this is a because it's an

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.880 
lights well this is a because it's an
LED<00:00:56.940> light<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.109> brighter<00:00:58.469> light

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
LED light so it's a lot brighter light

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.060 
LED light so it's a lot brighter light
and<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.329> did<00:01:00.449> some<00:01:00.719> testing<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and I think we did some testing on and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.290 
and I think we did some testing on and
it<00:01:02.160> showed<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> much<00:01:03.059> brighter

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it showed that it was a much brighter

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.630 
it showed that it was a much brighter
light<00:01:03.629> than<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.960> regular<00:01:04.170> standard<00:01:04.640> bulb

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
light than the regular standard bulb

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.690 
light than the regular standard bulb
light<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> uniqueness<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.010> these<00:01:08.430> lights

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
light but the uniqueness of these lights

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.760 
light but the uniqueness of these lights
is<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.150> once<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.750> completely<00:01:10.380> submerge

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
is that once you completely submerge

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.070 
is that once you completely submerge
these<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.159> water<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:12.060> automatically<00:01:12.750> turn

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
these in water they automatically turn

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.140 
these in water they automatically turn
themselves<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.280> they're<00:01:14.490> water<00:01:14.729> activated

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
themselves on so they're water activated

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.640 
themselves on so they're water activated
lights<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:15.930> did<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.290> use<00:01:16.439> really

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
lights and they did they use really

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.800 
lights and they did they use really
expensive<00:01:17.130> lithium<00:01:17.670> batteries<00:01:18.150> no<00:01:18.420> sir<00:01:18.600> just

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
expensive lithium batteries no sir just

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.990 
expensive lithium batteries no sir just
regular<00:01:19.200> standard<00:01:19.500> shelf<00:01:19.950> batteries<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
regular standard shelf batteries or the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.450 
regular standard shelf batteries or the
lithium<00:01:21.390> battery<00:01:21.720> work<00:01:22.049> these<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:23.009> standard

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
lithium battery work these got standard

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
lithium battery work these got standard
batteries<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.150> them<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> said<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.350> run

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
batteries on them and like I said to run

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.070 
batteries on them and like I said to run
in<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:25.830> 10<00:01:26.070> days<00:01:26.450> unbelievable<00:01:27.450> no<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
in about 10 days unbelievable no so

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.510 
in about 10 days unbelievable no so
you've<00:01:28.200> got<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.500> strobe<00:01:28.829> light<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> an

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you've got the strobe light which is an

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.300 
you've got the strobe light which is an
LED<00:01:29.939> strobe<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:32.159> an

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
LED strobe and then this is a not an

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
LED strobe and then this is a not an
incandescent<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.360> steady<00:01:33.689> light

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
incandescent but it's a steady light

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.609 
incandescent but it's a steady light
it's<00:01:34.950> an<00:01:35.130> LED<00:01:35.659> similar<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.350> it's

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
it's an LED similar to this one but it's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.219 
it's an LED similar to this one but it's
just<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.920> solid<00:01:38.340> light<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:40.049> these

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
just a solid light that's on do these

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.130 
just a solid light that's on do these
meet<00:01:40.470> any<00:01:40.650> Coast<00:01:41.220> Guard<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.729> solace
