00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.460
 let's draw an ellipse given its two 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.619
 axes we remember that the ellipse is the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.599
 geometric place of the points whose sum 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.930
 away from two other fixed 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.970
 called foci is constant and equal to 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.880
 major axis is that which we have in 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.590
 screen as axis bird the first thing that 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.710
 we have to do will locate the two 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.100
 focuses to do this we will take the radio 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.920
 of or bird is to say medium major axis and with 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.230
 this radio will click on cee 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.530
 we draw an arc of a circle 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.770
 that will cut that major axis in two 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.550
 points these two points are both 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.550
 focuses that we look for 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.500
 we will call them raw f &amp; f 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.380
 then we will mark several 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.640
 points / efe I in this case we will mark 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.200
 8 points 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.430
 For example, we can mark each 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.190
 centimeter although it is not indispensable 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.020
 that are equidistant we are going to list 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.020
 those points from 1 to 8 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.330
 and then we will take the radio that 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.580
 goes from a to 1 and with said radio 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.659
 we draw a circle with 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.659
 center in f 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:36.080
 now we will take the radius of ba1 and with 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.330
 this radio and center in f prime we draw 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.960
 an arc of circumference that will cut 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.170
 the previous one 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.810
 in two points we already have both 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.659
 first points of the ellipse except 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.750
 of the ends of the axes that gave me 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.780
 in the statement 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.180
 I will call them 1a and 1b in reference 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.780
 to the point that I used to find it 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.900
 then with radio to 2 and center 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.900
 In efe we ​​draw another circumference 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.910
 with radio 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.280
 two 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.620
 and center in this case efe prima 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.870
 draw another circumference arc 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.870
 that cuts to the previous 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.360
 two other points 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.569
 points also of the ellipse sought and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.650
 which we will call 2a and 2b in reference to 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.650
 that number 2 that we have used 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.230
 we are repeating that step radio to 3 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.099
 center in efe 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.099
 circumference 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.260
 radius of 3 center in prime f 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.140
 of circumference 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.040
 cut the previous one in two other points of 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.040
 the ellipse sought 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.710
 we call them 3a 3b 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:24.280
 we will repeat this operation 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.280
 with points 4 5 6 and 7 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.280
 in the same way 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.480
 which we did with the three 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.580
 first 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.980
 that is why the process is repeated 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.370
 so we have accelerated this part 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.370
 of the video 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.910
 point 6 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.370
 7 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.130
 with point 8 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.280
 ok we have the points on the side 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.349
 left of the ellipse now let's 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.200
 find the points on the right side of the 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.269
 ellipse for them we take the radios 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.849
 previous but in this case we are going to 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.760
 alternate the centers for example we take 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.190
 the radius to 1 and instead of taking as 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.489
 center ene efe we ​​take as center efe 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.489
 cousin 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.810
 then 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:32.940
 v 1 and instead of taking center in f prime 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.940
 in this case we will take it on 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.630
 we already have two other points of the ellipse 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.320
 that are going to be symmetrical 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.530
 the minor axis of points 1a and 1b that 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.050
 let's call 1 c and one of repeat the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.590
 operation 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.590
 radio to 2 center in f prime 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.590
 circumference 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.510
 within 2 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.560
 center ene efe 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.560
 circumference arch 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.270
 and we have two more points 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:25.570
 2 3 and 2 of repeated with 3 to 3 center 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.570
 prima f 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.849
 ib3 center in f 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.380
 You see that the process is repeated 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.750
 constantly 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.560
 that is, if we are clear about the 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.690
 procedure with a point 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.160
 we will have it clear in all the 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.530
 process 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.610
 that's why we 're going to accelerate this 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.099
 part of the video 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.580
 so that it does not become too heavy anymore 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:05.569
 that the same process is repeated 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:10.449
 with points 4 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:13.469
 5 6 7 and 8 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.469
 we have 5 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.900
 You see we have not commented that the ellipse is 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.720
 a curve that we find by approximation 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:28.700
 that is to say by points the more points 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.700
 we find more precision 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:36.499
 there we have 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.859
 then when we already have all 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.319
 the points what we have to do is 

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:47.749
 draw the curve we can draw it to 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.749
 hand or with help of curves template
