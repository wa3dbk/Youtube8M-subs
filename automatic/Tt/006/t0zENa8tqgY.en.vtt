00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.190
 for 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.619
 desire 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.460
 this 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.809
 Well guys and girls once again 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.789
 just like with space 3 I forgot 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.180
 put the interest of the end of the 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.009
 credits in the video but good this 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.229
 it's always an opportunity that I 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.790
 explain that you believe in 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.820
 comments that you explain to me that you think 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.009
 what's going to happen or what do you think that has 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.170
 been history not this open end 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.210
 is that history is key in plan 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.180
 origin that do not want to give it a final 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.909
 closed for people to talk about it 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.710
 or think one thing or think another what 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.810
 You think I'm very interested, you know 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.149
 to read your comments in the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.700
 down the video and I would love to 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.340
 truth that was debated and between all 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.799
 We debate that what happens in this game no 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.720
 that has passed to the end and that also 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.369
 this game is going to have dlcs just like the 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.020
 space 3 then it 's pretty fun 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.799
 debate it because then they take out the dlc already 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.920
 the best questions are answered 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.750
 some or affirm do not refuse the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.820
 the propositions of some and others do not 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.229
 so it's always fun to talk 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.790
 of these issues and I hope that in the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.890
 comments we can have a good 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.479
 discussion about this ending and this 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.880
 I play in general because it is a great game 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.160
 authentic and little more boys and girls 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.260
 I hope you have loved this this 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.150
 lg is very brief but I hope we can 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.220
 have a good opinion here all and 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.220
 little like that and until next time
