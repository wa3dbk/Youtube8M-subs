driving eastbound on highway 50 when I

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.860

first<00:02:29.770> thought<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.010> was<00:02:30.130> probably<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.970> bunch<00:02:31.630> of

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
first thought it was probably a bunch of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.210 
first thought it was probably a bunch of
helicopters<00:02:32.260> flying<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.680> some<00:02:32.860> type<00:02:33.070> of

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.949 
formation as I drew closer to it I saw
it<00:02:38.320> start<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.770> cross<00:02:38.950> over<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> roadway<00:02:39.959> it

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959

could see something that they were
attached<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.770> was<00:02:47.860> shaped<00:02:48.070> like<00:02:48.190> a

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
attached to and it was shaped like a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.280 
attached to and it was shaped like a
triangle

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290
