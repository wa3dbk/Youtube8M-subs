part so this sort site regulates the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.630 
part so this sort site regulates the
charging<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.020> there's<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> charger<00:01:08.430> there

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
charging and there's a charger there

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640

at that very boring blah blah blah move
on<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> next<00:01:22.650> bit<00:01:23.570> ok<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.150> outdoor

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
on to next bit ok this is the outdoor

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.350 
on to next bit ok this is the outdoor
hull<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.130> don't<00:01:29.280> want<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.939> the

hull so if you don't want to have the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.660 
hull so if you don't want to have the
other<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.159> looks

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
other one you can have this one looks

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.880 
other one you can have this one looks
very<00:01:32.909> cool<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.540> obviously<00:01:33.960> their<00:01:34.380> propeller

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
very cool and obviously their propeller

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
very cool and obviously their propeller
blades<00:01:35.189> are<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.640> exposed<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.840> you're<00:01:37.049> more

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
blades are all exposed so you're more

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.010 
blades are all exposed so you're more
likely<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.950> ruin<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.329> i<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.840> already

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
likely to ruin it and and i have already

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.800 
likely to ruin it and and i have already
but<00:01:40.500> I've<00:01:40.710> ordered<00:01:41.040> some<00:01:41.189> spare<00:01:41.610> parts<00:01:41.820> this

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
but I've ordered some spare parts this

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.010 
but I've ordered some spare parts this
is<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.350> shell<00:01:43.890> itself<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.759> got<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.570> camera

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
is the shell itself it's got the camera

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.069 
is the shell itself it's got the camera
on<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> bottom<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.740> reset<00:01:47.250> switch<00:01:48.079> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
on the bottom there reset switch and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.679 
on the bottom there reset switch and
it's<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.409> some<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.310> two<00:01:50.939> circles<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.600> you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
it's got some the two circles that you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.590 
it's got some the two circles that you
saw<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:52.110> actually<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.619> help<00:01:52.649> balance<00:01:53.280> it

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
saw there actually to help balance it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.450 
saw there actually to help balance it
and<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.840> whole<00:01:54.990> unit<00:01:55.439> itself<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.920> very<00:01:55.979> light

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and the whole unit itself is very light

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.800 
and the whole unit itself is very light
so<00:01:56.909> finally<00:01:57.210> we'll<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.290> look<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
so finally we'll just look at the the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.179 
so finally we'll just look at the the
information<00:02:00.810> booklets<00:02:01.259> or<00:02:01.469> warranty<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
information booklets or warranty and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.830 
information booklets or warranty and
then<00:02:02.610> these<00:02:02.759> are<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.060> stickers<00:02:03.329> these<00:02:03.719> are

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
then these are the stickers these are

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.459 
then these are the stickers these are
