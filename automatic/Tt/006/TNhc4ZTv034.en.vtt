welcome to my minecraft train switching

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.409 
welcome to my minecraft train switching
station

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
station

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.860 
station
I<00:00:03.500> wanted<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.620> train<00:00:04.830> station<00:00:05.310> that<00:00:05.690> allowed<00:00:06.690> me

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
I wanted a train station that allowed me

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.720 
I wanted a train station that allowed me
to<00:00:06.899> have<00:00:07.140> my<00:00:07.350> cart<00:00:07.649> sit<00:00:08.040> there<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.519> wait<00:00:08.700> for

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
to have my cart sit there and wait for

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.570 
to have my cart sit there and wait for
me<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.030> get<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.660> then<00:00:09.900> launch<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.590> that

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
me to get in and then launch it and that

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.160 
me to get in and then launch it and that
could<00:00:11.880> switch<00:00:12.120> me<00:00:12.300> out<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.540> multiple<00:00:12.870> tracks

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
could switch me out to multiple tracks

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.350 
could switch me out to multiple tracks
so<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.160> you're<00:00:14.280> seeing<00:00:14.490> here<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.849> my

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
so what you're seeing here is my

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.300 
so what you're seeing here is my
incoming<00:00:16.080> tracks<00:00:16.440> I'll<00:00:16.650> go<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.100> one

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
incoming tracks I'll go to that one

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.590 
incoming tracks I'll go to that one
track<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> way<00:00:19.260> out<00:00:20.240> they<00:00:21.240> come<00:00:21.449> up

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
track and on the way out they come up

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.750 
track and on the way out they come up
here<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.050> each<00:00:22.740> track<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.220> individually

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
here and each track is individually

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.120 
here and each track is individually
switched<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:27.170> and<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.619> under<00:00:28.890> here

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
switched out and you can see under here

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.580 
switched out and you can see under here
that<00:00:29.310> I'm<00:00:29.880> using<00:00:30.150> redstone<00:00:30.599> torches<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.289> power

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that I'm using redstone torches to power

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.830 
that I'm using redstone torches to power
the<00:00:31.859> switching<00:00:32.250> underground<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.450> wiring

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the switching underground there's wiring

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.310 
the switching underground there's wiring
and<00:00:33.960> I'll<00:00:34.050> show<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:34.739> while

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
and I'll show you that in a little while

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.420 
and I'll show you that in a little while
so<00:00:37.320> basically<00:00:37.710> I've<00:00:37.890> got<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.280> outgoing

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
so basically I've got for outgoing

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.580 
so basically I've got for outgoing
tracks<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.540> click<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> button<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
which one is selected then you get in

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.510 
which one is selected then you get in
the<00:00:45.180> cart<00:00:45.450> press<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> button<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.710> wait<00:00:47.460> for

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
the cart press the button and wait for

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.740 
the cart press the button and wait for
the<00:00:47.760> booster<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.090> launch<00:00:48.360> you

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.389 

in<00:00:56.260> order<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.530> get<00:00:56.649> some<00:00:56.800> of<00:00:56.829> that<00:00:57.010> switching

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
in order to get some of that switching

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.680 
in order to get some of that switching
done<00:00:57.579> I<00:00:57.609> used<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.440> Southwest<00:00:59.440> rule<00:01:00.629> thanks<00:01:01.629> to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
done I used the Southwest rule thanks to

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.779 
done I used the Southwest rule thanks to
Almighty<00:01:01.809> Bob's<00:01:02.289> tutorials<00:01:03.100> for<00:01:03.309> teaching<00:01:03.640> me

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
Almighty Bob's tutorials for teaching me

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.990 
Almighty Bob's tutorials for teaching me
how<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.629> trains<00:01:04.960> worked<00:01:05.199> in<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.470> game

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
how the trains worked in the game

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.370 
how the trains worked in the game
basically<00:01:07.000> when<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.299> track<00:01:07.600> intersects<00:01:08.200> with

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
basically when a track intersects with

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.800 
basically when a track intersects with
another<00:01:08.440> track<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.790> Minecraft<00:01:10.299> karts<00:01:10.690> are

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
another track the Minecraft karts are

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.499 
another track the Minecraft karts are
going<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.020> favor<00:01:11.259> going<00:01:11.680> south<00:01:11.950> or<00:01:12.159> west<00:01:12.190> and<00:01:12.729> I

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
going to favor going south or west and I

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.070 
going to favor going south or west and I
use<00:01:13.690> that<00:01:13.899> all<00:01:13.930> over<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.350> place<00:01:14.680> as<00:01:15.040> I<00:01:16.080> emerged

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
use that all over the place as I emerged

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.859 
use that all over the place as I emerged
tracks<00:01:17.440> together<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.940> down<00:01:19.090> in<00:01:19.240> my<00:01:19.360> mind<00:01:19.630> here

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
tracks together so down in my mind here

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.180 
tracks together so down in my mind here
I've<00:01:19.990> got<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.320> same<00:01:20.470> sort<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.830> booster

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
I've got the same sort of booster

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.100 
I've got the same sort of booster
launching<00:01:21.549> system<00:01:21.940> let's<00:01:22.390> click<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.720> button

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
launching system let's click the button

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:49.109 
launching system let's click the button
and<00:01:23.259> have<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.619> take<00:01:23.799> us<00:01:23.920> back<00:01:24.100> up<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.490> top

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.149 

so<00:01:50.020> now<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.259> we're<00:01:50.380> back<00:01:50.500> let's<00:01:50.710> take<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:50.979> look

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
so now that we're back let's take a look

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.490 
so now that we're back let's take a look
in<00:01:51.310> detail<00:01:51.729> you<00:01:52.329> see<00:01:52.509> my<00:01:52.630> cart<00:01:52.929> won't<00:01:53.109> start

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
in detail you see my cart won't start

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.120 
in detail you see my cart won't start
until<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.549> actually<00:01:54.729> get<00:01:55.060> in<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.359> you<00:01:56.130> press

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
until you actually get in it you press

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.590 
until you actually get in it you press
the<00:01:57.310> button<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.789> car<00:01:57.819> won't<00:01:58.119> move<00:01:58.299> what<00:01:58.569> I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
the button and the car won't move what I

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.999 
the button and the car won't move what I
did<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.899> I<00:01:58.990> put<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.170> stone<00:01:59.439> pressure<00:01:59.710> plate

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
did is I put a stone pressure plate

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.950 
did is I put a stone pressure plate
under<00:02:00.250> there<00:02:00.429> so<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:00.909> won't<00:02:01.000> activate<00:02:01.359> until

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
under there so it won't activate until

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.429 
under there so it won't activate until

you are in the cart and what I've done

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.219 
you are in the cart and what I've done
in<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.250> background<00:02:06.700> here<00:02:07.000> is<00:02:07.929> I've<00:02:08.080> got<00:02:08.110> a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.860 
there's my booster carts right there now
the<00:02:21.040> RS<00:02:21.370> nor<00:02:21.549> latch<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.299> heart<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.660> my

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
the RS nor latch is the heart of my

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.250 
the RS nor latch is the heart of my
entire<00:02:23.200> train<00:02:23.530> system<00:02:24.329> it<00:02:25.329> basically<00:02:25.780> once<00:02:26.110> it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
entire train system it basically once it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.680 
entire train system it basically once it
gets<00:02:26.500> set<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.890> keeps<00:02:27.160> its<00:02:27.579> signal<00:02:27.940> high<00:02:28.120> until

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
gets set it keeps its signal high until

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.630 
gets set it keeps its signal high until
it<00:02:29.049> gets<00:02:29.260> reset<00:02:29.680> here's<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.250> reset<00:02:30.610> line

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
it gets reset here's the reset line

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.949 
it gets reset here's the reset line
going<00:02:31.150> back<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.630> pressure<00:02:31.870> plate<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:35.700> so

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
going back to the pressure plate and so

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.479 
going back to the pressure plate and so
you'll<00:02:37.959> see<00:02:37.989> up<00:02:38.260> here<00:02:38.290> on<00:02:38.650> my<00:02:38.829> booster

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
you'll see up here on my booster

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.970 
you'll see up here on my booster
it's<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.239> booster<00:02:40.750> loop<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.530> piece<00:02:41.829> of

the circuitry when you press a button
the<00:03:05.500> signal<00:03:06.040> goes<00:03:06.220> out<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.690> basically<00:03:07.690> have<00:03:07.900> two

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
the signal goes out I basically have two

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.089 
the signal goes out I basically have two
RS<00:03:08.440> nor<00:03:08.680> latch<00:03:08.739> 'iz<00:03:09.510> representing<00:03:10.510> my<00:03:11.099> two

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.360 
RS nor latch 'iz representing my two
digits<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.900> each<00:03:13.900> button<00:03:14.349> either<00:03:14.799> sets<00:03:15.190> or

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
digits and each button either sets or

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.520 
digits and each button either sets or
resets<00:03:15.819> the<00:03:16.120> appropriate<00:03:16.660> latches<00:03:17.109> to<00:03:17.410> give

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
resets the appropriate latches to give

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.199 
resets the appropriate latches to give
me<00:03:17.620> four<00:03:17.859> combinations<00:03:18.519> coming<00:03:18.849> out<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.090> them

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
me four combinations coming out of them

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.569 
me four combinations coming out of them
there's<00:03:19.389> the<00:03:19.540> latch<00:03:19.720> one<00:03:20.019> here's<00:03:20.980> latch<00:03:21.220> two

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
there's the latch one here's latch two

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.879 
there's the latch one here's latch two
and<00:03:22.109> then<00:03:23.109> out<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.220> latches<00:03:24.819> I<00:03:25.889> condensed

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
and then out of the latches I condensed

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.460 
and then out of the latches I condensed
them<00:03:27.069> into<00:03:27.900> four<00:03:28.900> wires<00:03:29.310> one<00:03:30.310> for<00:03:30.549> each<00:03:30.700> track

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
them into four wires one for each track

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.870 
them into four wires one for each track
so<00:03:32.470> you'll<00:03:32.620> see<00:03:32.799> here<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.040> only<00:03:33.489> one<00:03:33.669> track

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
so you'll see here that only one track

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.729 
so you'll see here that only one track
is<00:03:34.150> powered<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.900> other<00:03:35.019> ones<00:03:35.230> are<00:03:35.380> turned<00:03:35.590> off

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
is powered the other ones are turned off

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.409 
is powered the other ones are turned off
and<00:03:35.799> that<00:03:36.040> controls<00:03:36.639> which<00:03:36.849> tracks<00:03:37.150> are<00:03:37.299> going

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
and that controls which tracks are going

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.770 
and that controls which tracks are going
to<00:03:37.480> be<00:03:37.540> switched<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.760> rise<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.030> signal<00:03:40.389> up<00:03:40.540> with

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
to be switched I rise the signal up with

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.990 
to be switched I rise the signal up with
those<00:03:40.959> torches<00:03:41.410> there<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.829> then<00:03:42.519> I<00:03:42.549> run<00:03:42.819> them

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
those torches there and then I run them

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
those torches there and then I run them
back<00:03:43.150> on<00:03:43.450> these<00:03:43.599> rails

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.560 

back<00:03:46.710> up<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.520> rest<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.970> system<00:03:48.540> I

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
back up to the rest of the system I

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.210 
back up to the rest of the system I
decided<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.290> go<00:03:49.410> vertical<00:03:49.650> rather<00:03:50.040> than

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
decided to go vertical rather than

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.970 
decided to go vertical rather than
horizontal<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:51.200> save<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.230> little<00:03:52.410> bit<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.650> space

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
horizontal to save a little bit of space

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.520 
horizontal to save a little bit of space
but<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.340> took<00:03:53.550> a<00:03:53.610> quite<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.510> bit<00:03:54.960> of<00:03:55.080> vertical

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
but it took a quite a bit of vertical

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.050 
but it took a quite a bit of vertical
room<00:03:55.710> I<00:03:55.830> was<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.010> little<00:03:56.250> surprised<00:03:56.610> how<00:03:56.760> big<00:03:56.910> it

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
room I was a little surprised how big it

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.680 
room I was a little surprised how big it
ended<00:03:57.270> up<00:03:57.390> being<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:59.190> here<00:03:59.490> you<00:03:59.610> can<00:03:59.820> see<00:04:00.090> the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
ended up being so here you can see the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.350 
ended up being so here you can see the
the<00:04:01.470> wires<00:04:01.680> go<00:04:01.980> up<00:04:02.100> top<00:04:02.370> here<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.820> power<00:04:03.120> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
the wires go up top here to power the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.360 
the wires go up top here to power the
lights<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.930> then<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.710> originally<00:04:05.130> had<00:04:05.250> them

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
lights and then I originally had them

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.890 
lights and then I originally had them
going<00:04:05.520> over<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.850> roof<00:04:06.060> but<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.360> decided<00:04:06.690> it

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
going over the roof but I decided it

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.150 
going over the roof but I decided it
looked<00:04:07.140> better<00:04:07.320> if<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.650> ran<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.010> wires

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
looked better if I ran the wires

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.910 
looked better if I ran the wires
underground<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:09.150> power<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.510> tracks<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.620> all

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
underground to power the tracks so all

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.120 
underground to power the tracks so all
four<00:04:11.250> wires<00:04:11.520> now<00:04:11.850> run<00:04:12.090> underground<00:04:12.800> all<00:04:13.800> the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
four wires now run underground all the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.330 
four wires now run underground all the
way<00:04:14.250> out<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.180> track<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.440> you'll<00:04:17.130> see<00:04:17.310> a

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
way out to the track and you'll see a

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.070 
way out to the track and you'll see a
lot<00:04:17.550> of<00:04:17.580> these<00:04:17.760> not<00:04:18.150> gates<00:04:18.480> along<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.959> way

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
lot of these not gates along the way

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.530 
lot of these not gates along the way
that<00:04:19.260> keeps<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.770> signals<00:04:20.340> going<00:04:20.549> wires<00:04:21.270> only

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
that keeps the signals going wires only

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.970 
that keeps the signals going wires only
go<00:04:21.660> 15<00:04:21.950> blocks<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.250> game<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.740> now<00:04:28.920> we

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
go 15 blocks in the game and so now we

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.280 
go 15 blocks in the game and so now we
get<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.690> torches<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.840> are<00:04:30.930> actually

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
get to the torches that are actually

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.220 
get to the torches that are actually
powering<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.980> tracks<00:04:32.900> there's<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.960> couple

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
powering the tracks there's a couple

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.690 
powering the tracks there's a couple
torches<00:04:34.650> above<00:04:34.950> them<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:35.280> you'll<00:04:35.400> see<00:04:35.550> here

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
torches above them so you'll see here

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.220 
torches above them so you'll see here
that<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.030> one<00:04:36.210> that's<00:04:36.360> turned<00:04:36.720> off<00:04:36.960> is

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
that the one that's turned off is

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.470 
that the one that's turned off is
actually<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.860> Select<00:04:38.460> track<00:04:38.850> right<00:04:39.120> now

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480

another quick look at them so you'll see

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.860 
another quick look at them so you'll see

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
delay because of how long the circuits

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.440 
delay because of how long the circuits
are<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:59.190> whichever<00:04:59.460> one<00:04:59.670> you<00:04:59.820> press<00:05:00.090> the
