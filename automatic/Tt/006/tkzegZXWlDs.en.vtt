00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
so when I contour I like to take my base

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.470 
so when I contour I like to take my base
foundation<00:00:11.280> shade<00:00:11.519> which<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.059> case<00:00:12.269> is

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
foundation shade which in this case is

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.419 
foundation shade which in this case is
golden<00:00:12.870> olive<00:00:13.230> because<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.679> get<00:00:13.950> pretty<00:00:14.099> tan

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
golden olive because I do get pretty tan

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.240 
golden olive because I do get pretty tan
and<00:00:14.759> mix<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.839> with<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> few<00:00:16.260> drops<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.770> dark

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
and mix it in with a few drops of dark

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.010 
and mix it in with a few drops of dark
almond<00:00:17.730> now<00:00:17.910> dark<00:00:18.180> almond<00:00:18.539> has<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> same

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
almond now dark almond has the same

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.109 
almond now dark almond has the same
undertone<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.740> golden<00:00:20.070> olive<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> find<00:00:20.880> that

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
undertone is golden olive so I find that

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.960 
undertone is golden olive so I find that
it<00:00:21.359> makes<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.810> very<00:00:21.840> natural<00:00:22.619> contour<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.880> I'm

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
it makes a very natural contour so I'm

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.089 
it makes a very natural contour so I'm
taking<00:00:24.300> 3<00:00:24.570> drops<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> dark<00:00:25.470> almond<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
taking 3 drops of the dark almond and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.070 
taking 3 drops of the dark almond and
adding<00:00:26.400> two<00:00:26.609> drops<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.210> golden<00:00:27.570> olive<00:00:27.930> if

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
adding two drops that be golden olive if

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.769 
adding two drops that be golden olive if
you<00:00:28.199> want<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.500> more<00:00:28.710> intense<00:00:29.220> contour<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.570> add

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you want a more intense contour just add

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.770 
you want a more intense contour just add
one<00:00:31.109> drop<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.769> your<00:00:31.890> foundation<00:00:32.579> base<00:00:33.450> color

one drop of your foundation base color
to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.829> deeper<00:00:35.190> color<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.790> will<00:00:35.880> give

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
to the deeper color and that will give

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.090 
to the deeper color and that will give
you<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.480> bit<00:00:36.660> darker<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> shade<00:00:37.410> so

when I contour I like to start at the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510 
when I contour I like to start at the
top<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.469> ear<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:41.100> blend<00:00:41.340> down

too<00:00:56.010> harsh<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> line<00:00:56.940> remember<00:00:57.300> also<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.899> get

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
too harsh of a line remember also to get

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.799 
too harsh of a line remember also to get
the<00:00:58.379> base<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> apples<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.520> cheeks

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
the base of the apples of your cheeks

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.209 
the base of the apples of your cheeks
just<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.989> make<00:01:01.170> sure<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.649> all<00:01:01.800> blended

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
just to make sure that it's all blended

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.799 
just to make sure that it's all blended
really<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.850> find<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.270> when<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.420> don't<00:01:03.690> do

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
really well I find that when I don't do

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.479 
really well I find that when I don't do
the<00:01:03.930> base<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> apples<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:04.890> cheeks<00:01:05.280> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the base of the apples of my cheeks it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
the base of the apples of my cheeks it
gives<00:01:05.700> too<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.689> differentiating<00:01:07.439> line

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
gives too much of a differentiating line

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.620 
gives too much of a differentiating line
between<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.189> contour<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> blush<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.570> you

between my contour and the blush and you
don't<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.560> want<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> have

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
don't want that because you want to have

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
don't want that because you want to have
the<00:01:11.130> most<00:01:11.250> natural<00:01:11.700> contour<00:01:12.150> possible<00:01:12.720> I'm

here there is a quick way to fix it what

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.650 
here there is a quick way to fix it what
I<00:02:34.160> like<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.580> do<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.910> just<00:02:35.090> take<00:02:35.300> my<00:02:35.330> base

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
I like to do is just take my base

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.570 
I like to do is just take my base
foundation<00:02:36.260> shade<00:02:36.470> which<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.709> golden<00:02:37.190> olive

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
foundation shade which is golden olive

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.729 
foundation shade which is golden olive
and<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:38.209> lightly<00:02:38.390> spray<00:02:38.690> over<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.680> that

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
and just lightly spray over of that

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.280 
and just lightly spray over of that
harsh<00:02:40.310> line<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.270> find<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.690> doing<00:02:42.110> this

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
harsh line and I find that doing this

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.520 
harsh line and I find that doing this
gives<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.520> most<00:02:43.670> natural<00:02:43.910> blending<00:02:44.780> that

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
gives you the most natural blending that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.520 
gives you the most natural blending that
you<00:02:45.709> can<00:02:45.920> get<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.550> it'll<00:02:46.850> also<00:02:47.030> not<00:02:47.660> cover<00:02:48.110> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
you can get and it'll also not cover the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.020 
you can get and it'll also not cover the
contour<00:02:48.950> completely<00:02:49.459> which<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.730> don't<00:02:49.880> want

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
contour completely which you don't want

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.550 
contour completely which you don't want
to<00:02:50.120> do<00:02:50.269> which<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.600> why<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:50.840> contour<00:02:51.230> our<00:02:51.260> noses

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
to do which is why we contour our noses

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.740 
to do which is why we contour our noses
you<00:02:51.860> want<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.130> see<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.400> contour<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.630> is

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
you want to see that contour so this is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.180 
you want to see that contour so this is
a<00:02:53.780> nice<00:02:54.019> way<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.260> go<00:02:54.500> ahead<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.830> correct<00:02:55.070> that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
mistake without covering it completely

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.920 
mistake without covering it completely
remember<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.739> blend<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.069> all<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.310> way<00:02:58.430> up<00:02:58.640> and
