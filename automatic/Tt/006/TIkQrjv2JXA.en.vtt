vehicle you can see also on the side of
the<00:00:27.630> frame<00:00:27.810> we've<00:00:28.289> got<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.590> hole<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:30.029> below

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the frame we've got this hole just below

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.870 
the frame we've got this hole just below
this<00:00:30.689> square<00:00:30.990> slot<00:00:31.520> we're<00:00:32.520> also<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> be

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
this square slot we're also going to be

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.639 
this square slot we're also going to be
putting<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.120> bolt<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.570> block<00:00:34.170> into<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.559> frame

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
putting a bolt and block into the frame

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.790 
putting a bolt and block into the frame
and<00:00:35.130> pulling<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.270> way<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.380> that'll

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and pulling it out this way and that'll

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.440 
and pulling it out this way and that'll
provide<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.190> attaching<00:00:38.850> point<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> side

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
provide it attaching point on the side

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.630 
provide it attaching point on the side
of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.660> frame<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> again<00:00:40.980> that'll<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
of the frame and again that'll be the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.799 
of the frame and again that'll be the
same<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.940> both<00:00:41.969> sides<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> vehicle

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
same on both sides of the vehicle

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.060 
same on both sides of the vehicle
looking<00:00:43.410> over<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:43.620> at<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> driver<00:00:43.950> side

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
looking over here at the driver side

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.619 
looking over here at the driver side
again<00:00:44.579> we're<00:00:44.760> using<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> same<00:00:45.210> attaching

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
again we're using the same attaching

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.229 
again we're using the same attaching
points<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.399> two<00:00:47.610> middle

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
points but you can see the two middle

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.180 
points but you can see the two middle
weld<00:00:48.480> nuts<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.680> any<00:00:49.829> bolts<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
weld nuts don't have any bolts and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.799 
weld nuts don't have any bolts and
apparently<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.820> there's<00:00:51.449> quite<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.660> bit<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
apparently and there's quite a bit of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
apparently and there's quite a bit of
rust<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.170> corrosion<00:00:52.379> built<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:52.980> them<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
rust and corrosion built up in them so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.310 
rust and corrosion built up in them so
the<00:00:54.239> first<00:00:54.420> thing<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> go

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the first thing we want to do is to go

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.959 
the first thing we want to do is to go
ahead<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.559> clean<00:00:55.739> those<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.699> insure<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
ahead and clean those out to insure that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.670 
ahead and clean those out to insure that
the<00:00:57.180> bolts<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.690> easier<00:00:57.960> once<00:00:58.530> we've

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the bolts go in easier once we've

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.750 
the bolts go in easier once we've
confirmed<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.489> go<00:00:59.550> ahead<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
confirmed that we can go ahead and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.310 
confirmed that we can go ahead and
remove<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.420> bolts<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.809> are<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> bottom

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
remove the bolts that are at the bottom

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.990 
remove the bolts that are at the bottom
of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.440> frame<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.800> both<00:01:01.949> sides<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.789> we'll<00:01:02.910> go

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
of the frame on both sides and we'll go

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.740 
of the frame on both sides and we'll go
ahead<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.149> put<00:01:03.300> our<00:01:03.329> hitch<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.750> position

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.450

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
arm that we just removed the bolt from

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.899 
arm that we just removed the bolt from
that's<00:01:13.920> actually<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> stay<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.729> here

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that's actually going to stay on here

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.210 
that's actually going to stay on here
when<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.659> put<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> hitch<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.049> into<00:01:16.350> place<00:01:16.500> the
