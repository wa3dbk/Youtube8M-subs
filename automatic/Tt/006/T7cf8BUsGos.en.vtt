00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:07.930
 [Music] 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.240
 after separating all the material 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.980
 required 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.200
 we should explain to the patient that 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.900
 procedure will be done 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.870
 we put a screen to guarantee the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.720
 privacy of the patient and can 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.020
 a screen we will discover the region 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.530
 patient perineal keeping your 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.820
 covered chest 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.050
 we should have a tray of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:46.129
 criterion catheterization this tray will be 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.250
 placed between the patient's legs and 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.030
 will be carefully opened by the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.030
 nursing professional 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.360
 we should note that this flag must 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.360
 being sealed thereby ensuring stereo 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.090
 we will also observe that the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.360
 nursing will open this tray without 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.350
 contaminate the inside and inside 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.579
 from this tray we will find a tub 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.869
 which will receive urine from the patient and a 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:30.100
 rounder that will be used to place 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.100
 an antiseptic solution 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:45.870
 we note then that the antiseptic solution 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 is placed in the smaller tub taking care 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.470
 to avoid contamination inside the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.860
 tray 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.500
 two 20 ml languages ​​are still required 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.670
 for male characterization 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.330
 the first syringe will be filled with 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.380
 local anesthetic and the second will be 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.380
 filled with water 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:15.060
 we will open the urethral ground pate 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:21.630
 stereo not contaminating the catheter nor 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:25.100
 the interior of the collector tray in 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.530
 will be connected later to the catheter 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.800
 can be opened by touching 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.800
 interior 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:41.570
 we should close your bottom exit to 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.930
 prevent loss of urine to the floor 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.690
 we should position this collector 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.310
 facilitate after the connection with 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.310
 the second after placed 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.660
 we note that the broker must be 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.489
 hanging next to the patient's bed and 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.340
 your connection gets the closest 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:11.510
 from the digital site to the catheter 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.510
 pride and trauma 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.450
 we note that one of the amendments was 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.540
 filled with water for later 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.640
 inflamed soap and the second 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.780
 about 20 should be filled with 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.180
 local anesthetic the type of alleles that 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.510
 will serve to lubricate more athlete 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:40.170
 patient before introducing the probe 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:42.150
 through the name to the tour this should 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.670
 see this black with approximately 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.330
 8 to 10 ml of the local anesthetic jelly 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.180
 and distilled water to ignite the bonnet 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.810
 should be 5 to 10 ml 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.819
 we take the waves out of its shell 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.209
 and we have already noticed that the 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.890
 nursing professional is 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.060
 wearing gloves 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.610
 sterile the correct way of pants 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.480
 sterile gloves can still be seen 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.840
 in this cd in the procedure put on gloves 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.840
 sterile 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:29.820
 we should put a field made masters 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:33.600
 the future, and the patient with 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:38.960
 the party including the patient's penis 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.960
 we approach the vial of the patient's penis 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.789
 patient's weight should be insured with 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.100
 the non-dominant hand in the case of this 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.050
 with the left hand that should be 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.860
 be placed on the right angle 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:05:00.510
 perpendicular to perry antisepsis should 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.860
 be always made of the half acted letral 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.860
 to the periphery 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.289
 we observed that the professional 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:15.660
 begins to name the act and always 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:19.849
 to the periphery so as to surround 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.849
 the patient's entire glans 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:31.169
 we observed once again an anti 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:34.410
 sepsis in order to avoid further 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.199
 a rear urinary infection 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.070
 lack of asepsis care during 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.070
 a characterization 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:58.420
 we see once again the uncertainty 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:04.490
 and finally for antisepsis 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:07.160
 named Natal after antisepsis 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.470
 we must lubricate the urethra of the 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.460
 patient with local anesthetic type 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.890
 jelly after the introduction of the anesthetic 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.740
 place we should compress the glans per 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.890
 two to three seconds to avoid leaving 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.930
 of the local anesthetic 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.540
 after this moment we will begin the 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.070
 introduction of the catheter through the urethra 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.340
 of the patient 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:35.050
 The magic quartet flax should be 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.050
 introduced in its entirety 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:44.540
 after insertion of the catheter we should 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:47.090
 inflate the monet of the catheter with the syringe 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.740
 containing distilled water in a volume 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:54.440
 can range from 5 to 10 ml 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:59.990
 after inflate bonetti 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:03.470
 we will make a slight pull on the catheter to 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:06.050
 confirm that the value is full 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.120
 urine output through the 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:12.130
 catheter is that it is a confirmation of 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.960
 correct positioning of the catheter 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.150
 we note that the kidney tub must be 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.520
 positioned in order to receive your 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.310
 line to prevent urine from falling on the bed 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.620
 of the patient 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:28.250
 we removed the field taught and 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.740
 connect the catheter to the collector 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:34.660
 was positioned near the region 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.660
 digital catheter 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:43.280
 after connecting the catheter to the collector 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:47.890
 We'll test the band again, we'll fix it. 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:51.290
 the patient's thigh catheter 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:54.940
 remove the glove so we can manipulate 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:59.420
 more easy Mexico stepfather 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:02.960
 we put together 

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:06.800
 and then with another piece of 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.580
 taping xix we will be probe the thigh 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.580
 of the patient
