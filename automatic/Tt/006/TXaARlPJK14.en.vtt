00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
turns out before embellisher so I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.440 
turns out before embellisher so I
completely<00:01:43.020> followed<00:01:44.960> her<00:01:45.960> tutorial<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.450> she

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
completely followed her tutorial and she

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.819 
completely followed her tutorial and she
made<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.020> pages<00:01:49.350> from<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.460> 4<00:01:51.090> card<00:01:51.829> basically

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
made the pages from a 4 card basically

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.149 
made the pages from a 4 card basically
just<00:01:53.250> folding<00:01:53.790> them<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.259> having<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.380> small<00:01:55.860> lip

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
just folding them and having a small lip

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.249 
just folding them and having a small lip
so<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.000> could<00:01:57.210> glue<00:01:57.450> them<00:01:57.689> together<00:01:57.899> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
so that you could glue them together to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.649 
so that you could glue them together to
make<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.619> pages<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:02.000> then<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.420> glue

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
make these pages and then you just glue

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.370 
make these pages and then you just glue
them<00:02:03.869> onto<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:05.159> backplate

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.590 

so<00:02:09.340> I'm<00:02:09.490> just<00:02:09.700> going<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.910> quickly<00:02:10.180> run<00:02:10.360> through

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
so I'm just going to quickly run through

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.910 
so I'm just going to quickly run through
each<00:02:11.170> page<00:02:11.860> before<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:13.320> embellish<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.350> just<00:02:14.770> so

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
each page before I embellish it just so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.490 
each page before I embellish it just so
you<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.250> see<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.630> as<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.020> see<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.380> is

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
you can see and as you can see it is

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.170 
you can see and as you can see it is
actually<00:02:17.740> quite<00:02:18.220> thick<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:21.360> think<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.600> was<00:02:24.180> two

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
actually quite thick I think it was two

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.530 
actually quite thick I think it was two
and<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> half<00:02:25.570> inches<00:02:26.440> here<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.540> think<00:02:29.520> offhand<00:02:30.540> I

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
and a half inches here I think offhand I

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.270 
and a half inches here I think offhand I
can't<00:02:31.870> remember<00:02:32.500> but<00:02:32.740> I<00:02:32.830> think<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.160> about

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
can't remember but I think it's about

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.640 
can't remember but I think it's about
two<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.760> half<00:02:33.910> inches<00:02:34.410> along<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.590> back<00:02:37.650> so

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
two and a half inches along the back so

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.220 
two and a half inches along the back so
that's<00:02:38.920> my<00:02:39.130> front<00:02:39.370> cover<00:02:39.610> as<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:40.420> now<00:02:40.720> it

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
that's my front cover as it is now it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.840 
that's my front cover as it is now it
won't<00:02:41.410> look<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.710> that<00:02:42.100> by<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.340> time<00:02:42.640> pop

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
won't look like that by the time pop

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.320 
won't look like that by the time pop
embellished<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.890> used<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.580> Tim<00:02:46.090> Holtz

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
embellished it but I used the Tim Holtz

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.590
