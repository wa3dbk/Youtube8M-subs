 mont-ventoux the one of purchase we have a little fed up a device pvz de dtcl time on 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.960
 will continue 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.860
 e their game according to a specific study talking about youth 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.259
 mindful of this subject 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.369
 so we will be interested% copy in his place of bpm 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.040
 dallas has mainly in the perspective of the service one must know 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.670
 deal with absences you have a city that will allow you to handle 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.310
 everything I do 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.720
 to undermine when others simply have 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 it will take traditional to do it 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.570
 however he did according to what he proposes 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.280
 and you have the beginning 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.460
 that the for all 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.940
 anyway you did not work your mobile 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.590
 at the beginning of the season, the one I have already presented in the world 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.600
 when this matter 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.810
 to be inspired 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.730
 but it must be said that my analysis of the general plan was based on the moment 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.390
 that I wanted to be part of it is terrible 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.560
 % but also with Antarctica a typical example of relizane spoils of war 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.600
 of course philippe cazenave 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.350
 and who to explain it with orders of more 8 cores open but who 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.130
 explain why currently being a member of his team on Wednesday against this 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.540
 very detailed text 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.450
 this being only 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.000
 this guide priori surprising the first which does not justify his style 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.960
 weak second 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.490
 it's worrying relatively old lawyer or to say the medals of the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.650
 hands can change 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.770
 and percent and dale third thing is that it's very very difficult to 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.830
 hold something of fire 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.260
 from this 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.130
 the president because it's very complex and interesting to come back to 5 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.210
 and 10 rebounds are not love 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.850
 you're going to have a hard time intimidating things 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.740
 against all odds that rejects 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.060
 otherwise I'm trying for this video to show it 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.490
 what does that know which ones are my ways of vail is so it was 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.439
 14 gases 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.929
 fourteen for the om he does a role to carla 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:17.739
 to get in shape that sales for up to 48 hours when you 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.939
 are in carmaux does not really dream a little more nothing we move more 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.989
 then percent 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.109
 can you remove your guys from gascon you're going to have his ranks 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.019
 see I feel we do not win but I stop doing 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.039
 to reap the guys I do two zergling 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.020
 attitude 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.089
 a hill 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:39.150
 turned it into less in order of miracle to count they did not care 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.419
 women with 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:42.330
 because for us 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.329
 the most important 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.019
 it is 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.890
 you will have beautiful you need to feast extra ore 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.850
 that's why you have no one on wastes are important and 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.940
 that's why you do not quote face with a drone so your goal is 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.130
 to be still internet before the carnage on average against 44 7% 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.289
 the spokesperson 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.329
 one of the holdings of 15 6% 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.209
 all that brings me to the can of more so it brings me 19 years old subject made 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.549
 of drones 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.489
 it's not quite a leap of 30% 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.389
 but the drone party and then I explored at 21 years ago that's it's done 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.879
 certainly interesting finds in the order 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.399
 the site here 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:23.229
 tel but their fate in hand in the bag this ream 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.439
 t 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.629
 ideally would not be by proposing to the holidays a first 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.849
 as your eldest finished so obviously you inject it makes a 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:31.619
 second mud flow 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.009
 the next time you need energy and solidarity you have 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.679
 hunger for culture 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:37.779
 we understand 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.349
 as reasons why 50 children 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.349
 change of trend 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.269
 this is not a problem 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.929
 face to face 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.629
 so a bonus 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.450
 that's it we do we want drones not for that it's really 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.289
 it's now only a matter of hours 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:58.929
 you have concerns to pay 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.949
 shortly before we counted the people so the vote of the primary 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.409
 plans to pose the cup the craze goyer 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.559
 on your expo actually the second prize obviously can not inject you 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.780
 you do not join in replacing the little monsters and 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:15.849
 resulted in plethora just after at the job or coke zero to the hitch 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.129
 center 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:20.349
 surrendering 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.520
 they were disappointed it was for 100 euros gada 14 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.710
 for the record floor 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.680
 the lack of drones to go up to 40 to 44 tons in order 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.400
 when you have 100 of gaza you take off diesel tour when we can find 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.780
 a crowd arrives at the top a hill two years and the speed the thirty 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.629
 years 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:47.050
 % then you retake rights up to 51 to 31 this platform 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:50.629
 evoking voting but obviously no longer inject 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.590
 eyedea this second energy costs you make a custom org 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.590
 you send him his vote export us 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.819
 as a second penalty obviously the guests 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.610
 ask when we get a new engine meters 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.199
 then there are schoolchildren people who do a third layer pardon e 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.509
 frankly I did not even think I was wasting time all of a sudden 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.270
 place that 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.599
 this woman as simple as her sister for hassan her family who walked 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.099
 e you have 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.439
 so 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.839
 you're going to have two types claude binaud protoss in front you're going to have 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.639
 the economic bubbles I did not know for example the nexus has only one 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.469
 payment 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:28.749
 george mathieu site 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:30.839
 three years is exciting 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.509
 they have suffered its doors but you have proto rocks what can be 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.159
 more than the most classificatory of being 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.650
 she 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.389
 bling this term 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.069
 summer brochot 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.469
 to stagnate for a shock mauro boselli others 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.149
 a very difficult link so to propose everything 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.919
 you'll almost love her scent 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.610
 so we had for 100 euros to say three of their 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.280
 it's economical you have according to the washington post operation first goal 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.629
 of rock how to do 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.899
 how when we get there the transition does not take off
