Occasionally someone comes there in the studio and says:

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.700
"Man, I'm wanting to do my first tattoo ..."

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.040
-Ok...

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.320
Oh, you want to do this size?

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:30.533
In this part of the body?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.560
Cool! Here we go then ...

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.220
This work was done in 2 sessions

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.060
In the first one, I have focused the central part of the wolf

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.700
The eyes are very important in a tattoo like this

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.120
It must be done calmly, enjoying while  the expression takes shape

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.750
If you are a tattoo artist or beginner, note that I do all the eye with liner needle

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.080
In this case I used 07 round liner

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.670
That was the second stage, where I worked the rest of the tattoo

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.170

00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:39.142
In this session used two types of needles

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:47.325
In the silver machine, 15 magnum

00:03:50.642 --> 00:03:54.562
In the green one, 09 round shader
