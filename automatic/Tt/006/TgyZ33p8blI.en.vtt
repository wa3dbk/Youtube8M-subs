identified what their current game is in
the<00:00:30.910> question<00:00:31.210> is<00:00:31.570> how<00:00:31.990> you<00:00:32.019> actually

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
the question is how you actually

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.280 
the question is how you actually
prioritize<00:00:33.280> your<00:00:33.879> improvement<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:35.019> the

prioritize your improvement and the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.250 
prioritize your improvement and the
answer<00:00:35.680> is<00:00:35.830> typical<00:00:36.730> property<00:00:37.120> line<00:00:37.269> this<00:00:38.140> is

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
answer is typical property line this is

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.990 
answer is typical property line this is
what<00:00:38.379> will<00:00:38.500> give<00:00:38.620> you<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.769> real<00:00:39.010> term<00:00:39.250> view<00:00:39.519> for

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
skill base development that came from

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.230 
skill base development that came from
training<00:01:05.110> then<00:01:05.710> you're<00:01:05.800> gonna<00:01:05.920> have<00:01:06.240> ability

base development it came from mom and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.279 
base development it came from mom and
dad<00:01:09.640> now<00:01:10.270> where<00:01:10.450> these<00:01:10.570> two<00:01:10.810> lines<00:01:10.840> intersect

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
dad now where these two lines intersect

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.999 
dad now where these two lines intersect
is<00:01:12.160> your<00:01:12.820> current<00:01:13.210> level<00:01:13.530> anything<00:01:14.530> that's

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
is your current level anything that's

is your current level anything that's
below<00:01:15.190> this<00:01:15.700> line<00:01:15.940> it's<00:01:16.479> going<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.720> be<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:17.140> skill

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
below this line it's going to be a skill

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.789 
below this line it's going to be a skill
that<00:01:18.210> holds<00:01:19.210> your<00:01:19.330> game<00:01:19.479> back<00:01:19.799> anything

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
that holds your game back anything

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.100 
that holds your game back anything
that's<00:01:21.100> above<00:01:21.220> this<00:01:21.580> line<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.270> skills<00:01:22.750> that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
that's above this line is skills that

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.670 
that's above this line is skills that
enhance<00:01:23.350> your<00:01:23.920> game<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.970> if<00:01:25.350> 2000<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.619> the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
enhance your game so if 2000 is the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.859 
enhance your game so if 2000 is the
current<00:01:27.340> level<00:01:27.490> there's<00:01:28.030> three<00:01:28.299> levels<00:01:28.659> up

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
current level there's three levels up

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.920 
current level there's three levels up
and<00:01:29.140> three<00:01:30.070> levels<00:01:30.460> down<00:01:30.640> so<00:01:31.630> let's<00:01:31.750> take<00:01:31.900> a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
and three levels down so let's take a

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.660 
and three levels down so let's take a
look<00:01:32.170> at<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.380> forehand<00:01:32.799> loop<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.189> most<00:01:33.400> cases

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
look at the forehand loop in most cases

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.350 
look at the forehand loop in most cases
is<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.030> skill<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:35.500> ability<00:01:36.130> base<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:37.240> is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
is a skill that's ability base and is

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.359 
is a skill that's ability base and is
much<00:01:37.570> higher<00:01:37.840> than<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.380> typical<00:01:38.710> property<00:01:39.189> line

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
much higher than a typical property line

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.389 
much higher than a typical property line
and<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:41.229> backhand<00:01:41.409> counter<00:01:41.890> drive<00:01:42.130> is

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
and the backhand counter drive is

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.670 
and the backhand counter drive is
typically<00:01:42.820> under<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.869> full<00:01:44.110> hand<00:01:44.320> loop<00:01:44.500> and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
typically under the full hand loop and

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.940 
typically under the full hand loop and
your<00:01:45.250> skill<00:01:45.759> based<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:47.290> backhand<00:01:47.770> loop

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
your skill based the backhand loop

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.010 
your skill based the backhand loop
doesn't<00:01:48.549> get<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.759> lot<00:01:48.939> of<00:01:49.000> play<00:01:49.270> because<00:01:49.780> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
doesn't get a lot of play because the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.289 
doesn't get a lot of play because the
forehand<00:01:50.470> gets<00:01:50.710> most<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.100> action<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:51.820> it's

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
forehand gets most of the action so it's

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.630 
forehand gets most of the action so it's
closer<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.740> technical<00:01:54.130> property<00:01:54.460> line

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
closer to the technical property line

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.719 
closer to the technical property line
and<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.630> forehand<00:01:56.049> counter<00:01:56.469> drive<00:01:56.710> is<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.490> shot

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
and the forehand counter drive is a shot

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.539 
and the forehand counter drive is a shot
that's<00:01:58.180> just<00:01:59.140> above<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.890> poverty<00:02:00.219> line<00:02:00.369> and

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
that's just above the poverty line and

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.340 
that's just above the poverty line and
again<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.119> for<00:02:01.299> loop<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.719> getting<00:02:01.990> most<00:02:02.110> to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
again the for loop is getting most to

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.459 
again the for loop is getting most to
play<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.280> boolean<00:02:04.240> counter<00:02:04.570> drive<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:05.079> a

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
play so boolean counter drive is a

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.520 
play so boolean counter drive is a
little<00:02:05.710> bit<00:02:06.189> low<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:07.390> these<00:02:07.600> are<00:02:07.810> skills<00:02:07.960> that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
little bit low and these are skills that

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.370

below<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.290> check<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> property<00:02:15.070> line<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
below to check the property line and the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.530 
below to check the property line and the
serve<00:02:16.780> return<00:02:16.989> is<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:18.280> skill<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:18.910> happens

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
serve return is a skill that happens

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.210 
serve return is a skill that happens
once

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
once

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.250 
once
her<00:02:20.850> point<00:02:21.150> which<00:02:21.390> makes<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.140> very

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
her point which makes it a very

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.550 
her point which makes it a very
difficult<00:02:22.950> skill<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.400> master<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.050> puts

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
difficult skill to master and that puts

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.880 
difficult skill to master and that puts
it<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:26.040> most<00:02:26.370> cases<00:02:26.640> below<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:28.470> technical

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
it in most cases below the technical

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.260 
it in most cases below the technical
property<00:02:29.190> line<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.580> because<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.090> that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
property line and because of that

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.770 
property line and because of that
defense<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.620> also<00:02:32.120> effective<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.540> both<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
defense is also effective and both of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.380 
defense is also effective and both of
these<00:02:34.080> are<00:02:34.410> skill<00:02:34.800> based<00:02:35.040> shots<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.180> can

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
these are skill based shots that you can

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.050 
these are skill based shots that you can
clearly<00:02:36.720> see<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.620> drags<00:02:38.250> your<00:02:38.520> game<00:02:38.820> in

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
clearly see that it drags your game in

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.040 
clearly see that it drags your game in
the<00:02:39.510> gun

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
the gun

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.490 
the gun
most<00:02:40.590> cases<00:02:41.270> footwork<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.510> ability<00:02:42.990> base<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
most cases footwork is ability base and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.830 
most cases footwork is ability base and
it's<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:44.640> low<00:02:44.790> temp<00:02:45.450> RP<00:02:45.930> line<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:47.250> is

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
it's just for low temp RP line and so is

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.000 
it's just for low temp RP line and so is
underspin<00:02:48.840> shucks<00:02:49.220> now<00:02:50.600> this<00:02:51.600> can<00:02:52.500> have<00:02:52.710> so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
underspin shucks now this can have so

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.830 
underspin shucks now this can have so
many<00:02:53.220> other<00:02:53.520> skills<00:02:53.880> added<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> or<00:02:54.810> just

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
many other skills added to it or just

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.530 
many other skills added to it or just
for<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.230> sake<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.500> time<00:02:55.860> one<00:02:56.520> put<00:02:56.850> up<00:02:57.000> for

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
for the sake of time one put up for

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.750 
for the sake of time one put up for
skiers<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.930> are<00:02:58.170> above<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.980> four<00:02:59.490> skills

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
skiers that are above the four skills

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.870 
skiers that are above the four skills
that<00:03:00.150> are<00:03:00.240> below<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:01.020> help<00:03:01.320> create<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:02.070> profile

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
that are below to help create a profile

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
defense footwork and under spin shot

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.290 
defense footwork and under spin shot
will<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.350> skills<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.850> would<00:03:12.000> use<00:03:12.270> to

will be the skills that you would use to

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.750 
will be the skills that you would use to
prioritize<00:03:13.290> your<00:03:13.560> training<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.430> can

actually get these skills above now if
you<00:03:19.890> see<00:03:20.220> there's<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.940> certain<00:03:21.120> scale<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.750> send

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
you see there's a certain scale to send

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.630 
you see there's a certain scale to send
your<00:03:22.110> game<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.770> feel<00:03:23.130> needs<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.490> be
