 well coordinated were made with a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.519
 military convoy

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.970
 wavering and you burst to the face you have 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.500
 the best team in the world in front of your 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.770
 nose 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.720

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.880
 objective is good show the commander of 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.130
 special operations 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.409
 for years he has done work in europe 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.649
 but the most recent ones have gone up 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.649
 level 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.350
