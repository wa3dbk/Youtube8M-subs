a little bit of flexibility to it you
don't<00:00:59.280> want<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.640> past<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.030> halfway<00:01:00.180> part

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
don't want to go past the halfway part

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
don't want to go past the halfway part
you<00:01:00.899> don't<00:01:01.020> want<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> snap<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.550> both

you don't want the snap do that on both

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.310 
you don't want the snap do that on both
halves<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> give<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.140> shape

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
halves that's going to give it the shape

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.899 
halves that's going to give it the shape
that's<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> need<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> bend<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that's going to need to bend to the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.870 
that's going to need to bend to the
other<00:01:06.030> piece<00:01:07.549> just<00:01:08.549> make<00:01:08.700> sure<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
other piece just make sure that

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.550 
other piece just make sure that
everything<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.689> fit<00:01:09.900> okay<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.350> both

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
everything is going to fit okay on both

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.690 
everything is going to fit okay on both
sides<00:01:11.270> if<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:13.290> didn't<00:01:13.680> put<00:01:13.920> your<00:01:14.010> shams<00:01:14.310> on

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
sides if you didn't put your shams on

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.060 
sides if you didn't put your shams on
the<00:01:15.210> double<00:01:15.509> curve<00:01:15.720> side<00:01:16.049> you're<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:16.860> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the double curve side you're going to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
the double curve side you're going to
end<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.490> piece<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.119> you'll<00:01:18.299> probably

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
end up with a piece but you'll probably

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
end up with a piece but you'll probably
need<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.110> notch<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.640> meet<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
need to notch out to meet up with the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.710 
need to notch out to meet up with the
curbside<00:01:23.060> can<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> curves<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
curbside can see the curves on the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
curbside can see the curves on the
inside<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> may<00:01:26.189> need<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> notch<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
inside there so you may need to notch it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.899 
inside there so you may need to notch it
out<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.200> hopefully<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.159> did<00:01:29.310> set<00:01:29.579> for

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
out so hopefully when you did set for

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.090 
out so hopefully when you did set for
you<00:01:30.659> put<00:01:30.869> them<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> curbside<00:01:31.409> begin<00:01:31.920> with

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
you put them on the curbside begin with

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.380 
you put them on the curbside begin with
but<00:01:32.280> either<00:01:32.400> way<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> little<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.299> extra

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
but either way just a little bit extra

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.080 
but either way just a little bit extra
cut<00:01:33.750> work<00:01:34.159> we're<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> use<00:01:35.460> more<00:01:35.670> defcon

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
cut work we're going to use more defcon

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.550 
cut work we're going to use more defcon
than<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.329> use<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> last<00:01:36.780> time<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.259> we're

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
than we use the last time because we're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
than we use the last time because we're
coming<00:01:38.369> onto<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.579> surface<00:01:38.820> where<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.240> can't<00:01:39.479> get

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
our clamps in the same way i like to use

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.929 
our clamps in the same way i like to use
a<00:01:42.770> piece<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.799> wood<00:01:43.950> that's<00:01:44.220> almost<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> same

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
a piece of wood that's almost the same

a piece of wood that's almost the same
width<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.630> my<00:01:45.780> sim<00:01:46.369> now<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.430> see<00:01:47.610> there's

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
width is my sim now you see there's

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.550 
width is my sim now you see there's
going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.060> gap<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.259> clamp

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
going to be a gap there but as we clamp

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
going to be a gap there but as we clamp
it<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.430> wood<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.030> helps<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.360> give<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.570> an<00:01:51.780> even

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140

work time so scoot things around so that
you've<00:04:11.370> got<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.550> good<00:04:12.320> good<00:04:13.320> clamp<00:04:13.650> on<00:04:13.890> both

you've got a good good clamp on both
surfaces<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.739> then<00:04:16.739> put<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.070> medium-sized<00:04:17.640> one

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
surfaces and then put a medium-sized one

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:27.230

in behind it give that extra little love
it<00:04:27.480> needs<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.490> where<00:04:35.640> these<00:04:35.760> clamps

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
it needs and this is where these clamps

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.230 
it needs and this is where these clamps
are<00:04:36.300> nice<00:04:36.450> because<00:04:37.370> glue<00:04:38.370> will<00:04:38.669> squeeze<00:04:39.060> all

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
are nice because glue will squeeze all

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.150 
are nice because glue will squeeze all
over<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.510> place<00:04:39.720> but<00:04:40.080> it's<00:04:40.680> not<00:04:40.919> going<00:04:41.040> to

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
not going to fit perfectly that's why we

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.119 
not going to fit perfectly that's why we
use<00:06:00.539> the<00:06:00.689> extra<00:06:00.839> glue<00:06:01.139> to<00:06:01.319> help<00:06:01.499> fill<00:06:01.710> that<00:06:01.860> gap

and<00:06:02.599> you're<00:06:03.599> going<00:06:03.719> to<00:06:03.779> be<00:06:03.839> doing<00:06:03.899> bondo<00:06:04.379> work

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:04.619 
and you're going to be doing bondo work

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:06.709 
and you're going to be doing bondo work
and<00:06:04.860> remember<00:06:05.399> there's<00:06:06.089> a<00:06:06.180> resin<00:06:06.539> piece

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
and remember there's a resin piece

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:07.969 
and remember there's a resin piece
that's<00:06:06.930> going<00:06:07.020> to<00:06:07.110> go<00:06:07.229> on<00:06:07.259> the<00:06:07.469> top<00:06:07.710> of<00:06:07.740> that

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
that's going to go on the top of that

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.369 
that's going to go on the top of that
forearm<00:06:08.569> whichever<00:06:09.569> side<00:06:09.839> ends<00:06:10.080> up<00:06:10.169> being<00:06:10.289> the

forearm whichever side ends up being the

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:11.839 
forearm whichever side ends up being the
top<00:06:10.589> depends<00:06:10.949> on<00:06:11.009> whether<00:06:11.159> this<00:06:11.309> is<00:06:11.460> right<00:06:11.520> or

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
top depends on whether this is right or

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.019 
top depends on whether this is right or
left<00:06:12.169> so<00:06:13.169> don't<00:06:14.129> worry<00:06:14.279> about<00:06:14.399> this<00:06:14.669> gap<00:06:14.879> we

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
left so don't worry about this gap we

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.389 
left so don't worry about this gap we
will<00:06:15.149> fix<00:06:15.300> it<00:06:15.479> later<00:06:15.949> so<00:06:16.949> you're<00:06:17.069> looking<00:06:17.309> at

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:17.399 
will fix it later so you're looking at

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.730 
will fix it later so you're looking at
large<00:06:17.879> to<00:06:17.969> medium<00:06:18.089> large<00:06:18.629> and<00:06:18.839> medium<00:06:19.199> large

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
large to medium large and medium large

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.739 
large to medium large and medium large
large<00:06:20.129> and<00:06:20.779> I<00:06:21.779> usually<00:06:22.020> set<00:06:22.469> it<00:06:23.479> the<00:06:24.479> double

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:24.749 
large and I usually set it the double

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:27.829 
large and I usually set it the double
side<00:06:24.899> down<00:06:25.110> let<00:06:26.069> it<00:06:26.099> dry<00:06:26.459> and<00:06:26.789> that's<00:06:27.659> going<00:06:27.779> to

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:27.839 
side down let it dry and that's going to

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.989 
side down let it dry and that's going to
be<00:06:27.930> that<00:06:28.139> half<00:06:28.409> when<00:06:29.369> you<00:06:29.430> come<00:06:29.610> back<00:06:29.729> to<00:06:29.909> do

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:29.999 
be that half when you come back to do

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:31.549 
be that half when you come back to do
the<00:06:30.089> second<00:06:30.449> half<00:06:30.629> it's<00:06:31.259> going<00:06:31.379> to<00:06:31.439> be<00:06:31.529> a

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:31.559 
the second half it's going to be a

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.379 
the second half it's going to be a
little<00:06:31.949> bit<00:06:32.159> of<00:06:32.279> wiggle<00:06:32.459> work<00:06:32.699> just<00:06:33.089> to<00:06:33.209> get

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
little bit of wiggle work just to get

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.279 
little bit of wiggle work just to get

the glue into this seam here but it's
