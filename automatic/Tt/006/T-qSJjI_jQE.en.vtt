00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the exact swim current that you would

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.870 
the exact swim current that you would
like<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.160> swim<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.630> basically<00:00:22.670> what<00:00:23.670> we've

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
like to swim at so basically what we've

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.150 
like to swim at so basically what we've
been<00:00:24.210> able<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.170> create<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.619> current<00:00:26.039> that

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
been able to do is create a current that

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.019 
been able to do is create a current that
goes<00:00:26.369> from<00:00:26.550> 0<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> 15<00:00:27.840> miles<00:00:28.170> per<00:00:28.349> hour<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.070> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
goes from 0 to 15 miles per hour and you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.120 
goes from 0 to 15 miles per hour and you
can<00:00:30.359> individually<00:00:31.050> control<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.710> current

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
can individually control that current

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610 
can individually control that current

now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.150 
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
turn<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.610> all<00:00:39.000> three<00:00:39.450> pumps<00:00:39.899> now<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.710> an<00:00:40.860> aqua

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
turn on all three pumps now on an aqua

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.549 
turn on all three pumps now on an aqua
trainer<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.730> three<00:00:42.239> pumps<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
trainer we have three pumps one that

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.540 
trainer we have three pumps one that
operates<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.399> lower<00:00:44.899> buoyancy<00:00:45.899> jet<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.550> two

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
operates the lower buoyancy jet and two

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.690 
operates the lower buoyancy jet and two
that<00:00:47.879> operate<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.420> wide<00:00:49.110> stream<00:00:49.800> current

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that operate the wide stream current

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.670 
that operate the wide stream current
Jets<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> top<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.500> particular

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
Jets at the top so at this particular

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.950 
Jets at the top so at this particular
point<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.730> turn<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.570> actual

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
point I'm going to turn on the actual

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
point I'm going to turn on the actual
pumps<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> pump<00:00:58.829> number<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.340> actually

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
pumps for it so pump number one actually

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.680 
pumps for it so pump number one actually
operates<00:01:00.840> two<00:01:01.829> things<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.820> operates<00:01:03.359> either

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
operates two things it operates either

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.820 
operates two things it operates either
the<00:01:04.379> hot<00:01:05.309> tub<00:01:05.640> area<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.380> turn<00:01:07.650> this

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the hot tub area or if I turn this

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.240 
the hot tub area or if I turn this
diverter<00:01:08.280> valve<00:01:09.200> right<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
diverter valve right as you can see it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.070 
diverter valve right as you can see it
operating<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> hot<00:01:12.299> tub<00:01:12.570> area

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
operating the hot tub area

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.650 
operating the hot tub area
okay<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:14.190> if<00:01:14.370> I<00:01:14.490> turn<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> diverter<00:01:15.240> about<00:01:15.480> the

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
okay or if I turn the diverter about the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.010 
okay or if I turn the diverter about the
other<00:01:15.840> way<00:01:17.060> what<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> does<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.810> actually

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
other way what it does is it actually

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.220 
other way what it does is it actually
sends<00:01:19.590> water<00:01:20.370> through<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> lower<00:01:21.270> buoyancy

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
sends water through the lower buoyancy

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.220 
sends water through the lower buoyancy
jet<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:22.800> is<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.190> round<00:01:23.610> jet<00:01:24.120> at<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.840> bottom

whiting<00:01:37.890> jet<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.330> what<00:01:39.660> I've<00:01:39.810> got

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
whiting jet now right now what I've got

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.200 
whiting jet now right now what I've got
it<00:01:40.230> on<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.800> lowest<00:01:41.220> level<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.940> fact

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it on is the lowest level so in fact

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.090 
it on is the lowest level so in fact
down<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> biggest<00:01:44.040> area<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:45.000> are<00:01:45.300> two

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
down at the biggest area there are two

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.070 
down at the biggest area there are two
stabilizing<00:01:47.100> Jets<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.210> actually<00:01:48.660> divert

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
stabilizing Jets that actually divert

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.290

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
the flow to the center of the tub

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.719 
the flow to the center of the tub
allowing<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.020> swimmer<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:53.070> keep

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
allowing the swimmer to actually keep

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.450

there<00:01:56.760> also<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.120> be<00:01:57.180> used<00:01:57.300> as<00:01:57.660> by<00:01:57.960> jet<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.410> be

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
there also can be used as by jet to be

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.010 
there also can be used as by jet to be
actually<00:01:58.950> wanted<00:01:59.220> for<00:01:59.430> massage<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.540> right<00:02:00.840> now

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
actually wanted for massage so right now

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.270 
actually wanted for massage so right now
what<00:02:01.200> I'm<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.010> to

swimming down here is located the two

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.539 
swimming down here is located the two
aqua<00:02:37.859> flex<00:02:38.249> control<00:02:38.790> buttons<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:40.310> I'm<00:02:41.310> just

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
aqua flex control buttons and I'm just

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.640 
aqua flex control buttons and I'm just
going<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.790> demonstrate<00:02:41.939> how<00:02:42.480> how<00:02:42.840> much<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
going to demonstrate how how much you

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.470 
going to demonstrate how how much you
can<00:02:43.889> actually<00:02:44.280> dial<00:02:44.579> it<00:02:44.760> up<00:02:44.879> so<00:02:45.150> there's<00:02:45.329> a

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
can actually dial it up so there's a

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.059 
can actually dial it up so there's a
plus<00:02:45.780> button<00:02:46.109> on<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.349> minus<00:02:46.680> button

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
plus button on the minus button

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.129 
plus button on the minus button
this<00:02:47.579> is<00:02:47.790> currently<00:02:48.209> set<00:02:48.510> at<00:02:48.659> its<00:02:48.750> lowest

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
this is currently set at its lowest

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.379 
this is currently set at its lowest
level<00:02:49.919> so<00:02:50.310> you're<00:02:50.549> probably<00:02:50.760> swimming<00:02:51.239> at

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
level so you're probably swimming at

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.069 
level so you're probably swimming at
about<00:02:51.659> up<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.139> mile<00:02:53.069> per<00:02:53.370> hour<00:02:53.689> swim<00:02:54.689> rate<00:02:54.930> at

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
about up to mile per hour swim rate at

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.099 
about up to mile per hour swim rate at
this<00:02:55.260> particular<00:02:55.409> point<00:02:56.329> so<00:02:57.329> as<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.629> held<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
this particular point so as I held the

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.740 
this particular point so as I held the
upper<00:02:58.439> button<00:02:58.859> it's<00:02:59.730> actually<00:03:00.180> diverting

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
upper button it's actually diverting

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.909 
upper button it's actually diverting
pressure<00:03:02.329> simultaneously<00:03:03.379> to<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.409> two

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
pressure simultaneously to the two

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.360 
pressure simultaneously to the two
o'clock<00:03:05.430> jet<00:03:06.230> now<00:03:07.230> as<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.709> can<00:03:07.859> see<00:03:07.919> at<00:03:08.219> the
