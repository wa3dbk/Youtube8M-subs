been really picky I really am but that's
the<00:04:24.750> elite<00:04:24.930> standard<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:25.410> want<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.620> be<00:04:25.710> held<00:04:25.860> to

the elite standard we want to be held to
and<00:04:26.340> I<00:04:26.400> thought<00:04:26.610> second<00:04:26.940> half<00:04:27.030> we<00:04:27.120> did<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.419> were

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
and I thought second half we did we were

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.960 
and I thought second half we did we were
very<00:04:27.720> sharp<00:04:28.080> in<00:04:28.200> my<00:04:28.290> opinion<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.770> but<00:04:29.760> then<00:04:29.850> i

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
very sharp in my opinion and but then i

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.150 
very sharp in my opinion and but then i
think<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.360> was<00:04:30.510> just--<00:04:30.540> just<00:04:31.530> looking<00:04:32.070> up

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160

and trying to know i don't know what it

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.920 
and trying to know i don't know what it
was<00:04:35.220> just<00:04:35.490> didn't<00:04:36.120> see<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:36.270> quite<00:04:36.570> look<00:04:36.780> then
