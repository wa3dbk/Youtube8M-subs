00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.559
 way you guys that's it so requires that 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.269
 good good good day 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.519
 so today I will introduce you 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.380
 my little new project that has banks 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.939
 and while they've found it's a 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.169
 subscriber who sent me a message in me 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.149
 saying that it could be nice to 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.609
 do and I really hooked on 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.019
 the idea because it's true it's a 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.640
 project that I did not see 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.180
 personally may have this exists 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.440
 but hey, I did not see that 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.929
 explain all that so it'll be called 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.269
 the team of the week so I think 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.960
 a high rhine every Sunday we go 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:47.449
 see we're going to see how we're going to do that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.920
 so in fact it's very simple you 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.160
 go see me in a video finally in 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.149
 a gameplay or in the end I'm worth final 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.420
 or in the middle of the game 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.429
 anywhere I'm going to make a clip 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.719
 so the team can go beyond the 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:06.080
 triple up to a duvet fidh a +16 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.200
 and on call of 4 for those who do not know 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.400
 not what it's the youngest of them all 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.810
 I will explain to her in a video 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.820
 all because there I'm going to be at the table 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.200
 jellett surote qg have moreover I 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.540
 will talk about why I want to spend on 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.270
 what of qg all that so what does not 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.000
 not necessarily follow a mostly accused 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.150
 no 300 anoint me 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.810
 normal so on youtube hours who had 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.880
 5000 ha and some subscribers there is little 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.770
 what then did I drop my channel when 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.570
 that's what it's all about in the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.729
 suites like prices my username all 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.229
 simple pipes create a nickname all that 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.690
 the géraud makes the chain with the 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.400
 same pseudo end i'm I have everything 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.090
 restarted in relation to an activity 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.470
 all that there was on my channel I 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.260
 really played back to zero and 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.520
 to start on a good basis and 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.869
 mostly sorry I'm talking to you I 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.869
 do not know at all what I was doing 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:03.490
 well here I am lost his life because 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.600
 already the base am not really a guy 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.500
 who makes the orders finally arrive 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.000
 I was not interested in three areas good 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.470
 I am neither for lignac the activity that 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.760
 here I thought I had done a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.900
 trip besides but in fact either 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.910
 what is the position that makes me a little 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.750
 more 15 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.220
 it's true that the comments that I 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.470
 am not too comfortable again or in good 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.840
 we will see later 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.830
 so it's a bit indulgent I'm not 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.680
 down there this young guy who makes that 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.840
 episode montages and all the tralala so 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.620
 so that's it 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.110
 so I also wanted to make you 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.340
 the advertised what if we are if I can 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.310
 not to say that the qg people will be 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.150
 not necessarily but I do 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.310
 now I'm going to do I 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.100
 late orders there are episodes so there 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.959
 and my best off quotation marks from my 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.480
 last edit where there are big fat 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.280
 Boëdic clip has also thank you 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.769
 my publisher who is providing 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.340
 a huge job 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:59.019
 so I hope it will be released soon 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.209
 so every Friday as you have 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.480
 could see android laughed i pulled out the 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.920
 new series bones and spots then that 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.350
 will only be on hold in case so I 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.489
 will explain or to the bunds because 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.900
 that many people are asking me and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.040
 yeah 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.200
 explain to us how goats are made 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.299
 I do not have too much facts going back from 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.220
 again all that so I tried to 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:23.079
 to do a test on invaded so that's good 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.450
 not the map either perfect but after 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.980
 I think I'll do the episodes 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.420
 all people say on two maps 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.400
 I think because there are maps or not 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.340
 there are no two individuals who are 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.379
 really a mailing to others so 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.489
 it will be two or three maps we will see 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.099
 well accurate nickel 4 h code and 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.140
 so here we go 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.569
 after what I wanted to go out 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.640
 like video yes I have a little guy but 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.560
 also for rides to be healthy active 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.540
 to resume this activity do a 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.099
 little gameplay commented also by 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.239
 week jean snella make sure three 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.680
 videos a week I think it 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.459
 would make a good hunting quota after 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.920
 nice of the I wanted to talk to you too 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.870
 sailboats this map chinatown so 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.889
 no you here I think about call of 4 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.950
 it's a map on the map pack that 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.989
 is I do not know the name any more where 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.729
 I explain all that because a lot of 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.680
 people say true that at 9.4 and unite 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.660
 their lobbies is that of the set up and everything 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.150
 it's anything so that's why 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.470
 that I also did this project because 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.590
 it's interesting to see 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.539
 that she really starts before doing 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.400
 clips or other because I'm 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.840
 not the machine people of a 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.330
 machine or makes clips and that's the 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.820
 chance in his reduced see him in the 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.990
 video when I'm going to do the clip is 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.720
