00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
Eber it's on his network ooh it's on the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.519 
Eber it's on his network ooh it's on the
acoustic<00:00:21.570> album<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
acoustic album right it's on the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.340 
acoustic album right it's on the
believable<00:00:22.949> but<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.630> pretty<00:00:25.170> much<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
believable but like it's pretty much the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.980 
believable but like it's pretty much the
exact<00:00:25.619> same<00:00:25.650> thing<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:27.000> both<00:00:27.060> problems<00:00:27.449> except

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
exact same thing on both problems except

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.200 
exact same thing on both problems except
the<00:00:28.349> dramas<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:28.890> about<00:00:29.099> her<00:00:29.220> gone<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.730> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the dramas and all about her gone on I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.229 
the dramas and all about her gone on I
guess<00:00:30.720> so

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
guess so

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.970 
guess so
it's<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.510> same<00:00:33.809> thing<00:00:34.200> repeated<00:00:34.770> throughout

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it's the same thing repeated throughout

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.950 
it's the same thing repeated throughout
the<00:00:35.160> entire<00:00:35.489> song<00:00:35.820> over<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.360> over<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.809> over

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the entire song over and over and over

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.830 
the entire song over and over and over
again<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:38.309> basically<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.090> B<00:00:39.510> minor

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
again so it's basically like a B minor

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.979 
again so it's basically like a B minor
on<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.770> sixth<00:00:41.190> fret<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:45.180> he<00:00:45.360> starts<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:45.780> it's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
on this sixth fret so he starts off it's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:55.069 
on this sixth fret so he starts off it's
like<00:00:52.940> right<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> beach<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.899> what's<00:00:55.020> not
