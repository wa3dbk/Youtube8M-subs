00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
do any special tactics but the thing is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.450 
do any special tactics but the thing is
when<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.259> go<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> head<00:01:13.679> it<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:14.009> really<00:01:14.280> hard

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
when they go to head it was really hard

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.859

to<00:01:14.550> do<00:01:14.670> anything<00:01:14.789> against<00:01:15.479> him<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.720> you

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to do anything against him like you

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.730 
to do anything against him like you
could<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.050> feel<00:01:16.409> their<00:01:16.619> presence

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
could just feel their presence

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.399 
could just feel their presence
everywhere<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> was<00:01:18.229> incredibly<00:01:19.229> hard

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
everywhere and it was incredibly hard

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.550 
everywhere and it was incredibly hard
for<00:01:19.590> me<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> play<00:01:20.659> looking<00:01:21.659> back<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.259> there

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
for me to play looking back is there

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.810

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
might have been able to stop some of the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.180 
might have been able to stop some of the
big<00:02:27.329> map<00:02:27.540> presences<00:02:28.109> is<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.470> something<00:02:29.070> that

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
big map presences is that something that

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.689 
big map presences is that something that
you<00:02:29.310> could<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.489> done

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:29.699 
you could have done

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.860 
you could have done
they<00:02:30.510> banned<00:02:30.720> its<00:02:30.930> home<00:02:31.139> games<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
they banned its home games and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.330 
they banned its home games and
we<00:02:31.959> banded<00:02:32.230> other<00:02:32.409> games<00:02:32.680> because<00:02:33.069> their

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
we banded other games because their

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.979 
we banded other games because their
jungler<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.819> very<00:02:34.060> good<00:02:34.180> with<00:02:34.330> chaga<00:02:34.659> as<00:02:34.780> well

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
jungler is very good with chaga as well

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.339 
jungler is very good with chaga as well
so<00:02:35.709> yeah<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.849> think<00:02:37.120> Joey<00:02:37.299> is<00:02:37.599> just<00:02:38.049> overall

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
so yeah I think Joey is just overall

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.649 
so yeah I think Joey is just overall
really<00:02:38.620> strong<00:02:38.950> jungler<00:02:39.280> now<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:39.819> that's<00:02:40.569> why

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
really strong jungler now so that's why

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.530 
really strong jungler now so that's why
I<00:02:40.690> spent<00:02:41.019> okay<00:02:41.620> um<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.730> noticed<00:02:43.030> him<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.330> picks

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
I spent okay um I noticed him the picks

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.800 
I spent okay um I noticed him the picks
and<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.319> picks<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.650> bans<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:45.629> Diana<00:02:46.629> was

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
and the picks and bans that Diana was

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.360 
and the picks and bans that Diana was
getting<00:02:47.049> through<00:02:47.260> pretty<00:02:47.650> much<00:02:47.739> every<00:02:48.250> game

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
getting through pretty much every game

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.619 
getting through pretty much every game
in<00:02:48.579> fact<00:02:48.730> there<00:02:49.030> at<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.239> tournament<00:02:49.569> I<00:02:49.599> think

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
in fact there at the tournament I think

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.449 
in fact there at the tournament I think
she's<00:02:49.959> been<00:02:50.319> in<00:02:50.470> ninety<00:02:50.799> she<00:02:51.099> did<00:02:51.250> have<00:02:51.340> been

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
she's been in ninety she did have been

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.770 
she's been in ninety she did have been
picked<00:02:51.700> up<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:51.970> ninety-eight<00:02:52.450> percent<00:02:52.569> of

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
picked up and ninety-eight percent of

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.270 
picked up and ninety-eight percent of
the<00:02:52.870> time<00:02:53.019> that's<00:02:53.920> ridiculous<00:02:54.790> but<00:02:55.360> uh<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:56.409> why

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
the time that's ridiculous but uh so why

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.190 
the time that's ridiculous but uh so why
let<00:02:57.519> her<00:02:57.670> through

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
let her through

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.580 
let her through
I<00:02:59.230> know<00:02:59.500> when<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.099> got<00:03:00.250> her<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.849> guys<00:03:01.000> won<00:03:01.590> but

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
I know when you got her you guys won but

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.330 
I know when you got her you guys won but
why<00:03:03.280> let<00:03:03.640> her<00:03:03.730> through<00:03:03.940> she's<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.359> strong

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
why let her through she's so strong

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.610 
why let her through she's so strong
Diana<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.579> itself<00:03:06.940> it's<00:03:07.420> not<00:03:07.780> like<00:03:08.200> she's

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
Diana in itself it's not like she's

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.890 
Diana in itself it's not like she's
really<00:03:08.829> strong<00:03:09.129> obviously<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.299> can<00:03:10.480> see<00:03:10.510> it

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
really strong obviously you can see it

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.170 
really strong obviously you can see it
in<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.109> stats<00:03:11.349> but<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.400> counter<00:03:12.730> her<00:03:12.879> and

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
in the stats but you can counter her and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.819 
in the stats but you can counter her and
we<00:03:13.569> try<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.840> counter<00:03:14.200> her<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.620> wasn't

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
we try to counter her and it wasn't

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.649 
we try to counter her and it wasn't
really<00:03:15.099> dying<00:03:15.400> as<00:03:15.609> for<00:03:15.819> why<00:03:16.000> we<00:03:16.120> lost<00:03:16.299> it<00:03:16.510> was

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
really dying as for why we lost it was

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.050 
really dying as for why we lost it was
other<00:03:16.989> reasons<00:03:17.650> so<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.190> don't<00:03:18.670> think<00:03:18.849> it<00:03:18.909> was<00:03:19.030> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
other reasons so I don't think it was a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.789 
other reasons so I don't think it was a
mistake<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.569> leave<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:20.260> open<00:03:20.319> okay<00:03:21.220> um<00:03:21.609> what<00:03:22.209> uh

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
mistake to leave it open okay um what uh

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.899 
mistake to leave it open okay um what uh
what<00:03:23.799> do<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:23.920> think<00:03:24.010> is<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.430> reason<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.730> guys

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909
