00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 as in dry 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.200
 alexis yacht over 25 meters 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.639
 length that sailed about 25 kilometers 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.400
 off the coasts of all the saints' 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.020
 in baja california south to the north and 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.060
 after making a tour from 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.919
 the peace going through the capes had a 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.439
 it would be mechanical failure that caused its 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.140
 subsidence the employer stated that it is 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.690
 I detect 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.820
 that was entering water 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.840
 the part 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.620
 is the propeller shaft of the yacht 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.230
 that when entering water for that place 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.740
 usually obeys that it is a fault 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.370
 in the seal that precisely prevents 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.880
 in the water inlet inside the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.500
 propulsion compartment of the 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.870
 boats in the family was traveling 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.630
 American who vacationed in waters 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.550
 Mexicans immediately alerted the 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.330
 naval sector of the heads who 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.060
 came to his rescue designate a 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.460
 vessel of the defend type so that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.700
 I went to verify 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.710
 the circumstances that had 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.770
 Emergency and effectively communicated 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.079
 to reach the area 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.880
 Two vessels detected one of 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.270
 they were the yacht that had the problem 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.409
 of sinking already on the yacht were traveling 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.810
 five people of nationality 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.810
 American among them three minors 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.270
 and the owner of Spanish origin all 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.320
 they were rescued safe and sound 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.220
 another catamaran type boat 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.960
 also attending the call of 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.930
 emergency is approached 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.420
 I have provided the facilities to move 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.880
 the crew of the yacht that were three 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.979
 adults and three children under age none 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.580
 of the crew was injured the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.730
 occupants all were well 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.080
 physical damage of none of them 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.970
 performance was total and the authorities 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.290
 emphasize that this emergency did not happen 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.670
 older because the boat 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.380
 had all the elements 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.380
 necessary communication
