00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:11.360
Today we will make puff pastry biscuits.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.606
If we already have puff pastry sheets ready then

00:00:16.607 --> 00:00:21.359
making puff pastry biscuits get easy and instantly.

00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:27.031
We have pastry sheets stored in refrigerator.

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:38.070
Take them out 4 hours prior bringing in use.

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:47.539
Method of making puff pastry sheets is available on nishamadhulika.com.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.656
Let’s start with the procedure of making puff pastry biscuits.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:01:00.125
Spread some oil on the board so that the board doesn’t stick to board.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:08.359
These pastry sheets can be stored for 6 months.

00:01:21.735 --> 00:01:23.977
Roll the sheet thinly.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.601
Now spread some ghee on top of it so that chaat masala sticks properly.

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:57.289
Sprinkle some chaat masala on the sheet.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:26.367
Fold the sheet like this and roll again keeping it ¼ cm thick.

00:02:30.032 --> 00:02:33.118
Now cut biscuits from it.

00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:39.696
Cut into 1.5x1.5 or 1.15x1.15 inch batons.

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:57.986
Place butter paper in the baking tray or grease it

00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:02.147
with ghee or oil and thenkeep the pieces in tray.

00:03:08.242 --> 00:03:10.273
Place them at distance.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:19.305
Similarly make all biscuits.

00:03:40.757 --> 00:03:42.945
Now we will make plain puff pastry biscuits.

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:52.398
For this take pastry sheet and roll keeping it ¼ cm thick.

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:54.735
We are not filling anything in these biscuits.

00:03:55.008 --> 00:03:57.414
Simply cut and place on the tray.

00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:22.883
Place them in the tray at some distance.

00:04:31.453 --> 00:04:37.234
Preheat oven at 230 degree centigrade.

00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:41.938
Now place the puff biscuits in oven for baking.

00:04:42.422 --> 00:04:52.734
Preheat the oven at maximum temperature.

00:04:53.062 --> 00:05:12.836
Place the biscuits at bottom rack and set for 10 minutes on same temperature and then check.

00:05:21.032 --> 00:05:24.899
Puff pastry biscuits have turned golden brown in color.

00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:39.842
Cook biscuits for 4 more minutes if they are light brown in color.

00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:13.941
Time may vary as per different models.

00:06:14.278 --> 00:06:27.567
Bake for 10 minutes first on 230 degree centigrade and bake while keeping a check on time.

00:06:28.184 --> 00:06:34.161
Appetizing and crusty golden brown puff pastry biscuits are ready

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:44.474
Store them in air tight container for a month once they turn frigid completely.
