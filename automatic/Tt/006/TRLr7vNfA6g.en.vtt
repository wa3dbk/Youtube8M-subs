00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.960
 hello pointless are their to our 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.880
 ask this topic again and again 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.549
 a magic thought we'll do it 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.009
 a little child point pants with circle 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.400
 apropos I believe the big trees the 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.400
 do not believe it 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.189
 he looks beautiful out of light 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.990
 you just why when you 're with stuff 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.480
 Of course, playing a bit is then 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.550
 also nice the optics in the materials 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.650
 you can give rights here very much 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.420
 well process what is this here 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.489
 big difference except the circle 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.219
 apropos to our forecast maxi we 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.680
 yes in the program is a bit more relaxed 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.140
 actually and then very nice 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.629
 now we have cut now 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.079
 but sometimes the front middle in the break 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.430
 that is to say one is and garant is 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.079
 For the time being empty of the material pressure 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.879
 were laid and you put off 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.800
 Stoffdruck sits since the bit here 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.840
 purely if you open the stains 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.340
 looking a bit wild already took off 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.140
 a bit wild but it gets you 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.730
 a trousers and a fine man as a man 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.759
 Maybe it should be up here 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.610
 and mark what relatively explains so 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.090
 here is the pants band below, yes, steps 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.340
 to Munich 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.689
 this is where it comes on the circle 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.170
 we are right in the machine 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.210
 show the cuffs would be quite normal 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.340
 as you and I had as usual 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.610
 sewed on as some just know that 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.500
 Special of the circle, there are still 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.210
 government aid like we do now 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.210
 I saw myself therefore 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.770
 that is, the circle is chosen so pure 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.350
 then the circle has to be natural 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.520
 he has to finish in there afterwards 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.200
 that is from the top that will then 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.200
 Although be closed 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.810
 the swimmers ok start to the machine 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.470
 and then we take these agents pompously 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:09.200
 together well then take the now 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:16.160
 circle time is now taking one more time 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.850
 admitting his come a little later his 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.870
 had biskind 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:25.340
 the cooperation may be missing 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.320
 us still something funny a knife 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.769
 just apply to the circulation 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.769
 can 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:43.150
 if you are a bit on the world 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.150
 Definitely something with her face at all 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.840
 Well then we have sewn the circle 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.010
 here you have the steps we need 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.360
 then immediately to the other side 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.250
 the cameraman still meant so we 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.970
 to make such a back for sale that 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.650
 we have a good target 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.840
 that would be double on cheap here 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.269
 above it has to be put on and below 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.680
 it must go out to the wine , but then 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.780
 make a snap and another one 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.090
 Ordinary education would become that 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.260
 do not have to find it that way 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:38.030
 that is theoretically possible 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:42.410
 assume wrong then have two now 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.400
 incorporated circles and then does the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.019
 in Canada the rest 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.090
 we're only doing it in the back 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.019
 close now disabled with diva 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.090
 frame taken 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.630
 just have to be careful now that here 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:00.670
 the circles meet 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.670
 that's right 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.169
 Just take a look 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:36.870
 yes very nice wet last wanted yes 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.550
 and I really planned that now 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.720
 Almost a pair of pants inside 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.570
 Completed steps 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.220
 and then I have the print this 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.419
 politics is already finished I am 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.310
 still on it and then the kwg is off 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:55.770
 Can we really variations here 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.889
 make indication was a good one 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.889
 keyword 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.710
 Well, there is already such a big one 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:28.780
 moment turns that can do that 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:30.070
 to see better with turning point there you have to 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.200
 but a bit tinker with it 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.410
 his nice eyes eyes mouth 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.410
 nose 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.780
 Maybe it was a helicopter motif, though 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.080
 She looks then from the front here this 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.300
 get out of here then we have here 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.960
 BÃ¼ndchen MÃ¼nchen right and left 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.440
 Shoot half a clip 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.600
 grundkurs cuffs sew his people 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.960
 moment saw here must be sometimes 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.960
 pinch 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.880
 that will be right from the forest here 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:09.430
 put on it now do not wrap like that 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:13.810
 nice thank you that feels you 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.640
 on this and so to speak here 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.650
 right on the right is on again 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.650
 the Bund and the Munich against 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.730
 principle here is the same and with is the 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.000
 Russian finished that makes the clock 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.270
 looked felt five minutes went 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.270
 fast 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.290
 but now every little internet 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.790
 get away from it but no suture in it 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.320
 So you can decide for yourself if 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.970
 the first with break or with nat 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:45.810
 are you doing it and the munich is still working ? 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.530
 for service principle here of course the 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:52.530
 sides stitched to the strings nice 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.530
 cabinet 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:01.950
 ok then let's say pumphose with circular 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.950
 Have fun
