with less cacao powder more moisturizer
yeah<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:15.330> kind<00:04:16.330> of<00:04:16.420> altering<00:04:16.960> it<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.640> build<00:04:18.640> up

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970

really<00:04:52.150> good<00:04:52.390> but<00:04:52.720> again<00:04:52.900> alter<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.800> recipe<00:04:54.160> a

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
really good but again alter the recipe a

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.740 
really good but again alter the recipe a
little<00:04:54.250> bit<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.640> your<00:04:54.729> liking<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.419> I

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
little bit to your liking and and I

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.630 
little bit to your liking and and I
would<00:04:55.900> say<00:04:56.080> build<00:04:56.380> up<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:56.919> color<00:04:57.220> gradually

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
would say build up that color gradually

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.520 
would say build up that color gradually
because<00:04:58.510> it'll<00:04:58.870> definitely<00:04:59.050> look<00:04:59.290> more

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
because it'll definitely look more

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.680 
because it'll definitely look more
natural<00:04:59.979> yeah<00:05:00.190> but<00:05:00.850> other<00:05:01.030> than<00:05:01.240> that<00:05:01.300> it

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
natural yeah but other than that it

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.650
