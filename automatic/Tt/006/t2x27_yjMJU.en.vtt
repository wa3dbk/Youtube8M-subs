00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.260
 so now for group-wide and photos brooding today, researchers always compared 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.019
 put a tick to make the region is my age of times 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.759
 Neckties by Nadine Jansen did not really matter 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.189
 you do not have to take anymore 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.789
 and for all the spreads I do two optional ones as well 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.499
 lives 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.969
 Percent sees you make a new level on the flank with a dock 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.560
 Now, first of all, the selection of tools Sandbox sees 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.470
 namely that course tool Klaus tool 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.490
 and in as front and drivers the lighter color so to Lübeck 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.420
 go up 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.350
 Jens Kaup 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.860
 «And the detonator and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.330
 Lost percent 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.960
 a dark gray 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.550
 and quoting percent of Annette from Blues half fat 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.740
 What does it look like? 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.740
 so now we realize the selection revive 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.670
 or not and now go to edit and transform 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.470
 and tend 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.990
 and no us that they are goals so so the anchor points top right and up 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.850
 Left 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 such a piece of small groups 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.520
 with it all 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.520
 Schriek borrowed 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.680
 so you could give up now 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.390
 Places of the Maran 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.190
 takes the right to choose it tools do not come that look like that 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.270
 3ds 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.720
 sit down on the lower left 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.220
 make such a small project no line 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.350
 until at the KAP under bottom right 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.350
 namely the fillet® back 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.619
 and if there is a driver here with brighter colors and join in 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.930
 3d effect 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.700
 looks a bit bitter but waited for a topic 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.159
 Now we take the way back earlier and do a little 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.760
 easy is here I do not know 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.040
 if you know that mine 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.040
 but beforehand must definitely make a new level 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.689
 and 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.869
 Niemietz Wales course tool I am a bit distributed 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.869
 and you just take it 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.979
 Year fuller and too transparent 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.979
 as a result and have the proof 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.689
 and just do it from top to bottom all over the world 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.689
 the opacity set the world to zero 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.549
 so now take a spud wet tool again 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.750
 and do your right it show you can look again i do that 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.449
 their 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.349
 of course you can do it that easy too of course you can do it in the 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.109
 make second piece of tool 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.659
 Mansiz too clean but I also make it very short polish 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.359
 Tool 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.419
 and after you 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.419
 anything so that the selection of waves can 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.969
 and now sits active once Seca fell to one hundred percent Unger process 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.969
 and cut or simply kick out jam XVI 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:07.349
 so and now all the rest here has to be removed now and do that 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.649
 finally give it 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.969
 or make costs gross emigrated per liter let tool 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.649
 and the whole thing young whole dock 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.299
 among children, simply percent 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.459
 to speech disorders him 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.339
 then take care then remove 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.579
 Euro the chlorine his keyboard shortcut did not work out then the man was 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:37.719
 can affect 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.529
 and can remove back 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.209
 those of the butcher in Bavaria are the dog was removed 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.209
 and this level is now set at 50 percent 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.759
 now always as good as finished now relative of the two and three of the 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.989
 from other disorders 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.159
 because the black him just an optional Bochum no longer a star 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.159
 to control topics at selected level 3 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.899
 and do something about the same in Dokki 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:04.949
 so 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.469
 Do you want to get out of it all? 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.469
 delete the black in Metz Metz 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.099
 There is also a distribution store under 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.109
 under coach Mason because I say nothing and OK 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.129
 under par format very important PNG 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.870
 then Danzl will not be transparent 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.249
 There was also saving and at the load, we can all expect that now 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.249
 Smash Hits Rock IT looks or percent 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.490
 as a game of hatch a hole to be built or what I know 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.160
 and i would say we have a lot of teamwork that i use this from 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.400
 Of course you can do better here with Beaus is a piece of tool 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.020
 but on the whole I think the first time 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.569
 have fun with it and it's the first escape
