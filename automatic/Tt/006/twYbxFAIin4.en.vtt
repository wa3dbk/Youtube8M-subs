00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.340 
that's how they're behind
and<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.460> means<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:57.079> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.200> going

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and that means some going to be going

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.160 
and that means some going to be going
between<00:00:58.620> C<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> G<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.700> family<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.140> you

between C and G your family do so so you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.600 
between C and G your family do so so you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
formation as well which makes it easy

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:15.450 
formation as well which makes it easy
transition<00:01:05.210> C<00:01:06.860> back<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> G<00:01:08.340> okay

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
can like this that way the transition

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.800 
can like this that way the transition
shouldn't<00:01:23.590> see<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:24.640> depth<00:01:24.850> for<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.570> string

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810

shouldn't see the depth for a string
fret<00:01:25.960> on<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.140> third<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.590> easier<00:01:27.240> all<00:01:28.240> right

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
let's just get the intro out of the way

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.010 
let's just get the intro out of the way
quickly<00:01:30.280> first<00:01:32.610> those<00:01:33.610> two<00:01:33.820> chords<00:01:34.150> which<00:01:34.810> are

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
quickly first those two chords which are

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.190 
quickly first those two chords which are
a<00:01:35.229> D<00:01:35.830> chord<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.399> sorry<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:36.790> G<00:01:37.060> chord<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:38.020> D

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
a D chord a sorry a G chord and a D

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.430 
a D chord a sorry a G chord and a D
chord<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.800> up<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.100> fretboard<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:40.080> this<00:01:41.080> G

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
chord just up the fretboard so this G

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.780 
chord just up the fretboard so this G
actually<00:01:41.950> is<00:01:42.340> shaped<00:01:42.610> like<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.820> D<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:44.640> make<00:01:45.640> your

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
actually is shaped like a D so make your

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.240 
actually is shaped like a D so make your
deformation<00:01:46.509> where<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:46.720> normally<00:01:46.869> would

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
deformation where you normally would

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.120 
deformation where you normally would
slide<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.399> up<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.789> seventh<00:01:49.509> fret<00:01:50.130> in

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
slide it up to the seventh fret in

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.790 
slide it up to the seventh fret in
relation<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.570> capo<00:01:55.289> just<00:01:56.289> strum<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.770> top

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
relation to the capo just strum the top

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.190 
relation to the capo just strum the top
three<00:01:57.220> strings<00:01:59.100> next<00:02:00.100> chord<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.840> G<00:02:02.170> chord

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
three strings next chord is a G chord

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.830 
three strings next chord is a G chord
but<00:02:03.190> it's<00:02:03.340> going<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:03.640> shaped<00:02:03.910> like<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.360> so

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
but it's going to be shaped like this so

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.510 
but it's going to be shaped like this so
the<00:02:04.929> first<00:02:05.200> string<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.500> fretted<00:02:05.890> on<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.250> fifth

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
the first string is fretted on the fifth

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
and the second and third strings are

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.660 
and the second and third strings are
threaded<00:02:10.000> on<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.179> seventh<00:02:11.400> strum<00:02:12.400> from<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
threaded on the seventh strum from the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.000 
threaded on the seventh strum from the
fourth<00:02:13.000> string<00:02:13.720> down<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.560> fourth<00:02:14.830> is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
fourth string down the fourth is

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:23.670 
fourth string down the fourth is
effectively<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.580> d<00:02:16.890> c<00:02:17.890> it

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.749 
can just leave that pinky there just
come<00:06:42.220> back<00:06:42.370> and<00:06:42.520> shape<00:06:42.759> your<00:06:42.910> D<00:06:44.400> at<00:06:45.400> least<00:06:45.580> the

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
come back and shape your D at least the

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.909 
come back and shape your D at least the
pinkies<00:06:46.090> come<00:06:46.360> back<00:06:46.539> to<00:06:46.780> the<00:06:46.900> D<00:06:47.080> so<00:06:47.680> from<00:06:47.830> the

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
pinkies come back to the D so from the

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:57.860 
pinkies come back to the D so from the
deity<00:06:48.900> so

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.010

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
and back into a verse again then I think

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.560

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
all you've got to do is repeat the

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.340 
all you've got to do is repeat the
repeat<00:07:03.570> another<00:07:03.750> verse

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
repeat another verse

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.120 
repeat another verse
repeat<00:07:05.100> bridge<00:07:05.400> again<00:07:05.699> and<00:07:06.260> the<00:07:07.260> outro<00:07:07.710> is

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
repeat bridge again and the outro is

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.320 
repeat bridge again and the outro is
just<00:07:08.699> again<00:07:09.660> the<00:07:09.780> same<00:07:09.990> as<00:07:10.080> the<00:07:10.139> intro<00:07:10.410> to<00:07:11.330> the

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330

parts<00:07:15.900> to<00:07:16.080> the<00:07:16.169> song<00:07:16.580> but<00:07:17.580> they<00:07:17.760> as<00:07:18.120> I<00:07:18.210> said

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
parts to the song but they as I said

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.960 
parts to the song but they as I said
lots<00:07:18.510> of<00:07:18.600> quick<00:07:18.780> chord<00:07:19.020> changes<00:07:19.520> it<00:07:20.520> is<00:07:20.699> fairly

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
lots of quick chord changes it is fairly

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.760 
lots of quick chord changes it is fairly
quick<00:07:21.240> song<00:07:21.510> so<00:07:21.720> even<00:07:21.930> when<00:07:22.050> I<00:07:22.110> played<00:07:22.350> that<00:07:22.560> I

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
quick song so even when I played that I

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.350 
quick song so even when I played that I
said<00:07:23.010> I<00:07:23.040> played<00:07:23.310> it<00:07:23.430> up<00:07:23.520> to<00:07:23.669> speed<00:07:23.790> it<00:07:24.060> probably

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
said I played it up to speed it probably

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.960 
said I played it up to speed it probably
was<00:07:24.479> still<00:07:24.690> a<00:07:24.720> bit<00:07:24.870> slow<00:07:25.340> but<00:07:26.340> obviously<00:07:26.669> just

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
was still a bit slow but obviously just

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.219 
was still a bit slow but obviously just
start<00:07:27.240> learning<00:07:27.570> it<00:07:27.630> slowly<00:07:27.900> and<00:07:28.110> then<00:07:28.199> speed

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:28.229 
start learning it slowly and then speed

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:30.560 
start learning it slowly and then speed
it<00:07:28.560> up<00:07:28.650> as<00:07:28.830> you<00:07:28.919> become<00:07:29.190> more<00:07:29.430> familiar<00:07:30.120> with

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
it up as you become more familiar with

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.340 
it up as you become more familiar with
the<00:07:30.660> chords<00:07:30.990> I<00:07:32.870> think<00:07:33.870> that's<00:07:33.990> all<00:07:34.110> I<00:07:34.139> need<00:07:34.320> to

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.350 
the chords I think that's all I need to

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.640 
the chords I think that's all I need to
show<00:07:34.470> you<00:07:34.590> for<00:07:35.040> this<00:07:35.130> one<00:07:35.310> so<00:07:35.930> anyway<00:07:36.930> that<00:07:37.620> was

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650 
show you for this one so anyway that was

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.669 
show you for this one so anyway that was
good<00:07:37.860> enough<00:07:37.979> for<00:07:38.040> you<00:07:38.220> like
