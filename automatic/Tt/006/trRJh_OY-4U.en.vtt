00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 developing a four-story project 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.960
 townhouse architects studio artyom 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.080
 proposed to create aerial stairs on 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.820
 metal guides for 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.549
 product coordination 3d studio department 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.330
 I use the created drawings 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.359
 develops the appearance of the product 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.830
 finished sketches reliably show 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.449
 appearance of the stairs after implementation 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.609
 products agreed by the customer, we 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.060
 proceed to the development of constructive 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.920
 drawings and calculations of bearing capacity 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.130
 determine the material thickness and location 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.210
 mounts on the construction site 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.210
 set embedded items in 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.410
 according to the created drawings 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 at the same time work on 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.989
 metal elements stairs in 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.250
 workshop 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:53.030
 we are in the red chamber of the zaur 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.620
 white paint almost go on fire 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.870
 metal elements made of 10 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.329
 centimeter steel sheets with length 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.329
 more than four meters the weight of each product 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.810
 more than 150 kilograms of painting 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.640
 produced in the chamber in the same way 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.049
 automakers and repair shops 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.600
 applies paint coatings on 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.119
 cars 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.280
 after 10 days the products are installed on 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.799
 mark the construction process is not complete 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.290
 for this reason, instead of finishing 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.240
 step mounted temporary installation 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.310
 continues with the completion 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.930
 object mounted steps 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.930
 installed and glass fencing 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.900
 well they have stairs installed on our 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.660
 the object you can now independently 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.990
 ready to watch like this and compare it 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.990
 with views before the start of work 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.140
 additional information and other 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.880
 projects completed study Artem see
