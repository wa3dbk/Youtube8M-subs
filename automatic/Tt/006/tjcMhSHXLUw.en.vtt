the weekend but the key things for these
bikes<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:41.329> we've<00:00:42.329> worked<00:00:42.570> recently<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
bikes is we've worked recently with the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
bikes is we've worked recently with the
guys<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.520> rock<00:00:44.730> shock<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.780> produce<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
guys at rock shock to produce a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.420 
guys at rock shock to produce a
co-branded<00:00:47.129> fork<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.430> carbon

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
co-branded fork so we have a carbon

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.709 
co-branded fork so we have a carbon
crown<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.410> tapered<00:00:52.410> steerer<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:54.390> may

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
crown and tapered steerer that you may

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
crown and tapered steerer that you may
be<00:00:54.780> aware<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.289> we've<00:00:55.440> had<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> epics

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
be aware of that we've had on the epics

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.180 
be aware of that we've had on the epics
and<00:00:56.640> stamp<00:00:57.210> jumpers<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:58.500> made<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and stamp jumpers we made it with a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.979 
and stamp jumpers we made it with a
rebar<00:00:59.550> lower<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:00.390> runs<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.809> Reaver

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
rebar lower it also runs the Reaver

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.939 
rebar lower it also runs the Reaver
internals<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.800> well<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.170> testing<00:01:04.830> right

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
internals as well so in testing right

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.620 
internals as well so in testing right
now<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.489> proving<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> be<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> lightest<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
now it's proving to be the lightest and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.770 
now it's proving to be the lightest and
stiff<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.960> 29<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> fork<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> market<00:01:08.780> so

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
stiff is 29 a fork out on the market so

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.649 
stiff is 29 a fork out on the market so
that's<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:11.040> key<00:01:11.250> tapered<00:01:11.820> tapered<00:01:12.390> steerer

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that's some key tapered tapered steerer

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.620 
that's some key tapered tapered steerer
inch<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> half<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.590> inch<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.860> 1/8<00:01:14.420> again<00:01:15.420> so

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
inch and a half to inch and 1/8 again so

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420 
inch and a half to inch and 1/8 again so
gives<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.930> save<00:01:16.590> weight<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.040> also<00:01:17.130> you've

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
gives you save weight but also you've

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.969 
gives you save weight but also you've
increased<00:01:17.790> front-end<00:01:18.180> stiffness<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.020> then

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
increased front-end stiffness and then

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.510 
increased front-end stiffness and then
the<00:01:20.700> tried-and-true<00:01:21.259> suspension<00:01:22.259> technology

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
the tried-and-true suspension technology

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.690 
the tried-and-true suspension technology
that<00:01:23.520> we've<00:01:23.640> had<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.659> epics<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.430> brain

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that we've had on epics the the brain

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.690 
that we've had on epics the the brain
shock<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.299> everything<00:01:27.689> very<00:01:28.350> lightweight

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
shock on everything very lightweight

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.039 
shock on everything very lightweight
this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.880> really<00:01:30.210> an<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.890> 29<00:01:31.890> race<00:01:32.549> bike

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
this is really an out now 29 race bike

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.649 
this is really an out now 29 race bike
spec<00:01:34.049> wise<00:01:34.610> there'll<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.759> marathon<00:01:36.150> version

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
spec wise there'll be a marathon version

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.630 
spec wise there'll be a marathon version
which<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.900> our<00:01:37.020> high-end<00:01:37.340> should<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
which is our high-end should have the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.899 
which is our high-end should have the
new<00:01:38.850> SRAM<00:01:39.240> double<00:01:39.750> X<00:01:39.900> components<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.909> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
new SRAM double X components on it and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.190 
new SRAM double X components on it and
then<00:01:42.060> they'll<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.360> various<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:42.960> three

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
then they'll be various I think three

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.580 
then they'll be various I think three
versions<00:01:43.380> after<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:45.350> spec<00:01:46.350> that's

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
versions after that with spec that's

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
versions after that with spec that's
still<00:01:47.280> being<00:01:47.430> decided<00:01:47.820> as<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.210> speak<00:01:48.479> but

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
still being decided as we speak but

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.620 
still being decided as we speak but
should<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.710> available<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.310> stores<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:51.060> October

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
so that is the 2010 29 epic and they're

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.730 
so that is the 2010 29 epic and they're
moving<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:58.640> for<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.810> carbon<00:02:01.049> fans<00:02:01.469> out<00:02:01.710> there

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
similarly found on stub jumpers and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.930 
similarly found on stub jumpers and
stuff<00:02:28.540> aids<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.350> lateral<00:02:29.740> stiffness<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
stuff aids in lateral stiffness of the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.090 
stuff aids in lateral stiffness of the
fork<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.250> we<00:02:33.370> have<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.000> then<00:02:35.100> carbon

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
fork so we have that and then carbon

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.990 
fork so we have that and then carbon
crank<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:37.480> you've<00:02:37.660> seen<00:02:37.930> on<00:02:38.140> epics<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.730> again

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
crank that you've seen on epics so again

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.610 
crank that you've seen on epics so again
very<00:02:40.030> lightweight<00:02:40.510> very<00:02:40.720> stiff<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:43.239> then<00:02:43.620> as

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
very lightweight very stiff and then as

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.900 
very lightweight very stiff and then as
with<00:02:44.739> all<00:02:44.920> these<00:02:45.040> bikes<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.520> know<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.700> you

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
with all these bikes you know you you

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.130 
with all these bikes you know you you
want<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.120> put<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.330> power<00:02:46.540> down<00:02:46.630> so<00:02:46.930> it's<00:02:47.080> a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
want to put the power down so it's a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.560 
want to put the power down so it's a
very<00:02:47.320> large<00:02:47.500> oversize<00:02:48.130> down<00:02:48.430> tube<00:02:48.730> large

very large oversize down tube large

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.110 
very large oversize down tube large
bottom<00:02:49.930> bracket<00:02:50.260> area<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.800> big<00:02:51.280> chain<00:02:51.520> stays<00:02:51.850> so

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
bottom bracket area a big chain stays so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.050 
bottom bracket area a big chain stays so
a<00:02:52.150> lot<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.450> lateral<00:02:53.350> stiffness<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:54.610> also<00:02:54.790> have

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
a lot of lateral stiffness we also have

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.960 
a lot of lateral stiffness we also have
probably<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.260> shortest<00:02:56.530> wheelbase<00:02:57.130> or<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.489> 29

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
probably the shortest wheelbase or a 29

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.940 
probably the shortest wheelbase or a 29
up<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.690> that's<00:02:59.020> achieved<00:02:59.380> by<00:02:59.590> actually

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
up and that's achieved by actually

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.620 
up and that's achieved by actually
curving<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.550> seat<00:03:00.760> tube<00:03:01.000> so<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.209> can<00:03:01.360> really

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
curving the seat tube so you can really

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.330 
curving the seat tube so you can really
tuck<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.050> wheel<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.840> that's<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.350> very

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
tuck the wheel in so that's a very

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.070 
tuck the wheel in so that's a very
compliant<00:03:06.760> ride<00:03:07.120> we<00:03:07.450> took<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.690> little<00:03:07.930> bit<00:03:08.020> of

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
compliant ride we took a little bit of

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.320 
compliant ride we took a little bit of
material<00:03:08.320> out<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.709> seat<00:03:08.890> stays<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:10.180> will

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
material out of the seat stays this will

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.509 
material out of the seat stays this will
be<00:03:10.420> available<00:03:10.780> as<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.930> frame<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.350> fork<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:12.220> as

they'll<00:03:18.250> have<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> different<00:03:18.820> fork<00:03:19.090> with<00:03:19.390> an

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
they'll have a different fork with an

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.229 
they'll have a different fork with an
adapter<00:03:19.959> in<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:21.160> for<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.790> single<00:03:22.090> speed

29<00:03:31.000> as<00:03:31.180> for<00:03:31.330> 2010<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.140> you've<00:03:32.620> got<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.830> sneak

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
29 as for 2010 so you've got the sneak

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:43.270 
29 as for 2010 so you've got the sneak
peak<00:03:33.220> first<00:03:33.489> here
