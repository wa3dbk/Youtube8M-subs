00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.350
 Hello calendar with you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.269
 on the channel trophy water to the middle 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.490
 the summer is warming up 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.380
 and when it reaches 20 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 degrees actual becomes 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.910
 fishing under a starry sky in the afternoon fish 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.600
 will hide at the bottom and near 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.789
 seaweed 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.550
 but despite this even the hottest 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.130
 day with the right approach can be mined 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.500
 a couple of worthy copies so for example 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.529
 I have a period of Jora which 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 last two weeks except the line on this 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.719
 week we'll talk about catching 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.210
 roaches 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.649
 catfish and perch but first things first 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.590
 the sky this week will be mostly 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.750
 sunny not significant cloudiness 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.760
 maybe only thursday and sunday and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.140
 will be accompanied by light rainfall 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.230
 daytime temperature will vary in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.379
 during the week from plus 23 to plus 27 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.000
 degrees and at dusk from plus 15 to + 19 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.439
 air pressure will be normal and 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.060
 go down briefly in the middle of the week 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.640
 it is at this time that fishing will pick up 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.100
 maximum speed with less 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.259
 pressure fish easier to move and noticeable 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.170
 increases metabolism forcing her 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.790
 eat more often than usual 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.909
 roach can be found in almost any 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.400
 she prefers this month 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.369
 clean water and open areas in among 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.900
 aquatic vegetation relevance 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.810
 gains night fishing 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.549
 night and morning roach is closest to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.820
 surface and shows remarkable 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.579
 activity catching her best on 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.980
 float fishing rod equipped with a coil and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.930
 crossing rings 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.950
 rod length for successful casting for 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.690
 aquatic vegetation 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.140
 must be at least six meters 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.780
 main line 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.150
 is taken with a diameter of 0 integer 0 8 0 integer 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.180
 one millimeter and a little thinner 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.980
 leads 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.080
 if your goal is a big roach then 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.860
 As a bait it is better to take moldy worm 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.899
 or pike perch in the first place is worth 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.760
 search in places with depth differences 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.460
 under the snags in the pools and pits this fish 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.440
 best to catch from a boat into a plumb for 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.140
 this besides the boat itself will need 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.270
 stiff rod up to three meters 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.880
 crossing rings and inertialess 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.920
 coil 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.040
 diameter of the main fishing line is about 0 whole 3 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.520
 millimeters and leads to 0 as many as 25 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.970
 millimeters the best catch goes on 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.080
 live bait 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.840
 right at the bottom of the stream also 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.960
 spinning spinning is popular 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.209
 twisters and vibrotails tench will 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.320
 hold on to tones and backwaters where 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.090
 eat bloodworms and these peak worms 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.360
 lazy activity falls on the second 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.180
 half a month usually biting begins with 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.660
 seven in the morning and lasts until noon then 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.950
 resumes in the late afternoon 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.910
 The most popular tackle for catching this 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.430
 fish float rod with reel fishing line 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.390
 is taken from 0 as much as 25 millimeters with 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.330
 hook on mi6 number eight for me 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.739
 very indecisive bite 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.660
 flow to is done only in that case 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.480
 if you are sure that the fish swallowed 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.550
 bait it should be made abruptly 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.650
 in order to pierce the fat lip of this fish 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.180
 we continue to catch from the shore to the donk itself 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.370
 or from a boat with a crook 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.439
 in July he goes out for food in 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.840
 mostly after sunset and hunt up 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.719
 in the early morning but in the afternoon biting is not 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.489
 is terminated 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:50.280
 bait for this fish will perfectly serve 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.329
 a bunch of worms a bear cub or a liver 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.430
 crustacean meat summarize the weather 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.739
 It is expected to be mostly sunny and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.379
 closer to the middle of the week is expected 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.389
 pressure drop the best days for 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.079
 going fishing will be thursday by 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.719
 Sunday 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.659
 roach goes out into the open and 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:12.739
 active night time catching 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.780
 float on moldy worm or dough 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.090
 the best places for zander fishing will be 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.930
 the boundaries of the currents catch spinning on 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.479
 bait bait or vibrotail and laziness 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.870
 keeps creeks feed cottage cheese 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.599
 as a nozzle we use moth or 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.990
 crustaceans continue to catch catfish on 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.729
 Donkey or from a boat using a Kwok 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.979
 nozzle traditional bunch of worms with 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.380
 leech infusion 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.330
 grasshoppers and crustaceans I wish you 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.139
 have a good time fishing and neither 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.139
 tail scales
