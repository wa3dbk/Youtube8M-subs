00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
of the madness and weird boundaries for

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.410 
of the madness and weird boundaries for
them<00:01:42.049> in<00:01:43.049> various<00:01:43.470> places<00:01:43.680> around<00:01:43.979> here<00:01:44.420> but

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
them in various places around here but

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.120 
them in various places around here but
this<00:01:45.570> place<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.960> actually<00:01:46.140> pretty<00:01:46.890> wide<00:01:47.100> open

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
this place is actually pretty wide open

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.000 
this place is actually pretty wide open
there's<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.729> lot<00:01:47.939> kind<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> foliage

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
there's a lot kind of what a foliage

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.760 
there's a lot kind of what a foliage
and<00:01:51.400> mostly<00:01:52.120> it<00:01:52.210> was<00:01:52.270> built<00:01:52.570> just<00:01:52.630> for<00:01:52.900> looking

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
and mostly it was built just for looking

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.470 
and mostly it was built just for looking
outside<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.280> map<00:01:54.430> it's<00:01:54.760> not<00:01:54.970> built<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.360> run

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
outside of the map it's not built to run

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.990 
outside of the map it's not built to run
around<00:01:55.600> them<00:01:55.960> but<00:01:56.170> it's<00:01:56.980> some<00:01:57.070> solid<00:01:57.460> mostly

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
around them but it's some solid mostly

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.750 
around them but it's some solid mostly
most<00:01:58.720> of<00:01:58.900> its<00:01:59.020> solid<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.950> we<00:02:00.130> can<00:02:00.430> run<00:02:00.670> around

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
most of its solid that we can run around

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.900 
most of its solid that we can run around
on<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:01.390> let's<00:02:01.960> start<00:02:02.530> actually<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.610> tour

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
on it so let's start actually the tour

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.530 
on it so let's start actually the tour
little<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:04.870> tore<00:02:05.200> from<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:06.010> front<00:02:06.670> while<00:02:07.300> what

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
little we tore from the front while what

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.870 
little we tore from the front while what
I<00:02:07.720> can<00:02:08.080> only<00:02:08.140> assume<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.880> front<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.620> so

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
I can only assume that the front is so

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.230 
I can only assume that the front is so
we've<00:02:12.880> got<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.090> big<00:02:13.330> wide<00:02:13.570> open<00:02:13.930> area<00:02:14.080> here<00:02:14.350> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
we've got a big wide open area here and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.460 
we've got a big wide open area here and
it's<00:02:16.240> pretty<00:02:16.510> empty<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.170> can't<00:02:17.380> even

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
it's pretty empty and you can't even

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.200 
it's pretty empty and you can't even
really<00:02:17.620> see<00:02:17.740> much<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.580> right<00:02:19.030> way<00:02:19.150> you

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
really see much of this right way you

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.540 
really see much of this right way you
can<00:02:19.360> see<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.660> from<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.900> top<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.490> top<00:02:21.490> of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
can see it from the top of the top of

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.620 
can see it from the top of the top of
the<00:02:21.610> window<00:02:21.700> up<00:02:21.910> there<00:02:21.940> they're<00:02:22.240> zombies<00:02:22.300> cod

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
the window up there they're zombies cod

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.880 
the window up there they're zombies cod
and<00:02:22.750> come<00:02:22.900> down<00:02:23.080> here<00:02:23.260> which<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.500> pretty<00:02:23.680> cool

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and come down here which is pretty cool

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.890 
and come down here which is pretty cool
so<00:02:24.520> some<00:02:24.790> nice<00:02:24.910> little<00:02:25.120> chill<00:02:25.270> out<00:02:25.360> area<00:02:25.510> and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
so some nice little chill out area and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.830 
so some nice little chill out area and
we<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:27.010> go<00:02:27.130> as<00:02:27.250> far<00:02:27.550> as<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:28.120> before<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:28.630> fall

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
we can go as far as this before we fall

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.710 
we can go as far as this before we fall
off<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.910> skip<00:02:31.300> around<00:02:31.540> these

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
off so we can skip around these

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.400 
off so we can skip around these
mountains<00:02:31.870> we<00:02:32.230> are<00:02:33.630> your<00:02:34.630> some<00:02:34.810> roads<00:02:35.080> coming

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
mountains we are your some roads coming

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.770 
mountains we are your some roads coming
up<00:02:35.560> around<00:02:35.740> here<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.340> think<00:02:36.850> they'll<00:02:37.270> start

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
up around here I think they'll start

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.870 
up around here I think they'll start
running<00:02:38.110> back<00:02:38.230> up<00:02:38.410> me<00:02:38.560> if<00:02:38.710> I<00:02:38.920> know<00:02:39.430> I'm<00:02:39.640> think

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
running back up me if I know I'm think

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.050 
running back up me if I know I'm think
I'm<00:02:39.970> still<00:02:40.180> safe<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.930> end<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.470> road

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
I'm still safe as the end of this road

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.430 
I'm still safe as the end of this road
so<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.600> like<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.550> kind<00:02:45.550> of<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.670> edge<00:02:45.850> of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
so this is like the kind of the edge of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.810 
so this is like the kind of the edge of
the<00:02:47.440> front<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.950> map<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.370> makes<00:02:48.550> sense

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
the front of the map of that makes sense

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.420 
the front of the map of that makes sense
as<00:02:49.180> far<00:02:49.450> as<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.720> go<00:02:49.990> and<00:02:50.830> if<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:50.980> go<00:02:51.100> down<00:02:51.130> here

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
as far as I can go and if I go down here

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.430 
as far as I can go and if I go down here
now<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.610> scale<00:02:51.850> confused<00:02:52.360> like<00:02:52.690> going<00:02:53.290> on

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
now the scale confused like going on

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.350 
now the scale confused like going on
they<00:02:54.070> might<00:02:54.280> start<00:02:54.490> running<00:02:54.760> at<00:02:54.850> me<00:02:55.030> they

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
they might start running at me they

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.210 
they might start running at me they
definitely<00:02:55.630> conquer<00:02:56.110> like<00:02:56.380> this<00:02:56.830> guy<00:02:56.980> gets

one of the most playable areas outside

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.900 
one of the most playable areas outside
there<00:04:45.600> is<00:04:45.630> in<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.620> zombie<00:04:46.740> maps<00:04:47.070> because

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
there is in the zombie maps because

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.460 
there is in the zombie maps because
there's<00:04:48.330> a<00:04:48.360> lot<00:04:48.389> it's<00:04:48.600> like<00:04:48.840> all<00:04:48.960> really<00:04:49.139> wide

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.930 
open it's probably the most playable but
it<00:04:54.419> wouldn't<00:04:54.810> be<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.169> fun<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.940> literally

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
maybe like a small potent percentage of

ultimate ending of this video and all of
that<00:07:06.340> is<00:07:06.580> pretty<00:07:07.060> much<00:07:07.240> shit<00:07:07.570> this<00:07:07.870> is

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
that is pretty much shit this is

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.720 
that is pretty much shit this is
probably<00:07:08.260> the<00:07:08.440> best<00:07:08.650> map<00:07:08.890> to<00:07:09.070> do<00:07:09.280> this<00:07:09.520> video

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
probably the best map to do this video

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.260 
probably the best map to do this video
on<00:07:10.180> but<00:07:10.600> considering<00:07:11.320> the<00:07:11.700> amount<00:07:12.700> of<00:07:12.910> like

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
on but considering the amount of like

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.790 
on but considering the amount of like
places<00:07:13.750> you<00:07:13.870> can<00:07:14.080> walk<00:07:14.290> about<00:07:14.500> on<00:07:14.620> the<00:07:14.680> other

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
places you can walk about on the other

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.100 
places you can walk about on the other
maps<00:07:15.010> it's<00:07:15.190> quite<00:07:15.400> interesting<00:07:15.700> to<00:07:16.420> see<00:07:16.930> I'm

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
maps it's quite interesting to see I'm

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.320 
maps it's quite interesting to see I'm
actually<00:07:17.290> watch<00:07:17.650> so<00:07:18.370> the<00:07:18.520> fact<00:07:18.760> that<00:07:18.850> this<00:07:19.060> was

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
actually watch so the fact that this was

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.630 
actually watch so the fact that this was
really<00:07:19.810> accessible<00:07:20.470> and<00:07:20.710> like<00:07:20.920> really<00:07:21.220> kind

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.640 
really accessible and like really kind

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.180 
really accessible and like really kind
of<00:07:21.760> open<00:07:22.390> out<00:07:22.510> was<00:07:22.810> the<00:07:23.170> boring<00:07:23.590> part<00:07:23.860> if<00:07:24.040> that

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
of open out was the boring part if that

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.280 
of open out was the boring part if that
makes<00:07:24.430> sense<00:07:24.640> like<00:07:25.300> gameplay<00:07:25.720> wise<00:07:25.930> it<00:07:26.200> was

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
makes sense like gameplay wise it was

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.670 
makes sense like gameplay wise it was
the<00:07:26.410> best<00:07:26.590> but<00:07:27.010> like<00:07:27.640> it<00:07:28.600> entertaining<00:07:29.290> wise

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 
the best but like it entertaining wise

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.430 
the best but like it entertaining wise
it's<00:07:30.280> not<00:07:30.730> so<00:07:31.330> make<00:07:31.570> sure<00:07:31.600> you<00:07:31.930> leave<00:07:32.050> a<00:07:32.110> like

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 
it's not so make sure you leave a like

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.080 
it's not so make sure you leave a like
