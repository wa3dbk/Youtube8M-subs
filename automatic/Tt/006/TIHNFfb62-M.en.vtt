00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi everyone welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.520
 video first thing i wanted 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.340
 thank you for having reached a thousand 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.400
 members really thank you heart 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.410
 for this we can now continue 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.509
 with the video today we are going to see how 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.960
 create a windows form application 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.720
 or how to run a program on one 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.050
 windows window then as before 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.779
 what are we going to do create a new project 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.040
 after which instead of going to the console 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.730
 application let's go to win32 with 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.180
 project and let's go to go here let's go to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.280
 select frame and here we have to give the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.420
 I will call the program name hello 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:52.020
 world we go on next and again on 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.399
 ends at this point we go to the main 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:03.030
 man cpp point we go to delete everything 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:07.700
 the one inside the main ok after that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:12.030
 let's go on setting we go on compiler 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.770
 ok here we go to linker setting 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.400
 then at this point we have to import 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.689
 some libraries I will put you in 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.310
 description a link to download the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.470
 libraries 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.990
 this is the folder where they are present 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.320
 the libraries are called codes and sailing 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.049
 I will then describe you one 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:40.159
 Once you have downloaded this folder you must 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:43.890
 give here the path of three libraries 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:49.560
 that is let's go on codes let's go up 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:54.479
 ccc files and let's go up and go to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.390
 import we are going to import the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.670
 ccc win library 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:04.409
 after that we are going to import the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:08.149
 ccc sw library and let's import 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.149
 the shop library 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:20.620
 ok once these three free ones are imported 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:24.370
 and we go to sales director here we have to 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.239
 go to select the address 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.590
 of the ccc files folder and after that 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.590
 we can press ok 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:44.530
 once this is done let's go to hello 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:51.549
 words let's go to file let's go up on 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:58.989
 our code folder then we go 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:03:04.439
 on cc files and we are going to import the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:09.879
 three books and first 15 cc win ccc shop 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:15.790
 and ccc msw with the related files there plus more 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:19.239
 so this is enough for us 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.930
 win does not take more and more files do 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.540
 open ok 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.780
 we will see that we will put the three point files 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:33.040
 h then the three libraries 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:37.090
 then we will also put the stitch files 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:42.489
 cpp files so the more there and we 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:51.780
 therefore the main ok film remains 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:57.959
 now we are going to include the libraries 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.959
 just writing this way 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:35.320
 ok ccc underscore show point h 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:44.290
 still includes quotes warns 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:46.890
 quotation marks ccc underscore rsw point h 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.270
 and again the quotation marks at this point 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.440
 to start the program we must 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:57.070
 go and write this ccc here ccc 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.860
 winmain and as usual warns 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.460
 braces sorry here 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.440
 int front ok at this point we can 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.919
 go to print on the screen the 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:14.620
 written hello words writing kyi win 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.460
 instead of there we use kyi win using 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:26.800
 open angle brackets and writing 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:27.550
 but this time I am writing by writing 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.919
 messages 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.440
 we must also give the point then 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.669
 writing point diamoli coordinates of 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.050
 where we want the inscription to appear 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:52.200
 then we write open parenthesis points 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:52.200
 round we do give less 99 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.470
 comma and here we write the message 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:16.750
 semicolon final preterm 0 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:24.670
 let's test the program by going 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:28.240
 su bale vendran will buy the writing 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:31.270
 hello world at this point for this 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.790
 video is everything and I invite you to register 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.510
 to the facebook page and to follow me too 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.790
 on twitter 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.760
 if you liked the video as it means 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.300
 I like the next video from mg 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.300
