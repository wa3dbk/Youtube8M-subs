here<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.479> where<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> pressure<00:01:30.990> plates<00:01:31.320> are

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
here is where the pressure plates are

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.910 
here is where the pressure plates are
pretty<00:01:32.430> simple<00:01:32.810> boots<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.960> over<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
pretty simple boots up over here and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.590 
pretty simple boots up over here and
this<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.609> where<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> other<00:01:36.060> picture<00:01:36.359> plates

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
this is where the other picture plates

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.170 
this is where the other picture plates
right<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.740> leads<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> goes<00:01:38.820> into<00:01:39.000> this

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
right and it leads up and goes into this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.819 
right and it leads up and goes into this
and<00:01:39.390> gate<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> don't<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.740> an

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and gate so if you don't know what an

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.539 
and gate so if you don't know what an
and<00:01:41.009> gate<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.340> pretty<00:01:41.670> much<00:01:42.079> this<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:44.250> has<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
and gate is pretty much this this has to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.200 
and gate is pretty much this this has to
go<00:01:44.810> okay<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.170> torch<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.799> go<00:01:46.950> off<00:01:47.219> this

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
go okay for this torch to go off this

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.969 
go okay for this torch to go off this
needs<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.469> torch<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> go

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
needs to be on and for this torch to go

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.120 
needs to be on and for this torch to go
off<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.399> lever<00:01:50.640> has<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.320> such<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.619> if

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
off the lever has to be on such and if

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.999 
off the lever has to be on such and if
they're<00:01:53.340> both<00:01:53.549> both<00:01:54.479> both<00:01:55.079> torches<00:01:55.679> are<00:01:55.829> off

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
they're both both both torches are off

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.130 
they're both both both torches are off
this<00:01:56.609> will<00:01:56.789> go<00:01:56.909> off<00:01:57.030> which<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:57.450> turn<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.899> on

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
this will go off which will turn this on

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.840 
this will go off which will turn this on
and<00:01:59.270> yeah<00:02:00.270> I'll<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.780> turn<00:02:01.289> that<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.920> put<00:02:02.700> in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and yeah I'll like turn that on I put in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
and yeah I'll like turn that on I put in
very<00:02:03.090> regular<00:02:03.390> because<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.289> invert

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
very regular because like I to invert

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.630 
very regular because like I to invert
the<00:02:04.829> signal<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.329> much<00:02:07.399> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.520> your

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the signal so so much this is your

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.240 
the signal so so much this is your
output<00:02:08.789> due<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.690> inputs<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.430> guess<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.530> then

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
output due to inputs I guess and then

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.500 
output due to inputs I guess and then
so<00:02:15.250> now<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.560> lever<00:02:17.830> goes<00:02:18.610> up<00:02:18.790> here<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.270> we

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
so now the lever goes up here and we

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.610 
so now the lever goes up here and we
turn<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:20.350> those<00:02:20.860> turns<00:02:21.820> on<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:23.320> leads

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
turn on just those turns on and it leads

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.830 
turn on just those turns on and it leads
down<00:02:23.830> here<00:02:25.080> where<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.940> signal<00:02:28.510> goes<00:02:28.630> down

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
down here where the signal goes down

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.050 
down here where the signal goes down
here<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.350> inverts<00:02:29.770> here<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.460> turn<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.790> torch

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
here and inverts here to turn this torch

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.370 
here and inverts here to turn this torch
off<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:32.830> keeps<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.520> off<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.900> when<00:02:35.350> I

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
off and it keeps that off and when I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.550 
off and it keeps that off and when I
turn<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.740> on<00:02:35.800> it'll<00:02:36.670> turn<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.470> is

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
turn that on it'll turn on so this is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.040 
turn that on it'll turn on so this is
like<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.860> main<00:02:39.010> part<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:40.000> double<00:02:40.870> doors

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
like the main part of the double doors

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.270 
like the main part of the double doors
so<00:02:41.950> what<00:02:42.040> happens<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.890> piece<00:02:45.130> of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
so what happens is the this piece of

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.720 
so what happens is the this piece of
bread<00:02:45.400> store<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:45.760> here<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:47.080> turns<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.830> which

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
bread store in here it turns on which

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.600 
bread store in here it turns on which
makes<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.300> block<00:02:49.750> right<00:02:49.780> here<00:02:50.080> turn<00:02:50.980> off<00:02:51.280> so

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
makes this block right here turn off so

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.880 
makes this block right here turn off so
makes<00:02:51.850> this<00:02:52.000> torch<00:02:52.270> turn<00:02:52.930> off<00:02:53.140> which<00:02:53.680> makes

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
makes this torch turn off which makes

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.070 
makes this torch turn off which makes
this<00:02:54.070> one<00:02:54.280> turn<00:02:54.460> on<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:55.420> makes<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:55.720> one<00:02:55.930> turn

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
this one turn on it makes this one turn

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.080 
this one turn on it makes this one turn
off<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.590> think<00:02:57.430> oh<00:02:57.990> sorry<00:02:59.550> that's<00:03:00.550> what<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.820> think

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
off I think oh sorry that's what I think

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.510 
off I think oh sorry that's what I think
that<00:03:01.240> because<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.480> makes<00:03:01.600> sense<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.340> me<00:03:03.340> at

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
that because it makes sense to me at

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.940 
that because it makes sense to me at
least<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:05.170> double<00:03:05.470> doors<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.830> like

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
least and the double doors just like

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.560 
least and the double doors just like
closed<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.550> open<00:03:06.790> cuz<00:03:07.690> our<00:03:07.840> glitch<00:03:08.080> time<00:03:08.950> and

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
closed and open cuz our glitch time and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.310 
closed and open cuz our glitch time and
yeah<00:03:10.570> that's<00:03:10.810> pretty<00:03:10.960> much<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:13.690> thought

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
yeah that's pretty much it and I thought

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.930 
yeah that's pretty much it and I thought
it<00:03:14.440> was<00:03:14.530> pretty<00:03:14.770> cool<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:20.550> give<00:03:21.550> me<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.700> thumbs

cool but what if a creeper comes and
they<00:03:45.460> go<00:03:45.550> on<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.700> pressure<00:03:45.850> plates<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.300> they

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
they go on the pressure plates and they

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.530 
they go on the pressure plates and they
open<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:46.750> kill<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.620> was<00:03:48.160> like<00:03:48.250> hmm<00:03:48.820> thanks
