00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.920
 good afternoon friends and subscribers 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.120
 of youtube on this occasion so here 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.370
 we are making a new video 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.469
 account for you a help video 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.119
 more than anything for all those 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.879
 people who have in mind to buy a 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:18.110
 iphone an ipad or a second iphone 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.310
 hand we know that the icloud lock 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.840
 it is a blockage that is affecting 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.570
 very much the second hand market 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.550
 because people have lost a lot 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.100
 money in the purchase of items that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.030
 they have that blockage in this video because I 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.880
 I am going to give you some recommendations 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.400
 that can help them to have 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.800
 a successful purchase 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.710
 At this point I recommend you very 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.360
 little of preference nothing that you 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.230
 buy a seller by means of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.940
 shipments for what reason because the seller 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.610
 well you can tell them that your article does not 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.220
 has no block etc. but 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.800
 when it comes to you and what 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.320
 want to connect to the internet or want it 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.390
 update and so on you can jump 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.150
 that blockage and what will happen to you 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.580
 they will not be able to contact the seller 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.290
 and your money will have been lost 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.110
 to see how we can avoid this myself 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.820
 I recommend now that both the all 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.580
 you can make purchases 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.160
 in person with the legitimate owners of the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 apparatus is to say that if you present them 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.030
 invoice that the device really 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.549
 it's theirs that so much the better 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.430
 do not buy devices that do not have 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.340
 charge because many sellers do that 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.530
 the device the iphone the iphone not 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.690
 It has a load but it works fine but 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.729
 what happens you buy it come to your 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.770
 home they connect and so on and jump 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.360
 the blockade then you come back to 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.659
 where they bought it and the seller already 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.620
 the earth has already swallowed it 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.680
 look 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.000
 once you are with the person 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.770
 I am going to recommend that it be in a 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 where you can connect 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.990
 the device to a wireless network status 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.270
 this mode if they connect and do not jump 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.640
 no blockade is sure that you 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.830
 they will not have any problem in case of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.610
 that have no disposition to their 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.060
 arrangement a wifi connection go to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.060
 device 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.430
 this is a first generation ipad and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.080
 this is a fourth generation ipod are 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.360
 Very last but still serve me for what 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.030
 that I want to show you once on 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.260
 the device are going to go to the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.260
 Adjustments section 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.590
 they go to adjustments and they go to look for the 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.860
 tab that says icloud there is 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.160
 they go there and if they see an account 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.650
 configured ask the seller to give them 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.830
 deactivate this account because you 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.320
 they are going to carry an unpleasant surprise 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.819
 especially if this function is active 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.640
 to search for my ipad or iphone or my ipod 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.719
 in 27 you are going to deactivate this 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.480
 function and they will jump a 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:59.420
 password if the seller does not know the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.150
 password do not buy anything and better 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.889
 look for a trusted seller 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.900
 because he's sure it 's that that 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.319
 device has the blocking of 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.120
 icloud 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.609
 another of the things that you are going to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.260
 Check is that it's time to get into 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.260
 to the icloud account 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.540
 keep in mind this you have to 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.250
 appear something like this when you 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.379
 they go there to the icloud tab 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.599
 have to show something like that is what 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.430
 means this is not linked 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.150
 to no account the device that they go 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.040
 to buy 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.140
 so when you connect it to 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.150
 internet or want to update it or something 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.180
 they will have no problem 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.790
 moment of the update 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.439
 similarly this also applies to 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.180
 sites 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.500
 because it also affects them of this type 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.020
 blocking 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:56.720
 they will also go to icloud here is 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.000
 and here I have my account set up 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.130
 observe that there is nothing configured in 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.230
 the ipod in the same way if it has 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.000
 I see them and when they deactivate this they see 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.790
 with a password ask the seller to 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.480
 Deactivates it if the seller does not know the 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.670
 account 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.110
 I repeat, do not buy anything better 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.110
 look for another trustworthy seller 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.100
 always look for what 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.670
 when the extra mess eyelash 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.550
 cloud something comes out 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.040
 that is not linked to any account 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.810
 well in this way when you 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.850
 verify that all these these 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.980
 movements are correct or it comes out as 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.010
 I just showed them I can 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.300
 guarantee that they will have a secure purchase 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.070
 above all, always look for sellers 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.900
 that have the original invoice of the 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.720
 apparatus so that you do not take 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.390
 a surprise with the device at the moment 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.460
 to connect it to iTunes 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.200
 this video is for you for 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.620
 all those people who do not know yet 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.020
 how to see if the device they are going to buy 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.880
 has this blockade I hope that they 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.530
 can serve this video if they have any 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.569
 ask with pleasure in the section 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.550
 of comments I will answer 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.289
 as I said at the beginning this 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.389
 video is dedicated to all to all 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.759
 those people who still do not know how 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.399
 check if your device will have that 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.379
 blockade there are many other people who already 

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:23.029
 they know it but this video is aimed at 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.219
 those that do not 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:27.979
 I am comment for one hundred I wish you a 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:31.360

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.360
