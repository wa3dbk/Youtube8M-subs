00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi girls lamiere pd today will be sui 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.540
 lipsticks and the highlights of the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.429
 levy chic pupa collection you asked 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.929
 to make a fair review of the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.070
 collection for them I make these two the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.570
 next video I'll make you two more 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.610
 because I haven't finished arousing good cars 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.949
 so meanwhile I talk about these in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.060
 primis the lipsticks of lipstick children are 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.970
 three 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.119
 these are the three colors and they are all 3 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.800
 super opaque lipsticks the price of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.710
 these lipsticks of them there is euro and 90 li 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.380
 I try on his lips and then we talk about it 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.940
 repeat as you see on propagated almost one 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.590
 bit floury 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.760
 I must say the truth is not homogeneous to the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.719
 one hundred percent is always a little more 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.930
 transparent know a little more from the side 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.140
 intense on the other this however is the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.210
 color 001 I'll show you too 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.700
 after an hour how to say nothing because 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.010
 I made a video this day another 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.340
 girl what happens if you really do 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.809
 the lips between them but leave around 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.059
 you don't have the mirror in the meantime 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.870
 talk do something press your lips 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.870
 you find yourself like this 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.510
 this instead the number 0 to 0 2 a lot of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.390
 let us apply it much more evenly 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.030
 however, compared to the number 001 too 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.610
 it's beautiful at the beginning I like it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.000
 very much, however, after a while after type 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.640
 twenty minutes half an hour the start becomes 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.470
 so dry that if I near the thousand 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.090
 track of them practically comes off the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.740
 color now all of everything 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.060
 how much stains 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880
 if you have the effect with the redest one 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.040
 after eating a yogurt this 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.110
 finally the third black color of the iii a 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.909
 the one more red understood than dark gods 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.619
 three 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.750
 this is also easier as a second one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.060
 apply more homogeneous perhaps than the three is 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.250
 the most homogeneous of all even 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.040
 here, however, the same problem is very dry 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.140
 as a product and it's good to see gods 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.210
 Opaque lipsticks are beautiful according to 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.270
 me but these are really too much 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.100
 opaque too dry after already twenty 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.840
 half an hour minutes on the lips 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.540
 and they really begin to become 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.300
 small shoals 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.610
 but in green site if you had to say in 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.920
 order of approval certainly 3 0 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.860
 3 this is the best as anyway 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.510
 effect then followed by 0 2 and last 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.250
 the 0 1 just because anyway fighter is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.110
 the less homogeneous and drier one 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.910
 antisense relatives all three are a lot 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.370
 dried girls news 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.040
 so for this product it is roll of 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.450
 4 half drums by four and a half 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.210
 because I didn't like a girl 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.300
 that is, after a bad look a little too 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.850
 because in any case being so 6 later 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.910
 very little start 6 eat or if 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.830
 talk if you close their lips 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.470
 then pieces start to come off 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.200
 just a bad effect anyway 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.720
 let 's talk about the eyeliner in yesterday 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.260
 instead there are two we find a blue one 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.420
 electric and one a light lilac the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.430
 price of these of 14 euros I make you 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.860
 see on the hand have the applicator 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.410
 that a little difficult because you see that 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.390
 with long long long thin thin 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.459
 thin little tiny little one 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.930
 so it takes precision of course 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.940
 much easier to put this than not 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:11.360
 a black eyeliner then those on that 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:14.230
 we are lucky this is my bed e 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.230
 this is electric blue 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.660
 this is blue color let's say it is 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.130
 80% homogeneous if not 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.170
 took without product becomes a bit 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.170
 koso is noted a little in the final part 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.890
 this girl instead is lilac-colored 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.599
 as you can see, they seem very constant here 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.519
 different there is one much darker than the other 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.080
 very clear on the eyes there is not this 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.910
 big difference is surely this is 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.400
 much more original as for color and for 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.310
 what concerns me is more homogeneous 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.870
 than this electric blue 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.850
 32 my absolute favorite because 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.040
 I find that if more original and I like it 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.400
 very much is a beautiful lilac color 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.080
 which however does not result in that color 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.880
 pastel that maybe there is stove because ne 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.720
 we saw too much around is a nice one 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.060
 color with its own character and last a 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.850
 long because even if you put us 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.130
 water then wet 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.410
 they stay there obviously they come away 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.830
 but the makeup remover is not so perfect 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.960
 because in any case waterproof and long 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.289
 holding girls my vote then for 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.850
 this product is drum roll 9 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.710
 lido 9 because I like them a lot 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.740
 the electric blue one a little less because 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.419
 a little less homogeneous but the lilac one is 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.140
 fantastic great product 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.140
 hello beauties
