I just bend it oops I I tore it a tiny
bit<00:01:18.520> but<00:01:19.520> hopefully<00:01:20.000> it's<00:01:20.540> not<00:01:20.689> too

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
bit but hopefully it's not too

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.840 
bit but hopefully it's not too
noticeable<00:01:22.689> okay<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:25.340> I'm<00:01:25.430> going<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.579> go<00:01:25.759> ahead

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
and do that to all the petals and

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.920 
and do that to all the petals and
there's<00:01:30.409> eight<00:01:30.649> of<00:01:30.799> them<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:32.000> makes<00:01:32.689> a<00:01:32.810> nice

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
there's eight of them so it makes a nice

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.830 
there's eight of them so it makes a nice
full<00:01:33.259> rose<00:01:33.590> but<00:01:33.979> it's<00:01:34.130> not<00:01:34.329> it's<00:01:35.329> not<00:01:35.479> too<00:01:35.689> much

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's not too hard and I'm making this

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.100 
it's not too hard and I'm making this
rose<00:01:42.409> with<00:01:42.649> a<00:01:42.680> nice<00:01:42.860> hot<00:01:43.070> pink<00:01:43.310> color<00:01:44.110> but

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
crazy and ink the edges because I know

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.090 
could totally use glue for this and then
you<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:33.050> want<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.260> hold<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.590> while<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.860> dries

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
you just want to hold it while it dries

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.850 
you just want to hold it while it dries
for<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.490> couple<00:02:34.760> seconds<00:02:35.380> but<00:02:36.380> just<00:02:36.620> for<00:02:36.770> this

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
for a couple seconds but just for this

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.220 
for a couple seconds but just for this
video<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.220> didn't<00:02:37.670> want<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:37.989> make<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.110> guys

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
video I didn't want to make you guys

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.620 
video I didn't want to make you guys
wait<00:02:39.500> while<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.739> hold<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.310> pieces<00:02:41.300> together

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
wait while I hold the pieces together

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.610 
wait while I hold the pieces together
while<00:02:41.989> they<00:02:42.110> they<00:02:42.800> dry<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:45.050> I'm<00:02:45.200> using<00:02:45.350> this

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
while they they dry so I'm using this

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.830 
while they they dry so I'm using this
but<00:02:45.950> by<00:02:46.550> no<00:02:46.610> means<00:02:46.940> do<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.180> have<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.510> have<00:02:47.660> one

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
but by no means do you have to have one

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.430 
but by no means do you have to have one
of<00:02:47.930> these<00:02:48.020> guns<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.250> make<00:02:49.400> these<00:02:49.580> roses<00:02:50.440> just

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
of these guns to make these roses just

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.910 
of these guns to make these roses just
any<00:02:51.709> kind<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:52.069> glue<00:02:52.340> or<00:02:52.730> whatever<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.239> fine<00:02:55.120> and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
any kind of glue or whatever is fine and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.170 
any kind of glue or whatever is fine and
even<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.040> folding<00:02:58.550> over<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.910> I'm<00:02:59.000> doing

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
even this folding over that I'm doing

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.710 
even this folding over that I'm doing
doesn't<00:02:59.480> have<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.810> be<00:02:59.900> perfect<00:03:00.320> because<00:03:00.500> if

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
doesn't have to be perfect because if

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.850 
doesn't have to be perfect because if
each<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.959> petals<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.470> little<00:03:03.739> bit

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
each of the petals is a little bit

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.009 
each of the petals is a little bit
different<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.690> actually<00:03:05.690> makes<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:05.989> look

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
different that actually makes it look

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.300 
different that actually makes it look
more<00:03:06.530> realistic<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.190> think<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.830> this<00:03:09.980> is<00:03:10.130> the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
more realistic I think so this is the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.780 
more realistic I think so this is the
final<00:03:10.519> petal<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:12.010> now<00:03:13.010> I'm<00:03:13.190> just<00:03:13.220> gonna<00:03:13.459> start

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
final petal and now I'm just gonna start

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.640 
final petal and now I'm just gonna start
gluing<00:03:14.180> them<00:03:14.300> together<00:03:14.480> in<00:03:14.930> order<00:03:15.170> from

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
gluing them together in order from

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.570 
gluing them together in order from
biggest<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.940> smallest<00:03:17.380> approximately<00:03:18.489> so<00:03:19.489> I'm

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
biggest to smallest approximately so I'm

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.620 
biggest to smallest approximately so I'm
gonna<00:03:19.700> put<00:03:19.910> them<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.090> order

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
gonna put them in order

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.180 
gonna put them in order
biggest<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.680> smallest<00:03:22.150> take<00:03:23.150> out<00:03:23.330> my<00:03:23.540> glue<00:03:24.370> and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
biggest to smallest take out my glue and

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.800 
biggest to smallest take out my glue and
I'm<00:03:28.190> almost<00:03:28.519> out<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:28.910> glue<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.239> let's<00:03:29.600> hope

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
I'm almost out of glue so let's hope

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.630 
I'm almost out of glue so let's hope
that<00:03:30.049> I<00:03:30.230> have<00:03:30.440> enough<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.890> finish<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.370> Rose

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
that I have enough to finish this Rose

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.170 
that I have enough to finish this Rose
here<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:33.350> I'm<00:03:33.440> holding<00:03:33.799> that<00:03:33.829> together<00:03:34.180> and

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
here so I'm holding that together and

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.750 
here so I'm holding that together and
I'm<00:03:35.870> just<00:03:35.900> putting<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.440> glue<00:03:36.650> right<00:03:36.950> on<00:03:37.160> sort

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
I'm just putting the glue right on sort

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.250 
I'm just putting the glue right on sort
of<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:37.940> flat<00:03:38.209> part<00:03:39.160> here<00:03:40.510> I'm<00:03:41.510> almost<00:03:41.959> out<00:03:42.200> of

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
of the flat part here I'm almost out of

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.840 
of the flat part here I'm almost out of
glue<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:45.320> then<00:03:45.920> I'm<00:03:46.010> just<00:03:46.040> I'm<00:03:46.430> squeezing

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
glue and then I'm just I'm squeezing

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.150 
glue and then I'm just I'm squeezing
that<00:03:47.030> nice<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.420> tight<00:03:47.480> while<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:47.959> dries<00:03:48.230> and

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
that nice and tight while it dries and

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.670 
that nice and tight while it dries and
I'm<00:03:49.820> using<00:03:50.000> my<00:03:50.120> favorite<00:03:50.420> sketch<00:03:50.989> quick<00:03:51.440> dry

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
I'm using my favorite sketch quick dry

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.580 
I'm using my favorite sketch quick dry
adhesive<00:03:52.299> but<00:03:53.299> whatever<00:03:53.810> kind<00:03:54.140> of<00:03:54.230> glue<00:03:54.410> you

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
adhesive but whatever kind of glue you

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.240 
adhesive but whatever kind of glue you
have<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:55.100> you<00:03:55.250> like<00:03:55.519> is<00:03:56.829> gonna<00:03:57.829> work<00:03:57.980> just

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
have that you like is gonna work just

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.060 
have that you like is gonna work just
fine<00:03:58.489> I<00:03:59.290> think<00:04:00.290> this<00:04:00.410> is<00:04:00.560> probably<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.920> most

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
fine I think this is probably the most

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.490 
fine I think this is probably the most

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
more because I'm pretty much used it all

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.990 
more because I'm pretty much used it all
up<00:04:20.530> okay

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.510 

and<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.720> couple<00:04:27.110> more<00:04:27.320> petals<00:04:27.680> here<00:04:27.980> so<00:04:28.460> I'm

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
and a couple more petals here so I'm

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.190 
and a couple more petals here so I'm
starting<00:04:28.790> to<00:04:28.850> come<00:04:29.000> apart<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.480> like<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.050> put<00:04:30.170> a

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
starting to come apart I like to put a

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.280 
starting to come apart I like to put a
nice<00:04:30.410> big<00:04:31.160> glob<00:04:31.640> of<00:04:31.700> glue<00:04:32.000> in<00:04:32.180> there<00:04:32.360> so<00:04:33.110> that

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
nice big glob of glue in there so that

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.540 
nice big glob of glue in there so that
it<00:04:33.410> definitely<00:04:34.720> touches<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.870> bottom<00:04:37.270> and

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
it definitely touches the bottom and

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.150 
it definitely touches the bottom and
we've<00:04:40.550> got<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.760> lot<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:40.970> contact<00:04:41.480> between<00:04:41.720> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
we've got a lot of contact between the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.970 
we've got a lot of contact between the
paper<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.580> glue<00:04:44.530> okay<00:04:45.530> so<00:04:45.590> here's<00:04:45.920> the

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
paper and the glue okay so here's the

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.600 
paper and the glue okay so here's the
final<00:04:46.250> petal

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
final petal

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.710 
final petal
come<00:04:49.610> on<00:04:49.700> glue<00:04:50.470> okay<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:53.150> that's<00:04:53.330> gonna<00:04:53.510> go

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
come on glue okay so that's gonna go

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.500 
come on glue okay so that's gonna go
there<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.290> I<00:04:55.100> I<00:04:55.310> tore<00:04:55.700> this<00:04:55.880> edge<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.120> little

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
there and I I tore this edge a little

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.180 
there and I I tore this edge a little
bit<00:04:56.630> which<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:56.930> didn't<00:04:57.170> do<00:04:57.290> before<00:04:57.470> on<00:04:57.830> my<00:04:57.860> first

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
bit which I didn't do before on my first

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.910 
bit which I didn't do before on my first
one<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:59.150> just<00:04:59.360> be<00:05:00.140> a<00:05:00.170> little<00:05:00.260> careful<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.980> guess

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
one so just be a little careful I guess

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.190 
one so just be a little careful I guess
okay<00:05:03.920> so<00:05:03.980> while<00:05:04.430> that's<00:05:04.670> drying<00:05:04.960> I'm<00:05:05.960> going<00:05:06.020> to

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
okay so while that's drying I'm going to

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.930 
okay so while that's drying I'm going to
still<00:05:06.350> squeeze<00:05:06.620> it<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:06.950> it<00:05:07.070> stays<00:05:07.490> together

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
still squeeze it so it stays together

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.440 
still squeeze it so it stays together
while<00:05:08.120> it<00:05:08.240> dries<00:05:09.250> but<00:05:10.250> now<00:05:10.400> for<00:05:10.790> this<00:05:10.880> spiral

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
while it dries but now for this spiral

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.200 
while it dries but now for this spiral
piece<00:05:12.010> I'm<00:05:13.010> just<00:05:13.220> gonna<00:05:13.340> start<00:05:13.700> in<00:05:13.850> the<00:05:13.910> middle

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
piece I'm just gonna start in the middle

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.080 
piece I'm just gonna start in the middle
and<00:05:14.470> it<00:05:15.470> does<00:05:15.920> not<00:05:16.070> have<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.400> be<00:05:16.490> perfect<00:05:16.940> but

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
and it does not have to be perfect but

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.590 
and it does not have to be perfect but
I'm<00:05:17.210> doing<00:05:17.480> my<00:05:17.510> best<00:05:17.660> to<00:05:18.290> just<00:05:19.330> curl<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.510> around

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
I'm doing my best to just curl it around

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.240 
I'm doing my best to just curl it around
itself<00:05:22.690> from<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.840> middle<00:05:24.110> all<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.620> way<00:05:25.070> to

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
itself from the middle all the way to

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.050 
itself from the middle all the way to
the<00:05:25.730> edge<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:28.040> edge<00:05:28.070> has<00:05:28.700> these<00:05:28.850> nice

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
the edge and the edge has these nice

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.840 
the edge and the edge has these nice
scalloped<00:05:29.720> pieces<00:05:30.590> on<00:05:30.770> on<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.220> outside<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.730> it

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
scalloped pieces on on the outside of it

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.320 
scalloped pieces on on the outside of it
so<00:05:32.630> that<00:05:32.960> it<00:05:33.140> blends<00:05:33.410> in<00:05:33.680> with<00:05:33.860> these<00:05:34.330> petals

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
so that it blends in with these petals

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.870 
so that it blends in with these petals
that<00:05:35.600> I've<00:05:35.720> already<00:05:35.930> glued<00:05:36.110> together<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.880> you

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
that I've already glued together and you

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.510 
that I've already glued together and you
know<00:05:38.030> I'm<00:05:38.840> kind<00:05:39.140> of<00:05:39.290> not<00:05:39.950> making<00:05:40.130> a<00:05:40.310> perfect

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
know I'm kind of not making a perfect

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.659 
know I'm kind of not making a perfect
circle<00:05:41.030> but<00:05:41.060> it's<00:05:41.600> fine

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
circle but it's fine

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.600 
circle but it's fine
and<00:05:43.669> I<00:05:44.660> have<00:05:44.840> if<00:05:45.200> you<00:05:45.620> if<00:05:45.890> you've<00:05:46.100> noticed<00:05:46.490> I've

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
and I have if you if you've noticed I've

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.310 
and I have if you if you've noticed I've
had<00:05:46.790> no<00:05:47.000> glue<00:05:47.300> on<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.630> inside<00:05:47.990> of<00:05:48.020> this<00:05:48.260> thing

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
had no glue on the inside of this thing

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.100 
had no glue on the inside of this thing
I'm<00:05:48.860> just<00:05:49.930> I'm<00:05:50.930> just<00:05:50.990> curling<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.590> around<00:05:53.110> and

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
I'm just I'm just curling it around and

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.270 
I'm just I'm just curling it around and
it<00:05:54.200> would<00:05:54.290> probably<00:05:54.380> be<00:05:54.620> easier<00:05:54.919> if<00:05:55.040> I<00:05:55.100> wasn't

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
it would probably be easier if I wasn't

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.409 
it would probably be easier if I wasn't
holding<00:05:55.550> this<00:05:55.820> together<00:05:56.120> but<00:05:57.730> it's<00:05:58.730> it's

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
holding this together but it's it's

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.360 
holding this together but it's it's
actually<00:05:59.750> not<00:05:59.870> hard<00:06:00.910> okay<00:06:02.830> so<00:06:03.830> I've<00:06:03.950> got<00:06:03.980> this

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
actually not hard okay so I've got this

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.659 
actually not hard okay so I've got this
whole<00:06:04.580> thing<00:06:04.640> rolled<00:06:05.210> up<00:06:05.480> you<00:06:06.430> know<00:06:07.430> I'm<00:06:07.550> going

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
whole thing rolled up you know I'm going

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.159 
whole thing rolled up you know I'm going
to<00:06:07.730> take<00:06:07.970> my<00:06:08.180> glue<00:06:10.570> let<00:06:11.570> me<00:06:11.660> get<00:06:11.810> nice<00:06:11.960> and

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
to take my glue let me get nice and

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.730 
to take my glue let me get nice and
tight<00:06:12.350> I'm<00:06:13.160> gonna<00:06:13.310> take<00:06:13.550> my<00:06:13.760> glue<00:06:14.560> I'm<00:06:15.560> gonna

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
tight I'm gonna take my glue I'm gonna

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.090 
tight I'm gonna take my glue I'm gonna
put<00:06:15.950> a<00:06:15.980> big<00:06:16.250> glob<00:06:16.700> around<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.540> whole<00:06:18.100> bottom

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
put a big glob around the whole bottom

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.510 
put a big glob around the whole bottom
nice<00:06:19.970> and<00:06:20.000> messy<00:06:20.450> is<00:06:20.570> fine<00:06:20.870> and<00:06:21.710> then<00:06:22.070> just<00:06:22.310> put

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
nice and messy is fine and then just put

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.150 
nice and messy is fine and then just put
this<00:06:22.640> in<00:06:22.820> the<00:06:22.880> middle<00:06:23.060> and<00:06:23.530> let<00:06:24.530> go<00:06:24.710> and<00:06:24.890> let<00:06:25.010> it

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
this in the middle and let go and let it

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.420 
this in the middle and let go and let it
kind<00:06:25.400> of<00:06:25.490> unravel<00:06:26.080> and<00:06:27.080> it<00:06:27.770> spreads<00:06:28.070> the<00:06:28.220> glue

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
kind of unravel and it spreads the glue

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.270 
kind of unravel and it spreads the glue
around<00:06:28.550> a<00:06:28.820> little<00:06:28.940> bit<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:29.530> then<00:06:30.530> just<00:06:30.770> hold

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
around a little bit and then just hold

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.190 
around a little bit and then just hold
it<00:06:31.460> in<00:06:31.580> place<00:06:31.760> a<00:06:31.880> little<00:06:32.180> while<00:06:32.450> it<00:06:32.570> dries<00:06:32.840> and

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
it in place a little while it dries and

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.440 
it in place a little while it dries and
the<00:06:33.979> center<00:06:34.280> part<00:06:34.490> is<00:06:34.610> not<00:06:34.789> really<00:06:35.120> touching

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
the center part is not really touching

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.390 
the center part is not really touching
the<00:06:35.539> bottom

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
the bottom

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.879 
the bottom
fine<00:06:36.940> just<00:06:37.930> make<00:06:38.080> sure<00:06:38.199> the<00:06:38.350> outside<00:06:38.380> is

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
fine just make sure the outside is

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.370 
fine just make sure the outside is
touching<00:06:39.250> the<00:06:39.370> bottom<00:06:39.699> and<00:06:40.030> let<00:06:40.990> it<00:06:41.080> sit<00:06:41.229> there

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
touching the bottom and let it sit there

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.290 
touching the bottom and let it sit there
and<00:06:41.530> dry<00:06:41.710> and<00:06:41.860> you'll<00:06:41.979> have<00:06:42.130> a<00:06:42.160> nice<00:06:42.370> rose<00:06:42.910> just

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
and dry and you'll have a nice rose just

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.660 
and dry and you'll have a nice rose just
like<00:06:43.419> this<00:06:43.540> one
