00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
has a little white line on a ring that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.370 
has a little white line on a ring that
runs<00:03:07.960> up<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.260> down<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:09.340> wire<00:03:10.300> front<00:03:10.990> cable

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
runs up and down the wire front cable

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.860 
runs up and down the wire front cable
what<00:03:14.380> you<00:03:14.500> do<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.910> take<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.360> white<00:03:16.600> line

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
what you do is you take that white line

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.890 
what you do is you take that white line
and<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:18.580> tuck<00:03:18.820> it<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.300> little<00:03:19.570> piece<00:03:19.720> of

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
and you tuck it in this little piece of

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.000 
and you tuck it in this little piece of
rubber<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.350> we<00:03:20.500> have<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:23.709> keeps

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
rubber that we have and that keeps

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.960 
rubber that we have and that keeps
tension<00:03:24.550> on<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.970> tip<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.610> can<00:03:30.760> keep

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
tension on the tip so that you can keep

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:39.420 
tension on the tip so that you can keep
the<00:03:31.120> tip<00:03:31.330> on<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.920> then<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.250> have<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:39.010> back<00:03:39.190> yo

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
the tip on so then you have the back yo

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.720 
the tip on so then you have the back yo
pull<00:03:39.670> spear

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730

like<00:04:47.450> this<00:04:47.830> there's<00:04:48.830> no<00:04:49.040> tension<00:04:49.280> on<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.550> line

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
like this there's no tension on the line

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.460 
like this there's no tension on the line
so<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.300> doesn't<00:04:50.630> slow<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.810> pole<00:04:51.080> spear<00:04:51.200> down

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
so it doesn't slow the pole spear down

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.290 
so it doesn't slow the pole spear down
at<00:04:51.680> all

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.120 

now<00:04:58.300> we'll<00:04:58.540> brig<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.140> full<00:04:59.350> breakaway<00:04:59.770> setup

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
now we'll brig the full breakaway setup

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.750 
now we'll brig the full breakaway setup
underwater

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760

the<00:05:22.270> pole<00:05:22.450> spear<00:05:22.600> well<00:05:22.990> you'll<00:05:23.170> see<00:05:23.410> this

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
the pole spear well you'll see this

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.340 
the pole spear well you'll see this
notch<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:24.190> put<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.270> line<00:05:25.450> in<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.840> notch<00:05:26.020> that

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
notch you put the line in the notch that

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.840 
notch you put the line in the notch that
gives<00:05:26.650> you<00:05:26.770> a<00:05:26.800> little<00:05:27.040> bit<00:05:27.160> of<00:05:27.250> tension<00:05:27.460> and

you now can fight the fish from the

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.390 
you now can fight the fish from the
surface<00:05:59.880> on<00:06:00.090> your<00:06:00.630> buoy<00:06:00.780> line<00:06:04.130> here's<00:06:05.130> another

of different fish that were in the reef
and<00:06:24.810> this<00:06:25.020> big<00:06:25.230> hog<00:06:25.440> fish<00:06:25.680> comes<00:06:25.920> out<00:06:26.130> and<00:06:26.220> he's

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
and this big hog fish comes out and he's

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.610 
and this big hog fish comes out and he's
able<00:06:26.460> to<00:06:26.640> shoot<00:06:26.820> it<00:06:27.000> with<00:06:27.150> the<00:06:27.840> single<00:06:28.050> flopper

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
on the pole spear itself you can see he

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.330 
on the pole spear itself you can see he
immediately<00:06:30.960> works<00:06:31.470> his<00:06:31.620> way<00:06:31.800> all<00:06:32.040> the<00:06:32.220> way<00:06:32.250> up

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.550 
immediately works his way all the way up
to<00:06:32.640> the<00:06:32.730> fish<00:06:32.970> and<00:06:33.450> puts<00:06:33.720> pressure<00:06:33.930> on<00:06:34.350> the

to the fish and puts pressure on the

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.620 
to the fish and puts pressure on the
fish<00:06:34.830> so<00:06:35.490> that<00:06:35.700> it's<00:06:35.790> pushing<00:06:36.030> against<00:06:36.570> the

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
fish so that it's pushing against the

fish so that it's pushing against the
slip<00:06:36.930> bar<00:06:37.170> against<00:06:37.950> the<00:06:38.040> flopper<00:06:38.400> tip<00:06:38.610> from

behind that way the fish doesn't have
anywhere<00:06:41.280> to<00:06:41.340> go<00:06:41.460> and<00:06:41.910> is<00:06:42.390> immobilized<00:06:44.420> now

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
you do you put the flopper down and get

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.670 
you do you put the flopper down and get
it<00:07:20.670> just<00:07:20.970> inside<00:07:21.480> the<00:07:21.510> skin<00:07:21.990> of<00:07:22.110> the<00:07:22.230> fish<00:07:22.440> like

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
it just inside the skin of the fish like

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.640 
it just inside the skin of the fish like
that<00:07:22.710> and<00:07:23.220> then<00:07:23.910> you<00:07:24.090> twist<00:07:24.390> the<00:07:25.080> hole<00:07:25.320> pull

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
that and then you twist the hole pull

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.560 
that and then you twist the hole pull
spear<00:07:26.010> and<00:07:26.190> it<00:07:26.820> comes<00:07:27.060> right<00:07:27.150> out

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.570 
spear and it comes right out

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.950 
spear and it comes right out
if<00:07:28.380> you<00:07:28.560> don't<00:07:28.830> twist<00:07:29.130> the<00:07:29.310> pole<00:07:29.490> spear<00:07:29.960> you

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
if you don't twist the pole spear you

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.660 
if you don't twist the pole spear you
put<00:07:31.170> the<00:07:31.260> flopper<00:07:31.530> in<00:07:31.770> there<00:07:31.950> the<00:07:32.130> flopper<00:07:32.580> is

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:32.670 
put the flopper in there the flopper is

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.310 
put the flopper in there the flopper is
going<00:07:32.820> to<00:07:32.880> try<00:07:33.060> to<00:07:33.120> open<00:07:33.360> up<00:07:33.600> inside<00:07:34.020> of<00:07:34.170> there

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.320 
going to try to open up inside of there

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.340 
going to try to open up inside of there
so<00:07:34.580> by<00:07:35.580> twisting<00:07:36.150> it<00:07:36.330> it<00:07:36.480> keeps<00:07:36.780> just<00:07:37.110> enough

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.350 
so by twisting it it keeps just enough

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.930 
so by twisting it it keeps just enough
tension<00:07:37.590> on<00:07:37.830> it<00:07:38.010> so<00:07:38.520> you<00:07:38.580> can<00:07:38.640> kind<00:07:38.880> of

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:38.940 
tension on it so you can kind of

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.020 
tension on it so you can kind of
corkscrew<00:07:39.480> it<00:07:39.600> back<00:07:39.780> out
