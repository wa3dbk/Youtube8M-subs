00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello guys to the girls we are in a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.520
 tutorial of asgard show and it is a tutorial 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.590
 as shields and swords good 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.289
 we basically have eight types of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.230
 different shields the looser is the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.800
 shield in the normal way and the strongest 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.190
 is the golden diamond shield and good 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.920
 let's see then the characteristics of 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.980
 each shield we will see then the shield 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.840
 wooden hood onion on the screen 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.329
 then you can see an image first 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.150
 explains in the most important things that 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.700
 is the durability that is the quantity 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.100
 Total damage and shield can absorb 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.500
 before breaking 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.960
 then the damage that is the total amount 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.610
 of damage that the shield can inflict on the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.970
 hit a target 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.150
 I think the other thing more efficient for 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.180
 we would be the weakness that indicates 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.460
 which situations are the ones that do not use 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.980
 certain shields 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.310
 so how good is the shield of 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:17.830
 then it has a durability of 118 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.590
 the damage is 1 to 2 hearts and then the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.750
 weakness of this shield is fire 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.550
 basically it is a wooden shield 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.800
 it is normal and burns quickly 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.040
 with fire yes be very careful 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.070
 the next one is the wooden shield 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.280
 golden let's see what is called in 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.200
 english ginger wood on it let's see the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:44.100
 features has a durability of 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.950
 246 the damage is from a heart 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 the weakness is also the game is 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.350
 will burn quickly through the wood 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.619
 since good it seems that it has a bit of 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.500
 gold as after the crafting are something of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.200
 gold you spend a little gold but that's just 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.840
 increases the durability are the corners 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.390
 Come on, it's a golden shield 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.300
 since they are the corners that are 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 Golden is not like a decoration but 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.090
 that also serves for this good now 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.209
 we have the stone shield and we are going to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.160
 see it's called this is an armchair and you're 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.300
 are its characteristics let's see 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:28.230
 has a durability of 131 the damage is 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.900
 of a heart nothing more and we go in the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.630
 weakness because they are the explosions already 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.470
 that the stone is easily broken 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.560
 from the very big explosions that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.750
 can be either tnt or creepers if 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.780
 We improve stone shield as 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.600
 we will get a golden stone shield 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.610
 as you see is the same thing that happened with the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.780
 wood 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.760
 and around you put 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.190
 now so let's see your 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.200
 characteristics that are the following 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:07.150
 has a durability of 259 the damage is 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.370
 from 1 to 12 hearts and the weakness then 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.800
 they are also explosions since the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.550
 Stone breaks easily from the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.280
 clippers and tdt explosions if we go 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.060
 improving so we can get a shield 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.010
 of iron that would be iron and we're going to 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.320
 see then the characteristics of this 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.430
 shield that looks a little better the 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.180
 durability is 250 we have a 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.450
 damage from 1 to 2 hearts and weakness 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.050
 Well, water iron starts 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.989
 rust in the water, increasing the 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.630
 durability then of harm not so yes 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.260
 So be very careful with the water 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.800
 avoid it good by improving the shield 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.500
 of iron as we can get the ginn 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.830
 jr iron shield that would be a shield of 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.590
 iron 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.060
 and in the characteristics, they are the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:08.570
 following has a durability of 378 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.020
 the damage is from a heart and weakness 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.450
 Well, the water itself and we have 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.640
 come then to a bigger improvement than 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.190
 it's the diamond shield 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.120
 damon jude the characteristics are the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.960
 following has a durability of 780 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.670
 it has the damage of one to two hearts and 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.850
 the weakness then the damage reflected 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:38.480
 damages the good durability coming to the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:42.140
 last improvement let's see is the shield 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.720
 of golden diamond that is the way is the 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.960
 biggest improvement and it's the most shield 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.250
 powerful let's say have let's see these 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:56.300
 908 durability features has 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.870
 the damage of a heart and the hard we go the 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.720
 weakness because it is the same as before 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.600
 the damage reflected as it damages the 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.480
 durability 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.790
 As you can see, the shield is put here and 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.270
 we click right as you see the bar 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:16.730
 it goes down slowly running out 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.240
 and if we release it then it is reloaded 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.400
 not so these are the uses then of 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.880
 the shields and now we're going to the party 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.640
 of the swords we have come to the part 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.280
 of the swords let's see we have a 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.000
 wooden sword a stone sword 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.580
 an iron sword a gold sword and 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.880
 a diamond sword that we're going to 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.630
 start then looking at each of them and 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.510
 we started since you can already jon sword that 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.790
 It is a giant wooden sword 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.960
 let's see then the characteristics of 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.280
 this sword 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:59.930
 let's see it has a durability of 88 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:03.350
 that is, you can inflict so much damage 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:07.070
 until the sword is exhausted thus 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:11.430
 that you have about 88 touches the damage that 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:14.310
 It inflicts because it is 2 hearts and yes 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.920
 now the stone sword let's see 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.930
 would be stones james word the 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:24.420
 characteristics are these durability 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:28.560
 is 196 and the damage is 2 to 12 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:31.680
 hearts the next is the sword of 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.950
 iron that would be iron giants word 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:38.100
 The characteristics are the following 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:41.520
 they have the durability of 375 and the damage 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:45.000
 that inflicts is 3 before finishing 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.660
 we have the golden sword and let's see 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.400
 golden giants board features 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.330
 are the following have the durability 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:57.510
 of 48 and the damage is 2 hearts the 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.510
 truth is that it's not a big thing and for 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.080
 last a diamond sword we are going to 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.290
 watch 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.420
 Raymond James Ward characteristics 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:12.660
 are the following has a durability 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:15.150
 of two thousand 341 and the damage is 3 or 12 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.560
 hearts so this is the best 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.990
 option but 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.889
 you would be pretty diamond as you see 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:26.010
 well three four five six diamonds 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:29.580
 but hey it's a giant sword so 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:33.300
 it's worth it and well they were 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.790
 the five swords and the eight shields that 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.430
 we have seen and well I hope that I have 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.710
