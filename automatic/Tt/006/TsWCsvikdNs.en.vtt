00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.550
 but 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.350
 or the one that has all youtube guys 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.360
 my name is the fatty ix and good guys 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
 because today we have a new video of how 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.800
 install what is fox for the version 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.480
 1.6 point 4 of minecraft in this case 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.070
 well we should have to install and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.960
 installed what is the make up something I'm going 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.310
 to truth and good we are going to enter this 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.110
 page that I leave in the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.600
 description of the video in this case let's 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.990
 to select the version we want in 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.430
 this case is going to be 1.6 point 4 and 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.900
 we can see what the promotions are 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.300
 in this case we are going to go something else 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.609
 sure they are folding in this case 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.949
 we can see that there are several 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.510
 versions not every one is the most recent 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.190
 what we are going through happening 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.230
 happening in this case we're going to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.910
 install the most recent and what we're going 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.739
 to do is give it here where it says 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.920
 install because for me it is the most 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.239
 easy that is the installable we are not going to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.699
 click on it there and it will take us to this 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.809
 adsl page and we're just going to 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.180
 wait 21 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.310
 When 0 seconds pass because we will 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.710
 give it in jump advertising and it will give us 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.570
 this file that is java we are going to 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.070
 install it equally well then we have to 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.560
 have installed what is java that is 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.119
 something very obvious to run minecraft and 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.619
 well let's hope it ends and 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.020
 let's see the folder to see the 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.179
 file in this case then we have this 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.990
 file that is the fork as you can see 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.310
 is here 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.380
 excuse all this that I have 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.659
 tremendously messy but good 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.030
 can come crystal force in this case 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.549
 let's give it two clicks 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.950
 and extract a bit as you can see us 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.930
 this is what is here that is for 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.090
 install it that is the client because today 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.280
 let's see here in install client and 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.259
 here we are going to select the folder 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.330
 where is your minecraft by general 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.580
 you just give it to you and it's always 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.520
 well not always but by default 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.409
 find in users data roaming point 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.060
 minecraft you do not have to move anything and 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.320
 we're just going to give it here in 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.360
 to accept 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.940
 We have acquired by downloading libraries and 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.740
 this installation is already installed 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.320
 the client of minecraft is made and 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.560
 here is the version as you can see if 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.930
 let's execute and we put percent 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.239
 app data percent and we're pointing 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.489
 minecraft, now they are going to appear 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.620
 more folders and more files in this case 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.660
 I would already be installed and all this and 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.430
 we will look like a mods folder in the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.530
 Mods folder is simply going to install 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.920
 as the mossos do not tell us that you 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.200
 want in this case because I'm going to open what 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.090
 what is minecraft and I will proceed to 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.650
 open what is the launcher let's see 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.629
 our common launcher mind 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.040
 and when I carry what is my struggle 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.530
 case then 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.329
 I think this is what we are going to do 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.790
 and what is going to happen is that it's going to 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.640
 leave what is fort here will ask us 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.680
 the usual and here the usual 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.840
 let's give it here and you can see that 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.920
 we are in the profile of force who is 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.650
 the case as we install the force of 1.6 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.260
 point 4 and simply because you have to give it 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.090
 play we hope you will not know what it is 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.190
 minecraft simply to show you 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.210
 how it changes what the interface is 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.070
 in the same game 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.830
 we can see that I already have some textures 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.960
 installed there and all this just me 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.660
 it's going to take a little longer to load because 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.310
 good is that I have several various mods 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.050
 I also recommend that you 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.580
 subscribe to the channel because it would be 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.080
 uploading packs of modes so that 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.820
 I just copied a folder that 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.400
 I'm going to leave it in the link of the flat video 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.400
 in the video that I'll do later so that 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.620
 simply click and download 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.390
 well the package here as you can see 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.650
 Well, you are already starting as you can see 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.600
 Here we are going to look like this is here 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.490
 and minecraft here is in the version that 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.380
 we have and the modes we also 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.760
 what is here that says mons 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.740
 and here will be all the modes that 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.540
 they have installed and so nothing 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.670
 guys would already have what is the force 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.440
 to be able to install their bikes that good 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.930
 I forgot to mention that for the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.090
 force yes yes force is like your 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.920
 good name his name do not say it but 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.310
 because it is the one that allows us to install 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.960
 mods 90% of mods need fox in 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.750
 which if we do not have photos then 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.540
 it just would not make us compatible 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.670
 for the day mods guys as always 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.350
 give you the pleasure of the video and subscribe 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.860
 to see more videos like this is the 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.860
