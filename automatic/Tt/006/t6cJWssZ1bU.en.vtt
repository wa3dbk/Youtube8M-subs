children<00:02:10.710> we<00:02:11.710> never<00:02:11.980> never<00:02:12.370> stop<00:02:13.180> learning

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
children we never never stop learning

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.630 
children we never never stop learning
now<00:02:14.440> how<00:02:14.470> can<00:02:14.680> parents<00:02:15.010> come<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.490> how<00:02:15.580> the

great stature today we're going to be
doing<00:03:06.370> an<00:03:06.610> experiment<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.750> with<00:03:08.019> force<00:03:08.440> and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
doing an experiment it with force and

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.860 
doing an experiment it with force and
what<00:03:09.160> you're<00:03:09.310> gonna<00:03:09.430> do<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:10.300> you're<00:03:10.600> gonna<00:03:10.660> go

okay heavier why do you think now

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.870 
okay heavier why do you think now
Anthony<00:04:02.800> come<00:04:03.190> over<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.810> now<00:04:04.960> we're<00:04:05.260> good

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
Anthony come over and now we're good

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.040 
Anthony come over and now we're good

what<00:04:27.110> happens<00:04:27.380> when<00:04:27.710> we<00:04:27.980> get<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.370> weight

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
what happens when we get the weight

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.270 
what happens when we get the weight
closer<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.440> this<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:30.860> is<00:04:31.010> called<00:04:31.190> the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
closer to this this is called the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.870 
closer to this this is called the
fulcrum<00:04:31.760> okay<00:04:32.780> Corbin's<00:04:33.440> when<00:04:34.400> we<00:04:34.520> get<00:04:34.700> this

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
fulcrum okay Corbin's when we get this

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.370 
fulcrum okay Corbin's when we get this
closer<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.540> closer<00:04:35.750> what<00:04:36.080> do<00:04:36.140> you<00:04:36.200> think

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
closer and closer what do you think

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.410 
closer and closer what do you think
happens<00:04:36.770> how<00:04:37.130> much<00:04:37.280> force<00:04:37.670> do<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:37.940> need<00:04:38.180> to

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
happens how much force do you need to

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.820 
happens how much force do you need to
apply<00:04:39.220> less<00:04:40.220> right<00:04:40.520> okay<00:04:41.360> so<00:04:42.020> let's<00:04:42.590> try<00:04:42.710> the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
apply less right okay so let's try the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:56.020 
apply less right okay so let's try the
last<00:04:43.100> one<00:04:43.310> that<00:04:43.730> we're<00:04:43.850> gonna<00:04:43.940> do<00:04:46.180> okay<00:04:55.030> you

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
last one that we're gonna do okay you

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.830 
last one that we're gonna do okay you
