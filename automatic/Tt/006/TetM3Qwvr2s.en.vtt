00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.930
 two 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.930
 i 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.420
 hello what will he do today today I'll tell you 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.330
 how to clean wash and disinfect dams 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.330
 to be able to eat them or prepare them 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.980
 First of all when buying strawberries 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.740
 we have to make sure that these 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.130
 be solid, be firm and not 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.950
 have no spoiled after 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.739
 We're going to get them to the water jet 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.890
 because we have to remove all 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.530
 the land we have to pay them very much 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.470
 well because these can come with 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.680
 many friends 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.540
 I praised her with soap from the same 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.450
 used to wash the dishes 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.090
 and here I make sure that all 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.810
 the bacteria that can bring all the 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.720
 life the whole earth 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.870
 I'm going as carving between themselves 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.510
 a bit and I'm pulling them water 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.750
 I do it for several times until the 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.150
 water come out completely clean that already 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.230
 dont have 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.610
 no soap I notice it at the moment in 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.610
 that there is not one 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.080
 I keep carving a little 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.650
 if they sometimes have something bold you can 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:48.590
 use a brush to brush it 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.590
 and so you can the easiest 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.330
 very important is that the speech of 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.340
 always with cold water since otherwise 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.220
 we can start to know our 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.770
 prey so much of time since it did not come out 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 No soap is when they are left 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.220
 lists 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.319
 which we are going to drain 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.650
 well if you need to peel your prey 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.379
 because you do not use them with the leaves 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.349
 You do not have to start them green 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.019
 let's use a knife and with this 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.420
 we are going to cut them so that we do not have 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:32.090
 here the hole where you can go 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.090
 our friends x who have 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.770
 so with the same knife remember to be 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.130
 short already after they are all 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.040
 peeled is the time when we are going to 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.950
 put to disinfect but never 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.340
 you start the leaves is cut so look if 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.290
 there is not the little hole 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.290
 all that are left peeled 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.950
 just that you want it for some 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.260
 very special decoration and you want 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.580
 leave their leaves very beautiful as they are 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.330
 you leave also here so that you 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.050
 disinfect but in this case we're going 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.420
 to finish peeling all 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.220
 I already tell you if you occupy that you have one 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.190
 with the leaves because you say I'm going to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.650
 put it decoration you leave here 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.160
 same to be disinfected with everything and 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.160
 leaves 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.090
 well already to disinfect we are going to 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.620
 use a few disinfectant drops 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.780
 depending on each manufacturer in the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.270
 amount of drops that will be put in 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.060
 this case says that we use half cover 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.820
 for a liter and we're going to leave it 10 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.130
 minutes so that these fit well 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.250
 disinfected we put the half cap 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.730
 and we're going to leave them here for space 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.650
 10 minutes and 10 minutes we are going to 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.650
 take out in this colander 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.500
 the 10 minutes have passed now 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.930
 if your prisoners are ready 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.410
 and disinfected but we put them in a 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.410
 strainer 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.800
 to drain all ice cream very well 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.800
 and ready 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.690
 Now and 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.620
 you can eat it
