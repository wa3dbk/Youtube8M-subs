laser level and I thought this was kind
of<00:03:59.389> gimmicky<00:03:59.720> at<00:03:59.840> first<00:04:00.049> this<00:04:00.319> is<00:04:00.379> really<00:04:00.560> neat

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
of gimmicky at first this is really neat

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.240 
of gimmicky at first this is really neat
when<00:04:02.569> you<00:04:02.629> hook<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:02.930> up<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.139> the<00:04:03.229> phone<00:04:03.439> you

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
when you hook it up to the phone you

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.159 
when you hook it up to the phone you
have<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.459> picture<00:04:04.759> of<00:04:04.909> your<00:04:05.180> wall<00:04:05.359> or<00:04:05.900> whatever

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
have a picture of your wall or whatever

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.039 
have a picture of your wall or whatever
you're<00:04:06.290> looking<00:04:06.560> at<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.919> then<00:04:07.639> a<00:04:07.939> level<00:04:08.479> when

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
you're looking at and then a level when

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.869 
you're looking at and then a level when
you<00:04:09.169> hit<00:04:09.290> level<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.739> can<00:04:09.889> hit<00:04:09.979> the<00:04:10.129> button<00:04:10.280> and

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
you hit level you can hit the button and

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.969 
you hit level you can hit the button and
if<00:04:11.000> this<00:04:11.180> is<00:04:11.389> it's<00:04:11.989> got<00:04:12.139> a<00:04:12.169> tripod<00:04:12.409> mount<00:04:12.859> and

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979 
if this is it's got a tripod mount and

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.170 
if this is it's got a tripod mount and
everything<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.459> can<00:04:13.669> keep<00:04:13.879> it<00:04:14.000> real

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
everything so you can keep it real

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.020 
everything so you can keep it real
stable<00:04:14.419> and<00:04:15.099> once<00:04:16.099> you<00:04:16.190> press<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.519> button<00:04:16.759> it

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
stable and once you press the button it

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.899 
stable and once you press the button it
will<00:04:17.209> project<00:04:17.570> an<00:04:18.199> x<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.859> y<00:04:19.070> access<00:04:19.579> laser

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:19.909 
will project an x and y access laser

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.029 
will project an x and y access laser
lines<00:04:20.269> so<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:20.989> can<00:04:21.259> use<00:04:21.409> this<00:04:21.560> for<00:04:21.739> leveling

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
lines so you can use this for leveling

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.529 
lines so you can use this for leveling
pictures<00:04:22.400> or<00:04:22.610> just<00:04:22.639> about<00:04:22.940> anything<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.389> mean
