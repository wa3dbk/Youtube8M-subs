 Welcome to the Garden House Profile Now it's about colored houses 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.590
 Can I have ordered the same order yes we have some now 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.210
 Color laser assortment 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.949
 We looked at what Thommy customer percent wish again and again 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.990
 and trade in the assortment that we took many houses or many 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.400
 Models already in the and can deliver easily and then must 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.590
 I will not be so easy it is not so with the build up are the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.810
 Finished houses from the outside ready that from the house may have nothing 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.870
 Doing more painting with the one we ourselves become our own ten 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 Years in which you really have no effort and no costs 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.680
 for milram-profi Voß Schusser thus I am to Babenhausen from the inside 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.870
 the houses know each other untreated so from the inside there is indeed more 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.340
 Of course, there can also be a basic question there, which means you can 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.160
 yes, sometimes breaks Faber deviate or receive light in the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.840
 Leave nature and the natural look 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.170
 and therefore completely free I have to do that but the interior painting must 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.460
 Of course plan is on the new exterior coat he wants the weather 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.260
 i cant get exposed okay 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.930
 and the houses that are in the same color frame in which the colors can 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.190
 The colors are harmless which are tested and harmless 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.950
 checked 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.660
 This is finished and dried nothing more 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.200
 so there is no smell or something so the physically harmless 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.590
 and when I sign up for one 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.260
 Howrse decide with natural wood then I have to do a lot more 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.979
 indeed from nature so formal hear 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.050
 Otherwise Trine's moisture will be absorbed into the house 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.630
 and then he has to make it a layer runs better and then it has to be twice 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.859
 with heads in the midst of protection before so but painting will be provided 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.369
 and has really long-term protection to offer 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.749
 and that should really every two to three years depending on how that 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.130
 House exposed to the weather that will be renewed and this bleu heavy 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.490
 what is this about preventing this car alone beginning education on 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.569
 Cottage and this mushroom formation in turn would lead to that 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.750
 defenseless watch is destroyed and then moisture could penetrate the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.909
 Least so important 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.490
 and just stupid around the wooden windows like that 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.319
 Pröll effective 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.069
 but there is an alternative to the natural to the colored houses 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.840
 that that you 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.319
 I wore Kate 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.169
 the problem occurs he is treated with salt 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.579
 What I've achieved is government all the wood is that durable 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.420
 is sufficient to build up as it is 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.420
 We do not just treat our house either inside or outside 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.510
 and percent it could still be so exempt connection from the outside like 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.230
 I would like it 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.069
 the year in the 40 at these houses that let the first song so 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.870
 making this number so you can come to something so greener 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.879
 Points on the wood pending the first song and that would sometimes be color 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:52.200
 again 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.259
 either cover it up and that's a bit weird 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.819
 You should always move the house there as we have seconded second year then 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.309
 Paint delete that's okay so who the choice he has the agony 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:03.189
 have fun 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.279
 when choosing under shock
