three stroke your arms this look where

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.730 
three stroke your arms this look where
my<00:00:08.010> fingers<00:00:08.820> are<00:00:08.940> touching<00:00:09.120> as<00:00:09.480> they<00:00:10.200> pass<00:00:10.440> my

my fingers are touching as they pass my
body<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:12.000> then<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.269> elbow<00:00:12.570> comes<00:00:12.840> up<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
body and then the elbow comes up and

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.870 
body and then the elbow comes up and
it's<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.950> second<00:00:14.340> not<00:00:15.150> here<00:00:15.650> up<00:00:16.699> to<00:00:17.699> where<00:00:17.850> I

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it's a second not here up to where I

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.590 
it's a second not here up to where I
feel<00:00:18.500> my<00:00:19.500> body<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.980> straight<00:00:20.449> shoulders<00:00:21.449> are

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
feel my body is straight shoulders are

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.359 
feel my body is straight shoulders are
stripped<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.320> elbow<00:00:22.590> comes<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.160> just

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
stripped and the elbow comes up and just

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.500 
stripped and the elbow comes up and just
catch<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.850> right<00:00:24.000> there<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> stops<00:00:28.949> here

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
catch it right there and it stops here

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.910 
catch it right there and it stops here
there's<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.570> bond<00:00:30.840> mechanical<00:00:31.349> principle<00:00:31.740> if

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
there's a bond mechanical principle if

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.520 
there's a bond mechanical principle if
the<00:00:32.489> body<00:00:32.730> does<00:00:33.000> automatic<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.780> swing<00:00:34.260> this

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the body does automatic if I swing this

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
the body does automatic if I swing this
and<00:00:34.860> stop<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.520> create<00:00:36.149> more<00:00:36.360> force

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and stop it and create more force

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.360 
and stop it and create more force
through<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.020> ground<00:00:37.260> from<00:00:37.800> my<00:00:37.950> foot<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
through the ground from my foot in the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.229 
through the ground from my foot in the
ground<00:00:38.719> and<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.140> stops<00:00:40.410> back<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:44.239> now

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
ground and this one stops back here now

as<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.600> want<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.050> faster<00:00:46.640> I'm<00:00:47.640> stroking

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
as I want to go faster I'm stroking

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
as I want to go faster I'm stroking
faster<00:00:48.840> through<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> range<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.590> motion<00:00:49.649> I'm

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
faster through that range of motion I'm

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979 
faster through that range of motion I'm
stopping<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.120> faster<00:00:51.449> through<00:00:51.840> that

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
stopping but I'm faster through that

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.279 
stopping but I'm faster through that
range<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.320> motion<00:00:53.120> faster<00:00:54.120> faster<00:00:54.870> faster

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
range of motion faster faster faster

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.619 
range of motion faster faster faster
faster<00:00:55.739> until<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> can't<00:00:56.760> go<00:00:56.879> any<00:00:57.030> faster<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
faster until I can't go any faster and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.110 
faster until I can't go any faster and
you<00:00:57.960> hope<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.530> 60<00:00:58.890> meters<00:00:59.010> then<00:00:59.760> after

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
you hope that's at 60 meters then after

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.959 
you hope that's at 60 meters then after
that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.780> maintain<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.590> stroke<00:01:01.969> maintain

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that you maintain the stroke maintain

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.880 
that you maintain the stroke maintain
your<00:01:03.090> body<00:01:03.300> position<00:01:03.840> keep<00:01:04.229> your<00:01:04.379> feet<00:01:04.530> coming

your body position keep your feet coming

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.929 
your body position keep your feet coming
down<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.250> relax<00:01:05.960> don't<00:01:06.960> fight<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
down and relax don't fight it

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.020

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
and that has a lot to do with technique

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.390 
and that has a lot to do with technique
maintaining<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.500> decelerating<00:01:14.340> as

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.560 
reason you know the longer lever that
easier<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.550> feel<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.030> stroke<00:02:32.300> when

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
easier it is to feel the stroke when

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.190 
easier it is to feel the stroke when
you're<00:02:32.720> here

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
you're here

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.220 
you're here
see<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.650> harder<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.100> feel<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.460> punch<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:36.020> it

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
see it's harder to feel the punch but it

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.510 
see it's harder to feel the punch but it
doesn't<00:02:36.530> make<00:02:36.620> any<00:02:36.770> difference<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:37.280> they

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
doesn't make any difference in they

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.010 
doesn't make any difference in they
still<00:02:37.730> have<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:38.060> open<00:02:38.360> up<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.630> arm<00:02:39.970> stroke

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
still have to open up the arm stroke

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.120 
still have to open up the arm stroke
regardless<00:02:42.020> of<00:02:42.140> their<00:02:42.260> hands<00:02:42.530> or<00:02:42.680> here<00:02:42.800> that's

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
regardless of their hands or here that's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.160 
regardless of their hands or here that's
all<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.880> ligament<00:02:44.360> has<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.750> come<00:02:44.930> from<00:02:45.080> the

that's<00:04:45.910> how<00:04:46.120> we<00:04:46.180> react<00:04:48.720> when<00:04:49.720> issued<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.169> stay

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440

there and Stroke not quicker because
then<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:53.889> get<00:04:54.070> your<00:04:54.250> stride<00:04:54.550> off<00:04:54.729> so<00:04:55.360> you

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
then you get your stride off so you

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.740 
then you get your stride off so you
don't<00:04:55.510> allow<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.440> hips<00:04:57.039> to<00:04:57.190> extend<00:04:57.760> when<00:04:58.630> you
