00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.259
 yes hello here I am again your monika 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.500
 k and today I have something for you 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.389
 brought a special highlight 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.199
 From time to time I have a colleague here 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.840
 which makes permanent make up and therefore 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.109
 that I met very well today 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.880
 which makes today eyebrows in herrchen 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.570
 drawing that's the whole 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.179
 This is very special 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.399
 and very good so that the eyebrows 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.649
 because really look like little ones 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.750
 hairs were there and I thought 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.480
 that it is also interesting for you 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 and that's why I think we'll keep that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.940
 camera on it and look like that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:54.780
 is made so that one even sees the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:57.449
 is really quite quite 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.460
 quite good is that you single hair 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.890
 does not make such a big mark 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.229
 So you should not such a bar 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.900
 do 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:10.320
 it does not look that good, it does 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.260
 is really herrchen for herrchen 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.610
 he drew that whole then 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.180
 really like your own good eyebrows 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.180
 leaves 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.790
 that is very tedious but that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:41.340
 Result afterwards is then really 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:43.890
 fantastic then yes we have here 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.720
 again the device that is one 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.520
 electrical device that will with the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 shoe foot switch practically operated one 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.080
 Can anyone imagine that first 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.510
 once we saw airbrushing 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.870
 synonymous as similar hand pieces is there 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.780
 Also the color above done or at 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.420
 the tattooists what we do here 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.600
 of course it is not a tattoo 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.660
 only given to the top layer 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.240
 the color so there is no blood here 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.160
 or so but it will only be in the 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.230
 given top layer of course keeps 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.230
 Do not even tattoo her 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.620
 live long but it fades in the course 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.500
 a few years the parents one 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.230
 however, the longer it holds 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.940
 Color in the skin is younger 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.709
 keep the metabolism bigger so that 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.700
 then a few years afterward 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.940
 must become 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.370
 now it's been six years for me 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.989
 So that's not a problem at all 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.610
 while here with younger people that 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.030
 ever after three or four years 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.660
 is followed so that is in the coarse 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:00.450
 and all the whole secret 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:05.330
 the work becomes very slow and very 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.800
 Carefully done because the eyebrows 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.730
 divide the face are so one 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.180
 quite a big part of what we do 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.570
 make or make a face out of power 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.150
 eyebrows is a face very flat 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.290
 while the eyebrow expression in the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.350
 give eyes 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.890
 and that's why an eyebrow is always 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.440
 something really very exquisite 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.220
 you just have to be careful you always have to 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.710
 otherwise you can disfigure man 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.480
 one 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.970
 people and here you can actually see 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.180
 that it really is a very complete one 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.590
 It is fantastic work that makes it 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.660
 eyes again at the subdivision 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.880
 eyes then radiate again while the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:00.040
 subdivision of the face is like that again 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:02.260
 that you look really happy again 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.850
 you can be calm without eyebrows 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.520
 be happy but you do not see it 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.470
 because the eyebrows are also facial expressions and 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.280
 Here is the facial expressions then again 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.880
 given 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.960
 yes that was it for me today and until 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.500
 there for the next time all the best yours 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.500
