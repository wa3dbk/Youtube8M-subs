00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
up after I wash it so that it doesn't

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
up after I wash it so that it doesn't
tangle<00:03:43.569> back<00:03:43.959> up<00:03:44.610> after<00:03:45.610> wait<00:03:46.599> I<00:03:46.629> think<00:03:47.019> I've

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
I was saying I usually twist my hair

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.370 
I was saying I usually twist my hair
after<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.810> wash<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:03.420> let<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.450> air<00:04:04.690> dry<00:04:04.720> in

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
after I wash it and let it air dry in

after I wash it and let it air dry in
big<00:04:05.920> twists<00:04:06.930> anyways<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.560> today<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.040> just

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
big twists anyways so today I just

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.620 
big twists anyways so today I just
thought<00:04:10.019> well<00:04:11.019> since<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.859> have<00:04:11.950> some<00:04:12.099> time<00:04:12.630> I'll

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
thought well since I have some time I'll

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.110 
thought well since I have some time I'll
just<00:04:13.900> twist<00:04:14.230> it<00:04:14.410> smaller<00:04:15.310> than<00:04:15.819> I<00:04:15.940> usually

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
just twist it smaller than I usually

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.569 
just twist it smaller than I usually
would<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:19.739> there<00:04:20.739> you<00:04:20.799> go<00:04:20.829> that's<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.280> last

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
would so there you go that's the last

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.860 
would so there you go that's the last
one<00:04:22.620> hopefully<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.770> shrinks<00:04:24.130> back<00:04:24.340> up<00:04:24.870> but

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
one hopefully that shrinks back up but

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.129 
one hopefully that shrinks back up but
yeah<00:04:26.020> this<00:04:26.229> is<00:04:26.440> basically<00:04:26.919> it<00:04:27.990> here's<00:04:28.990> the

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
yeah this is basically it here's the

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:36.980 
yeah this is basically it here's the
side<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.380> side

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.010 

yeah<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.440> as<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:38.740> said<00:04:38.800> cuz<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.660> never<00:04:40.660> managed

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
yeah and as I said cuz I never managed

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.440 
yeah and as I said cuz I never managed
to<00:04:41.110> do<00:04:41.290> these<00:04:41.470> need<00:04:41.770> enough<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.340> never<00:04:43.120> wear

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450
