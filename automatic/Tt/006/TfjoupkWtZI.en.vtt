that<00:00:38.790> was<00:00:39.149> more<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.540> concern<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.930> think

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
that was more of a concern I think

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.350 
that was more of a concern I think
during<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> game<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.760> might<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.210> been<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
during the game it might have been a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.389 
during the game it might have been a
concern<00:00:42.750> beforehand<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> definitely<00:00:44.219> wasn't

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
concern beforehand it definitely wasn't

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.100 
concern beforehand it definitely wasn't
because<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> mean<00:00:45.000> 40<00:00:45.329> jinx<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
because I mean 40 jinx with the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.779 
because I mean 40 jinx with the
protector<00:00:46.559> dings<00:00:46.739> comp<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> kind<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.550> scary

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
protector dings comp is kind of scary

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
protector dings comp is kind of scary
but<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.149> think<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.600> long<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> wasn't

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
but I think as long as it wasn't

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
but I think as long as it wasn't
mob<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> smart<00:00:49.950> guy<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.820> lot<00:00:51.180> of

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
mob as a smart guy there is a lot of

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.729 
mob as a smart guy there is a lot of
room<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> play<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.989> well<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
room to play with that well it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.990 
room to play with that well it
definitely<00:00:52.920> worked<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.520> favor<00:00:53.640> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
definitely worked out in your favor it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
definitely worked out in your favor it
felt<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.360> SK<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.989> charge<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> game

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
felt like SK was in charge of the game

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.619 
felt like SK was in charge of the game
the<00:00:56.190> entirety<00:00:56.640> definitely<00:00:57.030> dragon<00:00:57.329> control

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the entirety definitely dragon control

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.319 
the entirety definitely dragon control
the<00:00:58.050> gold<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.559> very<00:00:58.920> even<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> very<00:01:00.120> long

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the gold was very even for a very long

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.779 
the gold was very even for a very long
time<00:01:00.390> did<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.140> catch<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.649> God<00:01:01.859> not

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
time did that catch you of God not

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.670 
time did that catch you of God not
really<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.510> felt<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> we've<00:01:04.379> had<00:01:04.530> more

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
really but we felt it we've had more

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.590 
really but we felt it we've had more
insecure<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> game<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.210> felt<00:01:06.479> during

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
insecure in the game then we felt during

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.630 
insecure in the game then we felt during
preparation<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.409> think<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.520> was

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
preparation I think that it was

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.550 
preparation I think that it was
throughout<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> game<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> controlled<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
throughout the game kind of controlled I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.870 
throughout the game kind of controlled I
think<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.830> team<00:01:11.010> fights<00:01:11.220> were<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:11.670> bit

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
think the team fights were a little bit

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.070 
think the team fights were a little bit
massive<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> might<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> work<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
massive you might have to work on that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.249 
massive you might have to work on that
coming<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.710> playoffs<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:14.900> semis<00:01:15.900> will<00:01:16.080> show

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
coming to playoffs then semis will show

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
coming to playoffs then semis will show
we<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.740> need<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> prepare<00:01:17.130> better<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.700> we

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
we just need to prepare better and we

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.130 
we just need to prepare better and we
need<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.479> point<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:18.990> we're

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
need to be on point with what we're

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.570 
need to be on point with what we're
doing<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.500> were<00:01:19.560> slightly<00:01:19.830> off<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> was

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
doing we were slightly off but it was

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.249 
doing we were slightly off but it was
enough<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.850> take<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> win<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.450> game<00:01:21.600> while
