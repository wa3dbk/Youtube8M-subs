it's<00:00:24.260> not<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.470> earliest<00:00:25.890> version<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.279> has

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it's not the earliest version that has

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.099 
it's not the earliest version that has
the<00:00:26.550> built-in<00:00:26.820> power<00:00:27.029> supply<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.930> still

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the built-in power supply but it's still

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.550 
the built-in power supply but it's still
an<00:00:28.740> older<00:00:29.070> version<00:00:29.330> I<00:00:30.330> don't<00:00:31.170> claim<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.470> be

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
an older version I don't claim to be

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.319 
an older version I don't claim to be
good<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.550> could<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> horrible<00:00:33.090> demo

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
good and this could be a horrible demo

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090 
good and this could be a horrible demo
so<00:00:33.719> we'll<00:00:33.870> find<00:00:34.020> out<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.620> will<00:00:34.770> probably<00:00:34.890> be

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
so we'll find out there will probably be

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.520 
so we'll find out there will probably be
clamps<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:36.059> playing<00:00:36.420> through<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> version

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
clamps I'm playing through a version

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.319 
clamps I'm playing through a version
Blackbird<00:00:38.100> which<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> similar<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.969> super

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
Blackbird which is similar to a super

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.100 
Blackbird which is similar to a super
reverb<00:00:40.280> my<00:00:41.280> guitar<00:00:41.640> has<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.210> onboard<00:00:42.600> effects

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
reverb my guitar has the onboard effects

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500 
reverb my guitar has the onboard effects
loop<00:00:43.320> setup<00:00:43.950> similar<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.730> Garcia<00:00:45.149> mods

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
loop setup similar to the Garcia mods

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.529 
loop setup similar to the Garcia mods
and<00:00:46.550> this<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.700> being<00:00:47.879> recorded<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> rather

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and this is being recorded in a rather

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
and this is being recorded in a rather
crappy<00:00:49.020> camera<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> sound<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.039> probably

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
crappy camera so the sound is probably

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.319 
crappy camera so the sound is probably
if<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> -<00:00:50.969> good

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
if you - good

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.270 
if you - good
anyway<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.170> clean<00:00:52.410> sound<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> we'll

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
anyway this is my clean sound so we'll

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.860 
anyway this is my clean sound so we'll
start<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> vintage<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.120> well<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.719> should

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
start with the vintage one well I should

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.869 
start with the vintage one well I should
point<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:02.430> two<00:01:02.609> pedals

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
set up to be very similar in tone with

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.890 
set up to be very similar in tone with
very<00:01:05.580> similar<00:01:05.850> settings<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.750> really

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
