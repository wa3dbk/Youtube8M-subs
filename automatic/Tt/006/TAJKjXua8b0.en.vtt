 but I'm not quite that way yet 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.170
 convinced because I think they do a lot 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.280
 maintain a very bad result 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.330

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.899

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.920
 others these are arguments from bpm 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.869
 business class a tory I believe that 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.400
