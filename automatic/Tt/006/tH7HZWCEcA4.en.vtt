00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.559
 but weighed somehow easy hand draw europe the well in the manga style 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.720
 so I'll start here by the goals 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.140
 how to make 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.140
 morrow who will make these goals 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.929
 it's not just what they do the rockets do or other central bc show that 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.470
 What are we supposed to do for an email? 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.830
 hardly a dvd or cd 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.250
 and here we feel flee 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.710
 the stf already forming the triangle 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.940
 downstairs leaving 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.940
 of the ends are paulo 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.180
 with this base we define practically Russian in the manga style 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 so we make this trait that is not here 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.750
 dalfom as one of the markings of the eyes 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.500
 those whose nose 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.520
 and here comes your mouth 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.840
 or part of the eyes but at this point because the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.100
 or unusual 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.170
 they understand 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.130
 the other 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.370
 and here but it threatens to turn 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.400
 the ear 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.530
 exhibitors can do 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.040
 performance 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.790
 in the manga style 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.920
 of a director that came after tracing here that face already 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.460
 I think surrendering the format 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.720
 that I want to give my character 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.930
 then head then 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.320
 and I basically all with these few 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 the next destination 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.420
 the shape of the honey or air character remembering whenever the hair it is 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.159
 pointed at the head and not glued right then next to it will stay 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.190
 more or less here right? 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.320
 with these goals is that it will define practically 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.350
 my character 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.820
 black tracing here 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.820
 So we finish then. 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.730
 we did 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.939
 simply following 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.389
 This project predicts that Iraq will 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.059
 after the eye loses 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:24.199
 in manga style we do not need sick closure can do basically 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.889
 the top and low art people hit the course 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.529
 and let's do it then 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 the brightness of the applicant 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.009
 and we will end up completing this gold with our own 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.489
 calf 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.379
 we end up jeopardizing the eye that people 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.369
 we ended up leaving nothing 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:53.279
 thus enters the olindÃ£o 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.599
 the bracelet above 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.969
 but although 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.969
 in a game so caring - so 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:03.169
 it's because 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.319
 the hair 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 mister letter charter then 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:11.789
 next 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.789
 from the manga 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.529
 complete here 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.129
 the neck for us 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.129
 end character 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.629
 will put a glow that we receive 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.789
 and I'll darken link 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.969
 will make a finish 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.399
 A little better here 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:43.149
 at the Museum 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.149
 lisbon 10 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.329
 the actor and heartthrob you to study to make us little by little to 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.639
 law here 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.230
 in a few minutes 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.869
 with few 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:17.269
 thanks people 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.729
 can do a 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.729
 of being this place in a very simple way 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.590
 as you could see here 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.319
 with this attitude shows how the Chinese wang so 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.999
 on goals to kidnap 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.580
 without needing much finishing you saw 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.610
 Simple for us to make this taste here. 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.659
 we kind of dyed 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:57.399
 dropping more
