somebody who works with leather to do

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.820 
somebody who works with leather to do
that<00:02:32.820> however<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.660> leather<00:02:34.960> they<00:02:35.230> used<00:02:35.530> back

that however the leather they used back

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.140 
that however the leather they used back
in<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.010> day<00:02:36.100> when<00:02:36.400> they<00:02:36.520> made<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:39.640> belt<00:02:39.940> I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
in the day when they made this belt I

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.220 
in the day when they made this belt I
guess

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
guess

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.660 
guess
the<00:02:41.650> hit<00:02:41.980> was<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.400> lot<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.100> leather<00:02:45.340> was<00:02:45.640> a

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
the hit was a lot the the leather was a

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.610 
the hit was a lot the the leather was a
lot<00:02:45.940> thicker<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.360> lot<00:02:46.660> stiffer<00:02:47.140> than<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
lot thicker a lot stiffer than the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.400 
lot thicker a lot stiffer than the
simulated<00:02:48.490> leather<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:49.060> they<00:02:49.209> have<00:02:49.360> now<00:02:49.600> so

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
simulated leather that they have now so

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.240 
simulated leather that they have now so
yeah<00:02:51.160> it's<00:02:51.340> still<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.640> little<00:02:51.850> stiff<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:53.680> won't

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250
