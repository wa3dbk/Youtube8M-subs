00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
uploading this battle is not because it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.689 
uploading this battle is not because it
was<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.170> good<00:00:22.320> battle<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.920> wasn't<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.250> horrible

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
was a good battle it wasn't a horrible

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.130 
was a good battle it wasn't a horrible
battle<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.720> because<00:00:24.930> i<00:00:25.019> was

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
battle but it's just because i was

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.870 
battle but it's just because i was
really<00:00:25.350> proud<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.920> how<00:00:25.949> well<00:00:26.220> my<00:00:26.430> team<00:00:26.609> did

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
really proud with how well my team did

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.730 
really proud with how well my team did
so<00:00:27.810> i<00:00:27.840> guess<00:00:28.019> we'll<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.289> straight<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:28.590> this

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
think anything you touch him really but

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.120 
think anything you touch him really but
and<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.900> didn't<00:01:16.140> realize<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.680> felt<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:16.979> could

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and I didn't realize you felt all could

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.649 
and I didn't realize you felt all could
learn<00:01:17.250> focus<00:01:17.610> blast<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.030> mean<00:01:18.150> that's<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.450> thing

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
learn focus blast I mean that's a thing

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
learn focus blast I mean that's a thing
I<00:01:18.900> guess<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.259> happened<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.710> whatever<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I guess that happened it's whatever so

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.920 
I guess that happened it's whatever so
you<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.820> that's<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.150> Pokemon<00:01:21.540> down<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:21.869> me

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you know that's one Pokemon down from me

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.240 
you know that's one Pokemon down from me
already<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> decide<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> go<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> Ambrose

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
cuz I don't recall my own protein called

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.679 
cuz I don't recall my own protein called
unfroze<00:01:29.579> holy<00:01:29.820> crap<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> didn't<00:01:30.329> notice<00:01:30.450> that

pretty<00:01:39.420> sure<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.840> say<00:01:40.470> blood<00:01:40.680> shows<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
pretty sure and say blood shows the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.649 
pretty sure and say blood shows the
recover<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.520> since<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> prankster<00:01:42.240> Sableye

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
recover and since the prankster Sableye

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.109 
recover and since the prankster Sableye
you<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.869> he<00:01:42.990> always<00:01:43.229> goes<00:01:43.680> first<00:01:43.939> unless<00:01:44.939> i

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
you know he always goes first unless i

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.609 
you know he always goes first unless i
guess<00:01:45.329> there's<00:01:45.600> another<00:01:45.899> pokemon<00:01:46.380> with

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
guess there's another pokemon with

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.649 
guess there's another pokemon with
priority<00:01:47.220> i<00:01:47.250> actually<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
priority i actually don't think that

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.850 
priority i actually don't think that
well<00:01:49.049> i<00:01:49.079> don't<00:01:49.229> know<00:01:49.290> how<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> works<00:01:49.619> really

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
well i don't know how it works really

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.929 
well i don't know how it works really
but<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.250> Sableye<00:01:50.579> always<00:01:50.790> goes<00:01:50.909> first

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
but you know Sableye always goes first

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.999 
but you know Sableye always goes first
so<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:52.049> go<00:01:52.140> through<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> brave<00:01:52.500> bird<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> take

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
so you go through a brave bird and take

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.429 
so you go through a brave bird and take
some<00:01:53.130> Sableye<00:01:53.430> down<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> pretty<00:01:54.540> decent

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
some Sableye down to a pretty decent

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.990 
some Sableye down to a pretty decent
amount<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> HP<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.979> guess<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.820> felt

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
amount of HP I guess and then you felt

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.520 
amount of HP I guess and then you felt
all<00:01:57.119> goes<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.390> their<00:01:57.509> bluff<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.810> Oblivion

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530

goes for the the blaze kick here and
that<00:06:06.570> kind<00:06:06.780> of<00:06:06.840> worried<00:06:07.080> me<00:06:07.260> and<00:06:07.620> it<00:06:07.740> didn't

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
that kind of worried me and it didn't

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.260 
that kind of worried me and it didn't
even<00:06:07.980> do<00:06:08.220> as<00:06:08.340> much<00:06:08.550> damage<00:06:08.580> I<00:06:08.970> thought<00:06:09.150> at

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
even do as much damage I thought at

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.610 
even do as much damage I thought at
which<00:06:09.390> I<00:06:09.540> mean<00:06:09.690> flare<00:06:09.930> blitz<00:06:10.050> is<00:06:10.170> stronger<00:06:10.500> but

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
which I mean flare blitz is stronger but

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.930 
which I mean flare blitz is stronger but
i<00:06:10.680> guess<00:06:10.830> he<00:06:10.950> just<00:06:11.010> wanted<00:06:11.190> to<00:06:11.430> I<00:06:11.460> to<00:06:11.520> recall

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
i guess he just wanted to I to recall

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.820 
i guess he just wanted to I to recall
you<00:06:12.150> know<00:06:12.480> he<00:06:12.540> goes<00:06:12.630> for<00:06:12.750> the<00:06:12.810> blades<00:06:13.410> cake<00:06:13.620> and

until he killed himself like he did here

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.770 
until he killed himself like he did here
and<00:06:34.550> you<00:06:35.550> know<00:06:35.580> if<00:06:35.850> eventually<00:06:36.150> I<00:06:36.420> just<00:06:36.660> run

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
and you know if eventually I just run

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.390 
and you know if eventually I just run
out<00:06:36.900> recover<00:06:37.230> I<00:06:37.530> mean<00:06:37.740> I<00:06:37.830> could<00:06:37.980> have<00:06:38.070> lost<00:06:38.220> the

out recover I mean I could have lost the

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.770 
out recover I mean I could have lost the
battle<00:06:38.430> but<00:06:38.700> still<00:06:39.090> I<00:06:39.300> think

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
battle but still I think
