it<00:00:34.399> pairs<00:00:34.610> with<00:00:34.730> a<00:00:34.790> smartphone<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:35.390> we're

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
it pairs with a smartphone and we're

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.540 
it pairs with a smartphone and we're
going<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:35.660> come<00:00:35.870> on<00:00:36.020> to<00:00:36.260> that<00:00:36.470> later<00:00:36.740> and<00:00:37.340> if<00:00:37.430> we

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
going to come on to that later and if we

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.490 
going to come on to that later and if we
take<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.790> look<00:00:37.970> up<00:00:38.120> close<00:00:38.390> we<00:00:38.840> can<00:00:38.990> also<00:00:39.140> see<00:00:39.410> it

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
take a look up close we can also see it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.170 
take a look up close we can also see it
has<00:00:39.650> NFC<00:00:40.010> pairing<00:00:40.580> so<00:00:40.730> it's<00:00:40.850> going<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.000> be<00:00:41.150> a

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
has NFC pairing so it's going to be a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.720 
has NFC pairing so it's going to be a
one<00:00:41.420> touch<00:00:41.960> pairing<00:00:42.530> solution<00:00:42.980> with<00:00:43.160> Sony
