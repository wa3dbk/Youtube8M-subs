okay<00:00:05.410> next<00:00:05.740> we<00:00:06.010> are<00:00:06.040> going<00:00:06.160> to<00:00:06.340> make<00:00:06.520> the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:07.300 
okay next we are going to make the

okay next we are going to make the
little<00:00:07.479> envelopes<00:00:08.139> that<00:00:08.590> you<00:00:09.130> get<00:00:09.370> you<00:00:09.550> get<00:00:09.760> I

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:09.970 
little envelopes that you get you get I

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.409 
little envelopes that you get you get I
think<00:00:10.210> 12<00:00:10.540> of<00:00:10.719> them<00:00:11.580> these<00:00:12.580> are<00:00:12.999> really<00:00:13.209> easy

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:13.419 
think 12 of them these are really easy

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:14.730 
think 12 of them these are really easy
to<00:00:13.629> make<00:00:13.660> you're<00:00:13.929> just<00:00:14.110> going<00:00:14.259> to<00:00:14.320> punch<00:00:14.589> it

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
to make you're just going to punch it

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:23.770 
to make you're just going to punch it
out<00:00:14.860> of<00:00:15.730> your<00:00:16.180> kit<00:00:17.050> and<00:00:17.340> fold<00:00:18.340> it

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.830 

so<00:00:24.440> it<00:00:24.560> looks<00:00:24.740> like<00:00:24.830> that<00:00:25.190> and<00:00:25.630> then<00:00:26.630> there

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
so it looks like that and then there

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.690 
so it looks like that and then there
you'll<00:00:27.350> see<00:00:27.590> that<00:00:27.710> that<00:00:27.890> says<00:00:28.100> glue<00:00:28.460> right

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
you'll see that that says glue right

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.790 
you'll see that that says glue right
there<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.270> right<00:00:29.300> there<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.620> we're<00:00:30.770> just

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
there and right there so we're just

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.280 
there and right there so we're just
going<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.040> take<00:00:31.190> a<00:00:31.220> little<00:00:31.520> bit<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.790> glue<00:00:35.290> and

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290

corner<00:02:22.720> where<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.840> says<00:02:23.950> glue

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.949 
and let me see you're going to put it
right<00:02:36.879> here<00:02:36.939> even<00:02:37.420> though<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.569> doesn't<00:02:37.659> say

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
right here even though it doesn't say

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:45.090 
right here even though it doesn't say
glue<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:39.099> needs<00:02:39.280> glue<00:02:39.459> to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:54.850 

and<00:02:45.580> right<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:46.690> on<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:46.990> one

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.710 

now<00:02:55.460> I<00:02:55.490> think<00:02:55.700> we'll<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.090> an<00:02:56.240> issue<00:02:56.390> if<00:02:56.600> we

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
now I think we'll have an issue if we

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.420 
now I think we'll have an issue if we
try<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.930> glue<00:02:57.200> this<00:02:57.380> side<00:02:57.650> before<00:02:57.890> we<00:02:58.160> do<00:02:58.280> this

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
try to glue this side before we do this

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.030 
try to glue this side before we do this
side<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:58.880> let's<00:02:59.240> go<00:03:00.110> ahead<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.440> glue<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
side so let's go ahead and glue the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:24.890 
side so let's go ahead and glue the
other<00:03:01.250> side<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.850> same<00:03:02.060> way

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.429 

ok<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:26.939> leaving<00:03:27.599> these<00:03:27.750> two<00:03:27.930> flaps<00:03:28.200> out

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
ok so now leaving these two flaps out

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.130 
ok so now leaving these two flaps out
you're<00:03:29.310> going<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.519> fold<00:03:29.790> all<00:03:30.060> these<00:03:30.569> into<00:03:31.019> each

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
you're going to fold all these into each

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:42.610 
you're going to fold all these into each
other<00:03:32.930> glue<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.170> down<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.930> that

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.410 

and<00:03:42.920> you're<00:03:43.370> going<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.519> stick<00:03:44.739> these<00:03:45.739> all<00:03:48.190> to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
and you're going to stick these all to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:58.899 
and you're going to stick these all to
this<00:03:51.280> outside<00:03:52.280> piece<00:03:52.580> right<00:03:52.819> there<00:03:57.849> try<00:03:58.849> to

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
this outside piece right there try to

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.559 
this outside piece right there try to
even<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.390> out<00:04:00.700> okay<00:04:01.700> and<00:04:01.879> then<00:04:02.030> do<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.299> same<00:04:02.329> on

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
even it out okay and then do the same on

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:11.270 
even it out okay and then do the same on
the<00:04:02.810> other<00:04:02.840> side

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.160 

you've<00:04:11.970> got<00:04:12.180> one<00:04:12.360> more<00:04:12.510> little<00:04:12.690> flap<00:04:12.990> that

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
you've got one more little flap that

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.290 
you've got one more little flap that
needs<00:04:13.380> glue<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:13.950> haven't<00:04:14.220> put<00:04:15.090> glue<00:04:15.270> on

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
needs glue that I haven't put glue on

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.420 
needs glue that I haven't put glue on
yet<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:17.930> do<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.139> I<00:04:19.410> should<00:04:19.980> have<00:04:20.100> done<00:04:20.250> that

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
yet so do that I should have done that

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.840 
yet so do that I should have done that
before<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:22.070> should<00:04:23.070> have<00:04:23.130> glued<00:04:23.430> this<00:04:23.610> piece

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
before I should have glued this piece

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.400 
before I should have glued this piece
already<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.389> that<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.540> could<00:04:24.660> have<00:04:24.900> stuck<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.290> in

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
already so that I could have stuck it in

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.670 
already so that I could have stuck it in
already<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:26.370> make<00:04:26.550> sure<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.730> you<00:04:27.030> do<00:04:27.180> that

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
already so make sure that you do that

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.640 
already so make sure that you do that
whenever<00:04:28.680> you're<00:04:28.980> gluing<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.820> first<00:04:30.120> pieces

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
whenever you're gluing the first pieces

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.510 
whenever you're gluing the first pieces
because<00:04:31.650> it's<00:04:31.770> going<00:04:31.889> to<00:04:31.950> be<00:04:32.070> harder<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.340> get

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
because it's going to be harder to get

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:41.940 
because it's going to be harder to get
in<00:04:32.669> now

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:49.700 

oh<00:04:42.360> okay<00:04:43.360> there<00:04:43.540> got<00:04:45.210> okay<00:04:46.210> now<00:04:48.060> for<00:04:49.060> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
oh okay there got okay now for the
