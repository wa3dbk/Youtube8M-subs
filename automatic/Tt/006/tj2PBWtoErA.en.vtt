00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.770 
today I got actually off ebay and they
are<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.430> cone<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:09.060> studs<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.750> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
are these kind of cone like studs and I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.480 
are these kind of cone like studs and I
like<00:01:09.990> them<00:01:10.170> because<00:01:10.290> they're<00:01:10.830> more<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
like them because they're more like of a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.450 
like them because they're more like of a
3d<00:01:12.470> dimension<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> would<00:01:14.250> encourage

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
3d dimension and what I would encourage

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.620 
3d dimension and what I would encourage
you<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.210> make<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.350> general<00:01:16.920> shape<00:01:17.630> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you to do is make the general shape that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.140 
you to do is make the general shape that
you<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:19.680> design<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.280> first<00:01:20.729> instead

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
you want your design to be first instead

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
you want your design to be first instead
of<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.330> filling<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.890> I'm<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
of just filling in so I'm going to do a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.429 
of just filling in so I'm going to do a
shape<00:01:24.000> kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.689> how<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> mentioned<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
shape kind of like how I mentioned that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.710 
shape kind of like how I mentioned that
half<00:01:25.680> moon<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.240> it'll<00:01:27.420> just

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
half moon like that and then it'll just

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600 
half moon like that and then it'll just
be<00:01:27.810> easier<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.290> fill<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.710> afterwards<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.490> I'm

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
be easier to fill in afterwards so I'm

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.670 
be easier to fill in afterwards so I'm
really<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> eyeball<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.680> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
really just going to eyeball it this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.080 
really just going to eyeball it this
letter<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.369> easy<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.850> through

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
letter is really easy to go through

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
letter is really easy to go through
because<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.540> more<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.930> wool<00:01:34.200> sweater<00:01:34.560> so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
because it's more of a wool sweater so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
because it's more of a wool sweater so
definitely<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.150> want<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.630> an

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
definitely I'm if you want to have an

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.100 
definitely I'm if you want to have an
easier<00:01:37.229> time<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> sweater<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
easier time look for a sweater that is

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.030 
easier time look for a sweater that is
full<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> again<00:01:42.299> I'm<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.290> separate

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
full so again I'm just going to separate

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.249 
full so again I'm just going to separate
it<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.310> my<00:01:44.430> fingers<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.649> then<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:48.259> flying

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it with my fingers and then just flying

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.060 
it with my fingers and then just flying
at<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> I'm<00:01:51.960> basically<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.470> eyeballing

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
at out so I'm basically just eyeballing

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.880 
at out so I'm basically just eyeballing
to<00:01:53.399> make<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> good<00:01:54.299> outline<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:55.229> moon<00:01:55.530> shape

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
to make a good outline of my moon shape

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.069 
to make a good outline of my moon shape
on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> shoulder<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:57.390> only<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> finish

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
on the shoulder I'm only going to finish

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.510 
on the shoulder I'm only going to finish
the<00:01:58.200> lining<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.009> move<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the lining here and then move on to the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.910 
the lining here and then move on to the
other<00:01:59.670> side<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> make<00:02:00.420> sure<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.350> can

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
other side just to make sure that I can

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.399 
other side just to make sure that I can
make<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> exactly<00:02:02.450> symmetrical<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.290> other

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
make it exactly symmetrical on the other

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.150 
make it exactly symmetrical on the other
side<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> bit<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.200> framework<00:02:07.710> here

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
side so I have a bit of a framework here

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
side so I have a bit of a framework here
of<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.270> want<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.509> kind<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.810> try

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
of what I have you want to kind of try

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.140 
of what I have you want to kind of try
it<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.379> Midway<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.610> make<00:02:11.760> sure<00:02:11.790> you're

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
it on Midway just to make sure you're

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820 
it on Midway just to make sure you're
off<00:02:12.300> your<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.440> what<00:02:13.680> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
off your you like what you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.100 
off your you like what you
have<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.190> far<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.360> make<00:02:18.420> sure<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.960> it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
have so far so just to make sure that it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.810 
have so far so just to make sure that it
looks<00:02:19.290> exactly<00:02:19.590> how<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.040> want<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.550> it's

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
looks exactly how you want it that it's

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.570 
looks exactly how you want it that it's
even<00:02:21.350> where<00:02:22.350> else<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.770> want<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.950> add<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.550> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
even where else you want to add it so I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.970 
even where else you want to add it so I
might<00:02:23.820> just<00:02:24.030> add<00:02:24.210> a<00:02:24.240> little<00:02:24.450> bit<00:02:24.720> more<00:02:24.990> right

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
might just add a little bit more right

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.480 
might just add a little bit more right
here<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.490> then<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.970> fill<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.690> out<00:02:27.780> here<00:02:28.490> so

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
here and then just fill it out here so

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.340 
here and then just fill it out here so
basically<00:02:29.910> because<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.360> finished<00:02:30.900> one

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
basically because I finished one

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.680 
basically because I finished one
shoulder<00:02:31.980> I'm<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.610> folding<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.570> and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
shoulder I'm just folding it and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.840 
shoulder I'm just folding it and
matching<00:02:34.200> up<00:02:34.350> on<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.070> other<00:02:35.190> side<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.700> make

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
matching up on the other side to make

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.750 
matching up on the other side to make
sure<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.330> it's<00:02:36.570> exactly<00:02:37.020> symmetrical<00:02:37.760> so

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
sure that it's exactly symmetrical so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.300 
sure that it's exactly symmetrical so
I'm<00:02:38.850> just<00:02:39.030> using<00:02:39.330> studs<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.290> mark<00:02:40.680> off<00:02:40.920> some<00:02:41.190> of

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
I'm just using studs to mark off some of

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.820 
I'm just using studs to mark off some of
the<00:02:41.400> key<00:02:41.640> areas<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.420> where<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.260> half<00:02:43.500> moon

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the key areas like where the half moon

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.190 
the key areas like where the half moon
begins<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.670> where<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.940> ends<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.050> it's

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
begins and where it ends just so it's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.370 
begins and where it ends just so it's
easier<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.620> eyeball<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.850> other<00:02:48.000> side

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.270 

sometimes<00:02:52.380> for<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.740> go<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.890> little<00:02:53.100> bit

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
sometimes for it to go a little bit

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.910 
sometimes for it to go a little bit
faster<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.360> insert<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.170> studs

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
faster you can just insert the studs

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.250 
faster you can just insert the studs
several<00:02:56.790> at<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> time<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.660> then<00:02:57.690> flip<00:02:57.990> it<00:02:58.110> over

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
several at a time and then flip it over

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.760 
several at a time and then flip it over
and<00:02:58.850> fold<00:02:59.850> them<00:03:00.060> all<00:03:00.360> over<00:03:00.900> at<00:03:01.200> once<00:03:01.530> rather

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
and fold them all over at once rather

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:15.220 
and fold them all over at once rather
than<00:03:01.950> continuously<00:03:02.730> going<00:03:02.940> back<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.540> forth

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.600 

definitely<00:03:16.230> before<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.770> fill<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
definitely before you fill in the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.280 
definitely before you fill in the
shoulders<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.239> want<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.540> make<00:03:18.720> sure<00:03:18.750> that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
shoulders you want to make sure that

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.759 
shoulders you want to make sure that
it's<00:03:19.580> exactly<00:03:20.580> equal<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.450> definitely<00:03:21.959> fold<00:03:22.650> it

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
it's exactly equal so definitely fold it

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.310 
it's exactly equal so definitely fold it
over<00:03:22.860> make<00:03:23.220> sure<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.170> beginning<00:03:25.170> and

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
over make sure that the beginning and

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.229 
over make sure that the beginning and
ends<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:25.980> moon's<00:03:26.220> match<00:03:26.580> up<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.120> then

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
ends of the moon's match up and then

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.170 
ends of the moon's match up and then
you're<00:03:27.390> ready<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.630> fill<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.019> in<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:30.000> now<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
you're ready to fill it in so now to

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.810 
you're ready to fill it in so now to
kind<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.510> switch<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.840> up<00:03:30.930> i'm<00:03:31.080> actually<00:03:31.320> using

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
kind of switch it up i'm actually using

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.420 
kind of switch it up i'm actually using
square<00:03:32.820> studs<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.450> are<00:03:33.600> not<00:03:34.080> as<00:03:34.380> 3d<00:03:35.130> as<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
square studs that are not as 3d as the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.400 
square studs that are not as 3d as the
cone<00:03:35.700> ones<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.239> fill<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.780> shoulders<00:03:37.200> I

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
cone ones to fill in the shoulders I

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.140 
cone ones to fill in the shoulders I
thought<00:03:38.160> it'd<00:03:38.310> be<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> more<00:03:38.940> interesting

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
thought it'd be a more interesting

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.410 
thought it'd be a more interesting
design<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.630> also<00:03:39.959> think<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.709> 3d<00:03:41.400> pneus<00:03:42.180> of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
design I also think that the 3d pneus of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.270 
design I also think that the 3d pneus of
the<00:03:42.660> other<00:03:43.019> studs<00:03:43.380> are<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> little<00:03:43.769> bit<00:03:44.010> too

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the other studs are a little bit too

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.759 
the other studs are a little bit too
much<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:45.989> want<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.200> work<00:03:46.380> your<00:03:46.530> way

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
much so you just want to work your way

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.040 
much so you just want to work your way
to<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.340> middle<00:03:47.670> just<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.450> make<00:03:48.600> sure<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:49.019> all

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
to the middle just to make sure that all

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:57.259 
to the middle just to make sure that all
the<00:03:49.350> studs<00:03:49.620> are<00:03:49.769> aligned<00:03:50.340> properly<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:57.120> we're

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
the studs are aligned properly so we're

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.430 
the studs are aligned properly so we're
definitely<00:03:57.390> getting<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.840> little<00:03:57.870> bit<00:03:58.170> closer

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
definitely getting a little bit closer

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.190 
definitely getting a little bit closer
I'm<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.550> do<00:03:59.730> keep<00:04:00.120> in<00:04:00.239> mind<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.930> studs

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
I'm just do keep in mind that the studs

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.080 
I'm just do keep in mind that the studs
and<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.830> alignment<00:04:02.130> did<00:04:02.519> not<00:04:02.670> have<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.000> be

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
and the alignment did not have to be

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.530 
and the alignment did not have to be
perfect<00:04:04.340> many<00:04:05.340> people<00:04:05.519> will<00:04:05.820> not<00:04:06.120> be<00:04:06.300> able<00:04:06.390> to

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
perfect many people will not be able to

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.810 
perfect many people will not be able to
tell<00:04:06.840> if<00:04:06.870> one<00:04:07.680> or<00:04:07.709> two<00:04:07.860> studs<00:04:08.250> are<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.489> little

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
tell if one or two studs are a little

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.039 
tell if one or two studs are a little
bit<00:04:09.090> out<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.269> place<00:04:11.600> so<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.630> pretty<00:04:12.840> much<00:04:12.930> just

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
bit out of place so I pretty much just

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.930 
bit out of place so I pretty much just
finish<00:04:13.650> filling<00:04:13.980> up<00:04:14.190> one<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.580> shoulders

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
finish filling up one of the shoulders

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.940 
finish filling up one of the shoulders
and<00:04:15.150> just<00:04:15.269> make<00:04:15.510> sure<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.780> do<00:04:15.989> exactly<00:04:16.530> the

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
and just make sure you do exactly the

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.920 
and just make sure you do exactly the
same<00:04:17.010> thing<00:04:17.160> into<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.820> other<00:04:17.940> side<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.570> you

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930
