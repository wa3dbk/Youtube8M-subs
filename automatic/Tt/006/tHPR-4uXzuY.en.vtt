course where the large are very easy to

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.760 
course where the large are very easy to
see<00:05:51.900> so<00:05:52.900> this<00:05:52.990> one<00:05:53.140> here<00:05:53.230> is<00:05:53.320> very<00:05:53.500> heated

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770

it<00:06:44.980> will<00:06:45.130> take<00:06:45.370> care<00:06:45.580> of<00:06:45.670> the<00:06:45.760> braking<00:06:46.180> and

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
it will take care of the braking and

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.550 
it will take care of the braking and
throttle<00:06:46.600> control<00:06:46.900> so<00:06:47.140> all<00:06:47.230> you<00:06:47.320> have<00:06:47.410> to<00:06:47.470> do

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
throttle control so all you have to do

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.560 
throttle control so all you have to do
is<00:06:47.680> worry<00:06:47.860> about<00:06:47.890> steering<00:06:48.310> and<00:06:48.610> it<00:06:49.210> does<00:06:49.360> that

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
is worry about steering and it does that

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.060 
is worry about steering and it does that
so<00:06:49.810> that<00:06:49.990> to<00:06:50.530> make<00:06:50.680> sure<00:06:50.830> if<00:06:50.920> you're<00:06:51.040> going
