00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.920
 and now all suns in the video and good 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.200
 I just finished with this from the items and 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.870
 we go something also quite simple and 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.999
 that will last very little the video that are 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.820
 custom wagons like that going to 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:20.740
 some custom wagons like this 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.960
 that brings a peak or a lighthouse inside and 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.690
 you can still get on it like you can 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.730
 see here but you can also upload and 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.920
 you look very nice very well 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.350
 in other words it is a wagon with a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.840
 block inside do not limit ourselves to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.540
 wagons that already give us with oven hopper 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.220
 and those things is a pretty command 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.220
 simple what is this 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.100
 simon minecraft king of bolt these that 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.740
 are the coordinates that I already explained that 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.930
 they are a bit moved and they are 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.820
 moved in diagonal coordinates 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.370
 fixed and with these lines it is taken from 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.770
 reference the command block as 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.340
 point zero that I already explained in the 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.650
 Simon if you want to understand it better go 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.210
 to Schümann's video because it took me a while 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.030
 little explaining it in each video that 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.979
 do with this type of commands now 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:22.630
 I will know this custom display tyrol one that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:27.160
 is this from tyrol wine I have no idea 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.250
 let it be but the joke do not forgive 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.590
 forgive forgiveness is the item the idea of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.860
 item for example if I want me to 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.980
 exposes a cart with a block of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.500
 with a piston that is block 33 here 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.340
 we would put 33 and also here we have to 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.340
 put 33 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.909
 and here a one to make it look fair 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.880
 above 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.359
 sorry come bring a piston inside 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.359
 the wagon 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.520
 and this can be with any block 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.410
 less with some like these blocks of 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:13.210
 snow or heads or things like that 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.370
 and elvis with 138 and here is an example 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.050
 so you can use it for example 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.319
 is a little train must take coal 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.430
 it's not that it's in English which 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.209
 very well that is a little train that carries 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.280
 coal iron diamond gold and emeralds 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.160
 to somewhere 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.569
 to feed the chucu chucu and 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.020
 give it a good push 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.819
 push you 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.379
 fuck new failures on train 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.379
 you are not to fail 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.680
 because the change of lives does not move 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.659
 This is my little train that transports my 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.780
 minerals freshly extracted from a mine 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.150
 according to me and good the truth is that they look 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.060
 pretty nice ignore that mistake of 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.040
 skype looks pretty nice all this 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.130
 as you can always see decoration of 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.319
 adventure maps among other things 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.830
 basically it 's decoration and it's a bit 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.020
 peculiar this command 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.340
 do not thank me I thank him 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:27.000
 the forum where I read it because it's the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.170
 minecraft forum the post is called sumó 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 and of an block and command and it brings many 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.380
 things like these but I got the most 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.060
 important and if I make a video for 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.940
 that you understand better this 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.770
 command will come in the description 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.510
 all values that are at zero 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.510
 you can modify them at your whim 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.989
 you know you can only blocks do not you 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.180
 You can see items and it seems to me down here 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.180
 they appear all the videos that there are 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.400
 here they are pretty nice with a 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.019
 image similar to this one of the wagon and therefore 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.459
 well see you in a next video 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.459
 until the next goodbye
