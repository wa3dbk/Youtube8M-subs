00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
and these are micro adjustments like six

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.670 
and these are micro adjustments like six
a<00:01:34.120> sixteenth<00:01:34.660> of<00:01:34.780> an<00:01:34.930> inch<00:01:35.050> so<00:01:35.380> it's<00:01:35.530> very

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
a sixteenth of an inch so it's very

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.190 
a sixteenth of an inch so it's very
small<00:01:35.890> sometimes<00:01:36.790> I<00:01:37.210> don't<00:01:37.300> even<00:01:37.479> go<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:37.960> far

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
small sometimes I don't even go that far

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.160 
small sometimes I don't even go that far
because<00:01:38.440> just<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:39.010> little<00:01:39.520> bit<00:01:39.790> of<00:01:40.030> movement<00:01:40.660> is

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
because just a little bit of movement is

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.560 
because just a little bit of movement is
going<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:41.950> really<00:01:42.280> affect<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.940> impact<00:01:43.300> your

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
going to really affect the impact your

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.780 
going to really affect the impact your
arrow<00:01:43.750> so<00:01:43.900> it's<00:01:44.170> just<00:01:44.350> micro<00:01:44.830> adjustments<00:01:45.460> and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
arrow so it's just micro adjustments and

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.190 
arrow so it's just micro adjustments and
that's<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.660> beauty

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
that's a beauty

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.640 
that's a beauty
with<00:01:48.130> rest<00:01:48.430> these<00:01:48.610> days<00:01:48.940> is<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:50.500> can

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
with rest these days is that you can

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.170 
with rest these days is that you can
move<00:01:50.830> them<00:01:50.950> just<00:01:51.009> a<00:01:51.310> click<00:01:51.550> or<00:01:51.580> two<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.090> that's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
move them just a click or two and that's

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.390 
move them just a click or two and that's
that<00:01:53.050> micro<00:01:53.440> adjustment<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.009> you<00:01:54.130> need<00:01:54.280> to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
that micro adjustment that you need to

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.490 
that micro adjustment that you need to
bring<00:01:54.550> those<00:01:54.700> arrows<00:01:55.030> over<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.990> anytime<00:01:56.200> your

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
bring those arrows over so anytime your

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.010 
bring those arrows over so anytime your
broadhead<00:01:56.860> tuning<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.820> want<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.119> do<00:01:58.300> the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
broadhead tuning you want to do the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.990 
broadhead tuning you want to do the
opposite<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.860> what<00:01:59.979> your<00:02:00.340> arrows<00:02:00.610> are<00:02:00.700> doing

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
opposite of what your arrows are doing

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.640 
opposite of what your arrows are doing
so<00:02:01.390> once<00:02:01.540> again<00:02:01.690> if<00:02:01.930> your<00:02:02.050> arrows<00:02:02.290> are<00:02:02.380> hitting

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
so once again if your arrows are hitting

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.160 
so once again if your arrows are hitting
right<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:03.670> want<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.910> move<00:02:04.060> your<00:02:04.119> rest<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
left a sixteenth of an inch and that

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.859 
left a sixteenth of an inch and that
should<00:02:08.290> bring<00:02:08.739> your<00:02:09.190> broadheads<00:02:09.700> over<00:02:10.209> closer

meet in the middle so if your broadheads
are<00:02:17.140> hitting<00:02:17.380> over<00:02:17.500> here<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.160> your<00:02:18.610> field

movement<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.060> left<00:02:25.230> you're<00:02:26.230> probably

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
movement to the left you're probably

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.610 
movement to the left you're probably
going<00:02:27.549> to<00:02:27.670> start<00:02:28.060> grouping<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.350> middle

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
going to start grouping in the middle

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.830 
going to start grouping in the middle
kind<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:29.950> split<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.220> difference<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.910> once

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
kind of split the difference and once

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.750 
kind of split the difference and once
your<00:02:32.290> broadhead<00:02:32.739> start<00:02:33.040> grouping<00:02:33.430> together

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
your broadhead start grouping together

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.250 
your broadhead start grouping together
like<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.060> that's<00:02:34.480> perfect<00:02:35.019> that's<00:02:35.140> great

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
like that that's perfect that's great

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.940 
like that that's perfect that's great
then<00:02:36.040> move<00:02:36.730> your<00:02:36.760> site<00:02:37.150> adjust<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.080> get<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.680> in

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
then move your site adjust and get it in

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.640 
then move your site adjust and get it in
the<00:02:39.100> center<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:40.080> that'll<00:02:41.080> give<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.410> that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
the center and that'll give you that

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.110 
the center and that'll give you that
broad<00:02:41.890> head<00:02:42.100> tune<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.489> you're<00:02:42.610> looking<00:02:42.880> for

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
broad head tune that you're looking for

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.539 
broad head tune that you're looking for
that<00:02:43.150> down<00:02:43.630> range<00:02:43.870> accuracy<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:45.370> most

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
that down range accuracy and the most

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.400 
that down range accuracy and the most
efficiency<00:02:46.239> out<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:46.510> your<00:02:46.750> arrow<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.350> your

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
efficiency out of your arrow and your

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.740 
efficiency out of your arrow and your
setup<00:02:47.830> which<00:02:48.459> leads<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.910> better<00:02:49.180> penetration

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
setup which leads to better penetration

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.590 
setup which leads to better penetration
better<00:02:50.470> flight<00:02:50.830> in<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.040> wind<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.600> better

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
better flight in the wind and better

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.979 
better flight in the wind and better
accuracy<00:02:53.019> downrange<00:02:54.450> okay<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:55.959> our

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
accuracy downrange okay so we have our

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.150 
accuracy downrange okay so we have our
group<00:02:56.530> our<00:02:56.739> broadheads<00:02:57.400> with<00:02:57.910> our<00:02:58.120> field<00:02:58.390> tips

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
group our broadheads with our field tips

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.580 
group our broadheads with our field tips
the<00:03:00.160> broad<00:03:00.370> head<00:03:00.580> were<00:03:00.760> here<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:02.110> field<00:03:02.380> tips

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
the broad head were here the field tips

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.250 
the broad head were here the field tips
right<00:03:02.799> here<00:03:03.450> these<00:03:04.450> arrows<00:03:04.750> are<00:03:04.900> grouping

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
right here these arrows are grouping

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.030 
right here these arrows are grouping
together<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:05.799> I've<00:03:05.890> called<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.459> project

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
together so I've called it project

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:21.570 
together so I've called it project
I<00:03:08.209> really<00:03:09.209> go<00:03:09.360> through<00:03:09.569> good<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.349> go

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.640
