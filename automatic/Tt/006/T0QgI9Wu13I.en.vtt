00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.800 

Oh

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:14.810 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.840 

hello<00:00:15.810> everyone<00:00:16.280> android<00:00:17.280> user<00:00:17.550> here

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
hello everyone android user here

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.570 
hello everyone android user here
bringing<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.450> an<00:00:18.810> app<00:00:19.020> review<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
bringing you an app review of the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.830 
bringing you an app review of the
android<00:00:21.029> app<00:00:21.800> milestone<00:00:22.800> overclock<00:00:23.689> so<00:00:24.689> what

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
android app milestone overclock so what

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.080 
android app milestone overclock so what
this<00:00:24.960> app<00:00:25.230> does<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.860> overclocks<00:00:26.670> your<00:00:26.849> phone

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
this app does is a overclocks your phone

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.630 
this app does is a overclocks your phone
so<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> will<00:00:28.230> run<00:00:28.439> faster<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.400> more

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
so then it will run faster and more

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.359 
so then it will run faster and more
efficient<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:31.020> downside<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.739> is<00:00:31.919> that

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
efficient the downside of that is that

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.270 
efficient the downside of that is that
it<00:00:32.970> would<00:00:33.210> eat<00:00:34.079> up<00:00:34.320> more<00:00:34.590> battery<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
it would eat up more battery and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.300 
it would eat up more battery and
sometimes<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> phone<00:00:36.720> is<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:37.739> suited<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
sometimes if the phone is not suited to

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.160 
sometimes if the phone is not suited to
run<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.670> high<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.239> would<00:00:39.420> cause<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.930> phone<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
run so high it would cause the phone to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.930 
run so high it would cause the phone to
overheat<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.329> for<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.260> because<00:00:43.940> if

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
overheat I for one know this because if

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.420 
overheat I for one know this because if
I<00:00:45.120> use<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.570> app<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.230> more<00:00:46.559> than<00:00:46.769> 10<00:00:47.160> minutes

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
I use this app for more than 10 minutes

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.750 
I use this app for more than 10 minutes
or<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.359> phone<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:48.989> close<00:00:49.739> around<00:00:51.739> 20

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
or so the phone will get close around 20

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.099 
or so the phone will get close around 20
around<00:00:53.760> 36<00:00:54.679> almost<00:00:55.679> 40<00:00:56.039> Celsius<00:00:56.960> converts<00:00:57.960> in

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
around 36 almost 40 Celsius converts in

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.310 
around 36 almost 40 Celsius converts in
now<00:00:58.260> which<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.920> 24<00:00:59.820> degrees<00:00:59.989> what<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.109> see

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
now which is at 24 degrees what you see

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.500 
now which is at 24 degrees what you see
here<00:01:01.589> is<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.309> tells<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.969> whether<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.300> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
here is that it tells you whether it is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
here is that it tells you whether it is
loaded<00:01:03.839> or<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> gives<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
loaded or not and then it gives you the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.570 
loaded or not and then it gives you the
mass<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.570> maximum<00:01:07.050> frequency<00:01:07.400> right<00:01:08.400> now

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
mass with maximum frequency right now

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.270 
mass with maximum frequency right now
and<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.540> voltage<00:01:09.690> so<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.830> load<00:01:11.100> them

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and the voltage so when you load them

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.930 
and the voltage so when you load them
audio<00:01:11.870> and<00:01:12.870> will<00:01:12.990> tell<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.409> my<00:01:14.310> phone<00:01:14.550> is<00:01:14.610> at

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
audio and will tell you my phone is at

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.490 
audio and will tell you my phone is at
550<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:15.960> 56<00:01:16.620> and<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:18.390> dial<00:01:18.660> here<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.320> will

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
550 at 56 and this dial here it will

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.390 
550 at 56 and this dial here it will
allow<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:20.840> overclock<00:01:21.840> your<00:01:21.870> phone<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
allow you to overclock your phone to the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.400 
allow you to overclock your phone to the
desired<00:01:23.850> amount<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> most<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.890> 1200<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
desired amount so the most is 1200 and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.230 
desired amount so the most is 1200 and
by<00:01:28.410> pressing<00:01:28.770> refresh<00:01:28.980> it<00:01:29.550> can<00:01:29.700> tell<00:01:29.940> whether

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
by pressing refresh it can tell whether

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.960 
by pressing refresh it can tell whether
or<00:01:30.780> not<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.260> is<00:01:31.290> working<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.550> you<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.760> here

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
or not it is working so what you do here

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
is you go and apply it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.279 
is you go and apply it
after<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> fight<00:01:37.490> we<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:39.270> back<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.960> refresh

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
after a fight we go back you can refresh

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.350 
after a fight we go back you can refresh
it<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> says<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.149> at

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it and it says up here what it is at

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
it and it says up here what it is at
that<00:01:42.630> way<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.259> know<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:44.009> you're<00:01:44.189> using<00:01:44.340> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that way you know when you're using it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.670 
that way you know when you're using it
and<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.119> unload<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.539> anytime<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and you can unload it anytime so of

how much faster it runs with and without

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.540 
how much faster it runs with and without
my<00:02:07.049> soul<00:02:07.319> o'clock

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.530 

note<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.510> loading<00:02:13.110> time<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.970> later<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.420> will

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
note the loading time and later you will

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.390 
note the loading time and later you will
see<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.560> speed<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.450> car<00:02:18.750> itself<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.500> I

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
see the speed of the car itself and I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.880 
see the speed of the car itself and I
chose<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.780> application<00:02:21.780> because<00:02:22.260> this

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
chose this application because this

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.330 
chose this application because this
application<00:02:23.580> does<00:02:23.790> require<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.210> lot<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:25.340> memory

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
application does require a lot of memory

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.870 
application does require a lot of memory
and<00:02:26.580> ram<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:28.200> does<00:02:28.410> take<00:02:28.650> up<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:29.700> does

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
and ram and it does take up it does

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.090 
and ram and it does take up it does
cause<00:02:30.120> my<00:02:30.330> phone<00:02:30.540> itself<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.170> lag<00:02:31.560> sometimes

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
cause my phone itself to lag sometimes

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.130 
cause my phone itself to lag sometimes
like<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.060> wouldn't<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.600> wouldn't<00:02:33.630> keep<00:02:33.990> it

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
like I wouldn't I wouldn't keep it

me go back you can really tell the phone
is<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.019> lot<00:03:41.349> faster<00:03:41.849> but<00:03:42.849> just<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.329> make<00:03:43.480> sure

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
is a lot faster but just to make sure

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.970 
is a lot faster but just to make sure
note<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.430> loading<00:03:46.000> time<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:47.349> speed<00:03:47.709> of

the frames see right there it reloads

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.490 
the frames see right there it reloads
quite<00:03:51.519> quickly<00:03:52.030> compared<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.900> before<00:03:53.019> as<00:03:53.349> you

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
quite quickly compared to before as you

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.240 
quite quickly compared to before as you

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
can see try to run it's probably not

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.589 
can see try to run it's probably not
going<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.400> be<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.549> same<00:04:00.670> track<00:04:00.970> because<00:04:01.390> it's

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
going to be the same track because it's

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.740 
going to be the same track because it's
a<00:04:01.780> normal<00:04:02.560> race<00:04:02.920> nothing<00:04:03.760> happens<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.629> not

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
a normal race nothing happens it's not

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:21.090 
a normal race nothing happens it's not
career<00:04:05.140> mode

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.080 

as<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.610> can<00:04:21.730> see<00:04:21.940> there's<00:04:22.270> virtually<00:04:22.960> no<00:04:23.320> lag

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
as you can see there's virtually no lag

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:36.430 
as you can see there's virtually no lag
which<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.300> great<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:29.010> running<00:04:30.010> smoothly

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:48.860 

that's<00:04:37.440> it

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.700 

so<00:04:49.470> you<00:04:49.530> see<00:04:50.040> even<00:04:50.280> when<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.850> other<00:04:51.030> cars

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
so you see even when the other cars

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.690 
so you see even when the other cars
there<00:04:52.710> is<00:04:52.740> no<00:04:53.550> lag<00:04:53.820> at<00:04:54.090> all<00:04:54.500> running<00:04:55.700> because

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
there is no lag at all running because

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.640 
there is no lag at all running because
of<00:04:56.940> this<00:04:57.150> app<00:04:57.360> solely<00:04:57.810> because<00:04:58.110> it's<00:04:58.410> the
