00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hello this is part 5 of the advanced f2l

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.720 
hello this is part 5 of the advanced f2l
tutorial<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:04.650> video<00:00:04.950> picks<00:00:05.250> up<00:00:05.460> right<00:00:05.670> where

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
tutorial this video picks up right where

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.040 
tutorial this video picks up right where
video<00:00:06.450> for<00:00:06.870> or<00:00:07.290> part<00:00:07.799> 4<00:00:08.040> left<00:00:08.490> off<00:00:08.809> we're<00:00:09.809> still

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
video for or part 4 left off we're still

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.370 
video for or part 4 left off we're still
continuing<00:00:10.380> with<00:00:10.889> cases<00:00:11.540> where<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:13.110> corner

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
continuing with cases where the corner

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.620 
continuing with cases where the corner
is<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> cross<00:00:14.219> layer<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.420> see

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
is in the cross layer as you can see

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.830 
is in the cross layer as you can see
right<00:00:15.660> here<00:00:16.940> we're<00:00:17.940> not<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.300> cover<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
right here we're not going to cover the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.130 
right here we're not going to cover the
case<00:00:19.140> where<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.970> layer<00:00:21.240> sorry<00:00:21.930> that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
case where it's on this layer sorry that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200 
case where it's on this layer sorry that
the<00:00:22.289> base<00:00:22.470> color<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.980> right<00:00:23.550> here<00:00:23.789> basically

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the base color is right here basically

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.330 
the base color is right here basically
to<00:00:24.510> where<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:24.900> correctly<00:00:25.289> oriented<00:00:25.590> because

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
to where it's correctly oriented because

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.050 
to where it's correctly oriented because
I<00:00:26.430> already<00:00:26.519> did<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.920> first<00:00:29.789> couple

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I already did that in the first couple

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.150 
I already did that in the first couple
of<00:00:30.269> videos<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.380> anyway<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.130> just

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
of videos so anyway this is just

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.549 
of videos so anyway this is just
continuation<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> cases<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.510> where<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
continuation of the cases to where the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.190 
continuation of the cases to where the
base<00:00:35.100> colors<00:00:35.399> off<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> side<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.110> this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
base colors off to the side so in this

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.920 
base colors off to the side so in this
situation<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.730> base<00:00:39.059> color<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.390> facing<00:00:39.780> us

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
situation the base color is facing us

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.779 
situation the base color is facing us
it's<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> bottom<00:00:42.770> layer<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.280> cross<00:00:44.520> layer

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it's in the bottom layer the cross layer

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's in the bottom layer the cross layer
and<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.840> some<00:00:46.079> kind<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.469> matching<00:00:47.309> color

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and you have some kind of matching color

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.450 
and you have some kind of matching color
here<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.960> other<00:00:49.079> situation<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
here the other situation you can have is

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.549 
here the other situation you can have is
a<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:52.260> situation<00:00:53.210> where<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.660> piece<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
a this situation where the piece is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.709 
a this situation where the piece is
correctly<00:00:56.039> oriented<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.360> situation

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
correctly oriented in this situation

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.410 
correctly oriented in this situation
it's<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.829> correctly<00:00:59.309> oriented<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.030> it's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it's not correctly oriented and it's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.080 
it's not correctly oriented and it's
easily<00:01:01.309> distinguished<00:01:02.309> by<00:01:02.430> having<00:01:02.730> some<00:01:02.910> kind

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
easily distinguished by having some kind

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.679 
easily distinguished by having some kind
of<00:01:03.239> pair<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:04.189> okay<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.729> here's<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> move

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
of pair here okay so here's the move

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.539 
of pair here okay so here's the move
you're<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.170> you're<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.340> see

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
you're going to do you're going to see

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
you're going to do you're going to see
whether<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.510> sorry<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:10.409> side

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
whether or not there sorry which side

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.010 
whether or not there sorry which side
the<00:01:10.950> base<00:01:11.460> color<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.880> facing<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.750> case

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the base color is facing you this case

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.600 
the base color is facing you this case
is<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.100> we're<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
is the right so we're going to do the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.950 
is the right so we're going to do the
right<00:01:14.729> version<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> algorithm<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
right version of the algorithm and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080 
right version of the algorithm and
here's<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.590> you're<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.130> I'm<00:01:18.030> going

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
here's what you're going to do I'm going

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.450 
here's what you're going to do I'm going
to<00:01:18.299> bring<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.830> you're<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> move<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
to bring it up you're going to move the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.710 
to bring it up you're going to move the
corner<00:01:20.759> backwards<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.479> you're<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
corner backwards and you're going to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.780 
corner backwards and you're going to
split<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> pair<00:01:22.970> okay<00:01:25.580> you're<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
split up the pair okay you're going to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.039 
split up the pair okay you're going to
do<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:28.250> lower<00:01:29.250> case<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.759> D<00:01:29.939> move<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.750> basically

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
do a lower case of D move so basically

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
do a lower case of D move so basically
moving<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> empty<00:01:31.740> slot<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.130> back<00:01:32.369> here

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
moving the empty slot to the back here

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.870 
moving the empty slot to the back here
and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.229> you're<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> pull<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.159> edge

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and then you're going to pull this edge

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
and then you're going to pull this edge
over<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.600> way<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.740> bring<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> corner<00:01:38.400> down

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
over this way so bring the corner down

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.789 
over this way so bring the corner down
and<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:38.970> pull<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.299> edge<00:01:39.420> over<00:01:39.810> bring<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and then pull the edge over bring the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.700 
and then pull the edge over bring the
corner<00:01:41.070> back<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.750> now<00:01:42.750> you're<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> move

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
corner back up now you're going to move

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.719 
corner back up now you're going to move
the<00:01:43.890> edge<00:01:44.040> right<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:45.170> like<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.860> now

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the edge right here like so and now

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.460 
the edge right here like so and now
you're<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.869> easy<00:01:49.170> pair

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
you're going to do that easy pair

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
you're going to do that easy pair
combination<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.780> they're

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
combination so as you can see they're

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630 
combination so as you can see they're
opposites<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.189> pull<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.520> in

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
opposites and you can just pull it in

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.300 
opposites and you can just pull it in
like<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> don't<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
like this but so that you don't have to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.580 
like this but so that you don't have to
do<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> grip<00:01:56.880> or<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> cube<00:01:57.719> rotation<00:01:58.259> we're<00:01:58.439> just

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
do a grip or a cube rotation we're just

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.670 
do a grip or a cube rotation we're just
going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> backwards<00:02:00.350> like<00:02:01.350> so

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
going to do it kind of backwards like so

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.950 
going to do it kind of backwards like so
and<00:02:02.060> it's<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> put<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.689> back

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
and it's going to put it in that back

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.969 
and it's going to put it in that back
layer<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.079> little<00:02:07.290> complicated<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
layer so it's a little complicated so

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.520 
layer so it's a little complicated so
let's<00:02:08.310> go<00:02:08.489> over<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.970> more<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.470> okay<00:02:10.470> so

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
let's go over it one more time okay so

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.309 
let's go over it one more time okay so
here<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.280> more<00:02:11.340> time<00:02:11.930> again<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:13.200> have

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
here it is one more time again we have

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.010 
here it is one more time again we have
some<00:02:13.530> kind<00:02:13.770> of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
some kind of

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.660 
some kind of
here<00:02:14.140> here<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:14.920> facing<00:02:15.310> us<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:15.550> the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
here here and it's facing us on the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.860 
here here and it's facing us on the
right<00:02:15.820> so<00:02:16.060> we're<00:02:16.180> doing<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.450> right<00:02:16.570> version

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
right so we're doing the right version

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.710 
right so we're doing the right version
bring<00:02:17.260> up<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.560> corner<00:02:17.920> move<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.520> back

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
bring up the corner move it to the back

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.320 
bring up the corner move it to the back
split<00:02:19.720> these<00:02:19.900> two<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.910> then<00:02:21.910> you're<00:02:22.090> going<00:02:22.240> to

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
split these two and then you're going to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.160 
split these two and then you're going to
do<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.780> lowercase<00:02:23.470> D<00:02:23.860> move<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.960> empty<00:02:25.960> slot

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
do a lowercase D move the empty slot

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.480 
do a lowercase D move the empty slot
into<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.470> back<00:02:26.650> you're<00:02:27.100> going<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.280> move<00:02:27.340> the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
into the back you're going to move the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.300 
into the back you're going to move the
corner<00:02:27.820> downward<00:02:28.270> bring<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.690> edge<00:02:28.840> around

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
corner downward bring the edge around

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.400 
corner downward bring the edge around
bring<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.430> corner<00:02:30.700> back<00:02:30.880> up<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:31.510> move<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
bring the corner back up and move the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.800 
bring the corner back up and move the
corner<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.130> edge<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:34.240> so<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.780> then

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
corner and the edge like so and then

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.300 
corner and the edge like so and then
you're<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.680> put<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:36.100> from<00:02:36.280> behind

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
you're going to put it in from behind

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.030 
you're going to put it in from behind
just<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:40.770> here's<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.890> right

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
just like that and here's the right

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.290 
just like that and here's the right
version<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.580> algorithm<00:02:42.850> at<00:02:43.210> full<00:02:43.510> speed

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.880 

alright<00:02:49.300> this<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.720> same<00:02:50.020> algorithm<00:02:50.680> but

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
alright this is that same algorithm but

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.770 
alright this is that same algorithm but
this<00:02:51.130> time<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:51.550> on<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.730> left<00:02:52.000> as<00:02:52.240> you<00:02:52.540> can

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
this time it's on the left as you can

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.330 
this time it's on the left as you can
see<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.170> base<00:02:53.320> color<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.650> facing<00:02:54.010> us<00:02:54.100> on<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
see the base color is facing us on the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.730 
see the base color is facing us on the
left<00:02:54.550> side<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.000> we<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:56.320> matching

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
left side and we have the matching

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.980 
left side and we have the matching
colors<00:02:57.040> here<00:02:57.280> again<00:02:58.150> you're<00:02:58.630> going<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.810> bring

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
colors here again you're going to bring

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.960 
colors here again you're going to bring
up<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.350> corner<00:02:59.710> you're<00:03:00.400> going<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.580> move<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.850> to

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
up the corner you're going to move it to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.420 
up the corner you're going to move it to
the<00:03:01.090> back<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.600> then<00:03:01.990> realign<00:03:02.590> here<00:03:03.100> that's

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
the back and then realign here that's

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.730 
the back and then realign here that's
going<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.730> split<00:03:03.910> these<00:03:04.120> two<00:03:04.330> pieces<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.900> I'm

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
going to split these two pieces up I'm

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.200 
going to split these two pieces up I'm
going<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:05.950> move<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.190> empty<00:03:06.490> slot<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:06.940> back

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
going to move the empty slot to the back

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.140 
going to move the empty slot to the back
so<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.870> move<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.140> corner<00:03:08.440> down<00:03:08.470> and

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
so that you can move the corner down and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.270 
so that you can move the corner down and
then<00:03:10.150> move<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.450> edge<00:03:10.570> over<00:03:10.960> bring<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.010> corner

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
then move the edge over bring the corner

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.560 
then move the edge over bring the corner
back<00:03:12.430> up<00:03:12.990> with<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.050> edge<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:16.120> way<00:03:16.330> in<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
back up with the edge this way in the

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.410 
back up with the edge this way in the
corner<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.990> way<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.470> then<00:03:18.220> put<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.520> in<00:03:18.670> kind

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
corner that way and then put it in kind

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.199 
corner that way and then put it in kind
of<00:03:19.540> reverse<00:03:19.840> mode<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.560> like<00:03:20.800> that<00:03:21.100> align<00:03:22.060> it

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
of reverse mode so like that align it

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.020 
of reverse mode so like that align it
and<00:03:22.450> then<00:03:22.840> pull<00:03:23.020> it<00:03:23.110> down<00:03:23.760> okay<00:03:24.760> here's<00:03:24.970> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
and then pull it down okay here's the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.110 
and then pull it down okay here's the
left<00:03:25.300> version<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.690> little<00:03:25.930> bit<00:03:26.020> faster<00:03:27.120> facing

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
left version a little bit faster facing

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.150 
left version a little bit faster facing
us<00:03:28.240> on<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.450> left<00:03:28.660> there's<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.290> pair<00:03:29.530> pull<00:03:30.040> up

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
us on the left there's the pair pull up

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.010 
us on the left there's the pair pull up
the<00:03:30.280> quarter<00:03:30.580> move<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.240> back<00:03:31.270> split

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
the quarter move it to the back split

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.040 
the quarter move it to the back split
the<00:03:32.140> two<00:03:32.290> pieces<00:03:32.709> lowercase<00:03:33.640> D<00:03:34.030> Prime<00:03:34.330> you

from behind rather and here's a left

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.850 
from behind rather and here's a left
version<00:03:45.220> at<00:03:45.370> full<00:03:45.730> speed

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.700 

the<00:03:51.860> next<00:03:52.130> scenario<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.820> where<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:54.080> edge<00:03:54.350> is

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
the next scenario is where the edge is

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.300 
the next scenario is where the edge is
properly<00:03:55.370> oriented<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:57.260> corner<00:03:57.740> again

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
properly oriented and the corner again

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.550 
properly oriented and the corner again
is<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:59.480> base<00:03:59.600> color<00:03:59.840> is<00:03:59.960> facing<00:04:00.290> off<00:04:00.410> to

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
is the base color is facing off to

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.580 
is the base color is facing off to
either<00:04:00.710> side<00:04:01.360> in<00:04:02.360> this<00:04:02.450> case<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:03.020> facing<00:04:03.470> us

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
either side in this case it's facing us

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
either side in this case it's facing us
on<00:04:03.710> the<00:04:03.800> right<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.130> we're<00:04:04.220> going<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.400> do<00:04:04.490> the

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
on the right so we're going to do the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.370 
on the right so we're going to do the
right<00:04:04.790> version<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.330> algorithm<00:04:05.630> here's

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
right version of the algorithm here's

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.840 
right version of the algorithm here's
what<00:04:06.530> we're<00:04:06.650> going<00:04:06.740> to<00:04:06.830> do<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.490> first<00:04:07.700> thing

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
what we're going to do the first thing

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.070 
what we're going to do the first thing
we're<00:04:07.970> going<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.120> do<00:04:08.270> is<00:04:08.450> we're<00:04:08.600> going<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.750> pull

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
we're going to do is we're going to pull

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.800 
we're going to do is we're going to pull
this<00:04:09.380> slot<00:04:09.920> out<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:10.610> it's<00:04:11.090> very<00:04:11.330> very<00:04:11.570> similar

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
this slot out and it's very very similar

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.990 
this slot out and it's very very similar
to<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.140> way<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:12.530> pull<00:04:12.709> a<00:04:12.740> slot<00:04:13.070> in<00:04:13.100> it's

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
to the way that you pull a slot in it's

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.090 
to the way that you pull a slot in it's
going<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.209> be<00:04:14.390> are<00:04:14.990> you<00:04:15.830> r<00:04:16.400> prime<00:04:16.910> u<00:04:17.450> prime<00:04:18.100> like

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
going to be are you r prime u prime like

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.390 
going to be are you r prime u prime like
so<00:04:20.109> so<00:04:21.109> basically<00:04:21.470> we're<00:04:21.769> just<00:04:21.950> pulling<00:04:22.160> it

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
so so basically we're just pulling it

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.840 
so so basically we're just pulling it
out<00:04:22.490> like<00:04:22.730> so<00:04:23.980> next<00:04:24.980> part<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.400> algorithm

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
out like so next part of the algorithm

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.520 
out like so next part of the algorithm
is<00:04:25.970> you're<00:04:26.060> going<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.210> bring<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.510> corner<00:04:26.930> over

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
is you're going to bring the corner over

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.510 
is you're going to bring the corner over
here<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.400> you're<00:04:28.460> going<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:28.820> bring<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.419> around

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
here and you're going to bring it around

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.370 
here and you're going to bring it around
splitting<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.640> up<00:04:31.760> with<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.060> edge<00:04:32.380> then

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
splitting it up with the edge then

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.570 
splitting it up with the edge then
you're<00:04:33.530> going<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.680> bring<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.950> edge<00:04:34.070> back<00:04:34.340> up

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
you're going to bring the edge back up

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.880 
you're going to bring the edge back up
so<00:04:34.910> now<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.480> have<00:04:35.510> an<00:04:35.810> easy<00:04:35.960> pair<00:04:36.260> combination

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
so now you have an easy pair combination

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.460 
so now you have an easy pair combination
so<00:04:37.640> you're<00:04:37.760> going<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:37.910> align<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.570> these

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
so you're going to align it and these

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.050 
so you're going to align it and these
two<00:04:39.650> are<00:04:39.680> opposites<00:04:40.220> so<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.430> just<00:04:40.610> pull<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:40.940> in

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
two are opposites so you just pull it in

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.650 
two are opposites so you just pull it in
like<00:04:41.240> so<00:04:42.669> so<00:04:43.669> let's<00:04:43.850> do<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.150> one<00:04:44.210> more<00:04:44.450> time

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
like so so let's do that one more time

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.840 
like so so let's do that one more time
just<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:45.230> little<00:04:45.560> bit<00:04:45.680> faster<00:04:45.890> we're<00:04:46.669> going<00:04:46.760> to

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
just a little bit faster we're going to

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.680 
just a little bit faster we're going to
bring<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.960> up<00:04:48.169> and<00:04:48.470> out<00:04:49.390> then<00:04:50.390> we're<00:04:50.510> going<00:04:50.600> to

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
bring it up and out then we're going to

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.480 
bring it up and out then we're going to
bring<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.990> corner<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.080> back<00:04:54.460> do<00:04:55.460> a

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
bring the corner to the back do a

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.150 
bring the corner to the back do a
youtube<00:04:55.580> bring<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.630> edge<00:04:56.780> back<00:04:57.290> up<00:04:57.590> now

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
youtube bring the edge back up now

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.950 
youtube bring the edge back up now
they're<00:04:58.340> opposites<00:04:58.940> here<00:04:59.270> so<00:04:59.419> we<00:04:59.570> can<00:04:59.690> rotate

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
they're opposites here so we can rotate

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.930 
they're opposites here so we can rotate
and<00:05:00.440> put<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.280> into<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.700> slot<00:05:03.850> here's<00:05:04.850> the

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
and put it into the slot here's the

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.659 
and put it into the slot here's the
right<00:05:05.090> version<00:05:05.300> at<00:05:05.630> full<00:05:05.810> speed<00:05:08.950> all<00:05:09.950> right

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
right version at full speed all right

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.040 
right version at full speed all right
this<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.120> left<00:05:11.450> version<00:05:11.840> of<00:05:11.960> the

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
this is the left version of the

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.330 
this is the left version of the
algorithm<00:05:12.320> so<00:05:12.710> we're<00:05:12.830> going<00:05:12.919> to<00:05:13.010> bring<00:05:13.160> this

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
algorithm so we're going to bring this

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.810 
algorithm so we're going to bring this
pair<00:05:13.669> out<00:05:13.910> so<00:05:14.600> we're<00:05:14.720> going<00:05:14.780> to<00:05:14.900> do<00:05:15.080> L<00:05:15.830> prime<00:05:16.280> u

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
pair out so we're going to do L prime u

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.080 
pair out so we're going to do L prime u
prime<00:05:16.880> L<00:05:17.510> you<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:18.860> like<00:05:18.979> so<00:05:19.280> we're<00:05:19.910> going<00:05:20.000> to

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
prime L you so like so we're going to

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.420 
prime L you so like so we're going to
push<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.690> corner<00:05:21.290> to<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.560> back<00:05:21.740> here<00:05:22.160> that's

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
push the corner to the back here that's

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.670 
push the corner to the back here that's
going<00:05:22.610> to<00:05:22.700> put<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:22.970> edge<00:05:23.120> downwards<00:05:23.780> we're

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
going to put the edge downwards we're

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.640 
going to put the edge downwards we're
going<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.860> break<00:05:25.100> them<00:05:25.280> up<00:05:25.460> you<00:05:26.419> two<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:26.960> then

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
going to break them up you two and then

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.820 
going to break them up you two and then
realign<00:05:28.430> here<00:05:28.970> well<00:05:29.510> bringing<00:05:30.320> up<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.710> edge

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
realign here well bringing up the edge

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.130 
realign here well bringing up the edge
then<00:05:31.700> they're<00:05:31.880> opposites<00:05:32.450> all<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:32.900> have<00:05:33.020> to

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
then they're opposites all you have to

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.790 
then they're opposites all you have to
do<00:05:33.290> is<00:05:33.530> realign<00:05:34.270> above<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.419> slot<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:36.020> put<00:05:36.710> it

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
do is realign above the slot and put it

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.570 
do is realign above the slot and put it
in<00:05:36.950> like<00:05:37.490> so<00:05:38.680> okay<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:39.740> here's<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.250> left

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
in like so okay so here's the left

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.390 
in like so okay so here's the left
version<00:05:41.030> a<00:05:41.210> little<00:05:41.510> bit<00:05:41.630> faster<00:05:41.840> so<00:05:42.740> it's

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
version a little bit faster so it's

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.280 
version a little bit faster so it's
correctly<00:05:43.910> oriented<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.750> this<00:05:44.870> one's<00:05:45.080> not

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
correctly oriented and this one's not

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.260 
correctly oriented and this one's not
it's<00:05:46.010> facing<00:05:46.370> us<00:05:46.460> on<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:46.700> left<00:05:46.940> so<00:05:47.150> we're

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
it's facing us on the left so we're

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.990 
it's facing us on the left so we're
going<00:05:47.360> to<00:05:47.450> pull<00:05:47.690> it<00:05:47.840> out<00:05:47.960> like<00:05:48.290> so<00:05:48.970> push<00:05:49.970> the

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
going to pull it out like so push the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.700 
going to pull it out like so push the
corner<00:05:50.419> to<00:05:50.570> the<00:05:50.660> back<00:05:50.870> we're<00:05:51.169> going<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.350> break

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
corner to the back we're going to break

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.710 
corner to the back we're going to break
up<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.130> pair<00:05:52.400> by<00:05:52.700> doing<00:05:53.000> a<00:05:53.090> YouTube<00:05:53.270> move

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
up the pair by doing a YouTube move

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.700 
we did the original one from the layer
by<00:06:18.000> layer<00:06:18.030> method<00:06:18.569> in<00:06:18.690> the<00:06:18.780> first<00:06:18.990> video<00:06:19.169> where

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
by layer method in the first video where

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.550 
by layer method in the first video where
the<00:06:20.270> base<00:06:21.270> color<00:06:21.509> was<00:06:21.780> correctly<00:06:22.259> oriented

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
the base color was correctly oriented

the<00:06:30.060> base<00:06:30.180> colors<00:06:30.479> off<00:06:30.630> to<00:06:30.750> the<00:06:30.870> side<00:06:31.080> so<00:06:31.440> you

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
the base colors off to the side so you

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.469 
the base colors off to the side so you
should<00:06:31.800> know<00:06:31.830> all<00:06:32.190> of<00:06:32.220> those<00:06:32.550> cases<00:06:33.150> now
