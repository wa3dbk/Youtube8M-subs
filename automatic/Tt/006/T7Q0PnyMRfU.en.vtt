00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
here I think I got that dialed in for

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.810 
here I think I got that dialed in for
your<00:01:17.420> boys<00:01:17.600> pretty<00:01:17.960> good<00:01:18.200> it<00:01:19.190> should<00:01:19.520> be<00:01:19.670> the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
your boys pretty good it should be the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:35.620 
your boys pretty good it should be the
same<00:01:19.850> for<00:01:20.240> my<00:01:20.390> voice

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.360 

yeah<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.350> need<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:37.620> is<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.190> little

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
yeah all we need now is a little

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.930 
yeah all we need now is a little
processor<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.510> there<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.520> then<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.760> will

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
processor in there and then that will

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.730 
processor in there and then that will
change<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:43.910> dynamics<00:01:44.910> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> voice<00:01:45.740> because

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
change the dynamics of the voice because

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.650 
change the dynamics of the voice because
right<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:46.980> it's<00:01:47.460> flat<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.120> it<00:01:48.210> sounds<00:01:48.420> good

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
right now it's flat but it sounds good

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.370 
right now it's flat but it sounds good
and<00:01:49.640> we<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.820> change<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.420> dynamics<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.140> little

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and we can change the dynamics a little

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.270 
and we can change the dynamics a little
bit<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.960> add<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> little<00:01:55.260> spice<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.010> don't

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
bit and add a little spice in it don't

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:08.260 
bit and add a little spice in it don't
you<00:01:56.430> know
