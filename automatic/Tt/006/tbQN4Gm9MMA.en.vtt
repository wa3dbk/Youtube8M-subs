00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.309
 now let's launch on a race of the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.620
 national calendar a marathon race 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.990
 the twenty-second marathon bike of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.840
 casatenovo the marathon bike of the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.800
 brianza with mirko celestino always 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.279
 present the Italian champion and let's see 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.500
 many other Italian riders all 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.919
 the strongest present did not compete 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.079
 on the Alps as often happens year 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.210
 the organizers found a path 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.219
 very interesting on the hills 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.649
 brianzole in the province of lecco a 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.109
 path far from easy though 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.660
 evidently the alpine peaks were missing 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.320
 the landscapes above all the first ones 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.910
 in asphalt we say so 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 preparatory then it will come soon 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.699
 left the part in quotation marks easy 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.159
 to enter the fields in the woods and in the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.019
 hills of the province of Como here a 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.170
 beautiful passage always with mirko celestino 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.170
 among the first but begins to take shape a little 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.930
 what is the nature of the best 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.790
 we saw all the best in the lead 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.649
 this first group among others are 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.890
 races that a little follow what 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:21.210
 happens on road marathons and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.060
 there is the group of the top gods and then it happened 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.729
 all practitioners lovers of this 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.149
 sports that they engage with 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.360
 samples 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:33.060
 let's remember there were three paths that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.969
 to entertain the children of 2 km then 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.820
 there was the adventure of 44 km because 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:42.689
 let's remember that they are races in which they run 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.450
 together professionals and amateurs e 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.479
 then the path on which i 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.460
 various longo country and company of 66 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.670
 kilometers that had a slay of a 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.530
 difference in height of almost two kilometers 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.619
 david you train in winter on mountain 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.659
 bike we are very happy to 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.060
 winter preparation that sent us 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.619
 these two years the petroli firenze in 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.359
 December December emotional flank 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.759
 very willingly the road bike with 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.649
 the mountain bike 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.240
 I did the murderer was flanked 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.200
 very happy about the 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.569
 oils 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.840
 has disappeared unfortunately we have remembered 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.090
 from our microphones daniele tosoni that 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.920
 he was a very well-known figure 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.349
 the environment of your sports director has 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.150
 left a great void and two weeks 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.700
 makes the news that the petroli firenze not 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.060
 the activity will continue two words up 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.769
 this daniele bog in practice was the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.019
 worst was petroleum firenze as far as 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.269
 regards the cycling field is the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.849
 patron obviously did not feel in 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.680
 he didn't feel like going on this 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.630
 experience having come to 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.450
 missing such an important person 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.750
 we hope to review one anyway 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.060
 sponsor so passionate about the environment 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.400
 not necessarily young males know 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.849
 everywhere the marathon continues 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.030
 bike arias cuervo we see it big 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.739
 fatigue for him has already lost ground in the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.900
 comparisons of the best here are with 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.130
 leon pailletes in front then see to the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.790
 his wheel 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.269
 johnny cattaneo run in the small group of 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.130
 head naturally changes the ride no 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.109
 david oven for this is fine too 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.690
 as a workout to pedal a lot 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.720
 with more agile ratios for strength and a lot 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.340
 a bike knows us on the wall with slopes 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.959
 very high 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.670
 surely you have to push a lot more 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.709
 strong to keep going 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.920
 meanwhile we see 31 km 66 pass with the 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.829
 backbone 2 country of the white team 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.109
 here he gained a few meters of 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.500
 advantage over johnny 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.150
 cattaneo of the selle san marco uno team 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.170
 of the always great protagonists of the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.440
 season and then we see behind the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.410
 two 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.840
 in fact before it was tony longo sorry and it was 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.930
 past pailletes now here is a long one 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.880
 with cattaneo who reduced practically 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.180
 the disadvantage he had towards 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.840
 of the tv white athlete fair 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.389
 we see in this struggle are their 3bite 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.910
 the trio that practically dictate 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.889
 reads to others 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.359
 detached about thirty seconds at 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.729
 trio head two runners 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.949
 all white Catania alone in his 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:31.319
 vice, however, makes the choice to conduct e 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:36.000
 to face the most dangerous parts 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:38.159
 of the track in the head and tried in 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.409
 all ways to select his two 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.659
 opponents but see right here 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:45.990
 emblematic taken in the middle first third 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:49.050
 country and its longo shooting partner 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.879
 with cattaneo in the middle and you see the sprint 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.729
 is launched but the inconvenience in half 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.800
 straight draw that costs 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.590
 of course the possibility position of 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.199
 victory to card ruinous and neo fall 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.919
 then it is white doublet with loco tones 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:07.289
 in front of town it fell ruinously for 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.930
 johnny cattaneo who will come anyway 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.060
 ranked third it will succeed 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.460
 to get up again even if at this moment 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.650
 he seems unable to do it and will make it 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.169
 he deserved better luck could 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.789
 perhaps undermine the victory with 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.789
 the applause of the public the third place 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.800
 knows remained regions after san genesio in 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.710
 climb was what he had the most 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.800
 the last 20 I knew not fast 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.270
 especially for me than on a climber 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.400
 catania really strong it comes in 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.250
 plain and then also entered leo here in the 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.800
 final we played it in the sprint 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.040
 person flown in front looking pulled 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.360
 the Leonardo sprint and then it happened 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.220
 what happened already every happened 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.950
 I'm not even behind me 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.250
 noticed I only heard noise anyway 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.170
 go for a win after an excellent win 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.340
 almost a month that we didn't have a 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:07.030
 injury therefore satisfied tony longo 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.950
 we heard each other in the microphone 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.590
 cattaneo managed to preserve his 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.210
 third position for 40 seconds virtues of 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.490
 great advantage they had around 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.490
 2 minutes at the time of the fall 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.960
 Hello
