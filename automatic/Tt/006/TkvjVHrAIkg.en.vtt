looking the inbox into the computer

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.220 
looking the inbox into the computer
through<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> USB<00:00:24.150> port<00:00:25.699> from<00:00:26.699> there<00:00:27.230> the

through the USB port from there the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.130 
through the USB port from there the
Avalon<00:00:28.740> will<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:29.039> connected<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:30.679> the<00:00:31.679> inbox<00:00:32.040> to

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
Avalon will be connected to the inbox to

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.170 
Avalon will be connected to the inbox to
the<00:00:34.140> Avalon<00:00:34.559> connected<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:36.120> u-87<00:00:38.000> this<00:00:39.000> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the Avalon connected to the u-87 this is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.619 
the Avalon connected to the u-87 this is
the<00:00:39.300> u-87<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:40.710> these<00:00:41.550> are<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.180> wires<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the u-87 and these are the wires that

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.130 
the u-87 and these are the wires that
are<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.110> connected<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:48.140> our

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
are going to be connected with our

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.979 
are going to be connected with our
cables<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> microphone<00:00:51.270> cable<00:00:51.750> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
cables so the microphone cable is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.680 
cables so the microphone cable is
connected<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:56.100> course<00:00:56.510> we'll<00:00:57.510> turn

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
connected here and of course we'll turn

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:09.540 
connected here and of course we'll turn
this<00:01:01.460> 737<00:01:02.460> or

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.700 

this<00:01:10.550> end<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.330> connected<00:01:12.020> into<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
this end is connected into the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.550 
this end is connected into the
microphone<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.270> other<00:01:17.480> end<00:01:17.750> is<00:01:18.050> going<00:01:18.410> to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
microphone and the other end is going to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.020 
microphone and the other end is going to
go<00:01:18.680> into<00:01:18.860> input<00:01:21.070> microphone<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.310> force<00:01:22.760> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
go into input microphone and force the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.950 
go into input microphone and force the
output<00:01:23.690> from<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.910> 737<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:28.780> connects<00:01:29.780> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
output from the 737 this connects the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.850 
output from the 737 this connects the
u-87<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.760> this<00:01:31.940> is<00:01:32.120> going<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.420> connect<00:01:35.860> line

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
u-87 and this is going to connect line

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.080 
u-87 and this is going to connect line
output<00:01:37.550> this<00:01:38.300> is<00:01:38.510> going<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.750> connect<00:01:39.110> into<00:01:39.260> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
output this is going to connect into the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.530 
output this is going to connect into the
mbox<00:01:41.890> okay<00:01:42.890> we're<00:01:43.760> going<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:43.940> plug<00:01:44.150> this<00:01:44.330> into

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
mbox okay we're going to plug this into

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:53.260 
mbox okay we're going to plug this into
input<00:01:45.020> two<00:01:49.150> there<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.350> course<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.820> inbox

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
input two there and of course the inbox

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.680 
input two there and of course the inbox
will<00:01:53.479> be<00:01:53.570> connected<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.410> computer<00:01:55.690> with

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
will be connected to the computer with

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.920 
will be connected to the computer with
the<00:01:56.810> USB<00:01:56.840> cord<00:01:57.620> of<00:01:58.430> course<00:01:58.700> just<00:01:59.300> plug<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.630> in

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
the USB cord of course just plug that in

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.010 
the USB cord of course just plug that in
to<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.710> computer<00:02:01.420> there<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.410> USB<00:02:03.979> cord

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
to the computer there so the USB cord

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.350 
to the computer there so the USB cord
connects<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.290> inbox<00:02:09.970> line<00:02:10.970> balanced

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
connects the inbox line balanced
