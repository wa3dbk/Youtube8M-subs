he's<00:02:37.460> got<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.730> first<00:02:37.940> side<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.690> this<00:02:38.900> guy<00:02:39.050> has

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
he's got the first side so this guy has

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.140 
he's got the first side so this guy has
a<00:02:39.320> kind<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.160> different<00:02:40.490> looking<00:02:40.670> base<00:02:40.910> but

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
a kind of a different looking base but

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.460 
a kind of a different looking base but
pretty<00:02:41.330> much<00:02:41.390> it's<00:02:41.690> all<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.020> same<00:02:42.230> but<00:02:42.410> he

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
pretty much it's all the same but he

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.050 
pretty much it's all the same but he
doesn't<00:02:42.740> have<00:02:42.860> he<00:02:43.010> more<00:02:43.250> parts<00:02:43.580> thankfully

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
doesn't have he more parts thankfully

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.610 
doesn't have he more parts thankfully
but<00:02:44.510> he's<00:02:44.600> got<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> readout<00:02:45.170> towers<00:02:45.500> this

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
but he's got the readout towers this

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.080 
but he's got the readout towers this
time<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:45.920> let's<00:02:46.040> see<00:02:46.160> how<00:02:46.340> well<00:02:46.610> our<00:02:46.760> troops

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
time so let's see how well our troops

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.850 
time so let's see how well our troops
can<00:02:47.240> do<00:02:47.360> against<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.660> machine<00:02:47.990> guns<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.470> I'm

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860

can do against the machine guns and I'm
gonna<00:02:49.040> go<00:02:49.160> ahead<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.370> place<00:02:49.550> all<00:02:49.760> my<00:02:49.790> troops

food I want to loot now take a look at
what<00:02:57.110> this<00:02:57.260> readout<00:02:57.530> can<00:02:57.740> do<00:02:57.890> okay<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:58.910> can't

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
what this readout can do okay so I can't

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.310 
what this readout can do okay so I can't
exactly<00:02:59.240> remember<00:02:59.540> what<00:02:59.780> happened<00:03:00.200> but<00:03:00.260> I

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
exactly remember what happened but I

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.110 
exactly remember what happened but I
won't<00:03:00.440> go<00:03:00.560> ahead<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.010> rally<00:03:01.250> there<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.730> he

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
won't go ahead and rally there and he

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.250 
won't go ahead and rally there and he
could<00:03:02.270> even<00:03:02.390> attack<00:03:02.750> there<00:03:02.960> for<00:03:03.110> some<00:03:03.230> reason

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
could even attack there for some reason

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.930 
could even attack there for some reason
okay<00:03:03.650> either<00:03:03.770> that<00:03:03.980> was<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.130> glitch<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.610> think<00:03:04.880> it

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
okay either that was a glitch I think it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.700 
okay either that was a glitch I think it
was<00:03:05.270> shooting<00:03:05.630> at<00:03:05.690> me<00:03:05.810> but<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.050> didn't<00:03:06.320> show<00:03:06.530> me

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
was shooting at me but it didn't show me

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.290 
was shooting at me but it didn't show me
because<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.130> know<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.520> did<00:03:07.700> see<00:03:07.880> my<00:03:08.030> troops

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
because you know you did see my troops

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.910 
because you know you did see my troops
actually<00:03:08.930> going<00:03:09.110> there<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.620> know<00:03:09.710> health

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
actually going there you know health

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.350 
actually going there you know health
part<00:03:10.130> was<00:03:10.250> kind<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.460> going<00:03:10.700> down<00:03:10.730> there<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.240> I'm

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
part was kind of going down there so I'm

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.460 
part was kind of going down there so I'm
not<00:03:11.390> sure<00:03:11.540> why<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:11.870> didn't<00:03:12.140> show<00:03:12.260> any

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
not sure why I didn't show any

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.740 
not sure why I didn't show any
machine-gun<00:03:12.890> fire<00:03:13.130> but<00:03:13.610> maybe<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:14.000> replay

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
machine-gun fire but maybe this replay

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.910 
machine-gun fire but maybe this replay
was<00:03:14.930> kind<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.170> buggy<00:03:15.320> or<00:03:15.440> something<00:03:15.739> but<00:03:15.860> his

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
was kind of buggy or something but his

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.130 
was kind of buggy or something but his
 I've<00:03:16.250> fired<00:03:16.459> for<00:03:16.760> sure<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:18.050> know

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
 I've fired for sure and you know

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.660 
 I've fired for sure and you know
that<00:03:18.290> one<00:03:18.440> went<00:03:18.650> down<00:03:18.830> pretty<00:03:18.860> fast<00:03:19.280> because<00:03:19.459> I

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
that one went down pretty fast because I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.699 
that one went down pretty fast because I
was<00:03:19.790> able<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.120> rally<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.540> now<00:03:20.959> sometimes<00:03:21.500> and

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
was able to rally it now sometimes and

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.979 
was able to rally it now sometimes and
you<00:03:21.860> can't<00:03:22.100> get<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.430> lucky<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.030> as<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.870> guys

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
you can't get that lucky and as you guys

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.510 
you can't get that lucky and as you guys
see<00:03:24.200> right<00:03:24.320> now<00:03:24.410> I'm<00:03:24.530> kind<00:03:24.770> of<00:03:24.860> clobbering

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
see right now I'm kind of clobbering

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.830 
see right now I'm kind of clobbering
this<00:03:25.640> guy's<00:03:25.790> base<00:03:26.030> I'm<00:03:26.209> having<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.570> better<00:03:26.720> time

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
this guy's base I'm having a better time

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.690 
this guy's base I'm having a better time
with<00:03:27.200> this<00:03:27.290> guy's<00:03:27.500> base<00:03:27.770> than<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.220> did<00:03:28.489> with<00:03:28.610> the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
with this guy's base than I did with the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.150 
with this guy's base than I did with the
last<00:03:28.850> guys<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:29.450> it's<00:03:30.350> probably<00:03:30.709> because<00:03:30.890> you

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
last guys and it's probably because you

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.680 
last guys and it's probably because you
didn't<00:03:31.340> have<00:03:31.430> cannonballs<00:03:32.090> yet<00:03:32.330> but<00:03:32.570> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
didn't have cannonballs yet but the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.479 
didn't have cannonballs yet but the
readout<00:03:33.020> cows<00:03:33.260> definitely<00:03:33.800> are<00:03:33.980> very<00:03:34.250> very

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
readout cows definitely are very very

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.010 
readout cows definitely are very very
annoying<00:03:34.700> now<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.239> can't<00:03:35.570> really<00:03:35.690> tell<00:03:35.959> if

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
annoying now I can't really tell if

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.530 
annoying now I can't really tell if
these<00:03:36.230> bursts<00:03:36.590> I'd<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:37.670> know<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:38.000> doing<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.330> lot

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
a lot right now in his base because he's

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.500 
a lot right now in his base because he's
verse<00:03:40.370> side<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.760> kind<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.000> slowdown<00:03:41.330> might

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
verse side that kind of slowdown might

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.120 
verse side that kind of slowdown might
rip<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:41.750> guy's<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.110> know<00:03:42.230> machine<00:03:42.800> Oh<00:03:42.920> fire
