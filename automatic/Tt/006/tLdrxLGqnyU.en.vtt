 I just wanted to see you today, Henry. 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.859
 talk of low cost brand below 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.789
 thousand reais based on architecture with the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.640
 intel 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 everyone knows that beat dual core 2 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.420
 quad core core generation best part 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.519
 then came and 3 5 and 7 and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.969
 intel decided in this legislation to place the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.079
 sky brain and dust the dual core pentium 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.360
 in the same pinning of 3 and 5 and 7 which is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.230
 very interesting then we have a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.160
 kit consisting of a rw lg and samsung dvd 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:54.600
 a generic card reader we have an hd 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:58.559
 of 500 sata2 the processor 630 or 620 to 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.960
 motherboard xix was chicken or any 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.199
 brand here we have a gigabyte card 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.689
 a sign is cool and that's a lot 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.240
 interesting in terms of the cost 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.970
 Kingston memory of 4GB RAM can be the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.760
 memory Marxism opposition memory as 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.100
 sure a great pet most was 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.530
 convenient the motherboard stands out by the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.770
 small size and flexibility by 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:30.060
 example we do not have tvi here but we have the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:32.189
 We have no USB output and a board 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.650
 fancier but have with twice 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.509
 sound standard four I left the species 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 two, we do not have parallels neither 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.250
 would be the commercial application 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 store is that it may not be 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.790
 recommended because it will not give it to 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.290
 put a tax person easily 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.960
 can bring brought but not all 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.570
 people what works for you is 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.799
 dental knowledge is the following is the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.079
 low cost overall cabinet was 2 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.710
 240 vacancies 50 but depending on 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.159
 manufacturer of func two neighborhoods 52 base 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.110
 three and a half and if four hd neighborhoods 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.420
 come on talking and motive is one more of the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.369
 that you always machine 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.580
 the benefit lens you can place 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.040
 a video card after it has already expanded 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.810
 this machine or the near future 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.530
 increase the source and place if the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.630
 and toxic video used by 33 5 by 17 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.580
 and the machine will be upgraded during and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.930
 after the period also work here 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.930
