00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
even as you're turning try to kick as

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.559 
even as you're turning try to kick as
high<00:02:34.129> as<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.849> especially<00:02:35.239> if<00:02:35.480> you're

high as you can to especially if you're
real<00:02:35.720> flexible<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.440> looks<00:02:36.620> great<00:02:36.830> if<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.489> can

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
real flexible it looks great if you can

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.759 
real flexible it looks great if you can
get<00:02:37.819> big<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.480> side<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:39.319> makes<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> move

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
get big to the side just makes the move

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.789 
get big to the side just makes the move
more<00:02:39.980> dynamic<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.489> bigger<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.650> if<00:02:42.650> you

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
more dynamic and bigger and if you

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.080 
more dynamic and bigger and if you
struggle<00:02:43.190> try<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.730> break<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.060> down

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
struggle try to just break it down

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.780 
struggle try to just break it down
isolate<00:02:44.690> each<00:02:44.840> part<00:02:45.190> just<00:02:46.190> take<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.340> nice<00:02:46.549> and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
isolate each part just take a nice and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.619 
isolate each part just take a nice and
slow<00:02:47.500> kick<00:02:48.500> with<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.769> right<00:02:48.799> foot<00:02:49.450> kick<00:02:50.450> with

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
slow kick with the right foot kick with

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.789 
slow kick with the right foot kick with
the<00:02:50.720> right<00:02:50.870> foot<00:02:51.640> step<00:02:52.640> on<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.879> right<00:02:53.000> foot

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
the right foot step on the right foot

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.020 
the right foot step on the right foot
kick<00:02:54.799> with<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.040> left<00:02:55.220> foot<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:57.849> jump<00:02:58.849> back<00:02:59.000> to

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
kick with the left foot and jump back to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.349 
kick with the left foot and jump back to
180<00:02:59.599> degrees<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.110> side<00:03:00.519> so<00:03:01.519> just<00:03:01.879> isolate

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
180 degrees to the side so just isolate

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.780 
180 degrees to the side so just isolate
each<00:03:02.690> movement<00:03:03.079> take<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.769> nice<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:03.950> slow<00:03:04.160> and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
each movement take it nice and slow and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.030 
each movement take it nice and slow and
the<00:03:04.849> slower<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.450> train<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.930> move<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.500> faster

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
the slower you train the move the faster

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.069 
the slower you train the move the faster
you're<00:03:07.160> going<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.340> get<00:03:07.459> good<00:03:07.579> at<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.079> you

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
you're going to get good at it and you

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.390 
you're going to get good at it and you
don't<00:03:09.470> have<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.709> big<00:03:09.829> trick<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:10.160> when<00:03:10.280> you're

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400

don't have the big trick is when you're
doing<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.640> turn<00:03:10.879> you<00:03:11.209> can<00:03:11.629> use<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.959> momentum

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
doing the turn you can use the momentum

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.949 
doing the turn you can use the momentum
from<00:03:12.769> your<00:03:12.890> shoulders<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.489> whip<00:03:13.609> you<00:03:13.730> around

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959

feel<00:03:33.739> good<00:03:33.919> with<00:03:34.069> it<00:03:34.220> let's<00:03:34.430> try<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:34.639> half<00:03:34.910> speed

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
feel good with it let's try a half speed

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.670 
feel good with it let's try a half speed
with<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.569> nice<00:03:35.750> slow<00:03:35.959> count<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.380> then<00:03:36.500> we'll<00:03:36.590> do

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
with a nice slow count and then we'll do

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.789 
with a nice slow count and then we'll do
it<00:03:36.799> full<00:03:37.340> speed<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.790> music<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.989> we'll<00:03:39.109> go<00:03:40.150> 1

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
it full speed to the music so we'll go 1

00:03:41.799 --> 00:04:17.529 
it full speed to the music so we'll go 1

2 3 4 ok if you feel comfortable with
the<00:04:25.250> half<00:04:25.400> twist

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
the half twist

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.120 
the half twist
let's<00:04:27.050> try<00:04:27.169> it<00:04:27.229> full<00:04:27.380> speed<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.830> music

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
let's try it full speed to the music

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.830 
let's try it full speed to the music
once<00:04:28.729> you<00:04:28.849> get<00:04:29.000> this<00:04:29.150> down<00:04:29.389> you<00:04:29.599> can<00:04:29.630> try

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
once you get this down you can try

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.300 
once you get this down you can try
another<00:04:30.020> one<00:04:30.229> for<00:04:30.349> lessons<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.860> full<00:04:31.039> twist

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
another one for lessons the full twist

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.550 
another one for lessons the full twist
has<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:32.030> rotating<00:04:32.390> a<00:04:32.419> full<00:04:32.599> 360<00:04:33.289> degrees

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
has you rotating a full 360 degrees

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.860 
has you rotating a full 360 degrees
instead<00:04:33.890> of<00:04:33.979> just<00:04:34.099> 180<00:04:34.460> with<00:04:34.849> each<00:04:34.969> turn

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
instead of just 180 with each turn

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.110 
instead of just 180 with each turn
and<00:04:36.130> if<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.310> need<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.490> little<00:04:37.610> more<00:04:37.699> time<00:04:37.910> just

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
and if you need a little more time just

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.730 
and if you need a little more time just
run<00:04:38.210> through<00:04:38.330> lesson<00:04:38.660> again<00:04:38.900> when<00:04:39.500> you<00:04:39.590> feel

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740
