00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:01.910
 there is no city 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.910
 these days america a dry out of the water 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.780
 but let's imagine for a moment that 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.209
 great day 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.749
 very big 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.079
 me Russian oligarch Gagik secretly 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.590
 prime minister 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.660
 will present paper to dig dollars 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.540
 provide stocks in the world with our valuable goods 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.189
 papers 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.960
 what then will be 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.820
 it would be a very big problem for 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.739
 USA 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:27.900
 and oddly enough 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.439
 for those countries that are trying 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.169
 get rid of st 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.460
 This means that there will be an additional 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.550
 teenager will be available to customers 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.500
 trillions 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.650
 dollars 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.380
 but I could not do this because 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.950
 what 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.440
 these papers depreciated sharply 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.880
 now as if the Japanese do not get 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.270
 Chinese 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.050
 amazing but if i don't have to 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.650
 November is expected to grow as 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.060
 says that 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.320
 In principle, I donâ€™t know what to do with them 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.820
 why not because if 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.989
 present them 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.680
 with one and free 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.620
 this will cause this trip to be 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.620
 they will be even higher 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.410
 as for debt 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.950
 then the choice is by and large so bad 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.810
 or then he on american citizens 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.180
 through and through 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.140
 new delhi still live on a grand scale 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.770
 that politically much 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.840
 more acceptable 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.440
 and ask the rest of the world 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.860
 pay for it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.480
 if you were american 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.760
 politicians how would you do 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.370
 I generally live or work fine 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.079
 there is a lot of people around the mood is great 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.510
 that I am the best 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.730
 to the americans 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.710
 not only Americans but everyone 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.080
 who let the dollar 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.570
 so you this casino came all new 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.200
 the players 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.440
 that was someone in a pair of dollar 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.400
 What do you think Americans are first 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.540
 brought to Iraq and to Afghanistan after 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.380
 occupation 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.620
 food 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.440
 humanitarian aid funds 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.890
 production 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.419
 they brought there dollars 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.419
 their number is so large that since 2004 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.089
 US Treasury has already classified 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.469
 or rather the most curious why 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.749
 when from government and 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.219
 other central banks 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.719
 prefer to be transparent 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.919
 federal reserve suddenly cease 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.849
 publish reports about your actions 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.150
 now you need to go to a special site 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.019
 federal reserve system 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.700
 St. Louis to at least approximately 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.559
 find out these numbers 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.389
 american financier and understand 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.749
 what play 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.339
 but they can't come 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.709
 because 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.529
 this crisis 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.849
 today they are worthless 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.849
 but in the sport its all right with the products 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:02.859
 against the euro, the dollar is already a half 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.909
 times 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.359
 our state's savings which 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.709
 we kept in american valuable 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.819
 securities depreciated by half 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.669
 that means your personal lock 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.629
 who is thousand 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.749
 and as soon as you decide to replace them 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.329
 on euro take 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.529
 informing 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.529
 by 50 percent 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.239
 from Gibson 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.400
 and even if the Americans decide tomorrow 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.469
 raise dollars 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.239
 do you put up with children in mdts 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.669
 as soon as you contacted dollars 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.669
 logged into the casino and you first 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.569
 post scripts 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.569
 and what about our vision he 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.609
 they are not just visitors 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.209
 once came to him well if a person 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.539
 as they say on the housing of the dead 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.719
 trichet 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.719
 it turned out that if nothing unusual 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.190
 what can there start saving money on 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.849
 neve yes there is only 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.610
 well in the 1960s 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.090
 or it will be better to do now if 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.420
 good birth protection 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.420
 this heavy these features 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.319
 it will not really understand nothing 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.559
 have long been employees with us 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.789
 good committee r technology 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.120
 it was me post 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.219
 they can 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.269
 Let and on this island some guys who 

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:03.959
 paid colossal by 

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:06.739
 this fact and even the data is destroyed for 

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.360
 does it print its currency 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.050
 I repeat again Boris and private 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.610
 hands created in 1990 by the way these 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.280
 guys 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.969
 tried united states of america from st 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.189
 in the structure of a private plot central 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:21.759
 the bank did at least three times 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.819
 dollars first american bank was 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.580
 outsiders kansk bank back in 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.539
 nineteenth century as a result in order 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.939
 to make in rf was killed at 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.259
 least three american 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.069
 mother was killed by kim and college was killed he 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.479
 was killed prim 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.419
 Romanyuk him a ticket around the Sannikov 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.259
 bought for what he took from 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.319
 American private banks main 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.319
 source of income 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.749
 in 1913 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.619
 four banking house 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:03.929
 rockefeller jpmorgan and vmware bor money money rotshild 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.219
 by hook or by crook dragged into congress 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:10.009
 and acts of the federal reserve 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.699
 woodrow wilson signed this 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.439
 the law became president 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.689
 due to the fact that his election 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:17.659
 campaign financing those 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.419
 most banking house 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:21.469
 in this way 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.520
 we will be brilliant 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.520
 and grand in its consequences 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.669
 organized according to private principles 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.639
 us corporations 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.629
 settled on some kind of closed 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:34.599
 territories 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.960
 and it turned out the laws of the exclusive right 

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:39.860
 print money 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.210
 and let's country 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.460
 bill of exchange 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.460
 from the process 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.120
 give me control over the issue of money in 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.990
 State and I do not care who will 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.270
 write his laws 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.270
 Rothschild 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:03.680
 I really love 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.759
 but this young aton 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.599
 forte must play tough 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.770
 but she does not hide it 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.770
 but any village is another force 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.129
 so and finance 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:15.099
 there is someone who will play hard with 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:17.999
 america 

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:21.039
 here and not such a science 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:23.699
 there is science math we need so much 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.699
 hands protected 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.240
 she is 

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:39.349
 but
