see<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:01.079> pretty<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> same

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
see that it's pretty much the same

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.369 
see that it's pretty much the same
actually<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> little<00:01:03.780> smaller<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
actually it's a little smaller on the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
actually it's a little smaller on the
you're<00:01:04.949> looking<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.610> front<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.030> again

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you're looking at the front and again

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.810 
you're looking at the front and again
the<00:01:06.420> fin<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.439> big<00:01:07.619> big<00:01:08.280> factor<00:01:08.670> but

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the fin this is a big big factor but

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.980 
the fin this is a big big factor but
then<00:01:09.180> again<00:01:09.299> you're<00:01:09.540> talking<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
then again you're talking about a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.280 
then again you're talking about a
four-hundred-dollar<00:01:10.950> phone<00:01:11.310> versus<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.290> $99

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
four-hundred-dollar phone versus a $99

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
four-hundred-dollar phone versus a $99
smartphone<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.729> seen<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.000> fly<00:01:15.390> off<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
smartphone we seen this fly off the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
smartphone we seen this fly off the
shelves<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.710> cdma<00:01:17.430> version<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:18.000> another

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
shelves for the cdma version on another

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.399 
shelves for the cdma version on another
carrier<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.439> gsm<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.869> i<00:01:21.869> think

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
carrier so this is gsm and i think

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.179 
carrier so this is gsm and i think
they're<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> sell<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> lot<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.100> these

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
they're going to sell a lot of these

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.730 
they're going to sell a lot of these
based<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.610> my<00:01:23.700> first<00:01:24.420> couple<00:01:24.810> days<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.320> looking

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
based on my first couple days of looking

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 
based on my first couple days of looking
at<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.220> i'll<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.119> another<00:01:27.210> 10

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.840 
at it and i'll have this for another 10
days<00:01:28.170> or<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.100> loaner<00:01:29.340> unit<00:01:29.700> for

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
test out the XM music I haven't done

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.749 
test out the XM music I haven't done
that<00:06:17.229> yet<00:06:17.409> I<00:06:17.680> will<00:06:17.919> be<00:06:18.009> doing<00:06:18.159> so<00:06:18.490> because<00:06:18.669> I

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
that yet I will be doing so because I

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.059 
that yet I will be doing so because I
love<00:06:19.060> my<00:06:19.089> music<00:06:19.300> listen<00:06:20.229> to<00:06:20.289> XM<00:06:20.560> all<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.830> time

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.939 
love my music listen to XM all the time
and<00:06:21.779> my<00:06:22.779> thought<00:06:23.349> was<00:06:23.529> that<00:06:23.589> it<00:06:23.800> would<00:06:23.919> not

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
and my thought was that it would not

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.189 
and my thought was that it would not
work<00:06:24.370> too<00:06:24.819> well<00:06:24.849> on<00:06:25.089> this<00:06:25.389> device<00:06:25.659> because

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
work too well on this device because

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.899 
work too well on this device because
this<00:06:26.560> device<00:06:26.919> this<00:06:27.159> is<00:06:27.310> a<00:06:27.339> big<00:06:27.669> difference

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
this device this is a big difference

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.740 
this device this is a big difference
between<00:06:28.180> the<00:06:29.759> cdma<00:06:30.759> version<00:06:31.000> and<00:06:31.389> this

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
between the cdma version and this

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.920 
between the cdma version and this
version<00:06:32.139> this<00:06:32.860> has<00:06:33.099> no<00:06:33.250> 3d<00:06:33.520> Jake<00:06:33.789> now<00:06:34.719> some

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
version this has no 3d Jake now some

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.209 
version this has no 3d Jake now some
people<00:06:35.020> are<00:06:35.199> gonna<00:06:35.289> say<00:06:35.440> oh<00:06:35.589> that's<00:06:35.949> no<00:06:36.190> good

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
people are gonna say oh that's no good

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:37.679 
people are gonna say oh that's no good
it's<00:06:36.520> so<00:06:36.580> good<00:06:36.639> but<00:06:36.969> you<00:06:37.060> know<00:06:37.149> what

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:37.689 
it's so good but you know what

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.039 
it's so good but you know what
people<00:06:38.169> are<00:06:38.229> getting<00:06:38.379> by<00:06:38.619> with<00:06:38.919> no<00:06:39.159> 3g<00:06:39.549> on<00:06:39.699> this

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:40.049 
people are getting by with no 3g on this

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:42.479 
people are getting by with no 3g on this
granted<00:06:41.049> they're<00:06:41.229> doing<00:06:41.499> it<00:06:41.649> because<00:06:41.860> the

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:42.489 
granted they're doing it because the
