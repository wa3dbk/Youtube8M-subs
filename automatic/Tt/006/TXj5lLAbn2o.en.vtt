first<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.550> all<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.850> wanted<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.240> keep<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
first of all I wanted to keep this

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.480 
first of all I wanted to keep this
blonde<00:02:08.610> color<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:10.740> put<00:02:11.040> that<00:02:11.070> up<00:02:11.370> in

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
blonde color here so I put that up in

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.970 
blonde color here so I put that up in
foil<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.510> write<00:02:12.690> use<00:02:12.900> regular<00:02:13.320> tin<00:02:13.620> foil

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
foil I just write use regular tin foil

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.730 
foil I just write use regular tin foil
from<00:02:14.310> your<00:02:14.520> home<00:02:15.410> Reynolds<00:02:16.410> makes<00:02:16.590> this

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
from your home Reynolds makes this

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.990 
from your home Reynolds makes this
really<00:02:16.950> cool

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
really cool

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.660 
really cool
Reynolds<00:02:18.660> wrappers<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:20.040> pop<00:02:20.430> up

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
Reynolds wrappers it's just like pop up

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.000 
Reynolds wrappers it's just like pop up
and<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:21.810> big<00:02:22.110> squares<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> so

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and it's just like big squares of it so

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.080 
and it's just like big squares of it so
it's<00:02:23.190> easy<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.490> don't<00:02:23.610> have<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.850> cut<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
it's easy you don't have to cut it

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.270 
it's easy you don't have to cut it
anything<00:02:24.330> like<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.620> that's<00:02:25.770> what<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.980> used

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
anything like that so that's what I used

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.930 
anything like that so that's what I used
I<00:02:26.640> got<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.720> blonde<00:02:27.990> up<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.709> then<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.610> kind<00:02:29.850> of

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
I got the blonde up and then I kind of

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.610 
I got the blonde up and then I kind of
just<00:02:30.180> folded<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.660> over<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.930> clipped<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.440> and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
just folded it over and clipped it and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.250 
just folded it over and clipped it and
then<00:02:31.770> worked<00:02:32.040> around<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.580> i<00:02:33.110> sectioned<00:02:34.110> my

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
then worked around it i sectioned my

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.710 
then worked around it i sectioned my
hair<00:02:34.500> off<00:02:34.680> into<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.190> three<00:02:35.400> sections<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.630> we

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
hair off into the three sections and we

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.479 
hair off into the three sections and we
kind<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.140> see<00:02:37.610> about<00:02:38.610> where<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:38.970> did<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:40.489> made

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
kind of see about where it did it I made

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.830 
kind of see about where it did it I made
sure<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:41.850> really<00:02:42.150> even<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.540> wasn't

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
sure it was really even so it wasn't

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.570 
sure it was really even so it wasn't
like<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.019> jaggedy<00:02:46.560> hair<00:02:46.769> line<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.190> harder<00:02:47.489> to

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
like a jaggedy hair line it's harder to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.240 
like a jaggedy hair line it's harder to
just<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.120> way<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:50.300> then<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.330> just<00:02:52.250> used

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
just do it that way and then I just used

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.699 
just do it that way and then I just used
a<00:02:53.370> hair<00:02:53.519> tie<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.790> keep<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.480> up<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.900> did<00:02:55.470> that

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
a hair tie to keep it up and did that

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.770 
a hair tie to keep it up and did that
the<00:02:55.980> middle<00:02:56.220> section<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:56.760> well<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.209> then<00:02:57.570> just

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the middle section as well and then just

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.540 
the middle section as well and then just
worked<00:02:57.959> from<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.230> top<00:02:58.560> down<00:02:58.830> because<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.190> was

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
worked from the top down because I was

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.790 
worked from the top down because I was
doing<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.910> lighter<00:03:00.120> color<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.690> top<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.680> if

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
doing a lighter color on the top so if

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.740 
doing a lighter color on the top so if
it<00:03:01.920> led<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.220> love<00:03:03.180> where<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.420> didn't<00:03:03.660> really

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
it led to love where it didn't really

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.970 
it led to love where it didn't really
matter<00:03:03.989> because<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.380> was<00:03:04.470> gonna<00:03:04.590> get<00:03:04.800> covered

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
matter because it was gonna get covered

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.750 
matter because it was gonna get covered
anyway<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> said<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.400> took<00:03:08.519> probably

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
anyway like I said it took probably

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.449 
anyway like I said it took probably
about<00:03:09.019> two<00:03:10.019> hours<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.890> each<00:03:11.010> color<00:03:11.370> just

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
about two hours for each color just

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.340 
about two hours for each color just
those<00:03:11.940> really<00:03:12.269> particular<00:03:12.750> about<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.140> color

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
those really particular about the color

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.430 
those really particular about the color
and<00:03:13.440> everything<00:03:14.600> taking<00:03:15.600> really<00:03:15.870> really<00:03:16.230> tiny

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
and everything taking really really tiny

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.020 
and everything taking really really tiny
sections<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.550> seemed<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.820> work<00:03:17.970> pretty

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
sections but that seemed to work pretty

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.530 
sections but that seemed to work pretty
well<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.590> had<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.519> enough<00:03:21.000> hair<00:03:21.269> color

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
well and I had just enough hair color

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.780 
well and I had just enough hair color
free<00:03:21.900> sections<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.860> if<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.550> have<00:03:23.640> really

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
free sections so if you have really

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.020 
free sections so if you have really
thick<00:03:24.090> hair<00:03:24.360> you're<00:03:24.720> probably<00:03:24.989> gonna<00:03:25.200> want<00:03:25.470> a

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
thick hair you're probably gonna want a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.449 
thick hair you're probably gonna want a
couple<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.450> jars<00:03:28.190> unless<00:03:29.190> you're<00:03:29.370> doing

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
couple of the jars unless you're doing

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.070 
couple of the jars unless you're doing
something<00:03:29.730> like<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.150> am<00:03:30.180> where<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.660> just<00:03:30.870> want

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
something like I am where you just want

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.610 
something like I am where you just want
a<00:03:31.200> little

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
a little

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.399 
a little
each<00:03:32.099> color<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:33.150> last<00:03:33.480> night<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.870> was<00:03:34.200> doing

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
each color so last night I was doing

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.410 
each color so last night I was doing
that<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> got<00:03:35.099> through<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.519> two<00:03:35.700> colors<00:03:36.090> and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
that I got through the two colors and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.690 
that I got through the two colors and
then<00:03:37.019> decided<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:37.769> go<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.010> bed<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.430> sleep

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
then decided to just go to bed and sleep

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.059 
then decided to just go to bed and sleep
on<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:39.000> comes<00:03:39.239> with<00:03:39.420> like<00:03:39.629> a<00:03:39.830> developing<00:03:40.830> cap

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
on it comes with like a developing cap

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.030 
on it comes with like a developing cap
so<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.430> put<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.700> on<00:03:42.290> took<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.409> pillowcase<00:03:43.830> off

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
so I put that on took the pillowcase off

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.880 
so I put that on took the pillowcase off
my<00:03:44.220> pillow<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.940> slept<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.379> way<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.620> I

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
my pillow and slept on it that way so I

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.690 
my pillow and slept on it that way so I
didn't<00:03:47.190> get<00:03:47.310> mess<00:03:48.180> everywhere<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:49.319> morning

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
didn't get mess everywhere this morning

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.300 
didn't get mess everywhere this morning
did<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.909> bottom<00:03:51.329> part<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:52.349> know<00:03:52.799> let<00:03:53.159> that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
did the bottom part you know let that

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.550 
did the bottom part you know let that
just<00:03:53.519> process<00:03:54.000> for<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.329> regular<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.930> know<00:03:55.079> 25

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
just process for the regular you know 25

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.130 
just process for the regular you know 25
to<00:03:55.709> 30<00:03:55.920> minutes<00:03:56.129> and<00:03:56.579> then<00:03:57.239> washed<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.780> all<00:03:57.959> out

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140

the Manic Panic hair dye stay brighter

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.130 
the Manic Panic hair dye stay brighter
and<00:04:08.280> stay<00:04:08.640> longer<00:04:08.970> because<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.660> balances<00:04:10.079> out

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
and stay longer because it balances out

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.670 
and stay longer because it balances out
the<00:04:10.260> pH<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.819> did<00:04:12.329> a<00:04:12.660> half<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> half

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680

hair<00:04:21.060> dye<00:04:21.209> after<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.720> had<00:04:22.019> rinsed<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.500> out<00:04:22.650> until

hair dye after I had rinsed it out until
the<00:04:23.220> water<00:04:23.580> was<00:04:23.760> running<00:04:23.940> clear<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.570> then<00:04:25.260> I

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
the water was running clear and then I

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.100 
the water was running clear and then I
jumped<00:04:26.340> in<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.460> shower<00:04:26.729> and<00:04:27.000> just<00:04:27.090> rinse<00:04:27.930> my

whole hair in cold water
make<00:04:30.539> sure<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:30.840> do<00:04:30.990> it<00:04:31.139> in<00:04:31.260> cold<00:04:31.470> water<00:04:31.560> so

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
make sure you do it in cold water so

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.680 
make sure you do it in cold water so
that<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.400> water<00:04:32.580> or<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.090> colors<00:04:33.389> don't<00:04:33.570> run

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
that the water or the colors don't run

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.110 
that the water or the colors don't run
together<00:04:34.520> otherwise<00:04:35.520> it'll<00:04:35.760> end<00:04:35.970> up<00:04:36.030> looking

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
together otherwise it'll end up looking

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.350 
together otherwise it'll end up looking
muddy<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.840> just<00:04:37.110> end<00:04:37.470> up<00:04:37.590> looking<00:04:37.740> drown<00:04:38.360> but

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
muddy and just end up looking drown but

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.850 
muddy and just end up looking drown but
I<00:04:39.419> was<00:04:39.690> really<00:04:39.840> happy<00:04:40.050> with<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.440> way<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.680> it

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
I was really happy with the way that it

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.219 
I was really happy with the way that it
turned<00:04:41.099> out<00:04:41.389> like<00:04:42.389> I<00:04:42.450> said<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.810> was<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.020> first

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
turned out like I said it was the first

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.740 
turned out like I said it was the first
time<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:44.430> used<00:04:44.520> Manic<00:04:45.060> Panic<00:04:45.240> hair<00:04:45.570> dye

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
time that I used Manic Panic hair dye

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.290 
time that I used Manic Panic hair dye
and<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.770> probably<00:04:47.639> will<00:04:47.820> not<00:04:47.970> be<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.270> last

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
and it probably will not be the last

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.560 
and it probably will not be the last
I'll<00:04:48.690> probably<00:04:49.430> try<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.820> ton<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.240> their<00:04:51.479> other

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
I'll probably try a ton of their other

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.480 
I'll probably try a ton of their other
colors<00:04:51.990> they<00:04:52.200> have<00:04:52.229> a<00:04:52.320> bunch<00:04:52.620> more<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:53.190> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
colors they have a bunch more of the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.940 
colors they have a bunch more of the
amplified<00:04:54.090> version<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:55.020> then<00:04:55.260> they<00:04:55.500> have<00:04:55.710> a

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
amplified version and then they have a

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.510 
amplified version and then they have a
ton<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:56.580> their<00:04:57.270> original<00:04:58.200> version<00:04:58.889> which<00:04:59.160> I

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
ton of their original version which I

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.760 
ton of their original version which I
think<00:05:00.240> it's<00:05:00.510> not<00:05:00.690> supposed<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.050> last<00:05:01.349> as<00:05:01.590> long

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
think it's not supposed to last as long

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.990 
think it's not supposed to last as long
but<00:05:02.099> they're<00:05:02.610> all<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.789> semi-permanent<00:05:03.599> dye

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
but they're all a semi-permanent dye

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.689 
but they're all a semi-permanent dye
they<00:05:06.000> come<00:05:06.240> in<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.660> little<00:05:06.930> jars<00:05:07.199> I<00:05:07.650> think<00:05:08.580> you

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
they come in the little jars I think you

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.279 
they come in the little jars I think you
can<00:05:08.789> buy<00:05:08.880> them<00:05:09.060> at<00:05:09.180> Hot<00:05:09.360> Topic<00:05:09.389> but<00:05:10.020> like<00:05:10.169> I

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
can buy them at Hot Topic but like I

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.779 
can buy them at Hot Topic but like I
said<00:05:10.500> I<00:05:10.530> just<00:05:10.620> got<00:05:10.830> them<00:05:11.099> straight<00:05:11.370> from<00:05:11.550> Manic

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
said I just got them straight from Manic

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.719 
said I just got them straight from Manic
Panic<00:05:11.940> online<00:05:12.650> I<00:05:13.650> believe<00:05:14.099> they<00:05:14.490> were<00:05:14.550> like

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
Panic online I believe they were like

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.650 
Panic online I believe they were like
$18<00:05:15.479> per<00:05:15.780> jar<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.820> so<00:05:17.820> kind<00:05:18.000> of<00:05:18.090> expensive<00:05:18.599> but

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
$18 per jar and so kind of expensive but

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.620 
$18 per jar and so kind of expensive but
definitely<00:05:19.320> well<00:05:19.500> worth<00:05:19.530> it<00:05:20.300> I'm<00:05:21.300> really

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630
