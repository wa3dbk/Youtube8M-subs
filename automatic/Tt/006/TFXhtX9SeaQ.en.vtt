remembering<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.520> apply<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.000> very<00:04:25.150> very<00:04:25.750> thick

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080

remembering to apply it very very thick
you<00:04:26.770> can<00:04:26.979> go<00:04:27.160> across<00:04:27.370> grain<00:04:27.820> but<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.419> need<00:04:28.599> to

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
you can go across grain but you need to

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.480 
you can go across grain but you need to
make<00:04:28.840> sure<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:29.199> finish<00:04:29.560> up<00:04:29.740> with<00:04:29.949> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
make sure that you finish up with the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.810 
make sure that you finish up with the
grain<00:04:31.229> during<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.320> staining<00:04:32.590> process<00:04:32.889> you

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
grain during the staining process you

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.300 
grain during the staining process you
don't<00:04:34.030> want<00:04:34.180> any<00:04:34.300> cross<00:04:34.599> grain<00:04:35.050> marks<00:04:35.500> but

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
don't want any cross grain marks but

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.650 
don't want any cross grain marks but
sometimes<00:04:36.789> you<00:04:36.940> want<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.120> fill<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:37.539> in<00:04:37.599> a

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
sometimes you want to fill it in a

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.730 
sometimes you want to fill it in a
little<00:04:37.780> bit<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:38.259> you<00:04:38.349> can<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.560> little

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
little bit so you can do a little

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.800 
little bit so you can do a little
circular<00:04:39.310> motion<00:04:39.669> if<00:04:39.789> you<00:04:39.910> want<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.720> must

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
circular motion if you want but you must

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.950 
circular motion if you want but you must
finish<00:04:41.410> with<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.220> grain<00:04:42.460> so<00:04:43.389> I<00:04:43.419> can<00:04:43.630> feel<00:04:43.840> that

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
finish with the grain so I can feel that

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.860 
finish with the grain so I can feel that
it's<00:04:44.139> starting<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.560> dry<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.360> want<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.630> move<00:04:46.750> a

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
it's starting to dry so I want to move a

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.290 
it's starting to dry so I want to move a
little<00:04:47.110> bit<00:04:47.289> faster

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300
