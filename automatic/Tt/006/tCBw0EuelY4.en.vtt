00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.730
 to check how well they are coming from 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.470
 avocado I am the aissami and girls like 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.840
 you know I love the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.300
 accessories and I think the bag is a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.430
 ideal complement for any outfit 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.130
 for a long time I had been 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.680
 looking for bones that were easy to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.830
 make sure there was no need to sew 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.460
 and I found some pockets called 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.470
 furoshiki or origami bags are of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.289
 super fashion right now in japan and the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.720
 concept is that you can do your 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.230
 little bag with a piece of cloth without 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.149
 need sewing or gluing machine 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.399
 only based on knots and folds 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.130
 so in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.290
 teach how you can do is not forget 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.600
 stay at the end of the video so that 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.090
 see in our class of the day so 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.850
 let's see the list of materials for 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 make our little bag we need a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.110
 Thick piece of cloth mine is 70 x 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.630
 50 centimeters 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.910
 wooden rings that will be the handles of 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.190
 our bag I bought these that 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.560
 they use to board and they are 5 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.030
 inches in diameter or 12 centimeters 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.940
 approximately 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.310
 First paint the wooden rings of 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.430
 Black color so that they will combine with me 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.250
 fabric then flipped on the fabric where 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.280
 it has no drawing and I take the corners of 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.700
 each side to be able to pass them through 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.630
 We pull the cloth taking care 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.630
 that does not twist 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.490
 and we will do what we press a knot 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.490
 all right 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.659
 and we do another knot 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.960
 we arrange the fabric so that it does not twist 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.890
 and we repeat the same steps 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.890
 at the other end 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.129
 and ready girls, we have our little bag 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:18.069
 origami I also did this in colors 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.069
 spring and the result I loved 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.570
 I hope you liked the result 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.030
 as much as to me the truth is that these 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.860
 little bag they made me very pretty 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.100
 easy to do as they saw no 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.470
 they need not be even glue 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.050
 I decided to use a type of fabric 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.940
 thick so that the pouch was shaped 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.360
 and volume but you can also use 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.730
 other type of fabrics colors textures all 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.310

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.930
