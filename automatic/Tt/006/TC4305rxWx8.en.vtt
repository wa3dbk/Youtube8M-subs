00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.559
 to decorate this bottle we are going to 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.900
 need a glass bottle of what 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.150
 to be 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.099
 to sugar 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:27.400
 glue paints and a brush and with 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.560
 this let's start what we 're going to 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.730
 do 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.980
 is to take the bottle 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.640
 and start covering it with glue 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.640
 pvc 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.280
 little by little 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.790
 be covering it and we're going to start 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.560
 throw the sugar 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.560
 all over the bottle little by little 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.420
 I do it like that 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.680
 Generous glue because so then 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.820
 it will also stay better 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.820
 stuck the sugar 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.200
 and will stay more quantity that is also 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.200
 important 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.939
 for this craft because then to the 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.280
 time to paint it we will be more 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.390
 curious 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.390
 I give it on two sides 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.220
 and you have to start throwing sugar 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.220
 generous everywhere 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.680
 once it is dry 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.840
 the bottle with all the sugar and the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
 glue you see that is super pretty 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.619
 for Christmas to decorate the centers of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.619
 table I for example I have 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.500
 a base with light 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.200
 that will come in handy to put it 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.500
 of adornment of mine as you see 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.450
 but that you appreciate well 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.190
 It illuminates inside and illuminates all 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.190
 the bottle and the effect of sugar 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.650
 that shines is beautiful to decorate 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.060
 Christmas centerpieces solved me 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.050
 I think what I like most is Christmas 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.760
 but good everyone who uses it as 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.070
 as it seems best, I hope that you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.700
 have liked the idea and see you in the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.700
