introduced in vista however you had to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
introduced in vista however you had to
encrypt<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.160> partition<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.300> two

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
encrypt a partition you have to have two

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.810 
encrypt a partition you have to have two
partitions<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> hard<00:00:37.500> drive<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:38.370> was<00:00:38.610> I

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
partitions in the hard drive one was I

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.510 
partitions in the hard drive one was I
the<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.050> booted<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.980> windows

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the first one that booted on windows

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.430 
the first one that booted on windows
seven<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.180> encrypt<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> entire<00:00:43.110> system

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
seven it will encrypt the entire system

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680 
seven it will encrypt the entire system
volume<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.760> includes<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> page<00:00:45.450> files

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690

and<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> hibernation<00:00:46.379> files<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> do

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and the hibernation files so if you do

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.400 
and the hibernation files so if you do
lose<00:00:47.820> your<00:00:48.030> laptop<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.840> fully<00:00:49.079> disc

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
lose your laptop and it's fully disc

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.410 
lose your laptop and it's fully disc
encrypted<00:00:49.980> no<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.850> able<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
encrypted no one will be able to get it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.950 
encrypted no one will be able to get it
and<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:52.559> mean<00:00:52.829> no<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.390> third<00:00:54.629> party

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and I mean no this is for third party

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.500 
and I mean no this is for third party

two factors in occasion plugins such as

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.689 
two factors in occasion plugins such as

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
and actually let me get to that there's
no<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> said<00:01:02.879> no<00:01:03.180> need<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.510> partitioning

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
no like I said no need for partitioning

of a recovery password to be out of the
box<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.280> soon<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> install<00:01:24.270> windows<00:01:24.509> seven

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

box as soon as you install windows seven
if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> encrypt<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.380> hard<00:01:25.619> drive<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.670> need

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
if you encrypt your hard drive you need

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.999 
if you encrypt your hard drive you need
to<00:01:27.000> restore<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.960> recovery<00:01:28.439> key<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to restore that recovery key so you

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249 
to restore that recovery key so you
don't<00:01:29.400> want<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.729> give<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.479> users<00:01:30.659> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
don't want to just give your users this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.429 
don't want to just give your users this
and<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:32.070> them<00:01:32.250> store<00:01:32.549> their<00:01:32.579> third<00:01:33.509> key<00:01:33.780> then

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and have them store their third key then

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.800 
and have them store their third key then
they<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.100> fired<00:01:35.430> hey<00:01:36.210> what's<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.630> password

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
they get fired hey what's your password

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.550 
they get fired hey what's your password
I<00:01:37.350> forgot<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.640> goes<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.000> their<00:01:39.210> data<00:01:39.560> it's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I forgot there goes all their data it's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.069 
I forgot there goes all their data it's
happened<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.450> probably<00:01:42.750> isn't<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> best

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
happened so this probably isn't the best

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.840 
happened so this probably isn't the best
idea<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.130> setup<00:01:44.310> screen<00:01:44.460> looks

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
idea that's what the setup screen looks

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.300 
idea that's what the setup screen looks
like<00:01:45.560> basically<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.829> print<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
like basically you can print the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.100 
like basically you can print the
record-breaking<00:01:47.939> probably<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> best

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
record-breaking probably not the best

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.649 
record-breaking probably not the best
idea<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.680> save<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> file<00:01:50.430> maybe<00:01:51.329> another

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
idea or save it to a file maybe another

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.160 
idea or save it to a file maybe another
encrypted<00:01:52.380> device<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.149> said<00:01:54.210> there

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
encrypted device so like I said there

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.780 
encrypted device so like I said there
are<00:01:55.290> some<00:01:55.500> issues<00:01:55.619> with<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.189> they<00:01:56.430> require

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
are some issues with this they require

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.630

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
solved by using encrypted file system so

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.140 
solved by using encrypted file system so
some<00:02:43.110> issues<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.709> said<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.190> requires<00:02:44.700> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
some issues like I said it requires a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.449 
some issues like I said it requires a
trusted<00:02:46.049> platform<00:02:46.200> module<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.890> your<00:02:47.040> laptop

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
trusted platform module on your laptop

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.819 
trusted platform module on your laptop
so<00:02:47.940> as<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.150> buy<00:02:48.390> any<00:02:48.599> laptops<00:02:49.049> just<00:02:49.440> make<00:02:49.650> sure

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
so as you buy any laptops just make sure

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.550 
so as you buy any laptops just make sure
that<00:02:50.010> includes<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:51.110> usually<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.319> see

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
that includes this usually you don't see

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.520 
that includes this usually you don't see
