 we left ok very well we left 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
 did the first series together but 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 you have to repeat this exercise four 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.100
 or five times do we start get in 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.870
 boards 45 seconds of boards in a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.840
 first time placed your sub costs 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.030
 the shoulders keep the back straight back 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.320
 the number and the loan of the column is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 the reason to the flat and his rivals 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 glutes can still take 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.640
 the option on the knees if you allows 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.789
 of poems work and hold it the 45 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.789
 seconds 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.680
 think each time attract a maximum 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 all at the level of the belly 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.460
 the upper body the lower body 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.900
 keep the neck long in the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.220
 extension of the back and always think about 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.310
 breathe in general at the cuts his 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.750
 breathing on the contrary go we hold 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.710
 it's almost the end we have five 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.860
 seconds we hold three seconds 2 a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.330
 last and on hold warns 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.939
 follow up with the second exercise 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.579
 the climber place your hands just under 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.350
 shoulders always the neck in the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.600
 extension of the back and you can 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 climb your knees towards the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.840
 layers gather the feet at each 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.090
 time in one place 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.189
 so once right and once to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.170
 left the goal is to keep the 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.280
 two angels facing the ground when going up 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.310
 young or on the sides 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.829
 this is the difficulty in the same 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.240
 position that the swimming deaf before we 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.360
 always makes the navel near the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.920
 column and file series 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.110
 so we alternate right and left or 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.310
 as we wanted pink socks and I 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.070

 rising temples arising the chin from 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.080
 the chest always looked towards the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.880
 ceiling 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.770
 to avoid getting hurt at the level of 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.140
 neck when you ride think 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.110
