00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
like the cover do not like the cover of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.650 
like the cover do not like the cover of
all<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> photos<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.210> they<00:00:33.329> could<00:00:33.630> have

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
all the photos that they could have

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.000

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
picked for the cover I think they

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.180 
picked for the cover I think they
settled<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.969> weakest<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.540> don't<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.980> it

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
who's probably most likely to crash and

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.150 
who's probably most likely to crash and
burn<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:20.520> farthest<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.960> fastest<00:04:22.440> they

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160

maybe<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.590> timing<00:04:25.919> does<00:04:26.190> make<00:04:26.400> sense<00:04:26.640> in<00:04:26.850> all

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
maybe the timing does make sense in all

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.379 
maybe the timing does make sense in all
