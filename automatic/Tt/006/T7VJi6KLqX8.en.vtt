00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
with a hammer because I do construction

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
with a hammer because I do construction
I<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:44.789> remodels<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.539> when<00:00:46.379> you're<00:00:46.530> trying<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
I do remodels and when you're trying to

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.889 
I do remodels and when you're trying to
put<00:00:46.950> hurricane<00:00:47.610> metal<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> house<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.570> screw

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
put hurricane metal on a house the screw

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.290 
put hurricane metal on a house the screw
the<00:00:49.079> nails<00:00:49.289> are<00:00:49.590> bigger<00:00:50.489> than<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> holes<00:00:51.059> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the nails are bigger than the holes that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.639 
the nails are bigger than the holes that
they<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:51.750> into<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.199> they're<00:00:52.320> really

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
they have to go into so they're really

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
they have to go into so they're really
hard<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> put<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.370> usually<00:00:54.239> they're<00:00:54.809> only

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
hard to put in and usually they're only

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.869 
hard to put in and usually they're only
this<00:00:55.350> short<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.399> hold<00:00:56.520> them<00:00:56.730> real

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
this short so you have to hold them real

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.549 
this short so you have to hold them real
tight<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.809> end<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.230> hitting<00:00:58.350> your

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
tight and then you end up hitting your

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.170 
tight and then you end up hitting your
fingers<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> lot<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.910> figure<00:01:00.059> out

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
fingers a lot so I can just figure out

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.439 
fingers a lot so I can just figure out
how<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> cut<00:01:00.690> around<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.850> right<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
how to cut around this right here I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
how to cut around this right here I
should<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.290> able<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> take<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.979> whole<00:01:05.189> part

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
should be able to take that whole part

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
should be able to take that whole part
of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> board<00:01:06.000> off<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:09.750> take<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
of the board off and then just take and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.859 
of the board off and then just take and
reconnect<00:01:11.450> these<00:01:12.450> 4<00:01:14.360> 1<00:01:15.360> 2<00:01:15.840> 3<00:01:15.869> 4<00:01:17.119> connections<00:01:18.119> we

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
reconnect these 4 1 2 3 4 connections we

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.530 
reconnect these 4 1 2 3 4 connections we
should<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.170> good<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:20.640> again<00:01:20.759> who

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
should be good to go but then again who

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
should be good to go but then again who
really<00:01:21.990> knows<00:01:22.580> except<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.700> people<00:01:23.939> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
really knows except of the people that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.480 
really knows except of the people that
built<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.299> dang<00:01:24.570> thing<00:01:25.130> let's<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.220> start

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
built the dang thing let's just start

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.800 
built the dang thing let's just start
cutting<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.000> we'll<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.390> happens

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
cutting and we'll see what happens

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.660 
cutting and we'll see what happens
this<00:01:28.320> would<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> whole<00:01:29.100> heck<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.549> lot

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this would be a whole heck of a lot

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.170 
this would be a whole heck of a lot
easier<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:31.020> had<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.560> dremel<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:32.909> so

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
easier if I had a dremel but I don't so

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.960 
easier if I had a dremel but I don't so

like<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.240> wish<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.049> had<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> dremel<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.729> I

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
like I wish I had a dremel and so I

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.450 
like I wish I had a dremel and so I
might<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> lot<00:01:58.200> larger<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:59.420> a<00:02:00.420> tool<00:02:01.460> but

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
might I have a lot larger of a tool but

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.740 
might I have a lot larger of a tool but
it<00:02:02.549> might<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.030> too<00:02:03.090> big

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it might be just too big

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.830 
it might be just too big
I<00:02:04.520> don't<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.119> yeah<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.450> gonna<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.719> too

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
I don't know that yeah it's gonna be too

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.169 
I don't know that yeah it's gonna be too
big<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.200> can't<00:02:07.530> use<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.920> bring<00:02:08.819> all<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
big I can't use that bring all like a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.090 
big I can't use that bring all like a
circular<00:02:09.840> saw

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
circular saw

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.610 
circular saw
ah<00:02:11.330> broke<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.840> guys<00:02:12.990> think<00:02:13.230> it'll<00:02:13.350> tell<00:02:13.590> me

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
ah broke it you guys think it'll tell me

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.950 
ah broke it you guys think it'll tell me
somewhere<00:02:14.190> online<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.850> how<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.120> cut<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> logic

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
somewhere online like how to cut a logic

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.520 
somewhere online like how to cut a logic
board<00:02:16.400> without<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.610> dremel<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.990> may<00:02:19.320> have

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
board without a dremel this may have

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.580 
board without a dremel this may have
been<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> bad<00:02:20.130> idea<00:02:20.720> if<00:02:21.720> there's<00:02:21.930> an<00:02:22.020> easier<00:02:22.470> way

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
been a bad idea if there's an easier way

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.770 
been a bad idea if there's an easier way
to<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.670> what<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.820> say<00:02:24.060> easier<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.510> mean

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
to do this and what I say easier I mean

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.270 
to do this and what I say easier I mean
without<00:02:25.080> cutting<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.560> circuit<00:02:25.890> board<00:02:26.100> but

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
without cutting the circuit board but

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.730 
without cutting the circuit board but
probably<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.270> because<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.690> mean<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.710> I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
probably not because I mean this that I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.970 
probably not because I mean this that I
need<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.460> darn<00:02:30.120> CMOS<00:02:30.780> sensor<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.410> even<00:02:31.710> film

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
need the darn CMOS sensor to even film

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.640 
need the darn CMOS sensor to even film
anything<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:33.270> it's<00:02:33.420> stuck<00:02:33.930> on<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.260> circuit

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
anything and it's stuck on that circuit

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.830 
anything and it's stuck on that circuit
board<00:02:34.860> for<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.340> life<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:36.000> well<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.660> good

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
board for the life of it well the good

board for the life of it well the good
news<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.470> put<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.770> batteries<00:02:38.190> back<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.640> it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
news is I put the batteries back in it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.820 
news is I put the batteries back in it
and<00:02:39.000> tried<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.780> put<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.050> back<00:02:40.230> together<00:02:40.410> real

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
and tried to put it back together real

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.590 
and tried to put it back together real
quick<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.190> see<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.520> still<00:02:41.550> works<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.420> it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
quick to see if it still works and it

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
quick to see if it still works and it
doesn't<00:02:42.780> work<00:02:43.020> anymore

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
doesn't work anymore

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.520 
doesn't work anymore

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
me just make sure that the No

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.310 
me just make sure that the No
all<00:02:56.730> right<00:02:56.940> none<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.270> buttons<00:02:57.450> work<00:02:57.870> but

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
all right none of the buttons work but

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.590 
all right none of the buttons work but
at<00:02:58.500> least<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.830> turns<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.300> let's<00:03:00.300> try<00:03:00.450> that

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
at least it turns on let's try that

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.120 
at least it turns on let's try that
again

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
again

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.360 
again
okay<00:03:02.130> turns<00:03:02.460> on<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.090> far<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:03.540> good<00:03:04.070> exit<00:03:05.070> save

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
okay turns on so far so good exit save

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.280 
okay turns on so far so good exit save
settings<00:03:05.670> yeah<00:03:06.630> sure<00:03:06.840> why<00:03:06.960> not

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
settings yeah sure why not

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.820 
settings yeah sure why not
setting<00:03:07.920> saved<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.790> look<00:03:09.210> it<00:03:10.140> works

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
setting saved and look it works

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.520 
setting saved and look it works
hooray<00:03:11.790> bright<00:03:12.630> lights<00:03:13.400> look<00:03:14.400> at<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:15.200> stuff

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
hooray bright lights look at that stuff

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.070 
hooray bright lights look at that stuff
in<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.010> image<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.150> now<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.330> know<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.810> can<00:03:19.050> be

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
in the image so now I know it can be

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.680 
in the image so now I know it can be
done<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.740> need<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.880> get<00:03:21.090> some<00:03:21.360> tools

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
done I just need to do it get some tools

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.800 
done I just need to do it get some tools
in<00:03:21.900> there<00:03:22.080> near<00:03:22.460> cut<00:03:23.460> away<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:24.000> don't<00:03:24.600> think

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
in there near cut away I don't think

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.210 
in there near cut away I don't think
that<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.200> guys<00:03:25.380> are<00:03:25.440> gonna<00:03:25.710> want<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.010> sit

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
that you guys are gonna want to sit

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.680 
that you guys are gonna want to sit
through<00:03:26.250> me<00:03:26.580> cutting<00:03:27.000> at<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.300> thing<00:03:27.510> because

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
through me cutting at this thing because

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.050 
through me cutting at this thing because
it's<00:03:27.840> gonna<00:03:27.960> take<00:03:28.050> days<00:03:28.700> but<00:03:29.700> don't<00:03:29.820> worry

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
it's gonna take days but don't worry

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.140 
it's gonna take days but don't worry
just<00:03:30.500> like<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> rock<00:03:31.770> candy<00:03:32.280> I'll<00:03:32.490> keep<00:03:33.000> you

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
just like the rock candy I'll keep you

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.050 
just like the rock candy I'll keep you
updated<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:35.130> should<00:03:35.310> see<00:03:35.460> the<00:03:35.550> rock<00:03:35.730> candy

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
updated you should see the rock candy

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.180 
updated you should see the rock candy
now<00:03:36.210> it's<00:03:36.390> kind<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.660> gross<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.140> just<00:03:37.920> broke<00:03:38.130> my

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
now it's kind of gross I just broke my

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.700 
now it's kind of gross I just broke my
string<00:03:38.850> trying<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.390> get<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.810> rock<00:03:40.200> candy<00:03:40.590> out

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710

rock<00:03:43.620> Candy's<00:03:43.950> not<00:03:44.070> turning<00:03:44.370> out<00:03:44.490> so<00:03:44.640> good

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
rock Candy's not turning out so good

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.490 
rock Candy's not turning out so good
second<00:03:45.210> things<00:03:45.390> second<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:45.960> is<00:03:46.140> actually

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the first bottle of Fiji that I put in

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.390 
the first bottle of Fiji that I put in
the<00:03:49.290> freezer<00:03:49.440> pudding

it froze so I'm going to check the

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.610 
it froze so I'm going to check the
second<00:04:00.600> one<00:04:00.690> right<00:04:00.840> now<00:04:01.050> let's<00:04:01.260> see<00:04:01.410> what<00:04:01.530> it

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
second one right now let's see what it

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.810 
second one right now let's see what it
says<00:04:02.000> let's<00:04:03.000> see<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.240> it<00:04:03.330> froze<00:04:03.960> -<00:04:04.260> dang<00:04:04.710> it<00:04:04.890> how

do<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.150> do<00:04:06.540> this

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
do you do this

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.020 
do you do this
I<00:04:07.140> guess<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.860> good<00:04:07.980> news<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.520> that<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.760> know<00:04:08.880> how

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
I guess the good news is that I know how

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.640 
I guess the good news is that I know how
to<00:04:09.210> take<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> flip<00:04:09.870> apart<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.350> put<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.530> back

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
to take a flip apart and put it back

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.890 
to take a flip apart and put it back
together<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:12.530> I<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:14.670> just<00:04:14.940> continue<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.510> cut

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
together so I can just continue to cut

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.780 
together so I can just continue to cut
out<00:04:16.080> until<00:04:16.440> one<00:04:16.680> day<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:16.950> finally<00:04:17.460> get<00:04:17.549> all<00:04:17.670> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
out until one day I finally get all the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.740 
out until one day I finally get all the
way<00:04:17.880> through<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.420> then

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
way through it and then

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.750 
way through it and then
or<00:04:19.989> back<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.590> leads<00:04:21.100> that<00:04:21.340> need<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.670> be

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
or back the leads that need to be

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.320 
or back the leads that need to be
soldered<00:04:22.000> back<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.890> then<00:04:23.890> try<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.430> out<00:04:24.760> watch

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
soldered back and then try it out watch

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.360 
soldered back and then try it out watch
then<00:04:25.630> it<00:04:25.750> won't<00:04:25.870> work<00:04:26.020> I'm<00:04:26.470> not<00:04:26.530> too<00:04:26.920> much<00:04:26.950> of<00:04:27.130> a

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370
