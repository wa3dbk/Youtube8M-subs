00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.730 

so<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:13.799> want<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:15.379> recycle<00:00:16.379> all<00:00:16.560> of

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
so what we want to do is recycle all of

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.910 
so what we want to do is recycle all of
this<00:00:16.920> carbon<00:00:17.779> and<00:00:18.779> get<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.529> into<00:00:19.770> that

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
this carbon and get it into that

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.740 
this carbon and get it into that
decomposition<00:00:20.369> cycle<00:00:21.060> because<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> carbon

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
decomposition cycle because the carbon

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.290 
decomposition cycle because the carbon
is<00:00:21.900> solar<00:00:22.170> energy<00:00:22.680> stored<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.100> biomass<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
is solar energy stored in biomass so the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.120 
is solar energy stored in biomass so the
heat<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.689> feeder<00:00:24.930> gate<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.439> pulley<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.010> we

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
heat the feeder gate is on pulley so we

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.740 
heat the feeder gate is on pulley so we
can<00:00:26.250> raise<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.519> lowered<00:00:27.090> because<00:00:27.449> this

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
can raise it lowered because this

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.630 
can raise it lowered because this
bedding<00:00:27.990> pack<00:00:28.320> builds<00:00:28.769> up<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.130> know<00:00:29.279> three

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
bedding pack builds up you know three

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.700 
bedding pack builds up you know three
four<00:00:29.939> feet<00:00:30.179> deep<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.590> keep

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
four feet deep and so we just keep

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.260 
four feet deep and so we just keep
lifting<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.340> through<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.640> through<00:00:33.120> that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
lifting it up through that through that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.959 
lifting it up through that through that
hey<00:00:33.420> feeding<00:00:33.780> cycle<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:35.130> cows<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.579> course<00:00:35.760> eat

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
hey feeding cycle the cows of course eat

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.119 
hey feeding cycle the cows of course eat
through<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.420> they<00:00:36.930> Trump<00:00:37.260> out<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.620> oxygen

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
through it and they Trump out the oxygen

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.100 
through it and they Trump out the oxygen
so<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.370> whole<00:00:38.520> bedding<00:00:38.910> pack<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.329> actually

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
so this whole bedding pack is actually

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.040 
so this whole bedding pack is actually
fermenting<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.370> zero<00:00:41.570> outside<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
fermenting so when it's zero outside you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.660 
fermenting so when it's zero outside you
know<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.530> nice<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.890> warm<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.399> 50

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
corn then ferments so that when the cows

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.740 
corn then ferments so that when the cows
come<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> spring<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:51.240> turn<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
come out in the spring we turn in the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.030 
come out in the spring we turn in the
pig<00:01:51.960> Raiders

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
pig Raiders

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.030 
pig Raiders
now<00:01:54.940> our<00:01:55.210> pigs<00:01:55.660> have<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.050> big<00:01:56.350> sign<00:01:56.650> on<00:01:56.680> their

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
now our pigs have a big sign on their

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.340 
now our pigs have a big sign on their
forehead<00:01:57.580> will<00:01:57.790> work<00:01:58.060> for<00:01:58.330> corn<00:01:58.600> all<00:01:59.200> right

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
forehead will work for corn all right

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.700 
forehead will work for corn all right
and<00:01:59.710> so<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.730> pigs<00:02:01.030> then<00:02:01.300> go<00:02:01.570> in<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.080> seat<00:02:02.470> this

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
and so the pigs then go in and seat this

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.100 
and so the pigs then go in and seat this
fermented<00:02:03.250> corn<00:02:03.730> in<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.150> bedding<00:02:04.390> pack<00:02:04.780> and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
fermented corn in the bedding pack and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.450 
fermented corn in the bedding pack and
stir<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:05.980> all<00:02:06.190> up<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:07.750> aeration<00:02:08.710> aerobic

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
stir it all up like aeration aerobic

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.030 
stir it all up like aeration aerobic
okay<00:02:09.910> Pig<00:02:10.240> aeration<00:02:10.810> like<00:02:11.230> Jane<00:02:11.530> Fonda

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
okay Pig aeration like Jane Fonda

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.340 
okay Pig aeration like Jane Fonda
aerobics<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.970> know<00:02:13.090> Jane<00:02:13.360> Fonda<00:02:13.780> left<00:02:14.020> left

goes<00:02:20.960> on<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.410> little<00:02:21.530> bit<00:02:21.770> all<00:02:22.010> right<00:02:24.400> so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
goes on you a little bit all right so

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.430 
goes on you a little bit all right so
you<00:02:25.490> say<00:02:25.940> you've<00:02:26.120> got<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.600> you've<00:02:26.810> got<00:02:26.930> this

the pigs are doing all the work why is
it<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.500> farms<00:02:33.950> don't<00:02:34.160> like<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.430> do

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
it that farms don't like to do

aeration<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.190> stuff<00:02:43.430> when<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:43.910> let<00:02:44.150> animals

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
aeration and stuff when we let animals

do<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.050> work<00:02:45.310> suddenly<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.460> profit

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
do the work suddenly the profit

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.270 
do the work suddenly the profit
potential<00:02:47.330> becomes<00:02:47.780> sighs<00:02:48.110> neutral<00:02:48.500> because

potential becomes sighs neutral because

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.890 
potential becomes sighs neutral because
you<00:02:49.550> don't<00:02:49.730> have<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:50.030> recapitalize<00:02:50.870> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
you don't have to recapitalize the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.470 
you don't have to recapitalize the
infrastructure<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:52.340> wats<00:02:52.670> rusts<00:02:53.300> and

infrastructure that wats rusts and

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.130 
infrastructure that wats rusts and
appreciates<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.570> can<00:02:56.690> make<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.930> same

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
appreciates so you can make the same

appreciates so you can make the same
profit<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.680> two<00:02:57.920> arms<00:02:58.160> as<00:02:58.400> five<00:02:58.610> hugs<00:02:58.850> as<00:02:59.060> a

profit on two arms as five hugs as a
hundred<00:02:59.270> hogs<00:02:59.570> and<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.570> scalability<00:03:02.570> of

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
hundred hogs and so the scalability of

hundred hogs and so the scalability of
the<00:03:03.200> infrastructure<00:03:03.890> leaves<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.910> picture

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
the infrastructure leaves the picture

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.990 
the infrastructure leaves the picture
suddenly<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.770> profit<00:03:07.250> potential<00:03:07.670> is

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
suddenly the profit potential is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.810 
suddenly the profit potential is
completely<00:03:08.780> sighs<00:03:09.410> neutral<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.400> other<00:03:10.520> thing

completely sighs neutral the other thing

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.850 
completely sighs neutral the other thing
that<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:11.090> does<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.630> course<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.680> it

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
that this does of course is that it

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.100 
that this does of course is that it

we grow in faster fatter bigger cheaper
that's<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.220> only<00:03:52.550> question<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.239> we

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
that's the only question and we

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.170 
that's the only question and we
