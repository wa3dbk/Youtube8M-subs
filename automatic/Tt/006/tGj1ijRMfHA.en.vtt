there<00:02:42.050> especially<00:02:42.170> when<00:02:42.800> like<00:02:43.610> on<00:02:43.790> lessers

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
there especially when like on lessers

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.080 
there especially when like on lessers
and<00:02:44.630> these<00:02:45.470> morphs<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:46.370> take<00:02:46.640> away<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
and these morphs that take away the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.500 
and these morphs that take away the
belly<00:02:48.019> patterning<00:02:49.030> bananas<00:02:50.030> obviously<00:02:50.360> one

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
belly patterning bananas obviously one

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.300 
belly patterning bananas obviously one
of<00:02:50.540> them<00:02:50.830> how<00:02:51.830> can<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.010> tell<00:02:52.190> if<00:02:52.250> it's

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
of them how can you tell if it's

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.470 
of them how can you tell if it's
yellow-bellied<00:02:52.820> he's<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.150> well<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.390> know

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
yellow-bellied he's like well I know

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.210 
yellow-bellied he's like well I know
that<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.810> bread<00:02:54.380> my<00:02:54.500> ivory<00:02:55.239> -<00:02:56.239> my<00:02:56.890> pastel<00:02:57.890> banana

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
that I bread my ivory - my pastel banana

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.590 
that I bread my ivory - my pastel banana
so<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.459> know<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.850> this<00:02:58.970> one<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.390> yellow

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
so I know that this one is a yellow

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.160 
so I know that this one is a yellow
belly<00:02:59.870> fat<00:03:00.080> banana<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:02.120> he<00:03:02.300> said<00:03:02.540> but<00:03:02.720> when<00:03:02.989> you

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
belly fat banana so he said but when you

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.300 
belly fat banana so he said but when you
look<00:03:03.320> at<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.530> clutch<00:03:03.739> obviously<00:03:04.190> you're

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
look at the clutch obviously you're

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.710 
look at the clutch obviously you're
going<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.489> see<00:03:04.700> subtle<00:03:05.030> differences<00:03:05.570> and

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
going to see subtle differences and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.810 
going to see subtle differences and
those<00:03:05.840> subtle<00:03:06.560> differences<00:03:07.070> if<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.640> can

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
those subtle differences if you can

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.280 
those subtle differences if you can
compare<00:03:08.150> them<00:03:08.239> across<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.690> board<00:03:09.019> you'll

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
compare them across the board you'll

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.220 
compare them across the board you'll
you'll<00:03:10.040> know<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.340> those<00:03:10.489> are<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.930> subtle

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
you'll know that those are this subtle

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.580 
you'll know that those are this subtle
marks<00:03:12.470> inside<00:03:12.860> those<00:03:14.320> inside<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.350> other

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
marks inside those inside the other

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.270 
marks inside those inside the other
morph<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:17.110> obviously<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.320> wonderful<00:03:19.100> snake

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
morph so obviously a wonderful snake

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.170 
morph so obviously a wonderful snake
here<00:03:20.860> very<00:03:21.860> beautiful<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:23.829> as<00:03:24.829> is<00:03:25.579> customary

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
here very beautiful and as is customary

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.289 
here very beautiful and as is customary
over<00:03:26.480> here<00:03:26.720> whenever<00:03:27.290> we<00:03:27.470> get<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> new<00:03:27.799> animal

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
over here whenever we get a new animal

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.580 
over here whenever we get a new animal
we<00:03:29.299> set<00:03:29.510> them<00:03:29.660> up<00:03:29.750> with<00:03:29.780> all<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.140> information

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
so I'll put 2012 F for female

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.120 
so I'll put 2012 F for female
I'll<00:03:55.190> give<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.460> a<00:03:55.550> three<00:03:55.880> digit<00:03:56.830> each<00:03:57.830> morph

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
I'll give it a three digit each morph

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.350 
I'll give it a three digit each morph
gets<00:03:58.310> three<00:03:58.550> digits<00:03:58.880> unless<00:03:59.060> it's<00:03:59.270> already

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
gets three digits unless it's already

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.290 
gets three digits unless it's already
has<00:03:59.630> its<00:03:59.840> own<00:03:59.960> abbreviation<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.880> ban<00:04:01.880> for

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
has its own abbreviation to ban for

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.160 
has its own abbreviation to ban for
banana<00:04:03.400> yellow<00:04:04.400> belly<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:04.970> since<00:04:05.900> this<00:04:06.020> is

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
banana yellow belly and since this is

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.080 
banana yellow belly and since this is
the<00:04:06.200> only<00:04:06.350> one<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:06.740> we<00:04:06.950> got<00:04:07.070> from<00:04:07.160> 2012<00:04:07.970> we

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
the only one that we got from 2012 we

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:16.770 
the only one that we got from 2012 we
put<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.450> 1<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:09.680> now<00:04:10.550> I<00:04:10.910> always<00:04:11.540> like<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.840> do<00:04:12.050> this

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.090 

and<00:04:17.780> this<00:04:17.930> really<00:04:18.200> comes<00:04:18.410> in<00:04:18.590> play<00:04:18.769> when<00:04:18.980> it's

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
and this really comes in play when it's

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.550 
and this really comes in play when it's
when<00:04:19.370> it's<00:04:19.400> my<00:04:19.670> snake<00:04:21.610> but<00:04:22.610> I<00:04:22.850> know<00:04:23.300> for<00:04:23.510> I<00:04:23.840> know

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
when it's my snake but I know for I know

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.100 
when it's my snake but I know for I know
what<00:04:25.220> these<00:04:25.340> were<00:04:25.610> but<00:04:25.880> they're<00:04:26.450> not<00:04:26.600> coach

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
what these were but they're not coach

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.720 
what these were but they're not coach
that<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.410> have<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.010> they're<00:04:28.280> not<00:04:28.340> codes<00:04:28.610> that

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
that I have so they're not codes that

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.510 
that I have so they're not codes that
apply<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:29.030> me<00:04:29.180> so<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.360> always<00:04:29.510> just<00:04:29.750> fill<00:04:30.020> in<00:04:30.140> na

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
apply to me so I always just fill in na

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.130 
apply to me so I always just fill in na
when<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.610> produce<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:32.150> write<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.690> mother<00:04:32.990> and

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
when I produce I write the mother and

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.840 
when I produce I write the mother and

the father down just for I don't cross

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:42.160 
the father down just for I don't cross
genetics<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:36.340> then<00:04:39.940> acquired<00:04:40.940> then<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:41.930> got

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
genetics and then acquired then I got

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:55.460 
genetics and then acquired then I got

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
sometimes the PVC warps they're so small

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.999
