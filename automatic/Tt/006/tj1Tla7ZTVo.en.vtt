pretty much looks like oil so much rust

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.459 
pretty much looks like oil so much rust
in<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.449> orange<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.050> actually

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
in and it's so orange that actually

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.619 
in and it's so orange that actually
looks<00:00:55.649> black<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:57.000> we're<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> hook<00:00:57.449> it

right here is bad enough to where

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
right here is bad enough to where
there's<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> lot<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.119> rust<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> deposits<00:01:10.140> of

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
there's a lot of rust and deposits of

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.420 
there's a lot of rust and deposits of
stuff<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.590> came<00:01:10.740> out<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> use

stuff that came out so I'm going to use

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.399 
stuff that came out so I'm going to use
some<00:01:11.670> radiator<00:01:12.450> flush<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.110> had<00:01:13.229> laying

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
some radiator flush that I had laying

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.969 
some radiator flush that I had laying
around<00:01:14.479> reconnect<00:01:15.479> your<00:01:16.290> radiator<00:01:16.920> overflow

into the radiator fill it with water and

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.840 
into the radiator fill it with water and
then<00:01:25.530> run<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> temperature<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.729> we're

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
then run it up to temperature and we're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.210 
then run it up to temperature and we're
going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> add<00:01:27.180> temperature<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:28.140> 10<00:01:28.860> minutes

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
going to add temperature for 10 minutes

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.770 
going to add temperature for 10 minutes
with<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.920> heat<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> way<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.579> with<00:01:33.090> full

with water and flush it one more time
before<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.009> add<00:01:53.189> coolant<00:01:55.009> once<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
before you add coolant once you get a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.530 
before you add coolant once you get a
fill<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.610> water<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.180> radiator

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
fill with water and have the radiator

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.120 
fill with water and have the radiator
flush<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.259> want<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.469> reinstall<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
flush in there you want to reinstall the

flush in there you want to reinstall the
radiator<00:01:59.909> cap<00:02:00.740> fire<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> up<00:02:02.040> let<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.460> run<00:02:02.640> for

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
radiator cap fire it up let it run for

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:15.310 
radiator cap fire it up let it run for
10<00:02:02.969> minutes<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.450> said<00:02:03.630> before

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.900 

it's<00:02:16.320> been<00:02:16.530> running<00:02:16.770> at<00:02:17.130> operating

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
it's been running at operating

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.950 
it's been running at operating
temperature<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.930> ten<00:02:19.110> minutes<00:02:19.290> now<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.750> heat

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
temperature for ten minutes now the heat

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.060 
temperature for ten minutes now the heat
on<00:02:22.110> full-blast

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
on full-blast

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.350 
on full-blast
so<00:02:23.880> then<00:02:24.150> shut<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.480> off<00:02:24.690> let<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.590> cool<00:02:25.830> down<00:02:26.360> pop

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
so then shut it off let it cool down pop

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.150 
so then shut it off let it cool down pop
off<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:27.810> bottom<00:02:28.110> radiator<00:02:28.470> hose<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.010> see

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
off that bottom radiator hose and see

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.320 
off that bottom radiator hose and see
what<00:02:29.280> we<00:02:29.340> got<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.640> deal<00:02:29.790> with<00:02:32.150> now<00:02:33.150> I'm<00:02:33.210> going

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
what we got to deal with now I'm going

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.940 
what we got to deal with now I'm going
to<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:33.450> ahead<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.720> pop<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:33.930> bottom<00:02:34.530> radiator

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
to go ahead and pop that bottom radiator

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.750 
to go ahead and pop that bottom radiator
hose<00:02:35.250> off

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
hose off

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.400 
hose off
I<00:02:35.790> left<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.330> vice<00:02:36.510> grips<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:36.960> just<00:02:37.200> because<00:02:37.350> I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
I left the vice grips on just because I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.540 
I left the vice grips on just because I
don't<00:02:37.470> want<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.800> take<00:02:37.920> them<00:02:38.070> off<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.250> put<00:02:38.460> it

everything that there's no chance it'll

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.190 
everything that there's no chance it'll
leak<00:03:11.480> then<00:03:12.480> you're<00:03:12.600> going<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.810> want<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:12.960> top

leak then you're going to want to top
off<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.590> radiator<00:03:13.620> fluid<00:03:14.750> 50/50<00:03:15.750> mix<00:03:15.960> if<00:03:16.140> you

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
off the radiator fluid 50/50 mix if you

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.320 
off the radiator fluid 50/50 mix if you
get<00:03:16.380> full<00:03:16.560> concentrate<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.490> comes<00:03:17.670> 50/50

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
get full concentrate if it comes 50/50

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.510 
get full concentrate if it comes 50/50
just<00:03:18.510> pour<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.750> right<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:19.250> make<00:03:20.250> sure<00:03:20.280> you're

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
just pour it right in make sure you're

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.180 
just pour it right in make sure you're
over<00:03:20.760> full<00:03:20.970> lines<00:03:21.240> hooked<00:03:21.480> up<00:03:21.920> then<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.040> want

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
over full lines hooked up then you want

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.610 
over full lines hooked up then you want
to<00:03:23.280> fill<00:03:23.460> your<00:03:23.610> overflow<00:03:24.320> between<00:03:25.320> the

few hundred miles and then top off your
overflow<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:30.930> need<00:03:31.110> be<00:03:32.390> since<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.540> normal

flush didn't work I'm going to try
adding<00:03:35.580> some<00:03:35.610> CLR<00:03:36.270> with<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.570> water<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.960> do

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
adding some CLR with the water and do

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.720 
adding some CLR with the water and do
the<00:03:37.170> same<00:03:37.350> thing<00:03:37.650> see<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.340> works<00:03:38.550> any

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
the same thing see if that works any

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
the same thing see if that works any
better<00:03:40.280> after<00:03:41.280> about<00:03:41.490> six<00:03:41.880> flushes<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.510> water

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750

and two flushes with CLR this is the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.890 
and two flushes with CLR this is the
result

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
result

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.350

you see is just the CLR itself now let

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.370 
you see is just the CLR itself now let
me<00:03:57.450> show<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:57.630> what<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.900> looked<00:03:58.050> like<00:03:58.110> when<00:03:58.350> we

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
me show you what it looked like when we
