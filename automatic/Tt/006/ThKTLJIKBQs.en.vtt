00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 He says 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.990
 Now that the people are here, we are 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.420
 new tutorial and good that I'm going to 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.039
 teach now now I am going to teach you 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.800
 how to have a minecraft skin 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:31.150
 and that others can see it without 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.000
 be premium or be you have a skin 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.130
 you go to a server and see that skin 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.310
 do not 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.940
 obviously there is a disadvantage of this 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.600
 they have many skin to choose from but 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.360
 it's not necessarily the one you want 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.399
 I do not know if you explain me well let's 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.019
 start to start we need to go 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.930
 to the page that I left in the 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.530
 description 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.610
 and this will look like this 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.190
 you have to go if you insert if not 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.589
 I just leave in the description 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.690
 and as we can see there are many skins 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.670
 you will ask yourself good and this what 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.220
 Well, it's the skins that we can 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.090
 choose as we can see here we have 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.250
 up to the memory but that once 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.800
 being here we are going to go to proust 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.400
 and as we can see there are four hundred 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.180
 eighty-three thousand 473 pages so that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.120
 It really is very varied 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.460
 but we can only occupy those that are 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.190
 here another disadvantage is that we can not 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.160
 use our name that we 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.280
 We want to like that, I want to put one on 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.860
 I can wear it if my name is pancho and 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.590
 I want my profile to be pancho is not going 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.110
 to be able because because he already explains them 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.020
 beta or that we have to choose one of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.380
 everyone who is here 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.070
 in this case I am going to choose 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.070
 I dont know 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.299
 we should not look for one 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.650
 that is a penguin we simply give them 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.290
 come on and we click 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.220
 and as we can see he does not know what's coming 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.220
 being let's say the preview of it 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.070
 of this kind we do not see it 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.530
 here we see how it is from behind and from 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.440
 front and this is the link but good what 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.470
 that is not what we care about what 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.660
 we care is this that is here 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.030
 in this case it's power 526 ok let's see 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.600
 how it works in this case we're going to 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.600
 open the minecraft 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.220
 in this case I have already put a name of 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.100
 random with this name me so 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.660
 say it 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.660
 and let's say you enter the minecraft 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.170
 and we wait for it to start 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.130
 and once inside today we're going to start a 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.540
 alone here 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.540
 just let's start 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.940
 what are we going to give him 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.390
 will load tantito 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.300
 although I already charge 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.640
 is loading 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.110
 but good as we can see is the skin 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.160
 normal steve that is the one that would have 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.569
 any non-premium user 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.460
 and now 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.300
 let's go to the page 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.840
 let's copy the name 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.840
 creates 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.440
 as they are called craft 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.350
 and instead of the name that would be 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.139
 which you want to put, let's put the 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.440
 what 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:25.230
 the one who comes there 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.230
 in the skin now let's go 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.530
 wait for me to load 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:38.560
 you you you you you you you here we go we are going to 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.780
 enter the world 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.930
 let's wait for the orangutan to load 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.970
 if they achieve drop naught a note 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.970
 and getting that I already charge 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.340
 and how can we see both in the hand 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.669
 you can see already the skin is the penguin 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.669
 we already saw it 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.940
 and how did I tell you if you only see it here 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.920
 obviously they move on the servers 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.940
 what are we going to try another one so that they see 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.910
 that works with everyone 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.390
 obviously many many times the other 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.290
 what is regular in known servers 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:25.060
 these names are already registered 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.800
 several times then what will happen 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.280
 that the server is not going to allow you 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.200
 start with that skin name because 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.630
 probably someone else had already 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.630
 put in that case you will have to choose 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.870
 another but it does not matter or there is a lot 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.870
 variety 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.390
 well 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.580
 nothing else is not 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.600
 if it does not work for you, you can try another one and 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.700
 A) Yes 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.470
 by the rules tell me the servers 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.950
 known because where the 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.750
 most people 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.960
 in this case we will choose to master 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.960
 chief 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.759
 ok here is the name 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.120
 let's copy it 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.409
 let's open the minecraft 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.470
 and we are going to paste 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.790
 but there is a space 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.220
 as a sitting 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.530
 but do not worry as I said 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.350
 there is a lot of variety of the page so 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.480
 if it does not work for you, look for another one 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.830
 Sometimes he himself is with different 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.070
 names can then search 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.150
 simply the same 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.280
 but start it with another name 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.920
 As I tell you, the disadvantage is that 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.350
 you can not use your name that you want 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.040
 as I said wider system you can not 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.870
 put pancho 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.230
 you have to use the one that comes determined 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.570
 mind for that 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:00.330
 As you can see, we are already here 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:05.710
 we have a super master chief 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:07.900
 and as you can see, they work a hundred percent 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.860
 obviously I tell you that what happens in 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:15.310
 some servers but that is minimum 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.979
 or as you said in the best known and 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.340
 usually in the hunger games 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:23.160
 it's usually where it goes most 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.670
 it will be the error 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:29.130
 and well I suppose I hope that 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:32.400
 I have served them and later I left them 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.820
 a tutorial like on how to do that 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:39.210
 others see your skin without being premium and 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:41.820
 with your name and apart the skin that you 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.860
 you want or that you upload but good 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.110
 that will be another tutorial afterwards 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.260
 we liked 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.260
 bye
