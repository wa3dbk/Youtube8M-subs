evil Jonah I actually don't know his
real<00:00:20.660> name<00:00:20.899> but<00:00:21.200> I'm<00:00:21.380> just<00:00:21.560> gonna<00:00:21.739> assume<00:00:21.919> it

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
real name but I'm just gonna assume it

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.249 
real name but I'm just gonna assume it
something<00:00:22.550> like<00:00:22.669> that<00:00:22.849> so<00:00:23.329> first<00:00:23.809> of<00:00:23.960> all<00:00:24.050> I

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
something like that so first of all I

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.650 
something like that so first of all I
guess<00:00:24.710> what<00:00:25.070> do<00:00:25.130> we<00:00:25.220> want<00:00:25.399> to<00:00:25.489> do<00:00:25.669> is<00:00:25.939> go<00:00:26.360> all

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
guess what do we want to do is go all

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.720 
guess what do we want to do is go all
the<00:00:26.899> way<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.200> top<00:00:27.380> here<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:27.739> then<00:00:28.309> let<00:00:28.579> out

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
the way to the top here and then let out

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.409 
the way to the top here and then let out
our<00:00:28.759> lightsaber<00:00:29.630> like<00:00:29.809> that<00:00:30.079> boom<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:31.419> pyram

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419
