00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
cutter like slowly moves through the map

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
cutter like slowly moves through the map
and<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> moves<00:01:16.110> almost<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:17.009> an<00:01:17.130> arc

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it just you know kind of falls towards

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.179 
it just you know kind of falls towards
the<00:01:24.210> ground<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.259> ends<00:01:25.619> once<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.009> touch<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
beams of lasers or beams of energy out

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.980 
beams of lasers or beams of energy out
to<00:01:31.439> each<00:01:31.829> side<00:01:32.250> horizontally<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.750> kind<00:01:33.960> of

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
to each side horizontally and it kind of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.569 
to each side horizontally and it kind of
like<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.290> floats<00:01:34.710> through<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> map<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
like you know floats through the map and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.910 
like you know floats through the map and
every<00:01:36.060> single<00:01:36.540> zombie<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> touches<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
every single zombie that that touches it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.160 
every single zombie that that touches it
does<00:01:38.400> damage<00:01:38.670> too<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.720> absolutely

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
does damage too which is just absolutely

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.810 
does damage too which is just absolutely
insane<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.340> something<00:01:41.700> we're

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
insane so it's not like something we're

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.460 
insane so it's not like something we're
like<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.270> goes<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.780> touches<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.259> zombie

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
like it goes and it touches one zombie

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.469 
like it goes and it touches one zombie
then<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.829> quits<00:01:44.040> no<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.640> goes<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> entire

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
then it quits no it goes to that entire

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.660 
then it quits no it goes to that entire
room<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> any<00:01:46.290> zombie<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.250> room<00:01:47.490> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
room and any zombie in that room is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.730 
room and any zombie in that room is
gonna<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.240> affected<00:01:48.780> by<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.049> beam<00:01:49.290> which<00:01:49.590> is

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
gonna be affected by that beam which is

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
gonna be affected by that beam which is

keep you know kind of increasing its

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.460 
keep you know kind of increasing its
power<00:02:45.299> it's<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.079> gonna<00:02:46.170> be<00:02:46.319> like<00:02:46.410> a

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
power it's just gonna be like a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.110 
power it's just gonna be like a
hitmarker<00:02:46.950> machine<00:02:47.370> almost<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
hitmarker machine almost like the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.059 
hitmarker machine almost like the
microwave<00:02:48.450> gun<00:02:48.720> was<00:02:48.930> but<00:02:49.170> if<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.500> stay<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.709> top

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
microwave gun was but if you stay on top

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.220 
microwave gun was but if you stay on top
of<00:02:50.099> them<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:51.360> think<00:02:51.569> up<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:51.959> around

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
of them then I think up to like around

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.220 
of them then I think up to like around
17<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.250> was<00:02:53.280> still<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.849> one-hit<00:02:54.480> kill<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:54.959> all

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
17 it was still a one-hit kill on all

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.449 
17 it was still a one-hit kill on all
the<00:02:55.410> Somme<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.799> think<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.040> was<00:02:56.129> like<00:02:56.220> mark

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
the Somme and I think it was like mark

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.479 
the Somme and I think it was like mark
like<00:02:56.700> 15<00:02:57.510> or<00:02:57.660> 16<00:02:57.840> at<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.260> point<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.069> was

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
like 15 or 16 at that point so it was

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.490 
like 15 or 16 at that point so it was
still<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> one-hit<00:03:00.299> kill<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.690> every<00:03:01.110> single<00:03:01.440> one

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
still a one-hit kill on every single one

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.990 
still a one-hit kill on every single one
of<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.709> zombies<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:02.129> you<00:03:02.190> literally<00:03:02.489> could

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
of the zombies so you literally could

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.210 
of the zombies so you literally could
get<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> fifty<00:03:03.870> zombie<00:03:04.260> train<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.829> turn

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
get like a fifty zombie train going turn

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.580 
get like a fifty zombie train going turn
around<00:03:05.400> shoot<00:03:05.849> one<00:03:06.120> bullet<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.540> every<00:03:07.260> single

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
around shoot one bullet and every single

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.080 
around shoot one bullet and every single
one<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.769> them<00:03:07.980> would<00:03:08.129> be<00:03:08.280> dead<00:03:08.310> which<00:03:08.730> was<00:03:08.940> just

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
one of them would be dead which was just

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.089 
one of them would be dead which was just
absolutely<00:03:09.599> insane<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.290> gun<00:03:10.440> like<00:03:10.560> it's
