00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.000 

mean<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.080> engine<00:01:00.350> definitely<00:01:00.680> sounds

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
mean the engine definitely sounds

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.530 
mean the engine definitely sounds
throughout<00:01:01.250> here<00:01:01.519> than<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:01.850> did<00:01:01.970> without<00:01:02.150> that

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
throughout here than it did without that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.340 
throughout here than it did without that
with<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.809> stock<00:01:03.280> both<00:01:04.280> windows<00:01:04.790> down<00:01:08.259> but<00:01:09.259> you

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
with the stock both windows down but you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.270 
with the stock both windows down but you
definitely<00:01:09.710> hear<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:09.950> better<00:01:10.040> with<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
definitely hear it better with the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.690 
definitely hear it better with the
windows<00:01:10.610> down<00:01:12.160> well<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.250> can<00:01:13.369> definitely

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
windows down well you can definitely

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.580 
windows down well you can definitely
hear<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:13.970> blow-off<00:01:14.180> valve<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.380> a

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
hear that blow-off valve this is a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.340 
hear that blow-off valve this is a
straight-line<00:01:16.399> semi-aggressive<00:01:17.300> start<00:01:18.020> with

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
straight-line semi-aggressive start with

00:01:18.350 --> 00:02:02.700 
straight-line semi-aggressive start with
the<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:18.830> taken

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.480 

so<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.039> just<00:02:04.130> cruising<00:02:04.729> head<00:02:05.289> 16<00:02:06.490> 67

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
so this is just cruising head 16 67

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.240 
so this is just cruising head 16 67
miles<00:02:07.610> per<00:02:07.820> hour

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
miles per hour

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.930 
miles per hour
real<00:02:09.880> additional<00:02:10.479> noise

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.010 

so<00:02:13.630> let's<00:02:13.930> him<00:02:14.170> back<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.740> down<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.220> about<00:02:16.020> 65

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
so let's him back it down to about 65

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.850 
so let's him back it down to about 65
and<00:02:17.920> six<00:02:18.910> here<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.450> give<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.690> little<00:02:19.840> gas

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.180 

just<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.790> little<00:02:25.750> bit<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.050> in<00:02:26.200> Russia<00:02:26.440> very<00:02:26.800> but

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
just a little bit of in Russia very but

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.460 
just a little bit of in Russia very but
nothing<00:02:27.550> much<00:02:27.820> I<00:02:28.210> took<00:02:28.360> that

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
nothing much I took that

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.850 
nothing much I took that
so<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.130> mean<00:02:30.550> there's<00:02:30.730> no<00:02:30.910> highway<00:02:31.360> drone<00:02:31.860> you

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
so I mean there's no highway drone you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.280 
so I mean there's no highway drone you
know<00:02:33.420> annoying<00:02:34.420> thing<00:02:34.660> it's<00:02:34.870> just<00:02:34.930> kind<00:02:35.230> of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
know annoying thing it's just kind of

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.490 
know annoying thing it's just kind of
fun<00:02:35.500> when<00:02:35.680> you're<00:02:35.890> accelerating
