glass but not bedrock sorry okay our
next<00:01:35.980> tool<00:01:36.940> is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.970 

the<00:01:41.530> air<00:01:41.800> blaster<00:01:42.730> now<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.970> shovel

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
the air blaster now this is the shovel

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.750 
the air blaster now this is the shovel
remastered<00:01:47.980> so<00:01:48.790> it<00:01:49.630> works<00:01:49.810> like<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.080> shovel<00:01:50.410> and

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
remastered so it works like a shovel and

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.640 
remastered so it works like a shovel and
upon<00:01:51.760> using<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.270> ability<00:01:52.660> it<00:01:53.140> uses<00:01:53.440> up<00:01:53.620> to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
upon using the ability it uses up to

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.200 
upon using the ability it uses up to
redstone<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.520> this<00:01:55.210> happens<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:57.060> three<00:01:58.060> by

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
redstone and this happens a three by

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.620 
redstone and this happens a three by
three<00:01:58.270> volume<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.800> specific<00:02:00.130> block<00:02:01.090> is

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
three volume of a specific block is

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.710 
three volume of a specific block is
destroyed<00:02:02.490> no<00:02:03.490> grass<00:02:03.850> blocks<00:02:04.210> are<00:02:04.420> different

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
destroyed no grass blocks are different

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.920 
destroyed no grass blocks are different
from<00:02:04.870> dirt<00:02:05.140> blocks<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:07.210> might<00:02:07.570> not<00:02:07.750> make

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
from dirt blocks you that might not make

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.260 
from dirt blocks you that might not make
sense<00:02:07.990> but<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:09.660> kind<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.810> does<00:02:11.050> okay<00:02:11.950> um<00:02:12.270> let's

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
sense but it kind of does okay um let's

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.550 
sense but it kind of does okay um let's
see<00:02:13.990> next<00:02:14.770> tool<00:02:14.980> would<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:19.750> do<00:02:19.990> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
see next tool would be let's do the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.050 
see next tool would be let's do the
chainsaw<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.700> chainsaw<00:02:22.240> is<00:02:22.450> crafted<00:02:22.990> like<00:02:23.200> so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
chainsaw the chainsaw is crafted like so

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.890 
chainsaw the chainsaw is crafted like so
and<00:02:25.410> as<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.950> would<00:02:27.100> probably<00:02:27.850> guess<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.660> works

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and as you would probably guess it works

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.060 
and as you would probably guess it works
like<00:02:29.170> an<00:02:29.380> X<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.670> diamond<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.540> X<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.260> when

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
like an X a diamond to X that is when

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.440 
like an X a diamond to X that is when
you<00:02:33.100> right<00:02:33.370> click<00:02:33.400> on<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.790> tree<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.360> happens

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
you right click on a tree that happens

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.180 
you right click on a tree that happens
but<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.570> doesn't<00:02:37.900> work<00:02:38.080> on<00:02:38.230> chickens<00:02:38.740> sorry

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
but it doesn't work on chickens sorry

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.060 
but it doesn't work on chickens sorry
now<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.270> will<00:02:40.510> destroy<00:02:40.930> any<00:02:41.170> block<00:02:41.500> above<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
now it will destroy any block above the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.880 
now it will destroy any block above the
block<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.690> right-click<00:02:43.690> on<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.410> do<00:02:44.470> this

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
block you right-click on so if I do this

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
block you right-click on so if I do this
that<00:02:45.880> will<00:02:46.090> happen<00:02:46.269> leaving<00:02:47.080> this<00:02:47.290> block<00:02:47.590> open

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
that will happen leaving this block open
