I<00:00:05.240> don't<00:00:06.240> have<00:00:06.330> much<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.750> show<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:06.960> all<00:00:07.230> my

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
I don't have much to show for all my

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.919 
I don't have much to show for all my
work<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:07.919> far<00:00:08.160> my<00:00:08.820> lazy<00:00:09.059> susan<00:00:09.510> just<00:00:09.719> looks

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
work so far my lazy susan just looks

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.950 
work so far my lazy susan just looks
like<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.170> round<00:00:10.410> piece<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.889> plywood<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.309> spins

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
like a round piece of plywood that spins

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.030 
like a round piece of plywood that spins
so<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.049> order<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.380> me<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.500> make<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.889> little

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
so in order for me to make it a little

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.460 
so in order for me to make it a little
fancier<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.849> want<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> put<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> molding<00:00:16.350> around

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
fancier I want to put a molding around

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.109 
fancier I want to put a molding around
the<00:00:16.710> top<00:00:16.980> layer<00:00:19.340> these<00:00:20.340> pieces<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.910> paper

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the top layer these pieces of paper

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.689 
the top layer these pieces of paper
represent<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> approximate<00:00:22.560> sizes<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.220> the

represent the approximate sizes of the
five<00:00:23.939> pieces<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.420> wood<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.810> I'll<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
five pieces of wood that I'll have to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.599 
five pieces of wood that I'll have to
make<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.920> order<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.640> make<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.119> five<00:00:27.570> piece<00:00:28.609> round

molding around my lazy susan

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.729 
molding around my lazy susan
you<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> inner<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.590> two

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
you can see that the inner of the two

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
you can see that the inner of the two
circles<00:00:35.250> represents<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> outside

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750

the edge of the molding the point of
using<00:00:46.530> paper<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> waste<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.090> little

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
using paper is so that I waste as little

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.160 
using paper is so that I waste as little
wood<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:48.960> possible<00:00:50.480> since<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.600> chose<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> make

easy tutorial on how to do the math this
is<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> poplar<00:01:13.799> stock<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.310> I'm<00:01:14.400> going<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
is the poplar stock that I'm going to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.240 
is the poplar stock that I'm going to
use<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.390> molding<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.799> quite<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> bit

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
use for my molding it's quite a bit

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280 
use for my molding it's quite a bit
thicker<00:01:17.549> than<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.880> 3/4<00:01:18.600> material<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.229> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
thicker than the 3/4 material that I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
thicker than the 3/4 material that I
used<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> lazy<00:01:20.130> susan<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:21.509> how<00:01:21.659> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
used for the lazy susan and that's how I

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.929 
used for the lazy susan and that's how I
can<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> stick<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:23.009> good<00:01:23.189> bit<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
can have it stick up a good bit on the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:39.770 
can have it stick up a good bit on the
top<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.360> things<00:01:24.600> don't<00:01:24.750> roll<00:01:25.080> off<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.470> it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.789 

I<00:01:41.000> can<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> lot<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.900> excess

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
I can see that a lot of this excess

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.620 
I can see that a lot of this excess
material<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.909> removed<00:01:45.330> later

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
material is going to be removed later

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.230 
material is going to be removed later
from<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.200> molding<00:01:46.760> so<00:01:47.760> I'm<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.150> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
from this molding so I'm just going to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240 
from this molding so I'm just going to
put<00:01:48.450> screws<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.200> temporarily<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.040> hold

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
put screws in here temporarily to hold

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:01.130 
put screws in here temporarily to hold
it<00:01:50.369> together<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:59.540> didn't<00:02:00.540> use<00:02:00.630> glue<00:02:00.899> at<00:02:00.990> this

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
it together I didn't use glue at this

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.719 
it together I didn't use glue at this
point<00:02:01.440> I'm<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:02.190> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> fit<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.640> all

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
point I'm just going to fit it all

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.280 
point I'm just going to fit it all
together<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.360> I'll<00:02:03.540> glue<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.290> later

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
together and then I'll glue it later

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.070 
together and then I'll glue it later
when<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> put<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> two<00:02:07.830> pieces<00:02:08.100> together<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:09.080> can

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
when I put the two pieces together I can

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.600 
when I put the two pieces together I can
see<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.560> cut<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.950> less<00:02:11.190> than<00:02:11.370> perfect

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
see that the cut is less than perfect

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.790 
see that the cut is less than perfect
here<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.900> what<00:02:13.050> I'm<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.350> do<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.590> just

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
here so what I'm going to do is just

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040 
here so what I'm going to do is just
take<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.070> little<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:14.640> off<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.540> side<00:02:15.780> and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
take a little bit off of this side and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.830 
take a little bit off of this side and
this<00:02:16.830> side<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.310> make<00:02:17.459> them<00:02:17.640> both<00:02:17.790> fit<00:02:18.120> nobody's

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
this side to make them both fit nobody's

need to be sure that the securing device

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.900 
need to be sure that the securing device
really<00:03:41.599> is<00:03:41.870> secure<00:03:42.380> because<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.519> center

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
really is secure because this center

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.430 
really is secure because this center
point<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.239> where<00:03:44.480> we're<00:03:44.660> going<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.019> set<00:03:45.200> our

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
find the midpoint I've drawn two circles

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.619 
find the midpoint I've drawn two circles
to<00:03:57.709> indicate<00:03:57.739> where<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.430> molding<00:03:59.000> starts<00:03:59.420> and

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
to indicate where the molding starts and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.660 
stops I'm going to do the outside route
first<00:04:03.260> because<00:04:03.620> it's<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.860> easier<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.549> two

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
first because it's the easier of the two

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.940 
first because it's the easier of the two
there's<00:04:05.569> way<00:04:05.900> more<00:04:06.170> at<00:04:06.290> stake<00:04:06.560> with<00:04:06.799> the

with a 5/16 straight bit this will free

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.960 
with a 5/16 straight bit this will free
up<00:04:14.810> my<00:04:14.930> circle

it<00:04:20.970> was<00:04:21.150> having<00:04:21.360> a<00:04:21.510> lot<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.810> trouble<00:04:22.170> routing

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
it was having a lot of trouble routing

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.500 
it was having a lot of trouble routing
down<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:22.980> the<00:04:23.100> groove<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.850> was<00:04:23.970> creating

down in the groove that it was creating

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.510 
down in the groove that it was creating
there<00:04:24.960> was<00:04:25.080> no<00:04:25.230> place<00:04:25.440> for<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.800> exhaust<00:04:26.280> all

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
there was no place for it to exhaust all

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.780 
there was no place for it to exhaust all
of<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.790> sawdust<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.570> stuff<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.130> decided<00:04:29.610> to

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
of the sawdust and stuff so I decided to

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.640 
of the sawdust and stuff so I decided to
take<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.120> jigsaw<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:30.720> cut<00:04:30.990> this<00:04:31.170> excess

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
take the jigsaw and cut this excess

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.340 
take the jigsaw and cut this excess
material<00:04:32.340> away

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.760 

I<00:04:36.540> still<00:04:37.540> left<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.840> little<00:04:37.990> bit<00:04:38.200> on<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.440> bottom

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
I still left a little bit on the bottom

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.440 
I still left a little bit on the bottom
to<00:04:38.890> be<00:04:39.010> safe<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:39.850> I'm<00:04:39.910> going<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.150> take<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.390> over

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
to be safe so I'm going to take it over

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.330 
to be safe so I'm going to take it over
to<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.750> router<00:04:40.990> table<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.650> run<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.160> through

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
to the router table and run it through

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:53.870 
to the router table and run it through
with<00:04:42.580> this<00:04:42.760> flush<00:04:43.090> trim<00:04:43.420> bit

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.650 

I<00:04:54.410> just<00:04:55.410> used<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.710> disk<00:04:56.010> sander<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.660> smooth

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
I just used the disk sander to smooth

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.440 
I just used the disk sander to smooth
this<00:04:57.930> edge<00:04:58.170> really<00:04:58.650> nicely<00:04:58.860> with<00:04:59.070> 220<00:04:59.790> grit<00:04:59.970> it

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
this edge really nicely with 220 grit it

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.300 
this edge really nicely with 220 grit it
took<00:05:00.630> out<00:05:00.750> most<00:05:00.990> all<00:05:01.290> of<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.560> imperfections

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
took out most all of the imperfections

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.790 
took out most all of the imperfections
left<00:05:02.580> by<00:05:02.820> routing<00:05:03.290> now<00:05:04.290> I'm<00:05:04.440> just<00:05:04.620> going<00:05:04.740> to

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:13.610

you're not going to get away without
sanding<00:05:29.919> a<00:05:30.210> great<00:05:31.210> way<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.389> sand<00:05:31.780> on<00:05:31.990> a<00:05:32.050> chamfer

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
sanding a great way to sand on a chamfer

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.640 
sanding a great way to sand on a chamfer
is<00:05:32.889> to<00:05:33.069> use<00:05:33.280> a<00:05:33.310> block<00:05:34.199> because<00:05:35.199> if<00:05:35.319> you<00:05:35.469> use<00:05:35.620> a

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
is to use a block because if you use a

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.999 
is to use a block because if you use a
regular<00:05:36.219> piece<00:05:37.090> of<00:05:37.270> sandpaper<00:05:37.710> it's<00:05:38.710> going<00:05:38.949> to

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
regular piece of sandpaper it's going to

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.339 
regular piece of sandpaper it's going to
dull<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.729> sharp<00:05:40.389> edges<00:05:40.659> of<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:41.080> chamfer<00:05:41.590> the

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
dull the sharp edges of the chamfer the

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.619 
dull the sharp edges of the chamfer the
block<00:05:44.349> also<00:05:44.620> works<00:05:45.099> great<00:05:45.460> on<00:05:45.490> these<00:05:46.360> end

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:46.629 
block also works great on these end

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.629 
block also works great on these end
grains<00:05:47.020> because<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:47.860> allows<00:05:48.099> you<00:05:48.250> to<00:05:48.370> apply<00:05:48.610> a

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
grains because it allows you to apply a

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.719 
grains because it allows you to apply a
lot<00:05:49.120> of<00:05:49.270> pressure<00:05:49.539> and<00:05:49.870> it<00:05:50.529> just<00:05:50.800> seems<00:05:51.009> to<00:05:51.250> rub

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
lot of pressure and it just seems to rub

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.800 
lot of pressure and it just seems to rub
the<00:05:52.000> imperfections<00:05:52.750> away<00:05:54.330> it's<00:05:55.330> time<00:05:55.539> to<00:05:55.719> add

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
the imperfections away it's time to add

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.290 
the imperfections away it's time to add
the<00:05:55.840> decorative<00:05:56.259> edge<00:05:56.620> to<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:56.979> top<00:05:57.120> I'm<00:05:58.120> going

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
the decorative edge to the top I'm going

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.969 
the decorative edge to the top I'm going
to<00:05:58.360> use<00:05:58.509> this<00:05:58.779> bit<00:05:59.020> and<00:05:59.259> just<00:05:59.680> run<00:05:59.830> it<00:05:59.949> through

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
to use this bit and just run it through

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.959 
to use this bit and just run it through

on the router table all right now comes
the<00:06:04.150> moment<00:06:04.300> that<00:06:04.539> I've<00:06:04.629> been<00:06:04.659> planning<00:06:05.110> for

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:05.439 
the moment that I've been planning for

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.790 
the moment that I've been planning for
since<00:06:05.680> I<00:06:05.770> started<00:06:06.099> this<00:06:06.370> project<00:06:06.669> I<00:06:07.650> have<00:06:08.650> to

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
since I started this project I have to

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.179 
since I started this project I have to
make<00:06:08.979> the<00:06:09.159> cut<00:06:09.430> if<00:06:10.330> this<00:06:11.050> cut<00:06:11.319> is<00:06:11.439> too<00:06:11.650> big<00:06:11.949> or

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:12.189 
make the cut if this cut is too big or

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.779 
make the cut if this cut is too big or
too<00:06:12.219> small

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
too small

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.950 
too small
this<00:06:13.569> piece<00:06:13.900> really<00:06:14.830> could<00:06:15.159> be<00:06:15.340> ruined

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
this piece really could be ruined

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.420 
this piece really could be ruined
this<00:06:16.960> next<00:06:17.289> route<00:06:17.560> requires<00:06:17.740> more<00:06:18.250> precision

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
this next route requires more precision

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.570 
this next route requires more precision
than<00:06:18.940> anything<00:06:19.210> that<00:06:19.419> I've<00:06:19.629> done<00:06:19.870> so<00:06:20.110> far<00:06:20.580> I've

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
than anything that I've done so far I've

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.770 

it<00:06:44.979> took<00:06:45.219> two<00:06:45.430> or<00:06:45.460> three<00:06:45.780> microscopic

it took two or three microscopic

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.170 
it took two or three microscopic
adjustments<00:06:47.439> but<00:06:47.620> I<00:06:47.860> think<00:06:48.550> I<00:06:48.639> have<00:06:48.879> at<00:06:49.030> this

little<00:07:29.500> bit<00:07:29.620> of<00:07:29.710> that<00:07:29.830> material<00:07:30.129> still<00:07:30.550> left

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:30.729 
little bit of that material still left

little bit of that material still left
on<00:07:30.969> there<00:07:31.240> I'm<00:07:32.080> just<00:07:32.349> going<00:07:32.500> to<00:07:32.560> zip<00:07:32.830> it<00:07:32.949> off

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:33.069 
on there I'm just going to zip it off

with<00:07:33.279> the<00:07:33.400> flush<00:07:33.699> trim<00:07:34.029> bit<00:07:34.060> though

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.290 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.150 

well<00:07:45.290> I<00:07:45.500> got<00:07:45.800> it<00:07:45.890> to<00:07:46.010> fit<00:07:46.220> really<00:07:46.370> nicely<00:07:46.700> I

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 
well I got it to fit really nicely I

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.430 
well I got it to fit really nicely I
pressed<00:07:49.160> it<00:07:49.310> down<00:07:49.490> in<00:07:49.700> until<00:07:50.000> it's<00:07:50.150> flush<00:07:50.510> but

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 
pressed it down in until it's flush but

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.350 
pressed it down in until it's flush but
it's<00:07:51.560> just<00:07:51.770> dry<00:07:52.040> fit<00:07:52.280> for<00:07:52.490> now<00:07:52.610> I<00:07:52.880> haven't

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 
it's just dry fit for now I haven't

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.150 
it's just dry fit for now I haven't
decided<00:07:53.600> how<00:07:53.870> I'm<00:07:53.960> gonna<00:07:54.050> fasten<00:07:54.410> it<00:07:54.710> I<00:07:54.860> think

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.160 
decided how I'm gonna fasten it I think

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.410 
decided how I'm gonna fasten it I think
I'm<00:07:55.250> just<00:07:55.400> going<00:07:55.550> to<00:07:55.640> use<00:07:55.760> glue<00:07:55.970> though

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:58.420 

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.690 

unfortunately<00:07:59.560> this<00:08:00.560> projects<00:08:01.160> become<00:08:01.490> so

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:01.700 
unfortunately this projects become so

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.280 
unfortunately this projects become so
time-consuming<00:08:02.510> that<00:08:02.780> I'm<00:08:02.900> going<00:08:03.020> to<00:08:03.080> have<00:08:03.170> to

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.290 
time-consuming that I'm going to have to

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.190 
time-consuming that I'm going to have to
make<00:08:03.440> a<00:08:03.470> part<00:08:04.070> for<00:08:04.340> to<00:08:04.550> the<00:08:04.670> video<00:08:04.970> I<00:08:05.270> hope<00:08:06.110> you

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:06.200 
make a part for to the video I hope you

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.500 
make a part for to the video I hope you
stick<00:08:06.470> around
