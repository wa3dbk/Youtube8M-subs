00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.979
 outside the government on the android platform but this one personalizes document 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.119
 that sony ericsson 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.329
 what is this 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.929

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.100
 between the forwards 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.700
 this is the part 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.760
 of contacts 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.760
 and for example here you enter the part d 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.350

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.080
 calls 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.340
 and you start being the calls and all because this one 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.690
 the keyboard is the normal treatment then it is very easy to write or to 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.050
 make calls the traditional predictive normal text yes i which one here 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.540
 is the pair of messages so that in a very easy way 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.920
 problems completed 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.840
 do not 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.860
 morel size was around the best way to do it but it was very small it was 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.390
 put alphanumeric or credits 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.850
 so that from the four corners only the sony phone knows 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.650
 Ericsson 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.620
 but the phone is provided for example if you tell them here at 3 lara 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.360
 from the same standard 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.730
 of delights to see more applications not 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.220
 It has a 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.800
 in which it returns the same the photos are incredible if you want to activate the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.560
 camera the camera nothing else in automatic you press the button 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.460
 camera and the outgoing camera is activated so for the same thing it does not cost you 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.990
 work bots camera processing went very fast very simple 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.520
 so take the bed if you look here and the 4 corners changed although in a 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.239
 beginning in the main menu 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.910
 we had contacts messages 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.410
 all this 'the four corners' will be changing according to the application in 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.180
 what these 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.520
 so that in a very simple way 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.210
 you are facilitated to use press the express application as accesses 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.970
 direct the shakhtar here for example are the photos that poked 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:48.979
 these imbalances the photos that are taken here I'll go if you notice and at 4 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:50.109
 corners changed 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.219
 my team that's the best 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.219
 in Miami sent as a message 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.389
 and good 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.259
 Lieutenant and part of messaging you can do well by means of the application 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.259
 de rossi synchronize all your emails 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.469
 and good applications you can download from the android market market month all 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.789
 the applications 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.249
 and good 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:20.259
 here for example we have full in which you can download the same more 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:26.650
 content both songs and seven more pum pum apps even also 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.939
 it does not do that also that the team is not going well and only to people who want 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.379
 have it 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.169
 can the whole experience of a 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.670
 according to that morning 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.749
 but in a very compact way 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.909
 your phone is very compact that fits in the palm of your hand with the room 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:50.479
 also to other things that you can handle when entering all the accesses 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.619
 all of you 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:55.339
 All functions of the phone with only one hand 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:59.379
 that's the big problem that bulls have and it does not drown a lot of people 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.079
 the best does not like before this cereal in a compact way put all 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.089
 the experience in inter mosley and the price will be cheaper similar with 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.919
 more expensive than 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.599
 the side 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.870
 it will not turn out well 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.789
 a 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.779
 at a much more price see 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:19.329
 what we demand from here after a study in 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.139
 we have to do with the interests of all but also that among others 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.520
 elements that make another market that demand a single stroke of luck 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.490
 despite this we launched 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.629
 that is, if the minister 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.900
 which includes a keyboard 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 fall the same functions as a month and 10 mini 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.349
 if one enters the 5 megapixel camera 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.800
 it also includes the other detail is that lippi the four corners then 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800
 the phone also comes on the neutral platform 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.479
 then basically the same phone but with a keyboard this sliding 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.150
 a physicist 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.430
 more than a month 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.020
 we're 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.199
 well communities indicated 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.949

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.659
 the citizenship of colors 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.089
 it's going to be a problem 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.089
 but I'm seeing the black one time 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.520
 i lavenir a white with red we made a type a little more also a plate with 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.460

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.590
 also a year ago 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.960
 same with the two operators or 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.490
 I agree
