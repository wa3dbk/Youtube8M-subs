00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.840
 just fps and updated kia rio 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.410
 here with minimal external differences 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.540
 sang not the car a little bit recognizable 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.210
 back very carefully 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.590
 peering into the taillights and lightly them 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.950
 distinguish restyling and before restyling 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.509
 car a lot and what 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.070
 great value them if you want 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.000
 similar car nose a little more 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.370
 bright appearance 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.120
 You can look at Hyundai Solaris 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.030
 which after the update got more 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.429
 brighter appearance 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.670
 Olya for my taste is better 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:51.039
 externally balanced meni kechir 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.370
 you're just behind these two 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.199
 twin brothers i rather choose kia 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.929
 rio 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.440
 it is with this engine from mechanics and 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:04.480
 he is the fastest available 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.700
 cars 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.930
 in a fairly decent set already 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.300
 have climate control let single-zone 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.340
 normal radio there 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.950
 electric heating of the ruble and and believing 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.470
 windshield of course check it out 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.440
 the seats 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.050
 perhaps the only thing missing is so 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.690
 this is any fixture for 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.290
 reverse parking that is not 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.500
 Parktronic and rear view camera in Rio 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 this configuration is not provided but 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.910
 more expensive versions there and this 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.550
 for life for everyday use 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.290
 even a motor 14 would suffice 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.720
 especially if you are considering 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.730
 car with mechanics because the game 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.530
 choose the best machine they take 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.370
 lost because the box will be new 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.850
 six-speed with motor 1 and 6 even with 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.620
 Automatically and will leave fast cool we already 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.750
 told about solaris after 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.360
 updates just in that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.280
 combined 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.480
 although formally overclocking to hundreds 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.660
 relatively long 10.3 seconds but 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.840
 subjectively you can drive around the city 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.660
 extremely extremely dynamic but on the track 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.570
 I would honestly not be on the chintz 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.330
 but for city rio speeds 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.040
 fits perfectly depending on 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.750
 driver's temperament fuel consumption 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.480
 can even fit in the city 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.299
 easily in five and a half 6 liters at 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.349
 dynamic driving let's say 70 half 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.950
 8 no more if you look at 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.129
 prada statistics 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.200
 hyorin with iodine solaris 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:57.370
 are bought up on the country in large quantities 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.639
 than domestic frets and it is not at all 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.430
 amazing car really 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:06.000
 turned out good the rest of it 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.250
 Of course, a fundamentally different level 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.730
 new step for a man who 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.260
 so far broke up with the front 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.419
 hi niko maybe surrender to us or 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.700
 for example with Renault Logan you already 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:25.810
 full interior really 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.889
 nice full set of options no 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.230
 such cheaper prices are too much 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:36.870
 are evident as vazovskie 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.870
 models and logan 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.700
 you can go fast more or less 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:50.060
 even enjoy driving 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.590
 backseat not too much but the floor 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.349
 almost flat 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.349
 there is one for rear passengers 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.569
 cup holder in the center and each door and 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.170
 here is the armrest even in relatively 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.640
 rich set no sprint energy 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.120
 local complaints which can be 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.790
 to set 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.480
 works as i step that mechanics are also 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.310
 that step between 1 and 2 gears 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.239
 quite small to big score 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.760
 had to leave 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.289
 and 5 gears only slightly lengthening 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.240
 last advice to her 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:26.180
 corresponded to 6 and move from 4 to 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:32.229
 the sixth can now be completely calm 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:35.120
 and could well do 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.960
 honestly acquainted with such 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.570
 motor 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.080
 I 'm starting to wonder if I have the right to 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.260
 existence modest modern 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.539
 turbine unit 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.430
 there tips do you need all this on the tachometer 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.740
 Pripyat soon an hour less than one and a half 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.090
 thousand turns but this is absolutely 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.910
 enough at least for now 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.520
 the machine is not loaded suspension works 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.030
 very cool that is you feel i 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.680
 I jump over the creek doctors doctors with 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.010
 minimum shake that is 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.800
 looked an hour when shake less 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:17.600
 what do you expect from a car of this class 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.540
 since the city ​​car is enough 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.940
 serious interesting motor riot 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.850
 feel very confident in the city 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.400
 and if the carrizo still succeeds 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.310
 rear suspension problem setting and 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.880
 control so that at speeds above 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:41.340
 120 bitter you drove the car they 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.380
 crosswind rio will get even better though 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.169
 I don’t know even now that he has a lot 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.080
 there are no serious competitors 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:53.460
 probably the only potential 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:57.210
 competitor is a ford fiesta sedan 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.789
 and I hope to bake 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.500
 it’s not even possible to set the heat 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.080
 just at least make some 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.360
 more or less serious competition because 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.490
 that wound is frankly cheaper and 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:14.400
 frankly easier volkswagen polo can 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.630
 be but here's a better sagana bear point 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.470
 skoda rapid view 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:23.130
 more expensive and proportionally better but there 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.250
 there is a problem with the motor but that's all 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.039
 I repeat only cavils for 650 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.460
 thousand rubles with such a powerful engine 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.919
 rio has no competitors and so i'm with 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.389
 I recommend you this 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:41.389
 ride car and get 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.389
 pleasure 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.050
 I certainly do not be lazy to switch 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.039
 transmission 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.039
 until well
