 when it appeared that the US tried to close 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.759
 is that you will have these options on the side 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.759

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.899

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.259

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.770
 nothing is left 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.770
