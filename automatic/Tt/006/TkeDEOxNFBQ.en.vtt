 playoff semi-final in the kasseler 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.150
 ice rink offers the full program 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.370
 huskies against lions that's the non plus 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.860
 Ultra in the ice hockey league 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.210
 crackling tension was in the air who 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.730
 would be the first highlight at this 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.340
 starting at the beginning were the first 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 the window kassel huskies with this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.390
 impressive choreography voted 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.019
 first of all they hesse 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.580
 derby 1 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.019
 the team of headcoach without them 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.390
 played right at the beginning of the game 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.510
 but this could have good chances 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 not turning them into goals did it differently 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.170
 the live from frankfurt in the tenth 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.690
 minute they use a catastrophic 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.790
 Playback error from kyle doyle and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 went through roland meier with 1 0 in 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.550
 leadership but this leadership did not hold 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.500
 Long 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.450
 Returning the huskies hit back 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.800
 achieved with a powerful slap shot 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.579
 the captain of the huskies the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.860
 compensation to 1 1 then agreed 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.989
 Both teams fight for a fist fight 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.570
 jankowski and frankfurt's felix dukowski 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.460
 had so much nice to say that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.359
 both with playing time penalties early 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.359
 were allowed to shower 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.960
 in the second third of the game was 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.850
 offset what was in the 28 minute 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.259
 it hits the south Hesse 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.509
 All right 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.719
 brought the huskies into the rear 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.130
 within just 165 seconds that was 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.520
 play as well as decided 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.069
 branislav pohanka adam domogalla and 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.560
 Landon Gare increased to 4 to 1 for the 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.539
 frankfurter lions the good 400 followers 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.520
 The lions are completely over the moon 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.189
 they already celebrate their team as the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.810
 sure winner olin is taking the 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.219
 urgently needed time out to be around 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.539
 awaken team once again 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.489
 but that does not really work 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.020
 still worked too many easy 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.819
 play error in the game structure 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.470
 that's what frankfurt is all about 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.420
 but i am finkenrath on the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.250
 post and prevented worse 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.690
 to still turn the game 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.069
 need the huskies before the beginning of 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.069
 last third necessarily a second 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.569
 which then also much stung 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.310
 the disc somehow to frankfurts 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.530
 goalie kovacic passing in goal 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.209
 with these 24 it went into the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.590
 final section and this last one 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.819
 third will ice hockey in the kasseler 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.680
 story once again with red 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.760
 underlined responsible use the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.420
 Chances are not about the game too 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.940
 decide 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.769
 there it makes cash in the 54 minute 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.389
 michi christ has the faxes thick and 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.389
 cloth the slice for a jig 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.160
 from angel to gate 3 2 for the huskies 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.660
 are back in the game and the lions 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.329
 get soft knees 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.220
 and now it was really going on red 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.500
 snapper shoot now more and more uncertain 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.359
 would danijel kovacic at the concept 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.989
 the disc under itself is for children 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.500
 the line 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.510
 no, schiri daniels says a goal now 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.099
 it comes to the absolute showdown and 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.000
 lie in seconds before closing if I 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.799
 finkenrath from the ice 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.090
 the over time of the kassel huskies can 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.980
 frankfurt can not withstand 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.930
 five seconds are left to play 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.849
 fee from frankfurter tor michael 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.079
 Christ takes advantage of the confusion and 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.239
 stocker the slice over the goal line 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.519
 compensation for this 4 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.530
 he would have thought that after one 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.099
 too much it stands here now too much 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.099
 goes into the extension 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.280
 now everything is open again and the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.480
 huskies scent morning air 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.819
 in the fourth minute of the extension 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.930
 sets cold is the starting signal at the 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.329
 trift into the gate 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.099
 5 to 4 for the kassel huskies the 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.170
 huskies can be a fabulous one 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.329
 catching up legalize the residue 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.670
 and put in the extension the 1 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.980
 0-leadership in the playoff series sure 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.750
 the next meeting will follow 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.450
 now on Easter Saturday in Frankfurt 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.450
 difficult is there at 18 o'clock 30
