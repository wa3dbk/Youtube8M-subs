00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hello, how are you welcome? 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 new today is being in a trick of 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.290
 infinite reputation the best method ok 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.120
 to do that the only thing that we will have 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.980
 what to say will not satiate a filter 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.509
 activity we would go to created by 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.530
 rockstar ok very important here that we 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.330
 let's go to a race 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.430
 let's go to a race called the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.199
 triangles of the saints ok this race 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.270
 is enabled so they will see us 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.519
 much the infinite reputation and 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.320
 totally alone and that 's a career is 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.820
 in a race it's pretty easy since 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.250
 a lot of people do not like the tricks of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.090
 previous reputation for this trick for 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.380
 you ok 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.989
 after that in the configuration what 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.550
 that we are going to place 99 laps ok very 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.530
 important that they leave the most is a son 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.770
 that you are going to change them of the 99 laps 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 of the rest you will not move anything else ok 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.460
 of this is simply we are going then to 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.680
 the race normally like this is simple is 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.850
 the trick is the best because only 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.890
 help and we will level up 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 pretty fast I think they give us four 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.879
 thousand or three thousand rpp for each record 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.500
 world we do then here they 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.660
 I will explain what is what 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.800
 that glitch ok very important what 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.840
 we have to do is that the first 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 back we can take two minutes or 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.370
 what you want to delay team to be 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.700
 two minutes three minutes to 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.960
 every time we have what it is we do 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.460
 what is the checkpoint that we 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.290
 count the return then simply we 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.210
 say we made a world record like that 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.680
 that you have to be very clear where it is 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.630
 that will mark you the second 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.430
 turn ok to be able to do it like in 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.500
 here when I'm getting what it is to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.000
 point where it will mark us that already 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.440
 we took the second round we have to 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.450
 wait a little while it can be two 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.400
 minutes a minute fifty as you want 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.530
 ok here in this case well I'm going to 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.230
 wait what is a 20 minute ok for 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.180
 I can do what the other laps 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.500
 more quietly and I did not worry because 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.510
 if you do them very fast if you do the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.640
 first race very fast simply 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.860
 you have to overcome that time because if 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.370
 it will not give you the ok here as the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.200
 when today at minute 1 in you 27 what 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.940
 what I will do is cross the finish line ok 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.100
 sisters level up automatically 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.840
 step new fast lap and it's as if 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.310
 it was a world record then I already 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.770
 what we have to do is in the second 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.170
 come back a little before that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.850
 time ok and so on until 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.229
 you get married so easy is the trick and if 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.790
 you liked remember to leave your the and 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.570
