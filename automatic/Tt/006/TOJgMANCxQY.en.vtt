00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
didn't like I wanted this dress since I

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.379 
didn't like I wanted this dress since I
first<00:04:58.620> saw<00:04:58.860> it<00:04:58.919> like<00:04:59.610> when<00:04:59.759> it<00:04:59.880> came<00:05:00.000> out<00:05:00.060> on

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
first saw it like when it came out on

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.939 
first saw it like when it came out on
the<00:05:00.509> site<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:00.930> was<00:05:00.990> like<00:05:01.139> I<00:05:01.169> want<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.740> but

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
the site and I was like I want that but

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:02.930 
the site and I was like I want that but
I<00:05:01.979> think<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.190> was<00:05:02.310> like<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:02.430> hundred<00:05:02.849> and

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
I think it was like a hundred and

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.020 
I think it was like a hundred and
something<00:05:03.030> dollars<00:05:03.539> like<00:05:04.080> 160<00:05:04.770> dollars<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:05.610> I

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
something dollars like 160 dollars and I

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.029 
something dollars like 160 dollars and I
just<00:05:06.240> like<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.479> can't<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:07.380> wanted<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.860> read<00:05:08.009> this

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
just like I can't I wanted to read this

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.339 
just like I can't I wanted to read this
to<00:05:08.250> Comicon<00:05:08.699> but<00:05:08.849> I<00:05:08.880> don't<00:05:09.419> think<00:05:09.599> it'll<00:05:10.169> be

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
to Comicon but I don't think it'll be

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.040 
to Comicon but I don't think it'll be
tailored<00:05:10.680> in<00:05:10.830> time<00:05:10.979> for<00:05:11.160> Comicon<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.789> it's<00:05:12.780> by

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
tailored in time for Comicon and it's by

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.360 
tailored in time for Comicon and it's by
being<00:05:13.259> dot<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.770> don't<00:05:13.889> know<00:05:13.949> if<00:05:14.009> you<00:05:14.070> can<00:05:14.220> see

and it's just really pretty but I got it
into<00:05:16.830> 3x<00:05:17.250> because<00:05:17.430> they<00:05:17.669> send<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:17.940> size<00:05:18.090> up<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.419> a
