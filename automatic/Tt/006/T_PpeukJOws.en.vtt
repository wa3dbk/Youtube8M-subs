hello I'm Tyler good and I'll be showing

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.830 
hello I'm Tyler good and I'll be showing
you<00:00:07.020> my<00:00:07.140> real<00:00:07.319> canvas<00:00:07.680> camera<00:00:08.010> rig<00:00:08.780> here<00:00:09.780> I

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
you my real canvas camera rig here I

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.750 
you my real canvas camera rig here I
just<00:00:10.020> kind<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.320> basic<00:00:10.740> setup<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.430> a<00:00:11.520> couple

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
just kind of a basic setup of a couple

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.220 
just kind of a basic setup of a couple
of<00:00:11.790> blocks<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.270> you<00:00:12.299> can<00:00:12.480> see<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.900> camera

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
of blocks so you can see the camera

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.870 
of blocks so you can see the camera
working<00:00:15.650> getting<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> camera<00:00:17.099> onto<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
working getting the camera onto the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.750 
working getting the camera onto the
scene<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.930> just<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.950> import<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> Python

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
scene is just the import of a Python

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.510 
scene is just the import of a Python
module<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.750> run<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.710> function<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
module and then you run the function to

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.760 
module and then you run the function to
start<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.300> then<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.470> this

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
start it up and then you have this this

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.179 
start it up and then you have this this
is<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.420> polygon<00:00:27.420> setup<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.350> is<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.890> made

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
is a polygon setup that is just made

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.689 
is a polygon setup that is just made
there<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.670> approximate<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> look<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.699> basic

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
there to approximate the look of a basic

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.400 
there to approximate the look of a basic
boom<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.720> is<00:00:33.809> getting<00:00:33.900> in<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.230> way<00:00:34.320> in

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
boom if this is getting in your way in

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.780 
boom if this is getting in your way in
any<00:00:34.559> point<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:34.920> time<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.220> just<00:00:35.400> have<00:00:35.519> to<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.699> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
any point in time you just have to go to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.610 
any point in time you just have to go to
the<00:00:35.879> base<00:00:36.059> there<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.600> turn<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.230> visibility

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the base there and turn that visibility

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.510 
the base there and turn that visibility
on<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.130> off<00:00:38.630> it's<00:00:39.630> as<00:00:39.750> simple<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.520> all

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
on and off it's as simple as that all

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.400 
on and off it's as simple as that all
the<00:00:42.270> controls<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:43.260> are<00:00:43.530> located<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.460> these

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
the controls then are located on these

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.350 
the controls then are located on these
control<00:00:46.410> curves<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.059> ability

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
control curves you have the ability

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.680 
control curves you have the ability
movie<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> around<00:00:48.930> rotate<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.670> camera<00:00:51.390> from

movie it around rotate the camera from

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900 
movie it around rotate the camera from
this<00:00:51.899> position<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.500> then<00:00:53.010> generally<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
this position and then generally the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
aiming is going to be taken care of by

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.189 
aiming is going to be taken care of by
this<00:00:55.350> locator<00:00:56.300> although<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.660> you're<00:00:57.899> ever<00:00:58.079> in

this locator although if you're ever in
a<00:00:58.260> situation<00:00:58.440> where<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.129> feel<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
a situation where you do feel that you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.460 
a situation where you do feel that you
want<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.530> control<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.309> camera<00:01:02.730> directly<00:01:03.570> all

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
want to control the camera directly all

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
want to control the camera directly all
you<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.220> turn<00:01:05.820> off<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.240> aim

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you have to do is turn off that aim

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.870 
you have to do is turn off that aim
constraint<00:01:06.780> variable<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.190> I'm<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
constraint variable but I'm not going to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
constraint variable but I'm not going to
be<00:01:08.939> using<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.780> we're<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
be using that so we're not going to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.399 
be using that so we're not going to
worry<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.189> quite<00:01:11.549> yet<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.320> I'm<00:01:13.320> just

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
worry about that quite yet so I'm just

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.600 
worry about that quite yet so I'm just
going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> show<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.830> how<00:01:13.979> quick<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.340> easy<00:01:14.460> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
going to show you how quick and easy it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
going to show you how quick and easy it
can<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> create<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.950> reasonably

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
can be to create a reasonably

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.730 
can be to create a reasonably
interesting<00:01:17.250> camera<00:01:18.180> move<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:19.560> about

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
interesting camera move in just about

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.789 
interesting camera move in just about
under<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> minute<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> we're<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.439> going<00:01:22.710> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
under a minute so we're just going to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.099 
under a minute so we're just going to
kind<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.250> hop<00:01:23.430> straight<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.909> now

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.740 

I'm<00:01:27.409> gonna<00:01:27.500> get<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.829> said<00:01:28.009> we<00:01:28.100> can<00:01:28.250> see<00:01:28.750> what

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
I'm gonna get it said we can see what

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.289 
I'm gonna get it said we can see what
we're<00:01:29.899> seeing<00:01:30.109> through<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.350> camera<00:01:31.210> give<00:01:32.210> us

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
we're seeing through the camera give us

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.160 
we're seeing through the camera give us
a<00:01:32.329> nice<00:01:32.509> low<00:01:32.780> angle<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.920> approach<00:01:34.250> these

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
a nice low angle to approach these

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.789 
a nice low angle to approach these
random<00:01:36.170> boxes<00:01:37.869> one<00:01:38.869> of<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.049> values<00:01:39.619> that<00:01:39.649> you

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
random boxes one of the values that you

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.350 
random boxes one of the values that you
have<00:01:40.069> the<00:01:40.189> opportunity<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.759> manipulate<00:01:41.270> is

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
have the opportunity to manipulate is

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.669 
have the opportunity to manipulate is
the<00:01:41.479> boom<00:01:41.659> position<00:01:42.079> that<00:01:42.289> gives<00:01:42.469> you<00:01:42.649> a

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
the boom position that gives you a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.039 
the boom position that gives you a
chance<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:43.009> kind<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.310> slide<00:01:43.579> this<00:01:43.819> boom<00:01:44.659> in<00:01:44.899> and

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
chance to kind of slide this boom in and

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.109 
chance to kind of slide this boom in and
out<00:01:45.219> depending<00:01:46.219> on<00:01:46.549> where<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:46.819> want<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.090> you

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
out depending on where you want it you

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:55.039 
out depending on where you want it you
can<00:01:47.299> use<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:48.020> number<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.590> effects<00:01:52.060> so

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
can use that for a number of effects so

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.520 
can use that for a number of effects so
just<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.009> our<00:01:56.130> curves<00:01:56.460> there<00:01:57.530> set

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
just like all of our curves there set

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.570 
just like all of our curves there set
keyframes

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.619 

take<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.120> along<00:02:03.480> like<00:02:03.750> that

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:21.600 

coming<00:02:09.289> here

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.770 

all<00:02:22.090> right<00:02:23.040> tweaking<00:02:24.040> here<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.250> there<00:02:24.400> but

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.600 

really<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> mean<00:02:28.680> with<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.950> minimum<00:02:29.280> amount<00:02:29.490> of
