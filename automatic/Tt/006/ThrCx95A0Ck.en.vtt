00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
its its pretty long i'm not sure exactly

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.060 
its its pretty long i'm not sure exactly
how<00:01:08.180> long<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.480> have<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:08.780> right<00:01:08.870> now<00:01:09.050> let's<00:01:09.980> take

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
how long I have it right now let's take

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:25.870 
how long I have it right now let's take
a<00:01:10.130> look

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.670 

so<00:01:26.880> let's<00:01:27.360> throw<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.660> camera<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.260> top<00:01:28.440> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
so let's throw this camera up on top and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.280 
so let's throw this camera up on top and
see<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> view<00:01:29.490> looks<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:33.170> all<00:01:34.170> right

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
see what the view looks like all right

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.660 
see what the view looks like all right
the<00:01:34.410> camera<00:01:34.680> sitting<00:01:34.890> sideways<00:01:35.160> right<00:01:35.460> now

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the camera sitting sideways right now

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.200 
the camera sitting sideways right now
because<00:01:36.120> I<00:01:37.340> have<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.700> painter's<00:01:39.000> pole

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
because I have it on the painter's pole

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.730 
because I have it on the painter's pole
I'm<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> walk<00:01:40.050> down<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.440> other<00:01:40.620> end

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
I'm going to walk down to the other end

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.160 
I'm going to walk down to the other end
and<00:01:41.040> lift<00:01:41.550> this<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:41.940> air<00:01:42.120> I'm<00:01:42.900> sure

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and lift this up in the air I'm sure

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.890 
and lift this up in the air I'm sure
it's<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.590> quite<00:01:43.920> wobbly<00:01:44.750> going<00:01:45.750> up

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
it's going to be quite wobbly going up

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.590

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
but we'll see how steady i can get it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
but we'll see how steady i can get it
once<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.320> tall<00:01:49.590> enough<00:01:49.620> and<00:01:49.980> see<00:01:50.220> what

but<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.680> was<00:04:40.800> all<00:04:40.919> done<00:04:41.069> with<00:04:41.189> the<00:04:41.250> canon

but that was all done with the canon
s120<00:04:43.639> belies<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.759> shin<00:04:44.939> and<00:04:45.860> what<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:46.979> saw

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.260 
s120 belies a shin and what you saw
again<00:04:47.610> was<00:04:47.849> was<00:04:48.150> all<00:04:48.330> video<00:04:48.719> mode<00:04:49.050> if<00:04:49.409> i<00:04:50.340> had<00:04:51.240> a

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
again was was all video mode if i had a

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.029 
again was was all video mode if i had a
way<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.449> trigger<00:04:51.780> this<00:04:51.990> camera<00:04:52.439> I<00:04:52.590> could<00:04:52.860> use

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
way to trigger this camera I could use

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.179 
way to trigger this camera I could use
still<00:04:54.000> images<00:04:54.389> and<00:04:54.599> then<00:04:55.199> you<00:04:55.349> wouldn't<00:04:55.560> you

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
still images and then you wouldn't you

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.189 
still images and then you wouldn't you
know<00:04:56.310> obviously<00:04:56.490> notice<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.240> lot<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.389> that<00:04:57.629> the

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
know obviously notice a lot of that the

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.240 
know obviously notice a lot of that the
swing<00:04:58.469> when<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:58.889> was<00:04:59.009> on<00:04:59.039> top<00:04:59.340> there<00:05:00.229> so<00:05:01.229> yeah<00:05:02.069> I

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
swing when it was on top there so yeah I

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.330 
swing when it was on top there so yeah I
think<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:03.870> was<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.020> fairly<00:05:04.650> good<00:05:04.860> example<00:05:05.280> of

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
think that was a fairly good example of

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.159 
think that was a fairly good example of
what<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.729> could<00:05:05.849> do<00:05:06.000> with<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.210> Palo<00:05:06.419> Alto<00:05:06.750> get

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
what you could do with the Palo Alto get

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.129 
what you could do with the Palo Alto get
some<00:05:07.319> unique<00:05:07.620> perspectives<00:05:08.280> on<00:05:09.050> you<00:05:10.050> know

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
some unique perspectives on you know

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.749 
some unique perspectives on you know
things<00:05:10.409> like<00:05:10.500> real<00:05:10.740> estate<00:05:11.009> photography<00:05:11.610> or

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
things like real estate photography or

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.969
