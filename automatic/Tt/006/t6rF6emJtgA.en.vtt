00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
otherwise it like was too loose and it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.190

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
then the feet or whatever it is they can

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.839

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
lift so that if it's like going uphill

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.339 
lift so that if it's like going uphill
it<00:02:16.420> can<00:02:16.690> pull<00:02:17.620> itself<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.900> then<00:02:19.900> to

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
it can pull itself up and then to

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.220 
it can pull itself up and then to
compare<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.790> old<00:02:22.060> one<00:02:23.520> it's<00:02:25.200> quite<00:02:26.200> a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
compare it to the old one it's quite a

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.110 
compare it to the old one it's quite a
bit<00:02:26.470> smaller<00:02:26.620> than<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.190> old<00:02:27.310> one<00:02:27.519> but<00:02:27.790> I'd

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
bit smaller than the old one but I'd

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.479 
bit smaller than the old one but I'd
like<00:02:28.660> much<00:02:29.200> more<00:02:29.230> because<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:30.069> don't<00:02:30.250> know<00:02:30.310> this

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
like much more because I don't know this

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.110 
like much more because I don't know this
one's<00:02:30.730> not<00:02:31.690> weird<00:02:32.050> colors<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.680> all<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:34.080> so

basically<00:03:18.160> flies<00:03:18.579> up<00:03:18.940> instead<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.870> far<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.739> mean

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
basically flies up instead of far I mean

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.610 
basically flies up instead of far I mean
I<00:03:21.359> think<00:03:22.359> this<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:22.959> just<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.320> waste<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.650> pieces

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
I think this is just a waste of pieces

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.949 
I think this is just a waste of pieces
what's<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.890> point<00:03:27.930> it's<00:03:28.930> it's<00:03:29.500> not<00:03:29.799> bad<00:03:30.280> but

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
what's the point it's it's not bad but

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.020 
what's the point it's it's not bad but
odd<00:03:31.959> knowledge<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.739> just<00:03:33.040> goes<00:03:33.340> off<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.790> lands

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
odd knowledge it just goes off and lands

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.789 
odd knowledge it just goes off and lands
