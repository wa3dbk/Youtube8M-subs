the yeah I measured from the top my top
shoulder<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> doesn't<00:01:21.600> matter<00:01:21.720> because

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
shoulder but it doesn't matter because

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
shoulder but it doesn't matter because
when<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.320> try<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> trim<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
when you try it on you can trim the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.770 
when you try it on you can trim the
excess<00:01:24.710> but<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.920> um<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.509> less

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
excess but is um it's going to be less

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.880 
excess but is um it's going to be less
than<00:01:28.080> 50<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.060> little<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.299> than<00:01:30.479> 40<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.680> make

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
than 50 a little more than 40 so make

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
than 50 a little more than 40 so make
sure<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.220> measure<00:01:34.340> from<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.610> armpit<00:01:36.150> down

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
sure you measure from your armpit down

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.210 
sure you measure from your armpit down
to<00:01:36.750> your<00:01:36.900> ankle<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.470> let's<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.009> say<00:01:38.189> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to your ankle and let's just say that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.740 
to your ankle and let's just say that
it's<00:01:38.549> 15<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.750> really<00:01:39.960> tall<00:01:40.320> and

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
it's 15 you're really really tall and

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's 15 you're really really tall and
you<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.049> UM<00:01:43.290> when<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.640> those

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
you have to UM when you have all those

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.539 
you have to UM when you have all those
measurements<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:45.810> example<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:46.439> widest<00:01:47.040> part

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
measurements for example my widest part

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.069 
measurements for example my widest part
of<00:01:47.820> my<00:01:48.060> body<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.899> butt<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.810> that's<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
of my body is my butt so that's going to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.450 
of my body is my butt so that's going to
be<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:54.060> width<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.540> my<00:01:54.750> fabric<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.280> which

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
be the the width of my fabric so which

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.929 
be the the width of my fabric so which
was<00:01:56.670> 37<00:01:57.299> ancients<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.280> example<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.759> is

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
was 37 ancients so for example this is

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.480 
was 37 ancients so for example this is
my<00:01:59.969> fabric<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.619> folded<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.159> half

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
my fabric right and it's folded in half

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.899 
my fabric right and it's folded in half
right<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:04.259> length<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.829> 50<00:02:05.280> inches

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
right here and in length it's 50 inches

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.499 
right here and in length it's 50 inches
and<00:02:06.619> remember<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.099> folded<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.149> from

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and remember that this is folded so from

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.270 
and remember that this is folded so from
here<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.009> 18<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.879> remember<00:02:12.390> 8

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
here to here is 18 and remember 8

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.520 
here to here is 18 and remember 8
times<00:02:13.459> two<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.730> 37<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.630> when<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.900> unfold<00:02:15.110> it

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
times two is 37 so when you unfold it

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.260 
times two is 37 so when you unfold it
it's<00:02:15.709> actually<00:02:15.890> 37<00:02:17.319> so<00:02:18.319> when<00:02:18.530> it's<00:02:18.709> folded

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
it's actually 37 so when it's folded

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.600 
it's actually 37 so when it's folded
lengthwise<00:02:20.270> right<00:02:20.959> here<00:02:21.350> it's<00:02:21.770> 50<00:02:22.220> inches

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
lengthwise right here it's 50 inches

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.270 
lengthwise right here it's 50 inches
from<00:02:22.850> here<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.209> here<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.630> from<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:25.130> here

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
from here to here and from here to here

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.780 
from here to here and from here to here
is<00:02:25.610> 18<00:02:26.090> inches<00:02:26.569> and<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:27.620> also<00:02:27.830> actually<00:02:28.250> need

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
is 18 inches and you also actually need

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.300 
is 18 inches and you also actually need
to<00:02:29.030> grab<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.600> thick<00:02:30.020> elastic<00:02:30.350> this<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:30.950> a

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
to grab a thick elastic this is a
