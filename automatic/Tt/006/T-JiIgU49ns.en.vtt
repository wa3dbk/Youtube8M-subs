tutorial on sharing shape attributes
between<00:00:06.089> multiple<00:00:06.600> nodes<00:00:07.400> utilizing<00:00:08.400> a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
between multiple nodes utilizing a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.400 
between multiple nodes utilizing a
script<00:00:08.849> that's<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.800> WWE<00:00:10.800> ATV<00:00:11.130> crash<00:00:11.250> calm<00:00:11.880> and

script that's on WWE ATV crash calm and
and<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:13.860> want<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.130> run<00:00:14.250> through<00:00:14.429> basically

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
and I just want to run through basically

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.359 
and I just want to run through basically
how<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> use<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> tool<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.839> wrote<00:00:16.250> ok<00:00:17.250> it's

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
how to use the tool I wrote ok it's

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.349 
how to use the tool I wrote ok it's
based<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.449> gmail<00:00:18.810> rig<00:00:19.109> which<00:00:19.350> showed<00:00:19.650> shed

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
based on the gmail rig which showed shed

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.670 
based on the gmail rig which showed shed
attributes<00:00:21.359> between<00:00:21.840> several<00:00:22.199> nights<00:00:22.500> so

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
attributes between several nights so

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.179 
attributes between several nights so
here's<00:00:22.859> an<00:00:22.949> example<00:00:23.220> arm<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.590> sample

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
here's an example arm and in sample

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.410 
here's an example arm and in sample
these<00:00:26.279> circles<00:00:26.730> would<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:27.029> our<00:00:27.150> control

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
these circles would be our control

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.980 
these circles would be our control
objects<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.160> also<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> ik<00:00:30.449> handle

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
objects here we also have the ik handle

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.100 
objects here we also have the ik handle
and<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.769> might<00:00:31.920> want<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> shared<00:00:32.989> group<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
and we might want to the shared group of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.170 
and we might want to the shared group of
attributes<00:00:34.530> between<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.520> things<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.969> I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
attributes between them so things like I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.119 
attributes between them so things like I
case<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:36.840> things<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.270> okay<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:40.680> run

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
case which things like that okay to run

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.060 
case which things like that okay to run

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
attributes i like to use curves so

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.060 
attributes i like to use curves so
create<00:01:26.260> CV<00:01:26.770> curve<00:01:26.800> tool<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.890> just

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
create CV curve tool and I'm just

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.250 
create CV curve tool and I'm just
dropping<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.460> single<00:01:30.700> point<00:01:31.119> it's<00:01:32.110> I<00:01:32.229> don't

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
dropping a single point it's I don't

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.680 
dropping a single point it's I don't
actually<00:01:32.710> want<00:01:33.010> any<00:01:33.220> geometry<00:01:33.690> something

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
actually want any geometry something

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.100 
actually want any geometry something
enter<00:01:34.960> on<00:01:35.050> that<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.369> important<00:01:37.060> thing<00:01:37.360> we

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
enter on that now the important thing we

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.480 
enter on that now the important thing we
need<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.290> do<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.619> this<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:38.890> when<00:01:39.040> we<00:01:39.130> add<00:01:39.250> our

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
need to do to this is when we add our

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.820 
need to do to this is when we add our
new<00:01:40.180> custom<00:01:40.720> attributes<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.410> we<00:01:41.560> add<00:01:41.680> them

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
new custom attributes is we add them

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.590 
new custom attributes is we add them
actually<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.340> shape<00:01:42.700> rather<00:01:43.149> than<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.540> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
actually to the shape rather than to the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.770 
actually to the shape rather than to the
transform<00:01:44.500> node<00:01:44.680> so<00:01:45.460> I<00:01:45.490> select<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.880> shape<00:01:46.090> i'm

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
transform node so I select the shape i'm

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.609 
transform node so I select the shape i'm
just<00:01:46.960> going<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.140> rename<00:01:47.649> it<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.350> left<00:01:52.619> shared

again<00:03:31.980> we<00:03:32.280> could<00:03:32.490> do<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.790> with<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.600> whole

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
again we could do this with the whole

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.480 
again we could do this with the whole
group<00:03:33.780> them<00:03:34.170> together<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:37.250> does<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.400> take

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
group them together and does it take

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.980 
group them together and does it take

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
into account if it hasn't got on there

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.980
