00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hello, now consider 4 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.700
 exercises for effective development 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.090
 fingers of both hands 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.090
 extract she so 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.969
 that is, starting to move from the first 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.750
 fret 6 strings and index finger 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:52.070
 then go to the fifth middle finger 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.379
 extract too well extract strings further 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.750
 back to the sixth nameless 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:03.519
 extract and finish means little finger 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.380
 on 5 string 4 fret remember that 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.899
 index finger does not come off 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.240
 strings and at the same time further we jump off 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.990
 on 5 with a fool but many repeat 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 sequence then with what on 4 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.549
 darkness video 2 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.810
 and here we move the little finger by 1 watt by 5 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.810
 and go in the reverse order 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.509
 being on the sixth string 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.640
 tab 2 from the index finger move on 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.640
 fret does not go higher 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.460
 and so on 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:58.730
 up to 12 frets of the first string the little finger will have 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.390
 you exercise ends 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.060
 a feature like this when you go to 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.910
 reverse order especially at first 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.330
 frets as they are wider fingers will 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:16.760
 stretch more efficiently and watch out for 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:19.880
 so when here you are like this 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.040
 the moment when the little finger goes on in this 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.050
 case, the third string is a very 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.360
 moment such a peak for the muscles therefore 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.920
 watch for 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.280
 index finger to due to 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.900
 hand in general that she did not leave as 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.240
 It would be the moment for the fingers of principle. 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.380
 your results 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.120
 I'm right about the fingers of my right hand 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.000
 two fingers work here alternately 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.820
 index mean that is if in 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.090
 In this exercise, we first pull 6 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.950
 he is pointing at the fifth 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.950
 average and so 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:08.420
 and do not forget to play under the metronome 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.319
 showed in previous exercises like 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.160
 this is a matter between drums 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.080
 metronome and whip play four 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.569
 notes 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:27.170
 play necessarily at low speeds 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.170
 wish you luck
