PlayStation<00:02:26.250> 3<00:02:26.460> gameplay<00:02:26.910> HDMI<00:02:27.629> because<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
PlayStation 3 gameplay HDMI because it

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.750 
PlayStation 3 gameplay HDMI because it
avoids<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.409> copy<00:02:28.620> protection

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
avoids a copy protection

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.149 
avoids a copy protection
no<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.239> like<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> DVI<00:02:30.870> splitter<00:02:31.049> would<00:02:31.470> but

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
no just like a DVI splitter would but

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.679 
no just like a DVI splitter would but
the<00:02:32.280> end<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.549> day<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.030> DVR<00:02:33.390> splitter

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
the end of the day you DVR splitter

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.270 
the end of the day you DVR splitter
means<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.409> have<00:02:34.439> to<00:02:34.650> use<00:02:34.829> you<00:02:34.950> capture

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
means that you have to use you capture

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.429 
means that you have to use you capture
software<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.790> capture<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:37.110> defeats<00:02:37.439> the

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
software to capture and that defeats the

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.050 
software to capture and that defeats the
object<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:38.099> me<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.670> capture<00:02:39.030> card

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
object for me because the capture card

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.089 
object for me because the capture card
software<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.439> know<00:02:40.560> doesn't<00:02:40.890> capture

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
software you know doesn't capture

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.470 
software you know doesn't capture
lossless<00:02:41.610> quality<00:02:41.819> images<00:02:42.360> but<00:02:43.140> anyway<00:02:43.379> I

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
lossless quality images but anyway I

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.440 
lossless quality images but anyway I
want<00:02:45.480> other<00:02:45.870> media<00:02:46.700> extreme<00:02:47.700> cap<00:02:47.970> because<00:02:48.239> it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
want other media extreme cap because it

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.509 
want other media extreme cap because it
gives<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.290> option<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.680> capture<00:02:50.400> with

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
gives you the option to capture with

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.680 
gives you the option to capture with
lossless<00:02:50.909> quality<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.599> u.s.<00:02:51.870> utilizing<00:02:52.680> usb3

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
lossless quality the u.s. utilizing usb3

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.149 
lossless quality the u.s. utilizing usb3
technology<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.140> that's<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.440> one<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.920> look<00:02:56.010> out

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
technology so that's the one to look out

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.229 
technology so that's the one to look out
for<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.489> know<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:58.549> these<00:02:59.549> things<00:02:59.609> are<00:03:00.060> what

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
for you know but these things are what

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.119 
for you know but these things are what
things<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.019> would<00:03:01.260> look<00:03:01.349> into<00:03:01.590> getting<00:03:01.799> hold

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
things that would look into getting hold

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.130 
things that would look into getting hold
off<00:03:02.340> if<00:03:02.519> it<00:03:02.730> wasn't<00:03:03.120> for<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.299> PlayStation<00:03:03.870> 4

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
off if it wasn't for the PlayStation 4

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.190 
off if it wasn't for the PlayStation 4
so<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:05.909> sneaking<00:03:06.239> suspicion<00:03:06.359> amount<00:03:07.140> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
so I have a sneaking suspicion amount of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.349 
so I have a sneaking suspicion amount of
a<00:03:07.260> few<00:03:07.470> problems<00:03:07.769> recording<00:03:08.549> in<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:09.120> method

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
a few problems recording in this method

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.720 
a few problems recording in this method
especially<00:03:10.049> in<00:03:10.470> 1080p<00:03:10.980> from<00:03:11.370> ps4<00:03:11.849> so<00:03:13.579> now<00:03:14.579> I'm

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
especially in 1080p from ps4 so now I'm
