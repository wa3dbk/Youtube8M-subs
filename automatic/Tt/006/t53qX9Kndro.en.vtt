bottom which should be USB 3.0 here at
the<00:01:04.100> bottom<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:04.550> can<00:01:04.580> plug<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:04.879> in<00:01:05.239> so<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:06.200> hit

that back and stop fake calling people

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.730 
that back and stop fake calling people
earlier

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.160 

right<00:01:12.740> now<00:01:13.390> we<00:01:14.390> do<00:01:14.480> have<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.660> physical<00:01:14.960> home

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
right now we do have the physical home

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.570 
right now we do have the physical home
button<00:01:15.200> what<00:01:15.680> they<00:01:15.800> have<00:01:15.950> change<00:01:16.220> here<00:01:16.400> on<00:01:16.520> the

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
button what they have change here on the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.110 
button what they have change here on the
bottom<00:01:16.730> how<00:01:17.600> does<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.840> dedicated<00:01:18.650> multitask

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
bottom how does a dedicated multitask

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.640 
bottom how does a dedicated multitask
but<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:21.510> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.410> really

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
but now you can just now you just really

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.110 
but now you can just now you just really
literally<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.040> back<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.520> then<00:01:23.610> multitask

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
literally have back and then multitask

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.700 
literally have back and then multitask
when<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.330> jump<00:01:24.540> right<00:01:24.660> into<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> don't

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
when you jump right into it so you don't

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.870 
when you jump right into it so you don't
have<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> hold<00:01:26.010> on<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.280> home<00:01:26.430> ones<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.850> little

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
have to hold on the home ones a little

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.010 
have to hold on the home ones a little
bit<00:01:27.120> quicker<00:01:27.270> than<00:01:27.510> navigate<00:01:27.930> between

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
bit quicker than navigate between

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
bit quicker than navigate between
different<00:01:28.430> applications<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.850> what's<00:01:30.030> cool

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
different applications and what's cool

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.250 
different applications and what's cool
about<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.450> kind<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.660> sin<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> hear<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> little

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
about they kind of sin to hear a little

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.110 
about they kind of sin to hear a little
bit<00:01:31.410> so<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.860> little<00:01:32.010> bit<00:01:32.100> easier<00:01:32.730> to<00:01:33.000> know

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
bit so it's a little bit easier to know

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.300 
bit so it's a little bit easier to know
what<00:01:33.390> application<00:01:34.020> that's<00:01:34.140> using<00:01:34.620> my<00:01:35.010> kind<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
what application that's using my kind of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.920 
what application that's using my kind of
way<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.610> are<00:01:35.760> at<00:01:35.910> that<00:01:36.030> point<00:01:36.330> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.780> just

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
way they are at that point you can just

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.600 
way they are at that point you can just
should<00:01:37.230> be<00:01:37.290> able<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> swipe<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.980> way

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
should be able to swipe the way

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.830 
should be able to swipe the way
applications<00:01:39.610> as<00:01:39.909> you<00:01:40.060> would<00:01:40.270> say

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
applications as you would say

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.790 
applications as you would say
right<00:01:41.170> into<00:01:41.500> any<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.579> you

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
right into any of you
