00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
four years in advance is there a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.130 
four years in advance is there a
possibility<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.360> think<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:25.870> is

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
possibility that you think that this is

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.470 
possibility that you think that this is
just<00:02:26.890> some<00:02:27.100> sort<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.370> military<00:02:27.760> aircraft<00:02:27.970> that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
just some sort of military aircraft that

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.580 
just some sort of military aircraft that
we<00:02:28.660> haven't<00:02:29.170> released<00:02:29.740> that<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:31.590> sure

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
we haven't released that we have sure

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.620 
we haven't released that we have sure
anything's<00:02:33.010> possible<00:02:33.070> Glenn<00:02:33.730> but<00:02:34.150> if<00:02:34.390> you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
anything's possible Glenn but if you

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.120 
anything's possible Glenn but if you
want<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.870> go<00:02:34.960> that<00:02:35.140> route<00:02:35.380> then<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.710> think<00:02:35.980> what

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
want to go that route then I think what

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.470 
want to go that route then I think what
you<00:02:36.250> need<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.520> do<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.790> honest<00:02:37.090> about<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.390> is

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
you need to do to be honest about it is

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.630 
you need to do to be honest about it is
go<00:02:37.660> back<00:02:37.840> through<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.260> decades<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.280> indeed

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
go back through the decades and indeed

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.430 
go back through the decades and indeed
generations<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.600> reports<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.170> we've

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
generations of reports that we've

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.740 
generations of reports that we've
collected<00:02:41.770> of<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.490> these<00:02:42.760> types<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.270> objects

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
collected of of these types of objects

that people have been seeing and and let

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.230 
that people have been seeing and and let
me<00:02:46.960> just<00:02:46.990> add<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.490> is<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> phenomenon

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
me just add that this is a phenomenon

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.000 
me just add that this is a phenomenon
that<00:02:49.300> not<00:02:49.660> simply<00:02:50.170> civilian<00:02:50.620> people<00:02:50.920> have

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
that not simply civilian people have

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.280 
that not simply civilian people have
been<00:02:51.130> dealing<00:02:51.310> with<00:02:51.460> but<00:02:51.790> US<00:02:52.780> military

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
appear to be UFOs I don't know what else

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.240 
appear to be UFOs I don't know what else
you<00:02:57.670> would<00:02:57.760> call<00:02:58.000> them<00:02:58.210> objects<00:02:58.750> that

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
you would call them objects that

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.940 
you would call them objects that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
military pilots have frequently said are

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.770 
military pilots have frequently said are
disc-shaped<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.520> look<00:03:03.820> exotic<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.450> behave

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
disc-shaped that look exotic that behave

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.540 
disc-shaped that look exotic that behave
in<00:03:04.930> unusual<00:03:05.020> ways<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:05.920> have<00:03:06.100> violated

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
in unusual ways and that have violated

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.330 
in unusual ways and that have violated
sensitive<00:03:07.270> airspace<00:03:07.870> time<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.860> again<00:03:09.070> for

sensitive airspace time and again for

sensitive airspace time and again for
many<00:03:09.520> many<00:03:09.730> years<00:03:09.820> so<00:03:10.660> if<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:11.020> is<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> secret

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
many many years so if this is a secret

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.700 
many many years so if this is a secret
covert<00:03:12.640> project<00:03:13.390> as<00:03:14.110> many<00:03:14.320> people<00:03:14.620> have

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
covert project as many people have

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.250 
covert project as many people have
speculated<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.880> seems<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:16.360> be<00:03:16.480> going<00:03:16.930> on<00:03:17.050> in<00:03:17.200> a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
speculated it seems to be going on in a

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.170 
speculated it seems to be going on in a
rather<00:03:17.560> confrontational<00:03:18.430> provocative<00:03:19.000> way

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
rather confrontational provocative way

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.940 
rather confrontational provocative way
it<00:03:19.480> really<00:03:19.900> doesn't<00:03:20.170> have<00:03:20.260> an<00:03:20.350> explanation

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
it really doesn't have an explanation

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.980 
it really doesn't have an explanation
all<00:03:21.010> right<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.310> John<00:03:21.610> you<00:03:22.060> think<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.600> this<00:03:22.780> is

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
all right so John you think that this is

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.080 
all right so John you think that this is
there<00:03:23.800> was<00:03:23.890> some<00:03:24.130> sort<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.490> cover-up<00:03:24.820> at

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
there was some sort of a cover-up at

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.870 
there was some sort of a cover-up at
least<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.570> FAA<00:03:26.290> was<00:03:26.650> not<00:03:26.950> real<00:03:27.490> honest

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
least the the FAA was not real honest

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.080 
least the the FAA was not real honest
with<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.180> when<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:28.420> first<00:03:28.600> asked<00:03:29.380> right<00:03:29.560> oh

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
with you when you first asked right oh

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.370 
with you when you first asked right oh
yeah<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.120> went<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.540> FAA<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.140> they<00:03:32.200> said

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
yeah I went to the FAA and they said

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.080 
yeah I went to the FAA and they said
