00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.839
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.820
 a new test video with the canon 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:17.279
 legria hfm 406 and this is again quasi 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.109
 my dogs test video so I test the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.080
 you can by my mouth and that's me 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.210
 now with the camera 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.689
 45 cm away from his nose now 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.060
 here 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.789
 and that's why this is my test video 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.210
 on the subject of how well does the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.920
 canon legria recordings and if you look 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 here the whole small hair means 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.020
 I'm 34 inches away and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:56.760
 Now man is in oberstaufen 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:58.890
 I am calm when I am this 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.840
 I will do test video for you 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.439
 once every one sucks 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.180
 then always a little bit the claim 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.000
 fun 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.560
 Let's have a look at the paws 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.810
 so distance the camera to march at 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.299
 only about 4 inches three to four inches on 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:26.479
 the display super sharp to see each 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.310
 hairs I help post very carefully 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.900
 and yes I will this time even again 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.290
 Start playing pieces together 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
 Watch how far the camera makes it 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.890
 leipzig just will not stop like that 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.060
 back again and slowly again 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 just now listen and yes you can 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.820
 so many details see if the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.420
 Veterinarian veterinarians use this technique 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.170
 would 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:57.110
 I think they would be much more 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.420
 see more fat eg complete with her 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.579
 illnesses or injuries to these 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.990
 verses 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.690
 well that comes at the edge 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.000
 without sponsor as said canon legria hfm 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.780
 406 full hd 50 frames per second 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.310
 and yes I would in automatic mode that 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.040
 means the camera takes all 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.650
 settings even before white balance 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.799
 focus and so on here I am now 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.560
 yes about 3 cm away I try 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.360
 the ten situation also closer to 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.250
 zoom so the hairs are real 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:45.440
 absolutely sharp at some point well is clear 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.150
 the camera always has the focus on so now 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.010
 I try to zoom in on the eye run 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.879
 distance I would now to 30 35 cm 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.799
 appreciate and then we just start 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.220
 to zoom in on something 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:07.579
 It is not the original movie yet 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:10.400
 test here but still no idea I 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.760
 would appreciate it maybe 20 25 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.060
 fach zoom now at this point he 25 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440
 Fach I mix deeply I want to per 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.819
 hand and you can also do that 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.400
 image stability was 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.040
 it does not recognize him but that's 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.420
 Well the picture is very calm though I am 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.630
 here by hand forever more extreme 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.090
 turn health little blur so 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.109
 That makes the camera quite sensational 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.109
 It has an optical image stabilizer 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.440
 now in this sum I will do 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.230
 move 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.109
 in the eye and fit stays really sharp 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.280
 I'm maybe ten centimeters now 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.280
 still away from the eyes 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.480
 you get to be happy 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.370
 Well that should be mine too 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.790
 been small test video close up 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.900
 his 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.620
 See you in another video 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.519
 later again and until then, I say up 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.820
 next time 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.820
 ciao
