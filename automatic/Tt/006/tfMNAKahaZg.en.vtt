00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
awesome so what I usually do is I

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.599 
awesome so what I usually do is I
usually<00:00:27.490> set<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.150> weight<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:29.019> about<00:00:29.400> 120<00:00:30.400> to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
usually set the weight to about 120 to

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.760 
usually set the weight to about 120 to
give<00:00:30.759> it<00:00:30.880> some<00:00:31.089> resistance<00:00:31.659> the<00:00:32.349> more<00:00:32.590> weight

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
give it some resistance the more weight

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.760 
give it some resistance the more weight
you<00:00:32.829> add<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.760> better<00:00:33.910> leverage<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:34.480> have<00:00:34.770> you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
you add the better leverage you have you

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.470 
you add the better leverage you have you
don't<00:00:36.040> want<00:00:36.220> the<00:00:36.310> late<00:00:36.460> waits<00:00:36.790> to<00:00:37.030> be<00:00:37.060> light

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
don't want the late waits to be light

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.120 
don't want the late waits to be light
because<00:00:37.960> what<00:00:38.140> will<00:00:38.260> happen<00:00:38.320> is<00:00:38.770> that<00:00:38.920> you'll

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
because what will happen is that you'll

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.190 
because what will happen is that you'll
tip<00:00:39.400> right<00:00:39.640> over<00:00:39.970> you'll<00:00:40.150> fall<00:00:40.360> back<00:00:40.600> so<00:00:40.990> make

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200

obviously you're going to have to step a
little<00:00:53.920> bit<00:00:54.160> wider<00:00:54.340> because<00:00:54.940> you're<00:00:55.150> holding

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
little bit wider because you're holding

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.930 
little bit wider because you're holding

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
of measure myself out to know how I

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.069 
of measure myself out to know how I
should<00:01:05.439> be<00:01:05.799> squatting<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.549> then<00:01:07.090> I<00:01:07.180> step<00:01:07.540> one

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
should be squatting and then I step one

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.859 
should be squatting and then I step one
step<00:01:08.229> back<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:09.280> just<00:01:09.610> start<00:01:09.790> squatting<00:01:10.060> to

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
step back and I just start squatting to

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.190 
step back and I just start squatting to
my<00:01:11.050> butt<00:01:11.260> to<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.500> ground<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:13.240> looks<00:01:13.480> hard<00:01:13.750> but

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
my butt to the ground it looks hard but

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.450 
my butt to the ground it looks hard but
it's<00:01:14.350> really<00:01:14.500> not<00:01:14.770> because<00:01:15.190> when<00:01:15.340> you're

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
it's really not because when you're

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.300 
it's really not because when you're
pulling<00:01:15.730> it<00:01:16.030> down<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.409> weights<00:01:17.680> just<00:01:17.890> seem

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
pulling it down the weights just seem

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.580 
pulling it down the weights just seem
lighter<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:19.060> way<00:01:19.270> for<00:01:19.750> some<00:01:20.080> reason<00:01:20.409> so<00:01:20.530> it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
lighter that way for some reason so it

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.950 
lighter that way for some reason so it
looks<00:01:20.740> heavier<00:01:21.100> than<00:01:21.250> it<00:01:21.430> seems<00:01:21.730> it's<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.720> great

and then I step back and then I lean
forward<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.340> little<00:01:48.430> bit<00:01:48.549> you<00:01:48.790> want<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.120> make

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
forward a little bit you want to make

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.000 
forward a little bit you want to make
sure<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.780> you're<00:01:49.810> leaning<00:01:50.229> back<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.770> little

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
sure that you're leaning back a little

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.740 
sure that you're leaning back a little
bit<00:01:51.190> because<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.760> allows<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.390> pull<00:01:52.600> the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
bit because it allows you to pull the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.230 
bit because it allows you to pull the
weight<00:01:52.930> down<00:01:53.140> better<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:54.729> allows<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.090> to
