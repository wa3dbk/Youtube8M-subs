I<00:00:01.159> just<00:00:02.159> got<00:00:02.700> through<00:00:03.080> unboxing<00:00:04.080> everything

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
I just got through unboxing everything

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.520 
I just got through unboxing everything
that<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.220> did<00:00:05.609> for<00:00:05.759> global<00:00:06.089> sent<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.420> me<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:07.099> got

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
that I did for global sent to me I got

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.499 
that I did for global sent to me I got
the<00:00:10.530> 48<00:00:10.920> volt<00:00:11.099> charger<00:00:13.969> so<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.000> think<00:00:15.150> that

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the 48 volt charger so I think that

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.369 
the 48 volt charger so I think that
there<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.960> go

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
there you go

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.500 
there you go

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
48 volt charger scat an LED indicator on

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.599 
48 volt charger scat an LED indicator on
the<00:00:21.630> front<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.160> let<00:00:23.160> me<00:00:23.279> know<00:00:23.369> when<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
the front of it let me know when the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.230 
the front of it let me know when the
charge<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:23.910> complete<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:25.310> got<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:27.539> 12<00:00:27.869> volt

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
charge is complete I got the 12 volt

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.790 
charge is complete I got the 12 volt
battery<00:00:30.240> charger<00:00:32.360> for<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:34.410> I

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
battery charger for it there it it's I

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.090 
battery charger for it there it it's I
mean<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.700> really<00:00:36.120> small<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.980> it's<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
mean it's really small but it's a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.700 
mean it's really small but it's a
trickle<00:00:38.430> charge<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> doesn't<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.390> that

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
trickle charge so it doesn't have that

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.260 
trickle charge so it doesn't have that
they<00:00:40.710> carry<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.070> lot<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.219> amps<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.120> wives

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
like a push button that you would see

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.420 
like a push button that you would see
mini<00:01:36.000> chuck-e-cheeses<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:37.110> David<00:01:38.009> Buster's

mini chuck-e-cheeses or David Buster's
or<00:01:38.790> anything<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> push<00:01:40.500> button

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
or anything like that it's a push button

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.560 
or anything like that it's a push button
this<00:01:42.030> housing<00:01:42.509> right<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:42.960> was<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> button

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
this housing right here was a button

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.440 
this housing right here was a button
that<00:01:45.570> activates<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:47.070> switch<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:47.790> now<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that activates this switch here now if I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.080 
that activates this switch here now if I
can<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.750> close<00:01:49.049> enough<00:01:49.520> when<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.880> this

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
can get close enough when you see this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.850 
can get close enough when you see this
you<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.659> these<00:01:51.899> prongs<00:01:52.200> come<00:01:52.590> through

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
you see that these prongs come through

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.620 
you see that these prongs come through
this<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.939> squeeze<00:01:54.240> these<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
this if you squeeze these in that

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.140 
this if you squeeze these in that
the<00:01:55.930> switch<00:01:56.200> will<00:01:56.440> pop<00:01:56.590> off<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.820> can<00:01:57.970> get

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
the switch will pop off and you can get

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.420 
the switch will pop off and you can get
to<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.420> actual<00:01:58.960> switch<00:01:59.260> it's<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.040> two<00:02:00.220> pole

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
to the actual switch it's a two pole

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.870 
to the actual switch it's a two pole
switch<00:02:00.870> so<00:02:01.870> don't<00:02:02.080> it'll<00:02:02.380> control<00:02:02.920> up<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.159> at

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
switch so don't it'll control up to at

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.410 
switch so don't it'll control up to at
least<00:02:04.270> two<00:02:04.840> things<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.790> means<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.120> has<00:02:07.150> two

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
least two things so it means it has two

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.050 
least two things so it means it has two
channels<00:02:07.780> are<00:02:07.870> normally<00:02:08.229> closed<00:02:08.590> in<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.670> common

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
channels are normally closed in a common

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.310 
channels are normally closed in a common
or<00:02:10.560> yes<00:02:11.560> normally<00:02:12.070> closed<00:02:12.370> MC<00:02:14.610> yes<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:17.080> switch

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
or yes normally closed MC yes the switch

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.990 
or yes normally closed MC yes the switch
stays<00:02:17.650> normally<00:02:18.130> closed<00:02:18.400> yet<00:02:18.700> normally

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
stays normally closed yet normally

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.940 
stays normally closed yet normally
closed<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.390> common<00:02:19.690> nova<00:02:20.140> closed<00:02:20.380> in<00:02:20.590> common

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
closed and common nova closed in common

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.380 
closed and common nova closed in common
so<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> normally<00:02:23.950> closed

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
so it's in the normally closed

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.660 
so it's in the normally closed
positioned<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:27.190> current<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.640> flowing

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
positioned so the current is flowing

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.870 
positioned so the current is flowing
through<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.300> signals<00:02:28.690> flowing<00:02:28.870> through<00:02:29.170> when

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
through the signals flowing through when

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.940 
through the signals flowing through when
you<00:02:30.880> sit<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.780> says<00:02:32.050> okay<00:02:32.320> you're<00:02:32.530> good

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
you sit on it it says okay you're good

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.479 
you sit on it it says okay you're good
to<00:02:33.100> go<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.400> breaks<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.890> when<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.130> get<00:02:36.310> up

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
to go it breaks it but when you get up

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.850 
to go it breaks it but when you get up
it<00:02:37.090> reconnects<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.230> switches<00:02:38.530> everything

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
it reconnects it and switches everything

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.330 
it reconnects it and switches everything
to<00:02:38.920> ground<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.370> cuts<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.640> off<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.260> very<00:02:41.950> simple

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
to ground and cuts it off so very simple

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.260 
to ground and cuts it off so very simple
very<00:02:42.670> easy<00:02:42.790> setup<00:02:43.300> there<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.640> then<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.850> got<00:02:46.030> a

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
very easy setup there but then I got a

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.250 
very easy setup there but then I got a
full<00:02:46.660> set<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.870> blades<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:48.160> go<00:02:48.280> my<00:02:48.459> blade<00:02:48.640> mounts

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
full set of blades to go my blade mounts

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.009 
full set of blades to go my blade mounts
yeah<00:02:50.260> that's<00:02:50.709> that's<00:02:51.040> nice<00:02:51.810> those<00:02:52.810> are<00:02:52.930> pretty

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
yeah that's that's nice those are pretty

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.030 
yeah that's that's nice those are pretty
heavy-duty<00:02:53.350> these<00:02:53.769> blades<00:02:54.690> not<00:02:55.690> not<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.920> be

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
heavy-duty these blades not not to be

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.780 
heavy-duty these blades not not to be
joked<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.550> these<00:02:57.760> things<00:02:58.030> are<00:02:58.239> amazing

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
joked with these things are amazing

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.500 
joked with these things are amazing
almost<00:03:00.790> commercial<00:03:01.420> quality<00:03:03.299> then<00:03:04.299> you've

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
almost commercial quality then you've

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.870 
almost commercial quality then you've
got<00:03:04.750> additional<00:03:05.260> retros<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.430> have<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.640> seats

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
got additional retros you have the seats

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.400 
got additional retros you have the seats
which<00:03:07.120> retro<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:09.040> one<00:03:09.220> retro<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:11.170> now<00:03:11.350> you

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
which retro that's one retro and now you

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.039 
which retro that's one retro and now you
have<00:03:11.620> two<00:03:11.920> more<00:03:12.130> retros<00:03:12.519> this<00:03:12.850> one<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.900> gonna

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
have two more retros this one is gonna

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.229 
have two more retros this one is gonna
go<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.440> line<00:03:15.209> with<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.299> Scylla<00:03:16.510> needs<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:18.459> it

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
go in line with the Scylla needs and it

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.120 
go in line with the Scylla needs and it
reduces<00:03:19.959> back<00:03:20.739> flow<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.220> spikes<00:03:21.489> on<00:03:22.299> your<00:03:23.130> DC

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
reduces back flow and spikes on your DC

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.580 
reduces back flow and spikes on your DC
current<00:03:24.989> which<00:03:25.989> would<00:03:26.140> be<00:03:26.230> really<00:03:26.560> really

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
current which would be really really

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.949 
current which would be really really
nice<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.670> case<00:03:27.880> your<00:03:28.180> your<00:03:28.540> deck<00:03:28.810> is

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
nice so in case your your deck is

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.190 
nice so in case your your deck is
loading<00:03:29.350> up<00:03:29.530> or<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.579> know<00:03:30.700> your<00:03:31.090> drive<00:03:31.660> motors

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
loading up or you know your drive motors

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.020 
loading up or you know your drive motors
loading<00:03:32.620> up<00:03:32.769> or<00:03:32.950> something<00:03:33.220> like<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.370> it

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
loading up or something like that it

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.770 
loading up or something like that it
doesn't<00:03:34.269> cause<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:35.140> cut<00:03:35.320> off<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:37.420> inverter

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
doesn't cause it to cut off the inverter

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.330 
doesn't cause it to cut off the inverter
to<00:03:37.959> cut<00:03:38.140> off<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.440> controls<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.070> that's

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
to cut off the controls of that that's

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.420 
to cut off the controls of that that's
pretty<00:03:39.579> cool<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.209> then<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.950> the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
pretty cool and then you have on the

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.000 
pretty cool and then you have on the
battery<00:03:43.360> terminal<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:45.100> have<00:03:45.130> another<00:03:45.519> diode

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
battery terminal you have another diode

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.630 
battery terminal you have another diode
that<00:03:48.540> prevents<00:03:50.340> drainage<00:03:51.340> of<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.760> battery<00:03:52.590> so

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
that prevents drainage of the battery so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.850 
that prevents drainage of the battery so
that'll<00:03:55.019> be<00:03:56.019> really<00:03:56.260> nice<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.620> battery

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
that'll be really nice the battery

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.110 
that'll be really nice the battery
you'll<00:03:56.950> never<00:03:57.160> drain<00:03:57.400> down<00:03:57.610> now<00:03:57.880> at<00:03:58.030> this

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
you'll never drain down now at this

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.509 
you'll never drain down now at this
point<00:03:58.329> you're<00:03:58.480> just<00:03:58.630> gonna<00:03:58.720> isolate<00:03:59.519> this

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
point you're just gonna isolate this

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.770 
point you're just gonna isolate this
right<00:04:00.730> here<00:04:00.880> will<00:04:00.970> isolate<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.510> battery

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
right here will isolate the battery

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.460 
right here will isolate the battery
so<00:04:03.820> from<00:04:04.820> from<00:04:05.120> ground<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.750> diode<00:04:06.050> only

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
so from from ground so a diode only

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.470 
so from from ground so a diode only
allows<00:04:07.160> electricity<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.060> current<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.450> flow

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
allows electricity and current to flow

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.170 
allows electricity and current to flow
in<00:04:08.750> one<00:04:08.780> direction<00:04:09.080> unless<00:04:09.590> it's<00:04:09.890> failed<00:04:10.180> so

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
in one direction unless it's failed so

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.140 
in one direction unless it's failed so
then<00:04:11.870> we<00:04:11.990> know<00:04:12.310> backflow<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.340> electricity<00:04:13.790> to

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
then we know backflow of electricity to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.789 
then we know backflow of electricity to
ground<00:04:14.450> while<00:04:14.960> the<00:04:15.430> lot<00:04:16.430> more<00:04:16.640> sits<00:04:16.880> idle

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
ground while the lot more sits idle

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.150 
ground while the lot more sits idle
anyway<00:04:19.299> that's<00:04:20.299> my<00:04:20.510> grocery<00:04:20.930> list<00:04:21.160> it's

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
anyway that's my grocery list it's

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.030 
anyway that's my grocery list it's
amazing

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
amazing
