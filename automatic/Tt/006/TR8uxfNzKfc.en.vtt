00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
contacts your after are actually your

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.030

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
messaging and your a browser you can't

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.760 
messaging and your a browser you can't
change<00:03:04.310> these<00:03:04.760> but<00:03:05.750> I'm<00:03:06.110> kind<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.650> getting

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
change these but I'm kind of getting

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.710 
change these but I'm kind of getting
used<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.280> them<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:07.610> don't<00:03:07.760> worry<00:03:07.940> about<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.270> I

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
used to them so don't worry about that I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.280 
used to them so don't worry about that I
think<00:03:09.440> it's<00:03:09.560> pretty<00:03:09.740> easy<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:10.130> get<00:03:10.310> used<00:03:10.610> to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
think it's pretty easy to get used to

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.870 
think it's pretty easy to get used to
you<00:03:12.290> won't<00:03:12.470> have<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.650> problem<00:03:12.800> with<00:03:13.100> that<00:03:13.130> and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
you won't have a problem with that and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.090 
you won't have a problem with that and
you<00:03:14.030> see<00:03:14.240> here's<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.540> app<00:03:14.810> launcher<00:03:15.380> it's

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
you see here's the app launcher it's

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.300 
you see here's the app launcher it's
kind<00:03:16.490> of<00:03:16.640> 3d<00:03:17.180> one<00:03:18.170> thing<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.500> don't<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.770> is<00:03:19.130> if

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
kind of 3d one thing I don't like is if

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.610 
kind of 3d one thing I don't like is if
you're<00:03:19.460> all<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.610> way<00:03:19.730> down<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.360> some<00:03:21.320> people
