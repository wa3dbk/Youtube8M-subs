00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.520
 fragment of what this level has been 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.300

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.129

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.270

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.670

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.089

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.610

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.500
 vary a bit the characters 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.020
 we enter the gallery and we have to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.080
 go to the shelf where they are 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.660

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.190

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.159
 metal that will cost us four 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.429
 miter blocks 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.429

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.280

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.920

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 jumps on this table 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.650
 great and the blocks will have melted 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.900
 of me thrill 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.900

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.069

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.080
