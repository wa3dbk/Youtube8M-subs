00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.150
 fünkchen fund manager textraw angel forward 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.150

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.460
 What kind of card is that 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.730
 no it is a legend that is yes 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.630
 my first legend here manfred 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:29.080
 burgsmüller my dear mr 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.070
 Gesangsverein is because that stands here 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.900
 which club 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.800
 I can not recognize that 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.800
 dortmund or yes yes it is above 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.450
 Legend sensational a really nice 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.210
 map 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.920
 I think that will be my team times 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.180
 what is still here so better 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.000
 you almost would not be now except me 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.380
 war franz beckenbauer or similar 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.970
 so now I'm back with reasons 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.010
 also to collect people's tags on 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:04.180
 so defend harmony frankfurt and it is 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:10.690
 new transfer marcus less 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:12.700
 interesting, I find the midfield of 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.950
 VfB Stuttgart 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:22.300
 It is Raphael Holzhauser knows from the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.000
 vfb he stuttgart course always four 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.040
 gates 04 this has to be new 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.370
 nonsense it is it is let your stall 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.230
 from schalke 04 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.570
 and again a bvb card this time 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.580
 it is defensive and it is mats hummels 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.040
 star player winzers here are none 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:50.140
 clue and it is oliver church trolley 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.420
 really from the moon that was mine now 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.239
 first five cards i always worry here 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.820
 a little bit like course load 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:05.100
 a little bit are so out of the 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.100
 second book there are already flowers 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:21.180
 By the way, the noise I love it 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:25.080
 had two over head that's all right 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.730
 not so from the gate of fortuna 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.990
 düsseldorf that's right it 's nice 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:39.600
 spider fabian giefer fabian giefer 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:43.890
 matchwinner from fortuna first fc 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:50.459
 nuremberg midfield it is newer 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.870
 transfer lukas api and khaki that were 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:58.500
 already the first two cards three 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:05.540
 still follow midfield borussia 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.540
 monchengladbach and it is lukas 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.489
 midfield gladbach so then stay still 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.400
 Two churches in the end over always make 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.040
 I would have to continue with the Fc Augsburg 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.859
 now no how can that be 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.410
 wagner clan yes that was the penultimate 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.820
 card and one I still have it now 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.450
 is schmalke defense and it is now 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.430
 just once I say now times 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.040
 match winner 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.460
 papadopoulos no it is the captain 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.010
 If he was the cool of the times should be 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.660
 come to the bavaria and that one year 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.160
 after wanting to be newer 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.770
 We calmly believe harling back then 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.180
 but it is not 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.430
 come what I think a pity because 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.890
 he is also german national player and 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.510
 I think should stop at the FC Bayern 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.130
 Hold as many Germans as possible 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.280
 National players play as well as at 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.900
 It's as modern as Schalke's 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.550
 not only from Bavaria but now 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.450
 from a german point of view, I find that 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.669
 the topclubs around as many Germans as possible 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.290
 national player game should 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.870
 and here again my legend card 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.970
 and yes my big question to you 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.790
 so now how does he see that with the 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.620
 German comes 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.390
 top clubs do you see that as I do 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.400
 should there as many German 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.260
 National players are playing because of us 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.940
 clubs also in foreign countries so in the 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.490
 Champions League and in Europe 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.260
 present league or said that is 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.580
 you do not care you would rather have great 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.810
 stars like arjen robben ribery or 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.410
 maybe even a cristiano 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.140
 Ronaldo or the Messi in the Bundesliga 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.400
 rather such or rather the good ones 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.080
 german as özil and khedira 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.440
 maybe back to the bundesliga 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.480
 pick up 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.530
 how do you see that just writes 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.090
 times in the comments 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.220
 maybe I'll do a special video 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.860
 if enough people to join 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.230
 Well that 's it for this match attax 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.120
 extra video maybe I'll do it 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.930
 Again, now that I am the first time 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.340
 a legend card has magix extra 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.660
 I did not really collect that much 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.080
 that was just as incidental as it was 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.650
 There were no star cards this time 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.150
 and yes maybe it continues and 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.860
 I look forward to your comments 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.340
 I'm probably up to the master 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.340
 next time
