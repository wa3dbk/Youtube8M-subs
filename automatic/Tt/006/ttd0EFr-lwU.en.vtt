00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.769
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.990
 sixth part of road to millions i 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.360
 I showed in the previous video 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.190
 why I have not had a red in the last time 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.769
 could million coins make parts 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.269
 because somehow my auction 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.140
 I've been looking crazy for gambling 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.730
 that has several more a year and now 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.830
 That's why I could not search for players 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.810
 and do not act and so on 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.160
 problem is now fixed but thanks 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.349
 I also have or too 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.540
 Sorry, I have 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.350
 even from ea 2000 people received 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.120
 that is also very nice if yes my 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.100
 exchange agreement probably something 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.640
 would have been higher but is only now 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.580
 never mind 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.250
 2000 coins are also on and yes in 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.960
 I treat this consequence with gold 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.490
 players from the Bundesliga 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.470
 last time it was silver player 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.990
 this time the gold players and me 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.520
 I'll show you some players 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.900
 which you can do well and you 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.960
 I've already got four here 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.240
 auctions won with three players 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.500
 that's twice van der Pfeffer 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.869
 vaart and once for song to santana 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.469
 you can do well with the three players 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.679
 act 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:13.189
 at procedure and with van der vaart have 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:16.609
 This time, yes, as usual 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.780
 always up to at the time at the 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.689
 I did not do that super player 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.009
 but otherwise I have always on the here 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.179
 formation ensured that I got mine 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.369
 these two players again 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.899
 not done with these two players 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.799
 that's why you can do that then 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.560
 buy cheaper 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.100
 and then she has to be cheaper too 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.390
 Selling that is quite logical 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.569
 and then we just go here now 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.219
 times by the procedure we have for 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.619
 Bought 4300 coins and we put that 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:46.729
 now for 4800 people on it 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.350
 So minus the fee so 250 Munich 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.509
 win 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.939
 that is not so much now 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.410
 but that is also because that very much 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.990
 many people 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:02.550
 bid on gold players or better 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.340
 said to act with gold player and there 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.660
 does it happen then that one 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.000
 not so many bargains can do 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:14.100
 Bargains you can play at silver 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.290
 do a lot better and yes you do 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.090
 must stop synonymous with the silver players 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.920
 then wait longer until she sells 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.390
 that will be with the golfers 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.790
 otherwise they will be quite fast 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.720
 you sell you see her van der vaart 4 1 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.950
 2 2 for 4400 bought like 4800 try 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.860
 we sell it 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.230
 felipe santana here as I said 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.970
 not paying attention to the exhibition 343 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.750
 that's why he is not worth so much for 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.209
 We bought 4500 for 5000 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.970
 then sell coins for sale 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.220
 52 people also win completely 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.640
 decayed because I have again 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.290
 respected on the lineup is 4411 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.380
 not so popular now 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.800
 but still one of the better ones 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.140
 who remember bought and put 4400 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.570
 have him there now for 5200 on it 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.640
 we win a lot 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.730
 made everything for six hours like her 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.130
 See and yes, I will stay here now 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.989
 continue with silver players is there 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.350
 we had directly offer 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.060
 We namely for or try now 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.769
 So I have me free but so 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.780
 a limit to where I go with this 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:27.150
 setup is the limit 5700 because you 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.940
 him at the moment for 6200 people 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.900
 can sell and then we offer 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.080
 have a look right here and see if 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.120
 we will get it then too 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:45.060
 and at the moment it does not look so good 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.620
 out and yes that's what we'll leave 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.140
 offer equal on those with and on 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.030
 and then you will yes if we 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.890
 have luck and still others silver 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.049
 but I want to play for example now 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.250
 say other gold players from the 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.989
 If I show the 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 auctioneer then I'll show you too 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.690
 I'll take them downstairs as usual 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.880
 who write in the description with 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.360
 which did not act like me 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.040
 would 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.650
 I am often told that I am 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.590
 then please also write her prices 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.870
 for which I bought and 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.079
 for which I can sell one so 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.670
 I can not do that but I do 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.109
 Do not think that will bring you much 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.830
 because the prices are relative 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.210
 quickly change again and I believe for 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.600
 you would be better if you then 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.060
 just for the cheapest immediately 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.890
 purchase prices and looks and yes to the 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.360
 and then I'll call you right back 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.380
 if we have a few players left 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.360
 have bought or sold until the same 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.460
 as you can see, we have three out of four 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.470
 vendors selling van der vaart 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:52.980
 for 4800 farfan for also 4800 and 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.510
 felipe santana for even 5000 have but 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.919
 for the money we have here now 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.090
 have already taken two new ones 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.000
 bought players and that is once 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.280
 robert lewandowski of borussia dortmund 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.810
 I have not got that right now 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.210
 I thought that was the formations 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.210
 just pretty much so to speak and so on 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:16.710
 we have bought for 3500 standing 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.630
 for 4200 on it and then we hope 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.050
 that we get the sale for this 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.290
 Price and here is my first info 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.050
 player with whom we can act and 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:31.290
 Although this is all hands or aaron hunt 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.620
 anyway and we have in the 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.080
 4 3 3 formation for 13,500 bought and 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.050
 tried him for 14,500 now 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.130
 would sell well there as well 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.620
 make a profit and also for three hours 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:50.870
 and then let's see if we can do this 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.870
 things here all sale 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.600
 As you can see, we sold everything 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.030
 Once here, hand in the sleeves 4 3 3 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.770
 formation for 14,500 so i believe 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.850
 13,500 we had bought that 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.000
 not sure anymore but that would have to be 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.500
 have been there and so have 1000 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.090
 1000 coins will be made 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.200
 not been due to the fee 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:20.820
 therefore rather 500 coins then we have 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.740
 here the decay in 44 11 for 5200 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.680
 We sold 4400 back then 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.510
 I think so bought well 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.210
 made a profit and then we have here 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.640
 still robert lewandowski for 4200 have 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.860
 with that sold and yes that one now 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.770
 Here are the players with whom I am in this 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.640
 I'll succeed as well 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.419
 again below in the description 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.240
 write 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.940
 and yes that was it from the sixth 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.690
 part road to millions i hope he has 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.030
 you like it 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.930
 you're going to be part of the next part 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.930
 until then
