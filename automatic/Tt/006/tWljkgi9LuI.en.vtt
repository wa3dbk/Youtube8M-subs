00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
jungle biome is its basic a random

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.200 
jungle biome is its basic a random
generated<00:00:43.800> part<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> world<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:44.969> we

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
generated part of the world just like we

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.889 
generated part of the world just like we
really<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> deserts<00:00:46.379> swamps<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.300> but

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
really have to deserts swamps so on but

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.139 
really have to deserts swamps so on but
in<00:00:49.110> jungle<00:00:49.440> biomes<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:50.039> tool<00:00:50.340> trees<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.910> I

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
in jungle biomes we get tool trees and I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.119 
in jungle biomes we get tool trees and I
mean<00:00:51.510> massive<00:00:51.780> trees<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.739> four<00:00:53.010> blocks

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
mean massive trees like it's four blocks

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.360 
mean massive trees like it's four blocks
wide<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.210> four<00:00:55.199> blocks<00:00:55.440> basically<00:00:55.860> next<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
wide so four blocks basically next to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.830 
wide so four blocks basically next to
each<00:00:56.460> other<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:57.030> literally<00:00:57.480> stand

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
each other and they literally stand

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
each other and they literally stand
really<00:00:58.140> tall<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.309> anyway<00:00:59.789> that'd<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.120> good

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
really tall so I'm anyway that'd be good

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.880 
really tall so I'm anyway that'd be good
if<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.510> need<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> lot<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> wood<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.680> only

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
if we need a lot of wood but the only

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
if we need a lot of wood but the only
bad<00:01:02.129> thing<00:01:02.160> about<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.090> my<00:01:03.210> opinion<00:01:03.300> is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
bad thing about this in my opinion is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.870 
bad thing about this in my opinion is
the<00:01:04.140> wood<00:01:04.589> isn't<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:05.040> good<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.369> normal<00:01:05.700> word

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the wood isn't as good as normal word

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
the wood isn't as good as normal word
like<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.210> awkward<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> best

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
like but awkward I think is the best

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.820 
like but awkward I think is the best
it's<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.689> good<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.650> bad

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
it's not as good as that so that's a bad

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.070 
it's not as good as that so that's a bad
thing<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.210> jungles<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.750> also

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
thing so if we get jungles that also

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
thing so if we get jungles that also
means<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.770> getting<00:01:14.100> something<00:01:14.520> I've

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
means we would be getting something I've

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
go hunting we don't want

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.030 
go hunting we don't want
creepers<00:01:48.210> coming<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.509> behind<00:01:48.630> us<00:01:49.040> over

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
creepers coming up behind us over

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.520 
creepers coming up behind us over
auditions<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:51.000> will<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.720> getting<00:01:51.990> side<00:01:52.200> woods

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
auditions or will be getting side woods

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
auditions or will be getting side woods
so<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.009> also<00:01:53.130> put<00:01:53.430> stairs<00:01:54.180> upside<00:01:54.570> down

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
so we can also put stairs upside down

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.080 
so we can also put stairs upside down
ceteris<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:55.950> stuff<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.520> we'll<00:01:56.969> be

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
ceteris all stuff like that we'll be

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.230 
ceteris all stuff like that we'll be
getting<00:01:57.360> new<00:01:57.390> blocks<00:01:57.810> which<00:01:58.850> glowstone<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.149> I

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
getting new blocks which glowstone and I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.880 
getting new blocks which glowstone and I
think<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.689> triggers<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.350> you're<00:02:01.530> near<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
think it triggers it if you're near it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
think it triggers it if you're near it
it<00:02:02.040> turns<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.509> sure<00:02:03.689> how<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> does

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it turns on I'm not sure how it does

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.840 
it turns on I'm not sure how it does
that<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.009> rumors<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.759> I've

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.850 
that but that's just rumors of what I've
heard<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.689> anyway<00:02:06.930> all<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.259> side<00:02:07.469> would<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
heard but anyway all this side would it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.350 
heard but anyway all this side would it
be<00:02:07.979> good<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.190> you're<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.520> builder<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.179> like

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
be good if you're a builder and you like

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.580 
be good if you're a builder and you like
things<00:02:09.720> looking<00:02:10.080> pretty<00:02:10.530> awesome

things looking pretty awesome

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.750 
things looking pretty awesome
because<00:02:11.739> you<00:02:11.830> know<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.069> doesn't<00:02:12.250> know<00:02:12.400> me<00:02:12.610> when

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
because you know it doesn't know me when

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
I'm trying to make an archway on the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.390 
I'm trying to make an archway on the
house<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.769> see<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.040> bottom<00:02:15.310> of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
house and you have to see the bottom of

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.220 
house and you have to see the bottom of
the<00:02:15.489> out<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.760> wood<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.599> pretty<00:02:16.930> annoying

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the out of wood that is pretty annoying

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.500 
the out of wood that is pretty annoying
for<00:02:17.500> me<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.769> be<00:02:17.890> honest<00:02:18.160> so<00:02:19.000> another<00:02:19.269> feature

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
for me to be honest so another feature

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.420 
for me to be honest so another feature
would<00:02:19.750> be<00:02:19.900> massive<00:02:20.349> if<00:02:20.500> they<00:02:20.650> do<00:02:20.709> put<00:02:21.069> into<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
would be massive if they do put into the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.070 
would be massive if they do put into the
update<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.090> i'm<00:02:22.209> not<00:02:22.360> sure<00:02:22.540> if<00:02:22.660> they<00:02:22.750> are<00:02:22.780> yet

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
update but i'm not sure if they are yet

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.540 
update but i'm not sure if they are yet
they<00:02:23.590> did<00:02:23.800> tweet<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.220> other<00:02:24.340> day<00:02:24.519> that

they did tweet the other day that
they're<00:02:25.030> working<00:02:25.239> on<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.599> is<00:02:25.870> texture<00:02:26.709> packs

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
they're working on it is texture packs

they're working on it is texture packs
coming<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.519> xbox<00:02:27.940> 360<00:02:28.510> now<00:02:29.110> they<00:02:29.290> have

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
coming to xbox 360 now they have

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.589 
coming to xbox 360 now they have
uploaded<00:02:30.040> gameplay<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:31.060> but<00:02:31.239> i<00:02:31.299> don't<00:02:31.510> know

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
uploaded gameplay of it but i don't know

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.539 
uploaded gameplay of it but i don't know
if<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:31.810> fake<00:02:32.049> or<00:02:32.260> anything<00:02:32.560> like<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.739> but

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
if it's fake or anything like that but

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.539 
if it's fake or anything like that but
I'm<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.940> sum<00:02:34.150> here<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.620> don't<00:02:35.620> know<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.280> does

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
I'm the sum here I don't know it does

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:37.800 
I'm the sum here I don't know it does
look<00:02:36.730> like<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:37.060> but<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.269> don't<00:02:37.299> think<00:02:37.660> we'll<00:02:37.750> be

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
look like it but I don't think we'll be

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.839 
look like it but I don't think we'll be
getting<00:02:38.019> massive<00:02:38.530> things<00:02:38.769> like<00:02:39.010> dookie<00:02:39.489> craft

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
getting massive things like dookie craft

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.550 
getting massive things like dookie craft
obviously<00:02:40.450> being<00:02:40.629> get<00:02:40.900> unbelievable<00:02:41.319> shaders

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
obviously being get unbelievable shaders

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.110 
obviously being get unbelievable shaders
because<00:02:41.980> no<00:02:42.160> exports<00:02:42.700> will<00:02:42.819> be<00:02:42.910> able<00:02:43.000> to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
because no exports will be able to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.150 
because no exports will be able to
handle<00:02:43.269> that<00:02:43.569> but<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.110> think<00:02:44.319> we<00:02:44.410> might<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:44.680> be

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
handle that but I think we might just be

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.430 
handle that but I think we might just be
able<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.400> get<00:02:45.519> some<00:02:45.780> small<00:02:46.780> one<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:46.959> it's<00:02:47.319> like

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
able to get some small one so it's like

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.979 
able to get some small one so it's like
different<00:02:47.650> color<00:02:48.209> things<00:02:49.209> like<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.540> so

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
different color things like that just so

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.350 
different color things like that just so
it<00:02:50.110> varies<00:02:50.560> our<00:02:51.010> game<00:02:51.280> play<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.519> bit<00:02:51.760> because<00:02:51.910> to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
it varies our game play a bit because to

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.180 
it varies our game play a bit because to
be<00:02:52.450> us<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.780> think<00:02:53.290> most<00:02:53.500> people<00:02:53.769> next<00:02:53.980> once

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
be us I think most people next once

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.780 
be us I think most people next once
again<00:02:54.400> stick<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.880> same<00:02:55.200> same<00:02:56.200> old<00:02:56.349> buddy

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
again stick of the same same old buddy

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.580 
again stick of the same same old buddy
texture<00:02:57.790> packs<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.720> although<00:02:58.989> they<00:02:59.290> didn't

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
texture packs but although they didn't

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.199 
texture packs but although they didn't
say<00:02:59.739> it's<00:02:59.920> definite<00:03:00.430> they<00:03:00.610> did<00:03:00.819> say<00:03:01.030> they're

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
say it's definite they did say they're

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.089 
say it's definite they did say they're
working<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.599> it<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.170> means<00:03:02.470> sometime<00:03:02.980> in

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
working on it so that means sometime in

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.710 
working on it so that means sometime in
the<00:03:03.190> future<00:03:03.340> no<00:03:03.790> matter<00:03:03.940> what<00:03:04.209> we<00:03:04.390> will<00:03:04.569> be

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
the future no matter what we will be

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.350 
the future no matter what we will be
getting<00:03:04.840> texture<00:03:05.440> packs<00:03:05.760> one<00:03:06.760> last<00:03:07.000> thing<00:03:07.209> is

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
getting texture packs one last thing is
