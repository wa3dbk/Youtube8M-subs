00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
have been you know either top 32 or

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.919 
have been you know either top 32 or
maybe<00:00:29.460> even<00:00:29.550> top<00:00:29.910> aide<00:00:30.119> who<00:00:30.480> knows<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.869> he

maybe even top aide who knows that he

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.359 
maybe even top aide who knows that he
would<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.170> top<00:00:31.349> 32<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:31.980> got<00:00:32.070> his<00:00:32.219> invite

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
who need X was the same deck that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.900 
who need X was the same deck that
Frankie<00:00:44.969> had<00:00:45.090> lost<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.730> what<00:00:47.730> you're

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
Frankie had lost to and what you're

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
Frankie had lost to and what you're
about<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:50.129> video<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.530> part<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.829> one

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
about to see is a video of part of one

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.369 
about to see is a video of part of one
of<00:00:53.280> Leo's<00:00:53.750> matches<00:00:54.750> there<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.260> they

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
of Leo's matches there because they

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.840 
of Leo's matches there because they
didn't<00:00:55.530> allow<00:00:55.620> us<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> record<00:00:56.250> video<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:56.789> I

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
didn't allow us to record video but I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.689 
didn't allow us to record video but I
was<00:00:57.000> able<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.360> record<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.780> little<00:00:58.050> bit<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.699> what

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
was able to record a little bit of what

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.939 
was able to record a little bit of what
we're<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.960> about<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we're going on and it's about that I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.759 
we're going on and it's about that I
think<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.730> called<00:01:03.090> una<00:01:03.899> by<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> year<00:01:04.589> or

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
think is called una by in the year or

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.960 
think is called una by in the year or
something<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.960> dragunity<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:08.250> light

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
something like that dragunity and light

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
something like that dragunity and light
and<00:01:09.119> darkness<00:01:09.420> dragon<00:01:09.960> combo<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.650> got

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and darkness dragon combo that they got

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.969 
and darkness dragon combo that they got
that<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.520> equip<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that it can equip it you know and it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.660 
that it can equip it you know and it
goes<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.729> well<00:01:15.170> regardless<00:01:16.170> there's<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
goes out of it well regardless there's a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
goes out of it well regardless there's a
combo<00:01:17.670> loop<00:01:17.909> there<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.780> their

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
combo loop there that you can have their

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.630 
combo loop there that you can have their
and<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:21.350> Leo's<00:01:22.350> mess<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:22.950> about<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.369> see

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and in Leo's mess which are about to see

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.609 
and in Leo's mess which are about to see
you're<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.720> how<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.170> loop<00:01:25.380> came

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you're going to see how that loop came

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.670 
you're going to see how that loop came
about<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.810> basically<00:01:27.810> how<00:01:27.990> hard<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.500> to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
about and basically how hard it is to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
about and basically how hard it is to
break<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> loop<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.970> go<00:01:30.360> check<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.600> out

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
break the loop so go check that out

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:45.230 
break the loop so go check that out
right<00:01:30.990> now

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:02:35.110 

Wow

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:03:00.810 

Oh

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:28.290 

I'm<00:03:01.820> gonna<00:03:01.970> meet<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.180> down<00:03:02.300> there

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.309 

when<00:03:29.300> he's<00:03:29.420> destroyed<00:03:29.569> in<00:03:29.959> sent<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.230> the

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
when he's destroyed in sent to the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:04:01.550 
when he's destroyed in sent to the
Graveyard<00:03:30.739> we<00:03:30.860> get<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.130> activate

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:12.210 

yeah<00:04:08.730> sure<00:04:09.730> he<00:04:09.849> sensitively<00:04:10.799> lying<00:04:11.799> guidance

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
yeah sure he sensitively lying guidance

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.160 
yeah sure he sensitively lying guidance
was<00:04:12.400> portrayed<00:04:12.819> a<00:04:12.970> great<00:04:13.239> strike<00:04:13.870> strong

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
was portrayed a great strike strong

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.250 
was portrayed a great strike strong
presence<00:04:14.709> inside<00:04:15.670> providing

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.860 

I<00:04:21.860> will<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:22.950> saw<00:04:23.160> how<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.400> loop<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:24.000> it's

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
I will you saw how that loop is it's

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.870 
I will you saw how that loop is it's
really<00:04:25.020> really<00:04:25.350> difficult<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:26.280> break<00:04:26.640> out<00:04:26.850> of

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
really really difficult to break out of

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.910 
really really difficult to break out of
just<00:04:27.210> let<00:04:27.420> you<00:04:27.540> know<00:04:27.570> Leo<00:04:28.080> wasn't<00:04:28.410> able<00:04:28.680> to

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
just let you know Leo wasn't able to

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.330 
just let you know Leo wasn't able to
break<00:04:29.130> out<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.490> loop<00:04:29.790> there<00:04:30.260> um<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:32.130> only

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
break out of that loop there um the only

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.490 
break out of that loop there um the only
ways<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.700> I've<00:04:32.820> seen<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.900> loop<00:04:34.200> being

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
ways that I've seen that loop being

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.220 
ways that I've seen that loop being
disrupted<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.340> if<00:04:35.640> you<00:04:36.030> can<00:04:36.240> get<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.630> browning

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
disrupted is if you can get a browning

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.930 
disrupted is if you can get a browning
out<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.680> basically<00:04:38.640> pop<00:04:39.470> will<00:04:40.470> bounce<00:04:40.710> back

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
out and basically pop will bounce back

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.960 
out and basically pop will bounce back
both<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.150> them<00:04:42.240> back<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.630> his<00:04:42.750> hand<00:04:43.080> on<00:04:43.970> that

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
both of them back to his hand on that

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.700 
both of them back to his hand on that
look<00:04:45.240> breaks<00:04:45.540> it<00:04:45.750> up<00:04:45.840> or<00:04:46.400> if<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:48.450> happen<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.590> be

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
look breaks it up or if you happen to be

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.860 
look breaks it up or if you happen to be
on<00:04:49.860> your<00:04:50.040> turn<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.550> you're<00:04:50.640> able<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.390> bring

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
on your turn and you're able to bring

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.230 
on your turn and you're able to bring
out<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:54.140> Stardust<00:04:55.140> Dragon<00:04:55.650> when<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:56.580> destroy

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
out a Stardust Dragon when you destroy

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.190 
out a Stardust Dragon when you destroy
the<00:04:57.720> back<00:04:58.560> row<00:04:58.830> or<00:04:59.450> when<00:05:00.450> it<00:05:00.570> gets<00:05:00.750> destroyed

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
the back row or when it gets destroyed

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
the back row or when it gets destroyed
the<00:05:01.950> lad<00:05:03.110> negate<00:05:04.110> its<00:05:04.290> effect<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.800> destroying

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
the lad negate its effect of destroying

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.910 
the lad negate its effect of destroying
everything<00:05:05.550> on<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.970> field<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.920> therefore

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
everything on the field and therefore

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.730 
everything on the field and therefore
the<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:09.210> creature<00:05:09.480> stays<00:05:09.810> on<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.200> field<00:05:10.230> so

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
the that creature stays on the field so

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.330 
the that creature stays on the field so
you're<00:05:11.400> not<00:05:11.490> able<00:05:11.670> to<00:05:11.940> equip<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.780> with<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:14.160> lad

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
you're not able to equip it with the lad

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.230 
you're not able to equip it with the lad
there<00:05:16.160> and<00:05:17.160> that's<00:05:17.340> basically<00:05:17.550> all<00:05:17.820> you<00:05:18.090> can

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
there and that's basically all you can

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.200 
there and that's basically all you can
compose<00:05:18.570> bounce<00:05:19.560> them<00:05:19.830> that's<00:05:20.070> basically<00:05:20.490> one

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
compose bounce them that's basically one

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.580 
compose bounce them that's basically one
of<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.420> only<00:05:21.570> ways<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.080> could<00:05:22.140> see<00:05:22.440> that

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
of the only ways that I could see that

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.760 
of the only ways that I could see that
you<00:05:22.650> can<00:05:22.980> break<00:05:23.880> out<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.180> that<00:05:24.540> loop<00:05:25.170> there<00:05:25.530> or

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
you can break out of that loop there or

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.910 
you can break out of that loop there or
if<00:05:28.770> they<00:05:29.250> attack<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.730> I<00:05:29.790> guess<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.180> can

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
if they attack you I guess you can

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.190 
if they attack you I guess you can
dimensional<00:05:31.920> prison<00:05:32.340> it<00:05:32.640> you<00:05:33.210> know<00:05:33.420> or<00:05:33.690> D<00:05:33.930> fish

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
dimensional prison it you know or D fish

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.900 
dimensional prison it you know or D fish
or<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.410> monsters<00:05:35.220> out<00:05:35.400> there<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.760> make<00:05:35.880> sure

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
or the monsters out there and make sure

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.850 
or the monsters out there and make sure
that<00:05:36.120> they<00:05:36.300> don't<00:05:36.390> even<00:05:36.660> come<00:05:36.870> come<00:05:37.500> back<00:05:37.650> or

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
that they don't even come come back or

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.880 
that they don't even come come back or
if<00:05:37.950> you<00:05:38.250> play<00:05:38.460> gravekeeper's<00:05:39.560> basically<00:05:40.560> that

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
if you play gravekeeper's basically that

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.550 
if you play gravekeeper's basically that
loop<00:05:41.070> doesn't<00:05:41.430> really<00:05:41.550> happen<00:05:41.790> because<00:05:42.560> you

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
loop doesn't really happen because you

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.950 
loop doesn't really happen because you
have<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.830> necrovalley<00:05:44.130> out<00:05:44.750> so<00:05:45.750> it's<00:05:45.900> a

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
have the necrovalley out so it's a

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.350 
have the necrovalley out so it's a
difficult<00:05:46.170> loop<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.980> get<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.670> get<00:05:47.850> over<00:05:48.210> if

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
difficult loop to get to get over if

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.360 
difficult loop to get to get over if
they<00:05:48.510> do<00:05:48.570> get<00:05:48.960> it<00:05:49.140> and<00:05:49.320> if<00:05:49.890> you're<00:05:50.040> not<00:05:50.130> playing

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
they do get it and if you're not playing

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.610 
they do get it and if you're not playing
with<00:05:50.520> any<00:05:50.730> of<00:05:50.880> those<00:05:50.970> cards<00:05:51.480> there<00:05:51.720> you<00:05:52.470> know

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
with any of those cards there you know

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.560 
with any of those cards there you know
try<00:05:53.280> to<00:05:53.340> bring<00:05:53.580> our<00:05:53.700> brown<00:05:53.940> it<00:05:54.210> can<00:05:54.360> bounce

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
try to bring our brown it can bounce

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.060 
try to bring our brown it can bounce
both<00:05:54.870> of<00:05:55.050> them<00:05:55.170> back<00:05:55.350> and<00:05:55.590> then<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:55.800> loop<00:05:55.950> is

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
both of them back and then the loop is

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.790 
both of them back and then the loop is
broken<00:05:56.520> there<00:05:56.700> so<00:05:57.330> go<00:05:58.050> up<00:05:58.260> with<00:05:58.410> you<00:05:58.590> guys

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
broken there so go up with you guys

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.160 
broken there so go up with you guys
again<00:05:59.550> saw<00:05:59.910> the<00:05:59.940> dragoon<00:06:00.330> ADIZ<00:06:00.540> little<00:06:00.840> man<00:06:00.990> is

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
again saw the dragoon ADIZ little man is

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.300 
again saw the dragoon ADIZ little man is
actually<00:06:01.470> going<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.680> start<00:06:01.890> playing<00:06:02.130> your

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
actually going to start playing your

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.310 
actually going to start playing your
guna<00:06:02.610> knees<00:06:02.760> now<00:06:03.000> we<00:06:03.330> made<00:06:03.570> up<00:06:03.720> a<00:06:03.840> deck<00:06:04.020> which<00:06:04.200> I

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
guna knees now we made up a deck which I

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.230 
guna knees now we made up a deck which I
mean<00:06:04.500> we're<00:06:04.680> starting<00:06:05.310> to<00:06:05.370> practice<00:06:05.880> with<00:06:06.030> it

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
mean we're starting to practice with it

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.010 
mean we're starting to practice with it
it<00:06:07.140> does<00:06:07.350> require<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.770> lot<00:06:08.040> of<00:06:08.750> thinking<00:06:09.750> and

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
it does require a lot of thinking and

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.560 
it does require a lot of thinking and
deciding<00:06:10.530> which<00:06:10.920> ones<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.730> ditch<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.480> the

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
deciding which ones to ditch to the

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.180 
deciding which ones to ditch to the
graveyard<00:06:13.110> which<00:06:13.290> ones<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.590> equipped<00:06:14.070> and

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
graveyard which ones to equipped and

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.530 
graveyard which ones to equipped and
everything<00:06:14.580> it's<00:06:14.700> a<00:06:14.730> very<00:06:14.910> interesting<00:06:15.030> deck

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
everything it's a very interesting deck

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.540 
everything it's a very interesting deck
and<00:06:15.690> it's<00:06:15.810> very<00:06:15.960> fast<00:06:16.290> deck<00:06:16.620> no<00:06:17.220> man's<00:06:17.460> gonna

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
and it's very fast deck no man's gonna

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.250 
and it's very fast deck no man's gonna
have<00:06:17.700> fun<00:06:17.910> playing<00:06:18.210> it<00:06:18.450> and<00:06:18.870> I'll<00:06:19.020> let<00:06:19.170> you

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
have fun playing it and I'll let you

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.840 
have fun playing it and I'll let you
guys<00:06:19.440> know<00:06:19.620> how<00:06:19.800> it<00:06:20.160> goes<00:06:20.310> with<00:06:20.520> it<00:06:20.550> you<00:06:20.820> know

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
guys know how it goes with it you know

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.870 
guys know how it goes with it you know
maybe<00:06:21.180> once<00:06:21.810> we<00:06:21.990> got<00:06:22.110> a<00:06:22.170> better<00:06:22.410> build<00:06:22.710> of<00:06:23.460> it

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
maybe once we got a better build of it

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.640 
maybe once we got a better build of it
and<00:06:24.060> we'll<00:06:24.750> put<00:06:24.960> it<00:06:25.050> up<00:06:25.110> so<00:06:25.290> you<00:06:25.320> guys<00:06:25.530> can
