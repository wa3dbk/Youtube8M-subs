00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 yes 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello how I am good news before 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.820
 start this video I wanted to thank you 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.070
 all and all the good reception that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.980
 I had a lot of thanks last week 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.189
 and well let's move on to the content of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.869
 this video I'm going to show you the rotation 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 this week I will comment on the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.790
 characters is a bit above so 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.050
 we're going to do it well, here we have the 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.970
 rotation of this week to the characters 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.980
 I'll tell you a little bit like that 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.559
 for those who go a little lost 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.110
 that you know more or less where they go like this 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.290
 that we started with brand 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.270
 brand is a p hits me a lot in little 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.210
 time is to say that it is not very 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.180
 easily the enemy with a combo has 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.520
 a passive that leaves a gift to the enemy 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.070
 after casting a spell what happens 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.070
 that if we are going to throw another spell has 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.020
 left an extra effect for example if you 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.900
 we throw a q while the enemy has 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.110
 this mini-switch in question we throw 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.979
 q tunear one go if you throw one and going 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.070
 to propagate this 2 to the allies to 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.050
 our enemies and has the last one is 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.590
 very important for inks because 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.920
 much paste and paste in area and also 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.080
 which is a very good character for me and for 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.080
 the inks also good because we passed 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.390
 now with link link that the ine is a very 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.690
 Good character good very good carry 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.399
 bot online basically for its the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.410
 range that has both the auto attacks 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.680
 as in the cv that is a shot online 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.660
 straight hits a lot and also has a lot 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.549
 range and that makes it go very well that 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.930
 tighten very well in the bot line and 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.270
 then he has 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.830
 the r that we like so much everyone that 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.020
 serves to finish off those enemies 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.570
 that we are going to a very little life that 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.330
 we can not do anything with them because there 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.220
 here is the link to take your last and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.720
 finish them and good to finish and once 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.710
 for everything so with the other team 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.020
 well then we pass now to grace greivis 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.570
 is one of carrie that squeezes a lot 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.870
 very powerful both in early game and in 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.120
 mid oled game also has its passive that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.130
 during a combat your 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.500
 armor and magic resistance so 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.070
 every time it becomes stronger and 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.709
 his damage is based on his skills more than 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.440
 in auto attack and in the inks 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.040
 has a pretty strong bus with the with 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.349
 the ultimate 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.349
 well then we pass now with hard band 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.260
 fourth hard and we usually see so much in 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.269
 top as in jungle and it is also very 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.489
 cash to redeem why can 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.069
 make the combo with the flag and also 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.260
 lock yourself with the last one that optics 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.689
 so much hate of him that he locks you in a 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.090
 in an area and from there you do not go away 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:54.480
 it sticks a lot, it lasts a lot and that makes 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.909
 be a great champion well then we go to 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.959
 as an organ personally I believe that 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.689
 morgana is a pretty character 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.540
 Completito especially in energy game 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.909
 makes the farmer much easier thanks to 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.590
 damage that it has in area then you can 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.189
 get rid of some gun that or thanks to 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.919
 shield and then especially very important 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.139
 indispensable the last one in team fights 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.269
 since it does a lot of damage in the area and also 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.669
 is tunea so I think that for 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.549
 start using a p morgana mid is a 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:26.579
 pretty good character okay let's go 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.609
 to comment on their cases is a character 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.560
 top that good is a little flojilla al 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.409
 principle but it is based on going permeating 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.490
 go permeating with the cv that gives us 3 of 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.800
 damage for each 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.510
 killed and good and see that the 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.430
 principle will cost a bit but then 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.250
 based on that drug you're going to get 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.980
 the endurance you want and the necessary 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.050
 for a late good game good 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.900
 we now pass with bouquets 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.510
 basically it's a jungle that is going very well 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.550
 especially to win with what is done 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.820
 ball runs a lot and when it hits 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.680
 an enemy slows him down and then in the 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.010
 If you are going to escape, you can use 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.210
 the town that makes the enemy for his 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.130
 eggs attack it and good besides scale 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.710
 as a tank and that makes it very effective 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.160
 in the game it is worth it then we finally go to 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.920
 my super favorite that is area to say 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.630
 of her in early game is very effective is 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.120
 very beneficial for the team since 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.700
 has the cv that does a lot of damage and 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.610
 then the cure that also heals quite 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.190
 to the cardio in question then in let 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.350
 game and these two are these two skills 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.240
 and no longer they take so important and is given 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.410
 step to the last 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.979
 it is an area that in one of tim fain 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.930
 it's basically what you can do 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.660
 win a game or not so I think 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.160
 which is a very good support 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.319
 Well, well, we're about to 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.680
 finish this week's rotation 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:55.169
 let's go with twisted fight trust &amp; faith 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.409
 a p mid that has a good poke or the 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.649
 true 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.899
 can have a lot of variety of skills already 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:04.539
 that you can study can achieve with the 

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:08.909
 letters but mostly it matters 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:11.199
 from the last one with which you can 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.849
 be transported on a large part of the map 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.949
 to make cattle with the team 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.469
 Well, we have already finished the rotation of 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:21.080
 this week to discuss it we ended up with 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:24.319
 thirst to tell you is a character 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.699
 new that we still do not know how to approach it 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.800
 we do not know its limits 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.520
 many people play it in mid but there are 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.910
 people also playing it in top or in 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.870
 as a jungle 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.780
 is a killer his skills are based on 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.550
 shadows plays a lot with shadows and 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.610
 good but I'll leave you in your 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.170
 hands try it out and have it look like 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.540
 well so far the relationship of 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.430
 this week for more information on 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.200
 the ego of legends to subscribe to 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.280
 halo channel bp and see you in the 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.280
 next video goodbye
