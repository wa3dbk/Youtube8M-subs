00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
of from what I understand at least the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.750 
of from what I understand at least the
feel<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.770> from<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> movie<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.550> far<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
feel that I have from the movie so far I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
feel that I have from the movie so far I
haven't<00:01:02.969> seen<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> yet<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.690> course<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:04.559> not

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
haven't seen it yet of course it's not

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.980 
haven't seen it yet of course it's not
out<00:01:04.890> yet<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.210> feel<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.600> get<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
out yet but the feel that I get is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.230 
out yet but the feel that I get is
basically<00:01:07.920> these<00:01:08.070> monsters<00:01:08.610> emerge<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.119> then

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
basically these monsters emerge and then

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.760 
basically these monsters emerge and then
different<00:01:09.659> cultures<00:01:10.020> around<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.380> world<00:01:10.560> like

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
different cultures around the world like

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
different cultures around the world like
from<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.700> understand<00:01:12.060> gipsy<00:01:12.420> danger<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
from what I understand gipsy danger is

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.859 
from what I understand gipsy danger is
probably<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> American<00:01:14.600> fight<00:01:15.600> back

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
probably kind of the American fight back

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.740 
probably kind of the American fight back
and<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> American<00:01:16.860> unit<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.390> use<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and the American unit that we use to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.030 
and the American unit that we use to
fight<00:01:18.930> back<00:01:19.110> against<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> monsters<00:01:19.860> just

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
fight back against the monsters just

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.260 
fight back against the monsters just
with<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.250> whole<00:01:20.400> paint<00:01:20.670> scheme<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> know

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
with the whole paint scheme of you know

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.020

red white and blue kind of overarching

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
red white and blue kind of overarching
the<00:01:24.630> entire<00:01:24.960> character<00:01:25.290> design<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:25.950> crimson

the entire character design with crimson

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.399 
the entire character design with crimson
typhoon<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.909> kind<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.630> Asian<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.229> guess

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
typhoon it's kind of the Asian I guess

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.859

Chinese robot that they use something

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.270 
Chinese robot that they use something
like<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.229> that's<00:01:31.560> at<00:01:31.710> least<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.979> feel<00:01:32.130> that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
like that that's at least a feel that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.370 
like that that's at least a feel that
I've<00:01:32.369> gotten<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.150> designs<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.229> not

I've gotten from the designs I'm not

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.870 
I've gotten from the designs I'm not
sure<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.619> that's<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:35.040> they<00:01:35.159> intended<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.640> do

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
sure if that's what they intended to do

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.940 
sure if that's what they intended to do
but<00:01:36.060> nonetheless<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.560> feel<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.920> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
but nonetheless that's the feel that I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
but nonetheless that's the feel that I
have<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.610> will<00:01:38.729> focus<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> actual<00:01:39.540> toy

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
have but we will focus on the actual toy

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.980 
have but we will focus on the actual toy
here<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.710> let's<00:01:40.890> zoom<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> first

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
here so let's zoom on up and the first

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.170 
here so let's zoom on up and the first
thing<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> point<00:01:44.159> out<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
thing that I want to point out is the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.870 
thing that I want to point out is the
articulation<00:01:45.710> now<00:01:46.710> from<00:01:47.040> my<00:01:47.189> experience<00:01:47.729> with

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
articulation now from my experience with

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.440 
articulation now from my experience with
necrotize

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
necrotize

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.179 
necrotize
the<00:01:48.840> articulation<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.439> never<00:01:49.619> something<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
the articulation was never something to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.060 
the articulation was never something to
brag<00:01:50.729> about<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:52.320> articulation<00:01:52.530> here<00:01:52.979> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
brag about and the articulation here is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.850 
brag about and the articulation here is
definitely<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.790> Marvel<00:01:54.360> Legends<00:01:54.720> level<00:01:55.200> but

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
definitely not Marvel Legends level but

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.219 
definitely not Marvel Legends level but
for<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> negatory<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:57.689> really

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
for a negatory it is really really

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.660 
for a negatory it is really really
really<00:01:58.409> good<00:01:58.649> now<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.159> not<00:01:59.310> sure<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.549> they

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
really good now I'm not sure if they

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580 
really good now I'm not sure if they
have<00:01:59.820> gotten<00:02:00.240> better<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.780> late<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.409> from

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
have gotten better as of late but from

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.770 
have gotten better as of late but from
my<00:02:01.740> experience<00:02:02.119> necro<00:02:03.119> toys<00:02:03.299> used<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.659> be<00:02:03.750> very

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
my experience necro toys used to be very

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.600 
my experience necro toys used to be very
very<00:02:04.049> sluggish<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> articulation<00:02:05.430> used

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
very sluggish in the articulation used

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.130 
very sluggish in the articulation used
to<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:08.450> ineffective<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.810> terms<00:02:09.989> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
to be kind of ineffective in terms of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.229 
to be kind of ineffective in terms of
they<00:02:10.770> would<00:02:10.920> give<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.340> articulation<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:12.000> it

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
they would give your articulation but it

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.610 
they would give your articulation but it
was<00:02:12.360> kind<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.290> spot

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
was kind of in spot

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.080 
was kind of in spot
where<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.159> was<00:02:14.280> useless<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.849> would<00:02:14.940> look

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
where it was useless and would look

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.610 
where it was useless and would look
unnatural<00:02:15.629> like<00:02:15.750> they<00:02:15.959> would<00:02:16.080> give<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.379> cut

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
unnatural like they would give you a cut

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.220 
unnatural like they would give you a cut
at<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.370> thigh<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.909> when<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.690> twisted<00:02:19.170> it

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
at the thigh and when you twisted it

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.350 
at the thigh and when you twisted it
looks<00:02:19.409> like<00:02:19.560> your<00:02:19.680> thigh<00:02:20.129> got<00:02:20.610> blown<00:02:20.940> up<00:02:20.970> into

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
looks like your thigh got blown up into

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.210 
looks like your thigh got blown up into
two<00:02:21.510> pieces<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.989> mean<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.379> looks<00:02:22.620> very<00:02:22.890> very

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
weird but now the articulation on this

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.140 
weird but now the articulation on this
thing<00:02:25.379> is<00:02:25.470> very<00:02:25.860> very<00:02:26.310> very<00:02:26.459> good<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:26.819> well<00:02:26.849> as

they're<00:03:12.900> very<00:03:13.500> bulky<00:03:13.829> they're<00:03:14.099> not<00:03:14.310> smooth

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
they're very bulky they're not smooth

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.949 
they're very bulky they're not smooth
like<00:03:14.760> they're<00:03:15.060> not<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.690> know<00:03:15.720> they're<00:03:15.900> not

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
like they're not you know they're not

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.020 
like they're not you know they're not
very<00:03:16.079> acrobatic<00:03:16.739> or<00:03:17.340> anything<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:17.970> that

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
very acrobatic or anything like that

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.849 
very acrobatic or anything like that
they're<00:03:18.269> just<00:03:18.299> kind<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:18.780> honking<00:03:19.319> forces

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
they're just kind of like honking forces

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.490 
they're just kind of like honking forces
just<00:03:20.010> coming<00:03:20.489> on<00:03:20.609> head-to-head<00:03:21.500> one-to-one

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
just coming on head-to-head one-to-one

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.099 
just coming on head-to-head one-to-one
you<00:03:22.680> know<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.150> same<00:03:24.329> goes<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.930> same

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
you know and the same goes here the same

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.349 
you know and the same goes here the same
goes<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:25.500> because<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.639> articulation<00:03:27.180> is

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
goes here because the articulation is

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.089 
goes here because the articulation is
just<00:03:27.690> enough<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.109> make<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.290> believable<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:29.010> be

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
just enough to make it believable to be

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.970 
just enough to make it believable to be
a<00:03:29.129> ginormous<00:03:29.879> robot<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.169> we've<00:03:31.560> got<00:03:31.739> enough

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
a ginormous robot so we've got enough

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.119 
a ginormous robot so we've got enough
maneuverability<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:33.090> arms<00:03:33.450> here<00:03:33.980> as<00:03:34.980> you

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
maneuverability in the arms here as you

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.369 
maneuverability in the arms here as you
can<00:03:35.190> see<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.790> could<00:03:35.940> twist<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.299> all<00:03:36.599> around

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
can see we could twist that all around

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.800 
can see we could twist that all around
we've<00:03:37.859> got<00:03:38.040> shoulder<00:03:38.579> articulation<00:03:39.180> which<00:03:39.510> is

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
we've got shoulder articulation which is

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.059 
we've got shoulder articulation which is
a<00:03:39.840> little<00:03:40.169> limited<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.560> would<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.799> loved<00:03:40.980> to

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
a little limited I would have loved to

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.099 
a little limited I would have loved to
see<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.879> tiny<00:03:42.120> little<00:03:42.419> bit<00:03:42.599> more<00:03:42.930> but

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
see just a tiny little bit more but

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.349 
see just a tiny little bit more but
because<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.590> guard<00:03:43.889> right<00:03:44.160> here<00:03:44.359> the

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
because of this guard right here the

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.849 
because of this guard right here the
forearm<00:03:45.720> guard<00:03:45.810> here<00:03:46.169> it<00:03:46.349> definitely<00:03:46.739> is

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
forearm guard here it definitely is

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.920 
forearm guard here it definitely is
limited<00:03:47.340> we've<00:03:47.940> got<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> ball<00:03:48.359> jointed<00:03:48.690> wrist

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
limited we've got a ball jointed wrist

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.720 
limited we've got a ball jointed wrist
which<00:03:49.139> is<00:03:49.260> really<00:03:49.560> really<00:03:49.769> nice<00:03:49.919> for<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.639> know

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
which is really really nice for you know

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.430 
which is really really nice for you know
punching<00:03:51.269> poses<00:03:51.629> and<00:03:51.810> stuff<00:03:51.840> like<00:03:52.139> that<00:03:52.290> so

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
punching poses and stuff like that so

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.920 
punching poses and stuff like that so
that's<00:03:52.560> cool<00:03:52.889> mine<00:03:53.730> on<00:03:54.329> this<00:03:54.480> hand<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.900> a

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
that's cool mine on this hand is a

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.569 
that's cool mine on this hand is a
little<00:03:55.109> bit<00:03:55.290> loose<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:56.010> hand<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:56.370> much

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
little bit loose on this hand it's much

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.569 
little bit loose on this hand it's much
tighter<00:03:56.849> so<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.569> guess<00:03:58.290> that's<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.650> depending

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
tighter so I guess that's just depending

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.129 
tighter so I guess that's just depending
how<00:03:59.699> lucky<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.120> get<00:04:00.269> we've<00:04:00.660> got<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.870> ball

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
how lucky you get we've got a ball

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.890 
how lucky you get we've got a ball
jointed<00:04:01.620> upper<00:04:02.370> torso<00:04:02.790> here<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.209> guess<00:04:03.510> kinda

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
jointed upper torso here I guess kinda

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.960 
jointed upper torso here I guess kinda
in<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.049> ribcage<00:04:04.260> area<00:04:04.859> which<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.699> cool

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
in the ribcage area which is cool

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.939 
in the ribcage area which is cool
because<00:04:06.209> again<00:04:06.629> allowing<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:07.169> to<00:04:07.379> you<00:04:07.829> know

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
because again allowing you to you know

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.069 
because again allowing you to you know
kind<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.250> set<00:04:08.459> up<00:04:08.579> a<00:04:08.790> big<00:04:09.000> punching<00:04:09.599> pose<00:04:09.810> or

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
kind of set up a big punching pose or

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.330 
kind of set up a big punching pose or
something<00:04:10.410> blocking<00:04:10.709> or<00:04:11.040> something<00:04:11.280> like

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
something blocking or something like

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.220 
something blocking or something like
that<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.639> know<00:04:11.730> what<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:11.849> mean<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.419> that<00:04:12.870> would

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
that you know what I mean so that would

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.069 
that you know what I mean so that would
be<00:04:13.319> really<00:04:13.470> handy<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.699> that's<00:04:14.879> nice<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.329> of

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
be really handy so that's nice and of

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.439 
be really handy so that's nice and of
course<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.440> legs<00:04:16.650> are<00:04:16.859> also<00:04:17.430> articulated<00:04:17.940> so

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
course the legs are also articulated so

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.680 
course the legs are also articulated so
you<00:04:18.539> can<00:04:18.810> kick<00:04:19.199> on<00:04:19.380> forward<00:04:19.919> get<00:04:20.370> back<00:04:20.690> you

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
you can kick on forward get back you

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.020 
you can kick on forward get back you
could<00:04:21.870> get<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.740> nice<00:04:22.919> little<00:04:23.190> joint<00:04:23.820> right<00:04:23.969> here

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
could get a nice little joint right here

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.940 
could get a nice little joint right here
in<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.390> knee<00:04:24.599> and<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.770> lot<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.729> mean

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
in the knee and a lot and I mean

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.680 
in the knee and a lot and I mean
a lot<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.280> maneuverability<00:04:27.790> at<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.480> foot

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
a lot of maneuverability at the foot

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.630 
a lot of maneuverability at the foot
which<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:29.020> very<00:04:29.290> important<00:04:29.770> towards<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.520> know

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
kind of more dynamic poses because you

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.070 
kind of more dynamic poses because you
need<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:32.650> good<00:04:32.890> little<00:04:33.100> strong<00:04:33.460> base<00:04:34.030> for<00:04:34.960> your

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
need a good little strong base for your

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.710 
need a good little strong base for your
figures<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.640> definitely<00:04:37.000> available

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
here in spades so that is definitely

and I really like that about the figure

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.090 
and I really like that about the figure
indeed<00:04:46.050> as<00:04:47.050> far<00:04:47.230> as<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.350> paint<00:04:47.500> job<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.830> really

indeed as far as the paint job I really

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.740 
indeed as far as the paint job I really
loved<00:04:48.280> that<00:04:48.430> too<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.850> it's<00:04:49.210> very<00:04:49.450> very<00:04:49.630> nice

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
as I said before you might notice

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.760 
as I said before you might notice
obviously<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.390> it's<00:04:52.510> primarily<00:04:52.900> blue<00:04:53.440> with

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
obviously that it's primarily blue with

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.580 
obviously that it's primarily blue with
details<00:04:54.700> of<00:04:54.880> red<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.300> white<00:04:55.570> stripes<00:04:56.350> all

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
details of red and white stripes all

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.200 
details of red and white stripes all
over<00:04:56.920> but<00:04:57.040> I<00:04:57.100> really<00:04:57.430> loved<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.730> paint<00:04:57.970> wash

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
over but I really loved the paint wash

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.670 
over but I really loved the paint wash
on<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.510> entire<00:04:58.810> thing<00:04:59.080> of<00:04:59.230> kind<00:04:59.440> of<00:04:59.530> you<00:04:59.590> know

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
on the entire thing of kind of you know

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.920 
on the entire thing of kind of you know
made<00:04:59.860> it<00:04:59.890> making<00:05:00.400> it<00:05:00.520> look<00:05:00.750> much<00:05:01.750> more

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
made it making it look much more

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.600 
made it making it look much more
metallic<00:05:02.200> because<00:05:02.650> if<00:05:02.950> you<00:05:03.130> take<00:05:03.370> away<00:05:03.490> that

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
metallic because if you take away that

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.910 
metallic because if you take away that
paint<00:05:04.030> wash<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.960> robot<00:05:05.260> will<00:05:05.440> look<00:05:05.590> way<00:05:05.890> too

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
paint wash the robot will look way too

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.860 
paint wash the robot will look way too
clean<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:06.640> therefore<00:05:07.060> kind<00:05:07.390> of<00:05:07.510> look<00:05:07.690> you

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
clean and therefore kind of look you

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.350 
clean and therefore kind of look you
know<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.800> wouldn't<00:05:09.190> look<00:05:09.340> like<00:05:09.400> an<00:05:09.880> actual

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
know it wouldn't look like an actual

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.560 
know it wouldn't look like an actual
metal<00:05:10.780> honking<00:05:11.790> ginormous<00:05:12.790> piece<00:05:13.060> of<00:05:13.240> metal

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
metal honking ginormous piece of metal

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.630 
metal honking ginormous piece of metal
that<00:05:13.720> went<00:05:14.560> through<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:14.920> couple<00:05:15.130> of<00:05:15.370> wars

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
that went through a couple of wars

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.820 
that went through a couple of wars
against<00:05:16.150> giant<00:05:16.840> monsters<00:05:17.350> and<00:05:17.530> this

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
against giant monsters and this

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.410 
against giant monsters and this
definitely<00:05:18.280> looks<00:05:18.400> like<00:05:18.640> it<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.090> of<00:05:19.390> course

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
definitely looks like it and of course

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.510 
definitely looks like it and of course
you<00:05:19.600> could<00:05:19.780> add<00:05:19.900> more<00:05:19.930> to<00:05:20.410> it<00:05:20.500> because<00:05:20.740> you

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
you could add more to it because you

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.890 
you could add more to it because you
could<00:05:21.640> just<00:05:21.670> go<00:05:21.940> over<00:05:22.180> it<00:05:22.390> with<00:05:22.600> some<00:05:22.630> more

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
could just go over it with some more

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.530 
could just go over it with some more
paint<00:05:23.140> washes<00:05:23.440> with<00:05:24.250> some<00:05:24.400> blacks<00:05:24.640> and<00:05:24.910> etc

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
paint washes with some blacks and etc

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.020 
paint washes with some blacks and etc
which<00:05:25.720> would<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.050> add<00:05:26.230> even<00:05:26.620> more<00:05:26.740> detail<00:05:27.030> to

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
which would that add even more detail to

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.150 
which would that add even more detail to
the<00:05:28.060> piece<00:05:28.330> itself<00:05:28.630> as<00:05:28.900> far<00:05:29.230> as<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.470> head

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
the piece itself as far as the head

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.950 
the piece itself as far as the head
actually<00:05:30.370> that's<00:05:31.240> one<00:05:31.390> thing<00:05:31.570> that<00:05:31.600> I<00:05:31.720> wanted

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
actually that's one thing that I wanted

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.990 
actually that's one thing that I wanted
to<00:05:32.020> point<00:05:32.260> out<00:05:32.470> that<00:05:32.500> I<00:05:32.680> don't<00:05:33.010> like<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.760> head

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
to point out that I don't like the head

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.330 
to point out that I don't like the head
on<00:05:34.270> my<00:05:34.540> figure<00:05:34.840> I<00:05:35.140> know<00:05:35.590> that<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:35.950> does<00:05:36.130> move

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
on my figure I know that it does move

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.250 
on my figure I know that it does move
because<00:05:36.700> I<00:05:36.730> see<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:37.480> there<00:05:37.630> is<00:05:37.750> a<00:05:37.780> ball<00:05:38.020> joint

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
because I see that there is a ball joint

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.920 
because I see that there is a ball joint
but<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.950> problem<00:05:39.280> because<00:05:39.460> of<00:05:39.490> this<00:05:39.640> color<00:05:40.000> my

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
but the problem because of this color my

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.410 
but the problem because of this color my
the<00:05:41.440> way<00:05:41.560> that<00:05:41.770> my<00:05:42.370> figure<00:05:42.670> it<00:05:42.760> barely<00:05:43.090> barely

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
the way that my figure it barely barely

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.600 
the way that my figure it barely barely
moves<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:44.020> I<00:05:44.260> can<00:05:44.410> only<00:05:44.560> look<00:05:44.920> left<00:05:45.250> to<00:05:45.430> right

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
moves and I can only look left to right

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.850 
moves and I can only look left to right
and<00:05:45.910> again<00:05:46.300> it<00:05:46.540> works<00:05:46.840> for<00:05:47.050> me<00:05:47.230> because<00:05:47.590> I<00:05:47.800> know

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
and again it works for me because I know

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.280 
and again it works for me because I know
that<00:05:48.070> that's<00:05:49.060> kind<00:05:49.420> of<00:05:49.510> what<00:05:49.690> is<00:05:49.780> intended

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
that that's kind of what is intended

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.440 
that that's kind of what is intended
here<00:05:50.530> because<00:05:50.920> I<00:05:51.190> mean<00:05:51.550> it's<00:05:51.760> not<00:05:51.910> supposed<00:05:52.360> to

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
here because I mean it's not supposed to

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.060 
here because I mean it's not supposed to
be<00:05:52.570> a<00:05:52.600> very<00:05:52.810> smooth<00:05:53.230> movement<00:05:53.770> you<00:05:53.860> know<00:05:53.950> it's

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
be a very smooth movement you know it's

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.970 
be a very smooth movement you know it's
very<00:05:54.280> clunky<00:05:55.260> designs<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:56.560> therefore

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
very clunky designs and therefore

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.380 
very clunky designs and therefore
they're<00:05:57.430> not<00:05:57.580> supposed<00:05:57.880> to<00:05:57.910> be<00:05:58.030> like<00:05:58.150> you<00:05:58.270> know

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
they're not supposed to be like you know

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.210 
they're not supposed to be like you know
the<00:05:58.780> way<00:05:58.900> I<00:05:58.930> look<00:05:59.170> at<00:05:59.290> it<00:05:59.320> it's<00:05:59.650> like<00:05:59.830> it's<00:06:00.070> not

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
the way I look at it it's like it's not

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.310 
the way I look at it it's like it's not
designed<00:06:00.580> by<00:06:00.730> Apple<00:06:01.030> it<00:06:01.420> doesn't<00:06:01.660> have<00:06:01.780> style

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
designed by Apple it doesn't have style

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.740 
designed by Apple it doesn't have style
like<00:06:02.710> at<00:06:02.920> an<00:06:03.100> Apple<00:06:03.520> product<00:06:03.760> would<00:06:04.090> it's<00:06:04.510> much

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
like at an Apple product would it's much

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.450

of<00:06:26.440> kind<00:06:26.590> of<00:06:26.680> vents<00:06:27.310> and<00:06:27.730> things<00:06:27.970> with<00:06:28.180> that

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
of kind of vents and things with that

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.760 
of kind of vents and things with that
would<00:06:28.390> probably<00:06:28.600> like<00:06:28.840> release<00:06:29.200> pressure<00:06:29.530> and

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
would probably like release pressure and

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.440 
would probably like release pressure and
heat<00:06:30.010> and<00:06:30.280> make<00:06:30.430> sure<00:06:30.550> that<00:06:30.700> this<00:06:30.880> damn<00:06:31.150> thing

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
heat and make sure that this damn thing

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.110 
heat and make sure that this damn thing
doesn't<00:06:31.480> overheat<00:06:31.930> and<00:06:32.200> fall<00:06:32.830> apart<00:06:33.550> and<00:06:33.910> that

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
doesn't overheat and fall apart and that

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.400 
doesn't overheat and fall apart and that
being<00:06:34.300> said<00:06:34.420> I<00:06:34.600> would<00:06:34.660> definitely<00:06:35.200> absolutely

they're<00:07:12.960> gonna<00:07:13.050> be<00:07:13.229> releasing<00:07:13.530> a<00:07:13.680> much<00:07:13.860> bigger

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
they're gonna be releasing a much bigger

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.430 
they're gonna be releasing a much bigger
version<00:07:14.699> of<00:07:14.729> this<00:07:15.479> design<00:07:15.870> which<00:07:16.139> is<00:07:16.289> going<00:07:16.320> to

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 
version of this design which is going to

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.370 
version of this design which is going to
be<00:07:16.590> the<00:07:16.800> I<00:07:17.009> believe<00:07:17.520> 1/4<00:07:18.300> scale<00:07:18.690> so<00:07:19.169> if<00:07:19.259> you

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 
be the I believe 1/4 scale so if you

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.330 
be the I believe 1/4 scale so if you
want<00:07:19.590> to<00:07:19.650> wait<00:07:19.770> and<00:07:19.889> you<00:07:19.979> want<00:07:20.099> to<00:07:20.160> get<00:07:20.250> an

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
want to wait and you want to get an

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.969 
want to wait and you want to get an
18-inch<00:07:21.150> version<00:07:22.110> of<00:07:22.199> this<00:07:22.349> figure<00:07:22.560> which

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 
18-inch version of this figure which

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:24.529 
18-inch version of this figure which
will<00:07:23.130> probably<00:07:23.370> I<00:07:23.639> think<00:07:23.729> it's<00:07:24.210> supposed<00:07:24.509> to

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 
will probably I think it's supposed to

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:27.499 
will probably I think it's supposed to
retail<00:07:24.870> at<00:07:24.960> about<00:07:25.139> I<00:07:25.320> think<00:07:25.740> $80<00:07:26.490> so<00:07:26.940> this

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:27.509 
retail at about I think $80 so this

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:29.180 
retail at about I think $80 so this
retails<00:07:27.900> at<00:07:27.960> about<00:07:28.050> 20<00:07:28.530> so<00:07:28.740> if<00:07:28.830> you<00:07:28.919> want<00:07:29.130> to

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190 
retails at about 20 so if you want to

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.520 
retails at about 20 so if you want to
wait<00:07:29.340> you<00:07:29.550> can<00:07:30.060> get<00:07:30.330> a<00:07:30.360> much<00:07:30.539> bigger<00:07:30.870> scaled<00:07:31.380> up

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.530 
wait you can get a much bigger scaled up

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.350 
wait you can get a much bigger scaled up
version<00:07:31.889> of<00:07:31.979> it<00:07:32.099> but<00:07:32.759> that<00:07:32.849> means<00:07:33.000> that<00:07:33.180> I

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 
version of it but that means that I

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.400 
version of it but that means that I
would<00:07:33.599> say<00:07:33.720> if<00:07:33.840> you<00:07:33.930> had<00:07:34.050> to<00:07:34.169> choose<00:07:34.349> between

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.410 
would say if you had to choose between

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.740 
would say if you had to choose between
him<00:07:34.860> and<00:07:35.039> crimson<00:07:35.340> typhoon<00:07:35.520> I<00:07:35.910> would<00:07:36.479> go<00:07:36.599> with

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:36.750 
him and crimson typhoon I would go with

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.330 
him and crimson typhoon I would go with
crimson<00:07:37.080> typhoon<00:07:37.199> just<00:07:37.590> because<00:07:37.800> I<00:07:37.919> really

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
crimson typhoon just because I really

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.129 
crimson typhoon just because I really
loved<00:07:38.580> the<00:07:38.699> design<00:07:38.970> on<00:07:39.150> that<00:07:39.180> thing<00:07:39.509> and<00:07:39.660> the

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:40.139
