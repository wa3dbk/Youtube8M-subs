okay<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.870> simple<00:00:01.319> way<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.410> make<00:00:01.829> beams<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.820> light

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay a simple way to make beams of light

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.740 
okay a simple way to make beams of light
let's<00:00:03.990> start<00:00:04.259> by<00:00:05.359> make<00:00:06.359> new<00:00:06.569> image<00:00:07.160> and<00:00:08.750> a

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
let's start by make new image and a

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.770 
let's start by make new image and a
gradient<00:00:11.030> let's<00:00:12.030> do<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.240> gradient<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.750> I

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
gradient let's do that gradient that I

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.240 
gradient let's do that gradient that I
like<00:00:13.130> this<00:00:14.130> one<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:16.039> now<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.100> notice

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
like this one on this one now you notice

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.590 
like this one on this one now you notice
we<00:00:17.400> already<00:00:17.640> sort<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> beam<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.449> light

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
we already sort of have a beam of light

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.269 
we already sort of have a beam of light
just<00:00:18.840> by<00:00:18.960> choosing<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.529> second<00:00:19.890> gradient

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
just by choosing that second gradient

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.670 
just by choosing that second gradient
and<00:00:20.760> putting<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.060> line<00:00:21.270> there<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.170> what's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and putting that line there but what's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.009 
and putting that line there but what's
enhance<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.400> make<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> new<00:00:23.730> layer

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
enhance that so you make a new layer

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.019 
enhance that so you make a new layer
switch<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> white<00:00:25.730> choose<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> paint

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029

percent and press and press and that's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.170 
percent and press and press and that's
actually<00:00:34.620> twenty<00:00:34.980> percent<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.880> kind<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
actually twenty percent but that kind of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.910 
actually twenty percent but that kind of
gives<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.540> need<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.440> let's<00:00:37.710> take

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
gives you what you need so let's take

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.330 
gives you what you need so let's take
the<00:00:38.309> move<00:00:38.489> tool<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:39.570> click<00:00:39.870> free<00:00:40.860> transform

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the move tool right click free transform

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.049 
the move tool right click free transform
and<00:00:42.239> let's<00:00:42.390> take<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:43.309> middle<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.340> chance

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and let's take this middle one chance

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.090 
and let's take this middle one chance
for<00:00:45.239> whatever<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.930> let's<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.800> kind

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
for whatever that is and let's just kind

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100 
for whatever that is and let's just kind
of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.380 

shape<00:00:50.890> it<00:00:50.980> into<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.310> you<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:54.820> all<00:00:54.940> this<00:00:55.060> is<00:00:55.240> is

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
shape it into it you see all this is is

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.380 
shape it into it you see all this is is
just<00:00:55.480> another<00:00:55.750> layer<00:00:56.020> that<00:00:56.350> is<00:00:57.390> mostly

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
just another layer that is mostly

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.850 
just another layer that is mostly
transparent<00:00:59.070> because<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:00.310> have<00:01:00.490> that<00:01:01.860> three

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
transparent because I have that three

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.140 
transparent because I have that three
transform<00:01:03.280> again<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.730> this<00:01:03.790> will<00:01:04.000> switch

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
transform again and this will switch

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.420 
transform again and this will switch
back<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.449> regular<00:01:04.629> one

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
back to the regular one

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.310 
back to the regular one
and<00:01:06.550> I<00:01:06.940> hope<00:01:07.060> this<00:01:07.180> kind<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.510> follow<00:01:07.780> along<00:01:07.870> or

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
and I hope this kind of follow along or

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.880 
and I hope this kind of follow along or
even<00:01:08.650> trail<00:01:08.860> like<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:10.470> now<00:01:11.470> we<00:01:11.560> can<00:01:11.710> kind<00:01:11.860> of

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
even trail like that now we can kind of

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.530 
even trail like that now we can kind of
darken<00:01:12.250> this<00:01:12.340> up<00:01:12.550> to<00:01:12.730> a<00:01:12.760> handset<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> little<00:01:13.450> bit

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
darken this up to a handset a little bit

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.640 
darken this up to a handset a little bit
if<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.720> want<00:01:13.900> you're<00:01:14.320> in<00:01:14.410> saturation<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:17.350> that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
if you want you're in saturation do that

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.550 
if you want you're in saturation do that
and<00:01:18.340> if<00:01:18.430> they<00:01:18.520> blur<00:01:18.670> this<00:01:18.820> out<00:01:19.030> filters<00:01:19.560> blur

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
and if they blur this out filters blur

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.140 
and if they blur this out filters blur
Gaussian<00:01:20.979> blur<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:24.490> have<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.790> be<00:01:24.850> all<00:01:24.880> the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
Gaussian blur don't have to be all the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.790 
Gaussian blur don't have to be all the
weight<00:01:25.300> lurie<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.960> then<00:01:26.410> I<00:01:26.500> added<00:01:26.680> some

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
weight lurie and then I added some

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.680 
weight lurie and then I added some
sparkles<00:01:27.310> which<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.670> was<00:01:27.790> pretty<00:01:28.180> easy<00:01:28.330> to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
sparkles which that was pretty easy to

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.510 
sparkles which that was pretty easy to
do<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:28.990> didn't<00:01:29.290> Photoshop<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:29.830> breezy<00:01:30.010> new<00:01:30.310> here

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
do I didn't Photoshop as breezy new here

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.450 
do I didn't Photoshop as breezy new here
we<00:01:30.700> stick<00:01:30.910> it<00:01:30.940> into<00:01:31.150> later<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:32.250> paint<00:01:33.250> brush

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
we stick it into later and paint brush

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.859 
we stick it into later and paint brush
and<00:01:34.590> let's<00:01:35.590> go<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.800> 3d<00:01:36.460> brushes<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.600> let's

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
and let's go to 3d brushes and let's

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.050 
and let's go to 3d brushes and let's
choose<00:01:38.140> these<00:01:38.590> right<00:01:38.800> here<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.399> rotate

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
choose these right here and you rotate

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.109 
choose these right here and you rotate
it<00:01:40.330> is<00:01:41.170> facing<00:01:41.619> like<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:41.979> we're<00:01:42.729> going<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.000> be

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
it is facing like that we're going to be

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.820 
it is facing like that we're going to be
scattering<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:46.240> say<00:01:46.810> don't<00:01:47.380> want<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.680> to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
scattering and I say don't want you to

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.920 
scattering and I say don't want you to
know<00:01:47.890> what<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.250> does<00:01:48.280> but<00:01:48.640> if<00:01:49.540> we<00:01:49.750> should

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
know what that does but if we should

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.440 
know what that does but if we should
have<00:01:50.080> also<00:01:50.259> turn<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.160> flow<00:01:51.310> all<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.520> way<00:01:51.610> up

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.850 

this<00:01:56.450> gives<00:01:56.660> us<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.900> previous<00:01:57.410> run<00:01:57.590> our<00:01:57.680> mouths

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
this gives us a previous run our mouths

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.350 
this gives us a previous run our mouths
it<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.250> gives<00:01:58.430> us<00:01:58.520> some<00:01:58.640> different<00:01:58.730> sizes

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
it just gives us some different sizes

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.790 
it just gives us some different sizes
and<00:02:01.300> we<00:02:02.300> can<00:02:02.420> change<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.840> another<00:02:02.930> brush<00:02:03.530> if<00:02:03.680> we

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
and we can change to another brush if we

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.590 
and we can change to another brush if we
want<00:02:04.040> we<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.940> make<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.180> little<00:02:05.270> bit<00:02:05.450> bigger

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
want we can make it a little bit bigger

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.960 
want we can make it a little bit bigger
it<00:02:06.500> will<00:02:06.560> be<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.740> few<00:02:07.190> little<00:02:07.280> bigger<00:02:07.550> ones

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.850 

you<00:02:13.570> can<00:02:13.720> have<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:13.990> beam<00:02:14.260> go<00:02:14.470> over<00:02:14.740> things

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
you can have this beam go over things

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.400 
you can have this beam go over things
too<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.160> fear<00:02:15.490> what<00:02:15.610> we<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:15.850> do<00:02:15.940> later<00:02:16.410> let's

it<00:02:24.820> whatever<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.210> thing<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.840> sport

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.420 

let's<00:02:29.470> take<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.800> or<00:02:29.980> leave<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.310> down

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
let's take that or leave it down

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.270 
let's take that or leave it down
underneath<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.440> unless<00:02:32.770> kind<00:02:33.130> of

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
underneath of you and unless kind of

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.930 
underneath of you and unless kind of
free<00:02:33.820> transform<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.510> again<00:02:35.610> let's<00:02:36.610> go<00:02:36.790> ahead

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
free transform that again let's go ahead

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.820 
free transform that again let's go ahead
use<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.270> weather<00:02:37.690> transform<00:02:38.470> tool<00:02:38.650> sorry

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
use that weather transform tool sorry

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.810 
use that weather transform tool sorry
can<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.010> give<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.340> little<00:02:39.490> bit<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.700> dimension

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.510 

it<00:02:42.820> looks<00:02:42.970> like<00:02:43.000> an<00:02:43.180> alien<00:02:43.540> rock<00:02:43.960> or<00:02:44.140> something

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.810 

okay<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.790> regular<00:02:49.390> transform<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.640> little

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
okay and regular transform like a little

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.570 
okay and regular transform like a little
bigger<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.030> part<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.540> goes<00:02:52.690> out<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
bigger so part of it goes out of the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.860 
bigger so part of it goes out of the
beat<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:57.240> you'll<00:02:58.240> see<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.510> part<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.780> it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
beat and you'll see the part of it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
beat and you'll see the part of it
stored<00:02:59.080> by<00:02:59.170> being<00:02:59.410> all<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.560> way<00:02:59.590> don't<00:02:59.740> like

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
stored by being all the way don't like

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.460 
stored by being all the way don't like
it<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.040> makes<00:03:00.310> oh<00:03:00.570> I'm<00:03:01.570> going<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.900> check<00:03:02.320> it

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
it that makes oh I'm going to check it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.110 
it that makes oh I'm going to check it
out<00:03:02.590> again

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.300 

maybe<00:03:11.120> change<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.599> color

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.740 

so<00:03:16.880> we<00:03:16.970> get<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.120> nice<00:03:17.270> gold<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:22.030> do<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.630> can

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
also on this rocker where that thing is

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.059 
also on this rocker where that thing is
now<00:03:26.120> go<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.050> blur<00:03:27.349> tool<00:03:27.590> but<00:03:27.830> don't<00:03:27.980> use

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
now go to the blur tool but don't use

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
can kind of enhance the verse getting

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.300 
can kind of enhance the verse getting
hit<00:03:42.560> by<00:03:42.590> light<00:03:43.060> make<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.239> later<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:46.130> then<00:03:46.280> a
