00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
feedback on what you thought and I just

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.240 
feedback on what you thought and I just
think<00:02:32.640> that's<00:02:32.819> such<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> fantastic<00:02:33.780> idea<00:02:34.250> but

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
think that's such a fantastic idea but

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.390 
think that's such a fantastic idea but
anyway<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.849> had<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:37.049> middle<00:02:37.470> surface<00:02:37.739> which<00:02:38.190> is

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
anyway I had the middle surface which is

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.809 
anyway I had the middle surface which is
called<00:02:39.620> fragrance<00:02:40.620> customization<00:02:41.459> and

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
called fragrance customization and

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.720 
called fragrance customization and
basically<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.959> just<00:02:43.739> think<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.519> most

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
basically I just think this is the most

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.420 
basically I just think this is the most
genius<00:02:45.000> idea<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.720> all<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.920> get<00:02:47.190> your

completely<00:03:13.230> from<00:03:13.560> scratch<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:14.400> start<00:03:14.670> from<00:03:14.849> a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
completely from scratch you start from a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.789 
completely from scratch you start from a
base<00:03:15.180> perfume<00:03:15.780> which<00:03:15.900> isn't<00:03:16.079> at<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> perfume

florists<00:03:19.620> range<00:03:19.889> so<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.730> started<00:03:21.299> with<00:03:21.450> white

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
florists range so I started with white

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.400 
florists range so I started with white
rose<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:23.480> basically<00:03:24.480> I've<00:03:24.690> got<00:03:24.720> some<00:03:25.109> bits<00:03:25.260> of

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
experience is like because I know that I

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.160 
experience is like because I know that I
think<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:30.030> probably<00:03:30.239> seem<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.660> bit<00:03:30.840> overexcited

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
think I probably seem a bit overexcited

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.000 
think I probably seem a bit overexcited
about<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.889> of<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.720> was<00:03:33.870> just

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010

incredible<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.549> probably<00:03:35.790> did<00:03:36.030> Sheila's

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
incredible and I probably did Sheila's

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.470 
incredible and I probably did Sheila's
head<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:37.019> be<00:03:37.139> honest<00:03:37.380> because<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:39.090> know<00:03:39.239> I

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480

just<00:03:39.540> go<00:03:40.079> on<00:03:40.109> and<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.799> never<00:03:41.040> shut<00:03:41.280> up<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:42.120> I

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
just go on and on and never shut up so I

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.270

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
that much more than just buying one of

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.940 
that much more than just buying one of
the<00:03:56.849> fragrances<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.690> just<00:03:58.349> so<00:03:58.650> special
