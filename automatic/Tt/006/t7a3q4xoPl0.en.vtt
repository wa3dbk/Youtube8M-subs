00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.300
 hoisting machine in loops with frame 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.769
 thread 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.770
 recommended for products and stretch and 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.600
 spring fabrics also does not represent 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.570
 difficulties 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.420
 frame thread is retracted around the foot 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.770
 for making loops 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.770
 in the following way 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.820
 after that the foot is set 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:51.050
 lever for pull loops lowered 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.050
 choose the loop we need 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.620
 and so can 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.660
 as a result we get a loop 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.080
 frame find it need to tighten 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.750
 and fill in 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.640
 for this i use 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.640
 big and a bun 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:58.439
 if you will use thin 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:02.119
 frame threads can get along and 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.119
 with a small eye 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.910
 I use thick coils only for 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.670
 order to show on pancakes like this 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.220
 is done 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:24.420
 we thread around the end of the loop 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:30.900
 and get between the layers in the root 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.900
 do the same with the second bachelor 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.319
 this way the frame thread 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.760
 forms 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.760
 the second 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.760
 tack 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.310
 need to do this if possible in layers 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.800
 fabrics 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:08.450
 only well 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.350
 cut these loops for comparison without 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.660
 bits 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:17.620
 frame here are the same loop look here 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.620
 in this way 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.930
 surrounded by a loop 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.750
 and 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.689
 loop it's not like they are called well 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.870
 let's say a zigzag loop with contrasting 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.870
 threads 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.180
 well that's all for today 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.990
 Like me and sign up 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.420
 on my channel 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.420
 with you was the faith of life yet
