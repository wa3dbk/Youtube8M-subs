00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.849
 hello people so signs the holidays 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.929
 the Christmas name is with it 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.740
 all quite often in the kitchen and one of them 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.510
 the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 necessary tools 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.400
 the kitchen is a good cutting board 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.090
 Naturally the shelves that are in store 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.260
 buy that is firewood 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.840
 pull the worthless stuff around the splinter 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.239
 And it doesn't take long before you really 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 is money for the plastic 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.980
 cutting board and then you can already make it there 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.770
 falcons and brother use piece of wood 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.770
 with you by chance for the tried 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.930
 oak wood does not do beautifully in lemon 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.260
 oak set of tannic acid 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.890
 and louis acid is not healthy and that was 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.010
 always on when you exercise or work and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.000
 would have achieved this beautiful piece of oak 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.000
 use for something else 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:22.840
 beechwood term too suitable to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.429
 Utrecht thought it does not sprint but 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.380
 if you did not press him for Sunday 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:31.030
 that pulls the crown in all directions 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.039
 so actually not an option either 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.679
 again do well then the user 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.020
 We must have specially sawn it out 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.630
 it from the head of the trunk 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.619
 so that it is no longer chrome pull that is 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.479
 hard to come by 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:52.030
 it is the best material for half an hour 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:55.689
 in my opinion is just white 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.450
 trespa 12mm thick 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.789
 very hard but not so got him there 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.239
 got upset 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:07.869
 you can see it all so that is also whole 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.910
 good to clean the only problem 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.030
 is how do I get such a beautiful piece of tres 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.340
 page my advice is go to one 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.310
 interior bulbs or something similar 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.090
 furniture making often come pieces 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.860
 lie 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.829
 bit thicker than what you just get 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.180
 and then you can go along very well 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.370
 to feed 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.430
 Trespa mind many advantage and disadvantage 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.459
 if you like the raw wood 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.560
 there the side is sharply distracted 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.430
 after all, it is rather hard 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.459
 material to make inquiries 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.870
 manage with the fear table how i mine 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.590
 fear table 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.540
 who then made it myself 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.560
 but you can also put it on easily with 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.260
 one allowed frizzle and took the plate 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.680
 just along the follow meat with a wrote 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.769
 thank you and have you 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:09.000
 oak table made with mine 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:16.219
 own buy fear nobody learns one 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.849
 another table is in for fear 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:23.790
 you can set any eye and just with 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.760
 check your material and you will receive one 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:32.400
 you can finish it beautifully 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.650
 so far we are a furniture maker and the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:40.019
 quality is a little less than 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:43.980
 more professional machines 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.900
 more than offset by 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.280
 the extra lama you get for free 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.439
 gets 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.489
 so that is also a lot of fun 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:57.540
 I'd like to have a package like this 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:02.659
 with the sharp side on the board you want 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.659
 right that it give a decent noise 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.259
 No 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.800
 now there is one 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.690
 but we do have a beautiful one 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.520
 so the cutting boards got the use 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:40.560
 very good remains yes after all my 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.560
 good to clean perfectly
