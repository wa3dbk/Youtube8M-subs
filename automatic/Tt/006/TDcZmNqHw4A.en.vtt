00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.700
 bolten see for bonus berlin 20 thousand 436 the first tests in nuremberg 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.719
 and button is not that really invented this contraption that is a 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.460
 bet is a replica 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.739
 a so the teacher used 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.299
 yes what he invented the mobile types of metal one or an alloy 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.640
 in which they are in relief 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.519
 what the characters 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.210
 from typographic letters 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.280
 in a symmetrical way so that when printing by pressure 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.370
 well that the way we all know the letters 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100
 it was discovered that the Chinese 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.870
 they already worked this concept 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.160
 but this type of metal mobiles 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.610
 they were rather fixed types your template ascends developed percent in 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.760
 woodcarving 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.880
 Well, here we have the composition table called 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.010
 I do not know we have a small carpentry job 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.120
 to be able to create the margins and the structure where our assembly goes 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.460
 per hundred types of mobile types 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.100
 the mobile types 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.039
 cheese or a floor 2 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.810
 so you get whitespace the separation between words 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.640
 and others 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.720
 which are in relief where they are by the type of the typography of each letter 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.720
 are you a typography facing this 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.170
 a gothic manuscript 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.530
 that is very similar so that he used gutember in his first works 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.390
 a tournament that I play 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.509
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.389
 the Carolingian Gothic of these a quota manuscript tico 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.910
 and finally it should be noted that another 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.700
 the model well 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.960
 of this mobile type 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.650
 what is it is a model that is timely mentioned that they repeated reason explained 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.400
 that will not serve for decoration 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.869
 it arrives then we will go to 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.230
 to aventÃ­n tado 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.789
 you see really the safest thing is that in quintana 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.359
 with a principle like this is the so-called doll world are rags 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.230
 who are 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.240
 22m between the interns and this on the possible tape by applying 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.429
 in this way he pointed little 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.719
 but really we have painted with roller 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.749
 in this time breads and methane rodrÃ­guez faced with leather 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.290
 because we are going to prepare the ink we will have them 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.290
 this fact motivated his little 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:24.479
 I did not put 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.199
 we go 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.199
 I'm loading the thrushes with ribbons like titanic 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 Well now we move to different very carefully 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.339
 other types 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339
 they are changing color tempts us 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.859
 different studies 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.609
 morricone now we have prepared 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.190
 with cleanliness is the most important thing 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.190
 in spite of it we are all shocked 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.759
 Well now we have to clean the edges that may have 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:06.759
 emerged 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.019
 for now we are heading 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.019
 to work with the press 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.349
 as a novelty 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.429
 asked by the press 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.659
 efe 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.659
 they are a percentage cretins 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.159
 I do not want to prepare the paper 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:32.960
 we have water to paper 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.760
 so that fiber per hundred if we want soft and because the pressure 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:42.969
 to filipe what these fibers are in contact with the ink and with the relief 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:46.189
 of the types 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:47.599
 let's take a little
