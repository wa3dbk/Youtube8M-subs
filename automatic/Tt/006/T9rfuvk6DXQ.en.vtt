00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.389
 this 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.700
 hello to our today's lesson we 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:22.250
 touch on such extremely important topics 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:26.990
 like footwork when playing the game I am very 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.470
 often see players like children performing 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.970
 hit rally run entirely cross legs 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.059
 Now I will show how it looks 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.900
 they do body swing and at the moment 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.449
 striking put without supporting leg 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.100
 with the cross, I see that the coach praises them and 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.860
 say that so right and do 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.309
 what's on the right 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.850
 what's left is in my opinion very rough 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.719
 mistake 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:57.590
 explain why at the moment of contact with the ball 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.989
 your hand 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.989
 and accordingly your racket should 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.509
 conditionally speaking under the support 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.090
 have they have to resist 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.670
 the impact of the ball the ball has a very 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.310
 strong energetic and flies on on 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.119
 arrive I will adjust david with a large mass 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.979
 on the racket and if your hand is iraq and your 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.280
 the body is not able to resist the sword 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.290
 then the ball will just punch through 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.710
 you your hand will fall the ball will not 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.350
 counter 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.759
 you cannot control the ball if you 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.520
 take a step cross cross cross over here 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.960
 here you can resist can 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.700
 check if someone suits you and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.250
 try putting pressure on your arm here in 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.170
 this moment you your hand is under 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.320
 prop if you set foot with a cross something 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.409
 here at this moment you are unable to hold 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.250
 more your arm is not what muscles and and not 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.740
 support you deployed tass in such 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.280
 position that hand actually turned 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.420
 limp you strike at that moment 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.399
 when is your foot 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.009
 try to strike then when 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.790
 your straight leg is in the air 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.299
 and here at this moment when the leg 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.850
 goes over the projection of the middle of your body 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.280
 here at this moment your hand can no longer 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.799
 striking the ball just throw it away 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.170
 Therefore, the correct operation of the legs of the rally 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.959
 It looks like you are sure to knee without 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.530
 support leg step forward on the grid 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.750
 that is, if you beat my case there 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.190
 on the left I step with my left foot towards a 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.379
 right knee 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.170
 I always step on the grid here 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.959
 I can hold this position 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.000
 to withstand any blow of any force on the left 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.610
 performed hit just the same way you step 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.010
 in my case, right, walk right 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.370
 with your foot you turn your shoulders 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.860
 this and without a supporting foot you step on 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.510
 net and while your foot is up in the air you 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.629
 perform a hand strike across the hull 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.769
 It is played in one hand 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.989
 on the right with forehand fist remains 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.940
 sure side you can not carry your hand 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.390
 but these opposite side 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.370
 from this side you step forward and arm 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.040
 goes to the opposite side so that 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.400
 process the ball with the strings not bottom and 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.720
 top down and across 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.480
 I 'll show you how it looks 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.379
 the walls I'll throw myself the ball with my hand 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.690
 and take the right steps I step in 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.990
 side and on the grid 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.810
 i step aside and on the grid i step in 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:41.010
 side and on the net arm goes across 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.710
 the hull crosses the only case 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.690
 when the legs can go sun cross this when 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.690
 you jump very far behind the sword 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.600
 if you need to reach out and you jump 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.820
 far in then in so when 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.920
 position your hand goes very far 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.940
 per hull and shoulder project 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.670
 out of front foot projection 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.110
 your legs are here again 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.700
 position when your hand 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.710
 very strong and under support 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.100
 knee front knee same 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.580
 happens if you jump far under 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:21.989
 kick you bag end rally you can 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.780
 put a foot in the cross if you have a hand and 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.860
 shoulder over the front of the knee and from here 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.730
 You also do not make us forward, but under 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.620
 across the body that's all i wanted you 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.660
 to tell 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.760
 so small but very urgent 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.210
 problem is the work of the feet well and a little bit 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.860
 even the work of the hands when playing with the summer I hope 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.780
