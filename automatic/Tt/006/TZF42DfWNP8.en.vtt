00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.990

 unfortunately in this regard 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.540
 I hope though that if the systems do I owe everything 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.380
 say that I am beginning to appreciate 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.180

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.490
 we are as always if in the good of mine 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.710
 eyes and this is the basis of absence 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.410
 then passed to my beloved nor that two the 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.360
 my favorite eyeshadow expected that 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.360
 I apply over the entire eyelid 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.849
 the palette tuxedo of the make up academy 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.360
 from here I go to get his china i 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:59.470
 wall units in black smoke color 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.080
 with whom I go to make a line of 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.650
 eyeliner just at the hairline 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.650
 upper lashes 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.580
 you don't need to be very precise because 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.610
 with a brush of this type 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.820
 I know one I am going to fade with 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.670
 be careful with upward care 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.670
 the pencil previously applied 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.840
 with the smudge still dirty with black 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.690
 I'm going to spend the product too 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.520
 at the base of the lower lashes 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.660
 only at the outer corner from the 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.660
 palette smokin palette aprico mythical la 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.210
 pencil so you can fix it as 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.370
 an angled brush instead I go to 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.420
 lay out fantasy that this beautiful 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.500
 dove gray on the outside corner up 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.810
 at the crease of the eye 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.230
 not satisfied instead of a result 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.640
 I'm going to reapply the black pencil 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.290
 at the base of the lower lashes 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.019
 and to blend it now I need a color 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.930
 hotter and I just use mine 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.450
 land from a Roma in fact actually that 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.300
 I'm going to fade just above the dove 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.210
 that I had always laid out before 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.940
 from the tuxedo instead I apply flory below 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.210
 the eyebrow arch 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.520
 I now return the naked 2 to the baker this 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.270
 wonderful golden I go to apply 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.270
 at the inner corner 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.990
 beautiful waterline I await a pencil with 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.470
 a booklet and now at a time of 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.030
 mascara the obviously dark and pink bug 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.030
 upper and lower lashes 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:05.569
 I realize light contouring just below 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:07.729
 the cheekbones I 'm not going to make it up 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.550
 the whole face because lana del rey does not have 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:14.139
 a very marked point and I use one instead 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.189
 lighter part brighter like blush 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.960
 by corrector operettas 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:22.219
 catherine together these two 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.529
 correctors to go to illuminate 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:26.529

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.680

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.860

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.640
 obviously red to allow then 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.450
 to my lipstick and last longer and 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.450

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.430
 16 short with little to me hard costs 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.189

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.560
 outline of my lips and the possible 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:09.750
