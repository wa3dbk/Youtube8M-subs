because lots of people lots of different

cars and yeah really good fun Grand

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.250 
cars and yeah really good fun Grand
Valley<00:00:26.970> obviously<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> good<00:00:27.750> track<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.170> wasn't

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
Valley obviously a good track it wasn't

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.779 
Valley obviously a good track it wasn't
the<00:00:28.500> full<00:00:28.740> track<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the full track I think it was the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.209 
the full track I think it was the
eastern<00:00:30.420> actually<00:00:30.840> look<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.130> it

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
eastern actually look and I think but it

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.920 
eastern actually look and I think but it
was<00:00:32.309> really<00:00:32.520> good<00:00:32.640> fun<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.270> looking<00:00:33.660> forward

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
was really good fun and looking forward

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.510 
was really good fun and looking forward
to<00:00:33.989> doing<00:00:34.079> more<00:00:34.230> open<00:00:34.710> lobbies<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.219> Gran

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
to doing more open lobbies on Gran

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
to doing more open lobbies on Gran
Turismo<00:00:35.700> 5<00:00:36.120> at<00:00:36.329> some<00:00:36.570> point<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.559> near

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
Turismo 5 at some point in the near

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.619 
Turismo 5 at some point in the near
future<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.190> think<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.520> easiest<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.420> add

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629

I'm<00:01:45.360> also<00:01:45.509> thinking<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:45.960> doing<00:01:46.170> SimCity

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
I'm also thinking about doing SimCity

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.219 
I'm also thinking about doing SimCity
I've<00:01:47.610> gotta<00:01:47.970> buy<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.079> am

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
I've gotta buy it but I think I am

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.630 
I've gotta buy it but I think I am
hopefully<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.189> doing<00:01:50.280> some<00:01:50.520> videos

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
hopefully going to be doing some videos

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.749 
hopefully going to be doing some videos
on<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.000> between<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.189> later<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.490> and

comes out probably gonna get some

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.539 
comes out probably gonna get some
SimCity<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.560> let<00:01:58.799> me<00:01:58.829> know<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.219> you'd<00:01:59.340> like

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
SimCity up let me know with you'd like

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
SimCity up let me know with you'd like
that<00:01:59.759> or<00:01:59.850> not<00:02:00.079> watching<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> couple<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.500> videos

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
that or not watching a couple of videos

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.109 
that or not watching a couple of videos

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
on it I've really been enjoying it so I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.719 
on it I've really been enjoying it so I
was<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.409> what's<00:02:04.409> all<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> thinking<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.340> might

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
was like what's all the thinking I might

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.459 
was like what's all the thinking I might
as<00:02:05.820> well<00:02:05.850> get<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.119> game<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.450> myself<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.990> see

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
as well get this game for myself and see

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.260 
as well get this game for myself and see
if<00:02:07.560> anybody<00:02:07.890> enjoys<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.459> we'll<00:02:08.849> see<00:02:09.030> I

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
if anybody enjoys it but we'll see I

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.820 
if anybody enjoys it but we'll see I
don't<00:02:09.569> know<00:02:09.629> with<00:02:09.869> anybody<00:02:10.200> will<00:02:10.379> enjoy<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.709> or

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
don't know with anybody will enjoy it or

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.740 
don't know with anybody will enjoy it or
not<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.220> i<00:02:11.280> think<00:02:11.879> i<00:02:12.030> might<00:02:12.209> do<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> couple<00:02:12.660> of

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
not but i think i might do a couple of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.770 
not but i think i might do a couple of
videos<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.110> that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
turismo formula one and maybe four so

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.350 
turismo formula one and maybe four so
I'm<00:02:20.890> not<00:02:21.010> like<00:02:21.160> %<00:02:21.550> sure<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.850> don't<00:02:22.000> even<00:02:22.270> know

where the horizons has online to be

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.160 
where the horizons has online to be
perfectly<00:02:24.220> honest<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.700> actually<00:02:25.569> played<00:02:25.959> their

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
have ultra fast cars i think the highest

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.440 
have ultra fast cars i think the highest
performance<00:03:27.010> team<00:03:27.160> gets<00:03:27.340> 500<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.420> the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
performance team gets 500 and the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.850 
performance team gets 500 and the
hundred<00:03:28.810> percent<00:03:28.989> or<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.230> guys<00:03:29.380> can<00:03:29.590> let<00:03:29.769> me

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
hundred percent or you guys can let me

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.830 
hundred percent or you guys can let me
know<00:03:30.010> but<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.820> was<00:03:31.030> just<00:03:31.090> having<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.510> look<00:03:31.600> in<00:03:31.750> the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
know but I was just having a look in the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.630 
know but I was just having a look in the
settings<00:03:32.019> whilst<00:03:32.470> getting<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:33.070> lovely<00:03:33.310> set<00:03:33.489> up

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
settings whilst getting a lovely set up

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.880 
settings whilst getting a lovely set up
but<00:03:33.730> i<00:03:33.820> think<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.209> was<00:03:34.269> 500<00:03:35.019> which<00:03:35.560> was<00:03:35.739> the

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
but i think it was 500 which was the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.680 
but i think it was 500 which was the
highest<00:03:36.040> level<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.970> i<00:03:37.030> could<00:03:37.329> or<00:03:37.510> the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
highest level that i could or the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.569 
highest level that i could or the
highest<00:03:37.959> performance<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:39.100> i<00:03:39.130> could<00:03:39.340> get<00:03:39.430> up

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
highest performance that i could get up

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.240 
highest performance that i could get up
to<00:03:39.610> but<00:03:39.940> anyway<00:03:40.200> she<00:03:41.200> gets<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.560> latest<00:03:41.890> 15

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
to but anyway she gets the latest 15

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.430 
to but anyway she gets the latest 15
