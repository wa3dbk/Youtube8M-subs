my mind and knowledge and all fighting

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.509 
my mind and knowledge and all fighting
style<00:00:12.480> knowledge<00:00:13.080> goes<00:00:13.620> back<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.070> my<00:00:14.190> younger

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
style knowledge goes back to my younger

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.470 
style knowledge goes back to my younger
body<00:00:14.660> so<00:00:15.660> my<00:00:15.870> mind<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.350> there<00:00:16.970> my<00:00:17.970> body<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.450> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
body so my mind is there my body is a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.260 
body so my mind is there my body is a
little<00:00:18.689> slower<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.529> catch<00:00:19.860> up<00:00:20.099> and<00:00:20.369> actually

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
little slower to catch up and actually

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.210 
little slower to catch up and actually
if<00:00:21.599> you<00:00:21.689> think<00:00:21.779> about<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.290> back<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.040> 70s

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
if you think about it back in the 70s

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.670 
if you think about it back in the 70s
when<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.610> go<00:00:23.730> back<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.060> past<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.900> bone

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
when I go back in the past I have bone

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.779 
when I go back in the past I have bone
and<00:00:25.830> claws<00:00:26.039> not<00:00:26.490> steel<00:00:26.730> claws<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:28.640> when<00:00:29.640> you're

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
and claws not steel claws so when you're

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.380 
and claws not steel claws so when you're
used<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.410> getting<00:00:31.410> around<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:32.010> metal<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.239> was

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
used to getting around with metal it was

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
used to getting around with metal it was
a<00:00:33.449> real<00:00:33.809> challenge<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.440> able<00:00:34.470> to<00:00:34.680> remember

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
a real challenge to be able to remember

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.700 
a real challenge to be able to remember
um<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:35.940> body's<00:00:36.239> lighter<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.170> he's<00:00:37.320> not

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
um my body's lighter and and he's not

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.460 
um my body's lighter and and he's not
used<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.550> memory<00:00:38.970> wise<00:00:39.150> so<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.600> may<00:00:40.410> be

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
used to that and memory wise so I may be

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.350 
used to that and memory wise so I may be
answering<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.220> more<00:00:41.370> complicated<00:00:41.640> way<00:00:41.969> but

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
answering in a more complicated way but

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
answering in a more complicated way but
I<00:00:43.219> yeah<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> fun<00:00:45.270> challenge

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.120 

we<00:00:54.360> shot<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.810> movie<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.350> 3d<00:00:55.740> which<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.040> the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
we shot this movie in 3d which is the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.160 
we shot this movie in 3d which is the
first<00:00:56.370> time<00:00:56.610> I'd<00:00:56.760> actually<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.330> think<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
first time I'd actually I think it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.590 
first time I'd actually I think it
really<00:00:58.860> shot<00:00:59.310> with<00:00:59.490> 3d<00:00:59.820> cameras<00:01:00.240> the<00:01:00.360> entire

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
really shot with 3d cameras the entire

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.050 
really shot with 3d cameras the entire
time<00:01:00.810> and<00:01:00.960> Brian<00:01:01.470> is<00:01:02.010> always<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.730> cutting

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
time and Brian is always about cutting

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.900 
time and Brian is always about cutting
edge<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> making<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.810> look<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.040> know<00:01:05.160> you

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
edge of making it look as a you know you

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.940 
edge of making it look as a you know you
get<00:01:06.120> stuff<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.420> completely<00:01:07.170> new<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
get stuff that's completely new and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.790 
get stuff that's completely new and
things<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.090> changed<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
things have changed a lot and and

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.970 
things have changed a lot and and
weirdly<00:01:11.840> there's<00:01:12.840> less<00:01:13.140> green<00:01:13.440> screen<00:01:13.800> and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
weirdly there's less green screen and

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.560 
weirdly there's less green screen and
blue<00:01:14.100> screen<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> set<00:01:14.970> than<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.270> used<00:01:15.480> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
blue screen on a set than they used to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.440 
blue screen on a set than they used to
be<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.290> now<00:01:17.130> they<00:01:17.490> understand<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> best

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
be so now they understand that the best

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.750 
be so now they understand that the best
way<00:01:19.050> to<00:01:19.080> make<00:01:19.440> these<00:01:19.650> things<00:01:19.890> work<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.490> feel

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
way to make these things work and feel

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.090 
way to make these things work and feel
real<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.420> keep<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:21.990> much<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.410> it<00:01:22.710> real

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
real is to keep as much of it real

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.240 
real is to keep as much of it real
actually<00:01:23.730> so<00:01:24.240> you'll<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.810> bigger<00:01:25.050> sets<00:01:25.470> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
actually so you'll have bigger sets that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.730 
actually so you'll have bigger sets that
will<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.550> augmented<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.420> green<00:01:27.960> screen<00:01:28.290> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
will be augmented with green screen so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.790 
will be augmented with green screen so
it's<00:01:29.370> it<00:01:29.760> has<00:01:29.970> changed<00:01:30.510> but<00:01:30.660> in<00:01:31.200> reality<00:01:31.470> for

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
it's it has changed but in reality for

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.950 
it's it has changed but in reality for
the<00:01:31.979> actors<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.550> seems<00:01:33.060> less<00:01:33.390> technical

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the actors it seems less technical

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.050 
the actors it seems less technical
actually

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.569 

it<00:01:43.020> has<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> big<00:01:43.530> massive<00:01:45.500> weight<00:01:46.500> attached<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it has a big massive weight attached to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.240 
it has a big massive weight attached to
it<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:47.820> there<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> fans<00:01:49.130> there<00:01:50.130> is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.859 
it because there are the fans there is
also<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.579> an<00:01:50.820> expectation<00:01:51.060> from<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.539> studio

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
also just an expectation from the studio

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.999 
also just an expectation from the studio
that<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.170> makes<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> lot<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> money<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.920> they're

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that it makes a lot of money and they're

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.460 
that it makes a lot of money and they're
