00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
bottle or tubing so I wasn't as excited

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.580 
bottle or tubing so I wasn't as excited
about<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.060> there's<00:03:16.810> also<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.170> setting

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
about that and there's also a setting

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.979 
about that and there's also a setting
spray<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:18.430> I've<00:03:19.060> been<00:03:19.330> kind<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.690> curious

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
spray that I've been kind of curious

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.949

about<00:03:20.380> it's<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:21.430> all<00:03:21.730> nighter<00:03:22.030> setting<00:03:22.660> spray

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
about it's the all nighter setting spray

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.150 
about it's the all nighter setting spray
so<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.230> thought<00:03:23.410> this<00:03:23.620> was<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.860> pretty<00:03:24.040> good

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
so I thought this was a pretty good

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.460 
so I thought this was a pretty good
value<00:03:24.910> for<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:26.760> 500-point<00:03:27.760> perk<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:28.570> I<00:03:28.930> decided

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
value for a 500-point perk so I decided

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.900 
value for a 500-point perk so I decided
to<00:03:29.560> pick<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:29.830> up<00:03:29.890> now<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.519> item<00:03:30.880> that

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
to pick that up now on to the item that

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.300 
to pick that up now on to the item that
i<00:03:31.030> actually<00:03:31.209> purchased<00:03:31.690> online<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.860> this

I've been eyeing the set for quite a
while<00:06:55.099> now<00:06:55.159> but<00:06:55.759> I<00:06:55.879> was<00:06:56.090> on<00:06:56.210> my<00:06:56.300> beauty<00:06:56.449> band<00:06:56.719> so

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
while now but I was on my beauty band so

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.450 
while now but I was on my beauty band so
I<00:06:57.050> wasn't<00:06:57.319> able<00:06:57.560> to<00:06:57.860> pick<00:06:57.979> it<00:06:58.009> up<00:06:58.189> until<00:06:58.400> now

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
I wasn't able to pick it up until now

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.969 
I wasn't able to pick it up until now
but<00:06:59.330> patience<00:07:00.050> is<00:07:00.110> a<00:07:00.169> virtue<00:07:00.259> because<00:07:00.830> I

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
but patience is a virtue because I

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.589 
but patience is a virtue because I
received<00:07:01.250> this<00:07:01.400> for<00:07:01.610> twenty<00:07:01.849> percent<00:07:02.120> off<00:07:02.270> so

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
received this for twenty percent off so

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.209 
received this for twenty percent off so
it<00:07:02.719> was<00:07:02.840> an<00:07:02.990> even<00:07:03.289> better<00:07:03.500> deal<00:07:03.590> again<00:07:04.069> I'm<00:07:04.189> not
