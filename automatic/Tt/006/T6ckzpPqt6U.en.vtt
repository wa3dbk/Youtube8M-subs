a<00:00:03.360> real<00:00:04.110> quick<00:00:04.259> video<00:00:04.380> here<00:00:04.740> on<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.069> draw

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
a real quick video here on how to draw

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.530 
a real quick video here on how to draw
angles<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.180> what<00:00:06.899> we<00:00:06.990> call<00:00:07.200> standard<00:00:07.770> position

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
angles in what we call standard position

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.720 
angles in what we call standard position
we<00:00:09.540> need<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.200> sort<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> uniform<00:00:11.219> idea

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
we need to have a sort of uniform idea

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.030 
we need to have a sort of uniform idea
of<00:00:11.969> how<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> draw<00:00:12.599> angles<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.380> standard

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
of how to draw angles and standard

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.060 
of how to draw angles and standard
position<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:16.170> what<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.710> is

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
position is just that so what it is is

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.060 
position is just that so what it is is
we're<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.490> have<00:00:17.670> our<00:00:18.000> origin<00:00:18.859> be<00:00:19.859> our

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
we're going to have our origin be our

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.859 
we're going to have our origin be our
vertex<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:22.789> our<00:00:24.410> what<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.439> call<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.800> initial

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
vertex and our what we call the initial

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.669 
vertex and our what we call the initial
ray<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.199> initial<00:00:28.680> side<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.539> our<00:00:30.539> angle<00:00:30.929> will

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
ray or initial side of our angle will

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.350 
ray or initial side of our angle will
lie<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.189> x<00:00:32.369> axis<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.550> positive<00:00:36.030> x<00:00:36.180> axis

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
lie on the x axis the positive x axis

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.799 
lie on the x axis the positive x axis
and<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> positive<00:00:38.219> angle<00:00:38.719> it's<00:00:39.719> going

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
and if it's a positive angle it's going

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.889 
and if it's a positive angle it's going
to<00:00:39.989> open<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.680> way<00:00:40.920> counterclockwise<00:00:41.899> so

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
to open up this way counterclockwise so

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.330 
to open up this way counterclockwise so
positive<00:00:43.500> angle<00:00:44.360> counter<00:00:45.360> clockwise<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.280> in

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
positive angle counter clockwise so in

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.889 
positive angle counter clockwise so in
other<00:00:47.430> words<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.969> 30<00:00:48.210> degrees<00:00:48.570> right

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
other words this is 30 degrees right

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.400 
other words this is 30 degrees right
here<00:00:51.530> if<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.649> were<00:00:52.800> negative<00:00:53.250> 30<00:00:53.760> degrees<00:00:54.410> then

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
here if it were negative 30 degrees then

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.080 
here if it were negative 30 degrees then
it<00:00:55.469> would<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:55.920> clockwise<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> negative<00:00:59.850> 30

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
it would go clockwise so negative 30

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.399 
it would go clockwise so negative 30
degrees<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.570> down<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.899> way<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.960> opens<00:01:04.260> up

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
degrees is down this way it opens up

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.760 
degrees is down this way it opens up
that<00:01:04.439> way<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.900> same<00:01:06.900> thing<00:01:07.080> goes<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.260> radians

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that way and same thing goes for radians

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.520 
that way and same thing goes for radians
too<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.700> course<00:01:08.930> PI<00:01:09.930> over<00:01:10.200> 6

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
too you know this is of course PI over 6

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.690 
too you know this is of course PI over 6
radians<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:12.830> if<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.920> wanted<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> open<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.490> down

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
radians and if I wanted to open up down

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.730 
radians and if I wanted to open up down
this<00:01:14.909> way<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.360> would<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.710> right<00:01:16.710> here

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
this way this would be right here

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
this way this would be right here
negative<00:01:17.310> PI<00:01:17.520> over<00:01:17.549> 4<00:01:18.150> radians<00:01:20.450> all<00:01:21.450> right<00:01:21.630> if

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
negative PI over 4 radians all right if

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.390 
negative PI over 4 radians all right if
we<00:01:22.619> want<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> sometimes<00:01:23.520> we'll<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:23.820> around<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
we want to sometimes we'll go around a

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.590 
we want to sometimes we'll go around a
couple<00:01:26.400> times<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.090> wanted<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.479> an

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
couple times if you wanted to have an

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
couple times if you wanted to have an
angle<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.290> around<00:01:29.090> 360<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:31.640> stop

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
angle like go around 360 and then stop

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.929 
angle like go around 360 and then stop
there<00:01:33.140> all<00:01:34.140> right<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.939> 360

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
there all right so that would be 360

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.140 
there all right so that would be 360
degrees<00:01:36.000> plus<00:01:36.799> another<00:01:37.799> 45<00:01:38.490> degrees<00:01:38.880> let's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
degrees plus another 45 degrees let's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.039 
degrees plus another 45 degrees let's
say<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.829> would<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:40.950> 405<00:01:41.790> degrees<00:01:42.360> right

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
say so that would be 405 degrees right

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.190 
say so that would be 405 degrees right
here<00:01:43.350> goes<00:01:43.590> around<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:44.100> than<00:01:44.130> once<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.200> it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
here goes around more than once and it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.670 
here goes around more than once and it
stops<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.860> what<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.189> call<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.579> terminal

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
stops here what we call this terminal

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.530 
stops here what we call this terminal
the<00:01:49.680> terminal<00:01:49.770> side<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> terminal<00:01:51.270> ray

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the terminal side of the terminal ray

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.600 
the terminal side of the terminal ray
terminal<00:01:52.170> meaning<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> stops<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:55.430> angles<00:01:56.430> in

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
terminal meaning it stops so angles in

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.069 
terminal meaning it stops so angles in
standard<00:01:56.640> position<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.450> their<00:01:57.600> initial<00:01:57.750> ray

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
standard position have their initial ray

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.600 
standard position have their initial ray
on<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:59.070> positive<00:01:59.939> x-axis<00:02:01.040> their<00:02:02.040> vertex<00:02:02.460> on

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
on the positive x-axis their vertex on

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.560 
on the positive x-axis their vertex on
the<00:02:02.640> origin<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.270> their<00:02:04.110> terminal<00:02:04.619> ray

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
the origin and their terminal ray

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.459 
the origin and their terminal ray
depending<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> whether<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.049> positive<00:02:07.439> or

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
depending on whether it's positive or

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.260 
depending on whether it's positive or
negative<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> terminal<00:02:08.280> ray<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:08.550> reside<00:02:09.119> in

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
negative the terminal ray will reside in

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.210 
negative the terminal ray will reside in
quadrant<00:02:09.720> 1<00:02:09.979> 2<00:02:11.390> 3<00:02:12.500> 4<00:02:13.500> or

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
quadrant 1 2 3 4 or

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.420 
quadrant 1 2 3 4 or
was<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.340> good<00:02:14.520> lie<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.850> any<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.390> axes<00:02:16.430> so

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
was a good lie on any of the axes so

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.650 
was a good lie on any of the axes so
let's<00:02:17.550> try<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> couple<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.090> these<00:02:20.120> negative<00:02:21.120> 140

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
let's try a couple of these negative 140

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.650 
let's try a couple of these negative 140
all<00:02:22.530> right<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.790> negative<00:02:23.970> degree<00:02:24.450> so

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
all right so it's a negative degree so

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.190 
all right so it's a negative degree so
we're<00:02:24.810> definitely<00:02:24.870> going<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.230> go<00:02:27.200> clockwise

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
we're definitely going to go clockwise

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.590 
we're definitely going to go clockwise
so<00:02:28.680> let's<00:02:28.830> start<00:02:29.070> with<00:02:29.160> our<00:02:29.360> vertex<00:02:30.360> at<00:02:30.570> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
so let's start with our vertex at the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.530 
so let's start with our vertex at the
origin<00:02:30.740> our<00:02:31.740> initial<00:02:32.370> ray<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.880> positive

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
origin our initial ray on the positive

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.920 
origin our initial ray on the positive
x-axis<00:02:33.810> we're<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.350> go<00:02:34.410> down<00:02:34.670> 140

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
x-axis we're going to go down 140

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.500 
x-axis we're going to go down 140
negative<00:02:36.930> degrees<00:02:37.050> go<00:02:37.350> this<00:02:37.620> way<00:02:37.800> clockwise

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
negative degrees go this way clockwise

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.660 
negative degrees go this way clockwise
so<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.600> would<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.810> negative<00:02:39.960> 90<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:41.520> will

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
so this would be negative 90 this will

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.350 
so this would be negative 90 this will
be<00:02:41.730> negative<00:02:41.940> 180<00:02:43.100> well<00:02:44.100> negative<00:02:44.280> 140<00:02:45.120> is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
be negative 180 well negative 140 is

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.540 
be negative 180 well negative 140 is
going<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.630> be<00:02:47.420> somewhere<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.480> here<00:02:49.550> so

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
going to be somewhere in here so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.030 
going to be somewhere in here so
negative<00:02:50.820> 140<00:02:51.780> degrees<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.380> right<00:02:52.590> there<00:02:52.830> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
negative 140 degrees is right there and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800 
negative 140 degrees is right there and
in<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.000> next<00:02:54.180> video<00:02:54.300> we're<00:02:54.540> going<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.690> talk

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
in the next video we're going to talk

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.660 
in the next video we're going to talk
about<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:55.170> reference<00:02:55.590> angle<00:02:55.800> idea<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.430> fact

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
about this reference angle idea the fact

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.090 
about this reference angle idea the fact
that<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:57.750> case<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.200> reference<00:02:58.350> angle<00:02:58.980> is

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
that in this case the reference angle is

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
that in this case the reference angle is
going<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.370> 40<00:03:00.300> degrees<00:03:01.610> it's<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.700> distance

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
going to be 40 degrees it's a distance

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.640 
going to be 40 degrees it's a distance
between<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:05.959> terminal<00:03:06.959> side<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.260> an<00:03:07.530> angle

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
between the terminal side of an angle

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.250 
between the terminal side of an angle
and<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:09.270> x-axis<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:12.080> we'll<00:03:13.080> save<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
and the x-axis but this we'll save that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.410 
and the x-axis but this we'll save that
for<00:03:13.410> next<00:03:13.560> video<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.850> main<00:03:15.150> idea

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
for next video but the the main idea

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.449 
for next video but the the main idea
here<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.470> third<00:03:17.150> quadrant<00:03:18.150> angle

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
here is that it's a third quadrant angle

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.000 
here is that it's a third quadrant angle
goes<00:03:20.459> down<00:03:21.239> negative<00:03:22.170> angle<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.920> goes

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
goes down negative angle so it goes

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.780 
goes down negative angle so it goes
clockwise<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:25.100> just<00:03:26.100> have<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> general<00:03:26.640> idea

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
clockwise and just have a general idea

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.840 
clockwise and just have a general idea
that<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.630> negative<00:03:27.840> 90<00:03:28.380> degrees<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.790> is

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
that this is negative 90 degrees this is

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.729 
that this is negative 90 degrees this is
negative<00:03:30.420> 180<00:03:30.780> degrees<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.470> would<00:03:31.620> be

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
negative 180 degrees this would be

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.009 
negative 180 degrees this would be
negative<00:03:32.070> 270<00:03:32.760> degrees<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.450> would<00:03:33.600> be<00:03:33.720> zero

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
negative 270 degrees this would be zero

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.009 
negative 270 degrees this would be zero
degrees<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.410> negative<00:03:34.860> 360<00:03:35.790> degrees<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.870> it

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
degrees and negative 360 degrees and it

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.180 
degrees and negative 360 degrees and it
would<00:03:37.110> just<00:03:37.260> keep<00:03:37.380> going<00:03:37.709> around<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.070> around

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
would just keep going around and around

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.820 
would just keep going around and around
like<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.970> know<00:03:39.269> negative<00:03:39.690> 360<00:03:40.260> plus

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
like that you know negative 360 plus

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.690 
like that you know negative 360 plus
another<00:03:41.040> 90

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
another 90

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.340 
another 90
I<00:03:41.730> guess<00:03:42.150> minus<00:03:42.540> another<00:03:42.720> 90<00:03:43.110> would<00:03:43.260> be

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
I guess minus another 90 would be

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.130 
I guess minus another 90 would be
negative<00:03:43.739> 450<00:03:44.730> degrees<00:03:45.090> will<00:03:45.420> be<00:03:45.540> right<00:03:45.750> here

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
negative 450 degrees will be right here

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.720 
negative 450 degrees will be right here
and<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:47.130> on<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.489> forth<00:03:49.310> number<00:03:50.310> twos<00:03:50.519> and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
and so on and so forth number twos and

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.350 
and so on and so forth number twos and
radians<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:52.650> let's<00:03:52.769> graph<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.519> radians

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
radians so let's graph this in radians

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.920 
radians so let's graph this in radians
and<00:03:55.489> I'll<00:03:56.489> put<00:03:57.209> my<00:03:57.470> vertex<00:03:58.470> at<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.620> origin

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
and I'll put my vertex at the origin

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.960 
and I'll put my vertex at the origin
initial<00:04:00.930> side<00:04:01.140> right<00:04:01.380> there<00:04:01.760> this<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.940> a

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
initial side right there this is a

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.490 
initial side right there this is a
positive<00:04:03.600> angle<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.260> it's<00:04:04.380> going

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
positive angle so it's going

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.720 
positive angle so it's going
counterclockwise<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:06.140> it's<00:04:07.140> over<00:04:08.100> twelve<00:04:08.459> my

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
counterclockwise and it's over twelve my

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.400 
counterclockwise and it's over twelve my
diamond<00:04:09.060> aters<00:04:09.239> twelve<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:09.810> this<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:10.080> zero

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
diamond aters twelve so this is zero

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.979 
diamond aters twelve so this is zero
radians<00:04:10.890> if<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.760> go<00:04:11.910> all<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.209> way<00:04:12.299> around<00:04:12.660> it

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
radians if I go all the way around it

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.500 
radians if I go all the way around it
will<00:04:13.200> be<00:04:13.320> two<00:04:13.980> pi<00:04:14.250> radians<00:04:14.880> but<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.239> want<00:04:15.450> to

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
will be two pi radians but I want to

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.680 
will be two pi radians but I want to
convert<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:17.000> something<00:04:18.000> over<00:04:18.239> twelve

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
convert that to something over twelve

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.870 
convert that to something over twelve
well<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.500> would<00:04:19.620> be<00:04:19.650> 24<00:04:20.310> PI<00:04:20.729> over<00:04:21.359> 12<00:04:21.660> radians

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
well that would be 24 PI over 12 radians

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.210 
well that would be 24 PI over 12 radians
which<00:04:23.880> makes<00:04:24.120> this

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
which makes this

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.200 
which makes this
pi<00:04:25.610> radians<00:04:26.270> or<00:04:26.540> 12<00:04:27.380> PI<00:04:27.740> over<00:04:28.310> 12<00:04:28.580> ratings<00:04:29.000> it's

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
pi radians or 12 PI over 12 ratings it's

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.910 
pi radians or 12 PI over 12 ratings it's
good<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.510> have<00:04:29.600> these<00:04:29.810> these<00:04:30.590> like

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
good to have these these like

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.700 
good to have these these like
denominators<00:04:31.640> 90<00:04:32.630> degrees<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:33.140> generally<00:04:33.500> PI

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
denominators 90 degrees is generally PI

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.360 
denominators 90 degrees is generally PI
over<00:04:33.980> 2<00:04:35.170> but<00:04:36.170> if<00:04:36.260> it's<00:04:36.410> something<00:04:36.770> over<00:04:36.980> 12<00:04:37.100> it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
over 2 but if it's something over 12 it

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.730 
over 2 but if it's something over 12 it
will<00:04:37.430> be<00:04:37.490> 6<00:04:37.820> PI<00:04:38.090> over<00:04:38.120> 12<00:04:38.600> because<00:04:39.590> that's

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
will be 6 PI over 12 because that's

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.860 
will be 6 PI over 12 because that's
equal<00:04:40.040> to<00:04:40.070> PI<00:04:40.280> over<00:04:40.550> 2<00:04:40.760> so<00:04:41.000> I'm<00:04:41.690> just

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
equal to PI over 2 so I'm just

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.480 
equal to PI over 2 so I'm just
converting<00:04:42.350> these<00:04:42.440> fractions<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.220> all<00:04:43.340> have

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
converting these fractions to all have

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.000 
converting these fractions to all have
the<00:04:43.610> same<00:04:43.760> denominator<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.830> that's<00:04:45.830> going<00:04:45.950> to

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
the same denominator and that's going to

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.530 
the same denominator and that's going to
help<00:04:46.130> me<00:04:46.280> right<00:04:46.370> there<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.850> fact<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.180> 90

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
help me right there the fact that 90

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.650 
help me right there the fact that 90
degrees<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:48.020> 6<00:04:48.260> PI<00:04:48.500> over<00:04:48.680> 12<00:04:48.950> this<00:04:49.790> is<00:04:50.030> 7<00:04:50.420> PI

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
degrees is 6 PI over 12 this is 7 PI

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.090 
degrees is 6 PI over 12 this is 7 PI
over<00:04:50.870> 12<00:04:51.140> so<00:04:51.170> it's<00:04:51.350> going<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.500> be<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.620> little<00:04:51.920> bit

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
over 12 so it's going to be a little bit

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:00.520 
over 12 so it's going to be a little bit
more<00:04:53.830> than<00:04:55.240> 6<00:04:56.240> PI<00:04:56.450> over<00:04:56.630> 12<00:04:59.320> so<00:05:00.320> it'd<00:05:00.410> be<00:05:00.440> a

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
more than 6 PI over 12 so it'd be a

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.820 
more than 6 PI over 12 so it'd be a
second<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.450> second<00:05:02.450> quadrant<00:05:02.960> angle<00:05:05.590> number<00:05:06.590> 3

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
second a second quadrant angle number 3

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.490 
second a second quadrant angle number 3
in<00:05:07.070> standard<00:05:07.730> position<00:05:08.290> vertex<00:05:09.290> at<00:05:09.470> the

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
in standard position vertex at the

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.150 
in standard position vertex at the
origin<00:05:09.850> the<00:05:10.850> initial<00:05:11.180> side<00:05:11.390> on<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:11.660> x-axis

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
origin the initial side on the x-axis

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.950 
origin the initial side on the x-axis
negative<00:05:13.160> we're<00:05:13.310> going<00:05:13.340> this<00:05:13.700> way<00:05:13.960> clockwise

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
negative we're going this way clockwise

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.250 
negative we're going this way clockwise
so<00:05:15.470> I'm<00:05:15.560> going<00:05:15.680> to<00:05:15.710> go<00:05:16.180> negative<00:05:17.180> 90<00:05:17.810> negative

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
so I'm going to go negative 90 negative

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.540 
so I'm going to go negative 90 negative
180<00:05:18.650> negative<00:05:19.160> 270<00:05:19.850> negative<00:05:20.290> 360<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:22.400> I've

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
180 negative 270 negative 360 so I've

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.930 
180 negative 270 negative 360 so I've
gone<00:05:22.970> one<00:05:23.240> revolution<00:05:24.190> one<00:05:25.190> rotation

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
gone one revolution one rotation

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.030 
gone one revolution one rotation
whatever<00:05:26.120> you<00:05:26.300> want<00:05:26.420> to<00:05:26.480> call<00:05:26.600> it<00:05:26.750> is<00:05:27.040> 360

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
whatever you want to call it is 360

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.030 
whatever you want to call it is 360
degrees<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:28.610> I<00:05:29.180> need<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.390> go<00:05:29.540> 45<00:05:30.200> more<00:05:30.590> degrees

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
degrees and I need to go 45 more degrees

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.640 
degrees and I need to go 45 more degrees
than<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.720> 45<00:05:32.720> more<00:05:32.930> degrees<00:05:33.230> is<00:05:33.380> going<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.590> be

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
than that 45 more degrees is going to be

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.170 
than that 45 more degrees is going to be
right<00:05:33.890> in<00:05:33.980> here<00:05:34.220> it's<00:05:34.400> going<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.550> be<00:05:34.640> half<00:05:34.880> of

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
right in here it's going to be half of

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.960 
right in here it's going to be half of
90<00:05:35.720> so<00:05:36.650> that<00:05:36.770> would<00:05:36.890> be<00:05:36.980> negative<00:05:37.130> 405<00:05:38.320> degrees

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
90 so that would be negative 405 degrees

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.130 
90 so that would be negative 405 degrees
fourth<00:05:40.970> quadrant<00:05:41.620> and<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:44.780> quadrant<00:05:45.080> is

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
fourth quadrant and the quadrant is

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.330 
fourth quadrant and the quadrant is
going<00:05:45.260> to<00:05:45.320> be<00:05:45.380> important<00:05:45.770> as<00:05:45.860> we<00:05:45.980> move<00:05:46.130> forward

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
going to be important as we move forward

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.950 
going to be important as we move forward
into<00:05:46.640> our<00:05:46.910> unit<00:05:47.150> circle<00:05:49.419> all<00:05:50.419> right<00:05:50.600> next<00:05:50.780> up

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
into our unit circle all right next up

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.980 
into our unit circle all right next up
we've<00:05:51.169> got<00:05:51.200> 7<00:05:51.980> PI<00:05:52.190> over<00:05:52.220> 4<00:05:54.310> positive<00:05:55.310> so<00:05:56.030> this

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
we've got 7 PI over 4 positive so this

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.430 
we've got 7 PI over 4 positive so this
would<00:05:57.140> be<00:05:57.230> 4<00:05:57.560> PI<00:05:57.860> over<00:05:58.040> 4<00:05:58.430> this<00:05:59.270> would<00:05:59.450> be<00:05:59.570> 2<00:06:00.110> PI

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
would be 4 PI over 4 this would be 2 PI

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.300 
would be 4 PI over 4 this would be 2 PI
over<00:06:00.770> 4<00:06:01.390> this<00:06:02.390> would<00:06:02.570> be<00:06:02.690> down<00:06:03.020> here<00:06:03.050> 6<00:06:03.650> PI<00:06:03.980> over

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
over 4 this would be down here 6 PI over

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.200 
over 4 this would be down here 6 PI over
4<00:06:04.640> and<00:06:04.970> this<00:06:05.210> would<00:06:05.390> be<00:06:05.540> 0<00:06:06.020> or<00:06:06.350> 8<00:06:06.800> PI<00:06:07.250> over<00:06:07.880> 4

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
4 and this would be 0 or 8 PI over 4

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.830 
4 and this would be 0 or 8 PI over 4
radians<00:06:08.450> so<00:06:09.410> 7<00:06:09.800> PI<00:06:10.100> over<00:06:10.130> 4<00:06:10.370> is<00:06:10.910> going<00:06:11.540> to<00:06:11.630> be<00:06:11.690> in

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
radians so 7 PI over 4 is going to be in

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.710 
radians so 7 PI over 4 is going to be in
between<00:06:12.140> 6<00:06:12.530> &amp;<00:06:12.800> 8<00:06:16.270> there<00:06:17.270> we<00:06:17.390> go

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
between 6 &amp; 8 there we go

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.390 
between 6 &amp; 8 there we go
and<00:06:17.810> that<00:06:18.320> reference<00:06:18.680> angle<00:06:18.980> would<00:06:19.010> be<00:06:19.160> PI

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
and that reference angle would be PI

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.540 
and that reference angle would be PI
over<00:06:19.430> 4<00:06:20.740> again<00:06:21.740> the<00:06:21.830> reference<00:06:22.130> angle<00:06:22.490> is

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
over 4 again the reference angle is

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.220 
over 4 again the reference angle is
going<00:06:22.640> to<00:06:22.700> be<00:06:22.790> this<00:06:23.000> right<00:06:23.330> in<00:06:23.510> here<00:06:23.810> theta

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
going to be this right in here theta

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.060 
going to be this right in here theta
prime<00:06:26.290> but<00:06:27.290> we'll<00:06:27.440> come<00:06:27.560> back<00:06:27.590> to<00:06:27.740> that<00:06:27.919> in<00:06:28.010> the

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
prime but we'll come back to that in the

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.790 
prime but we'll come back to that in the
next<00:06:28.280> video<00:06:29.169> so<00:06:30.169> there<00:06:30.260> you<00:06:30.320> go<00:06:30.410> really<00:06:30.650> quick

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
next video so there you go really quick

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.370 
next video so there you go really quick
video<00:06:30.919> on

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
video on

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.230 
video on
getting<00:06:33.160> angles<00:06:33.430> in<00:06:33.520> the<00:06:33.610> standard<00:06:34.030> position

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
getting angles in the standard position

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.270 
getting angles in the standard position
it's<00:06:34.630> important<00:06:35.020> to<00:06:35.080> have<00:06:35.200> angles<00:06:35.860> that<00:06:36.100> are

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
it's important to have angles that are

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.130 
it's important to have angles that are
that<00:06:36.580> we<00:06:36.700> have<00:06:36.730> some<00:06:37.030> sort<00:06:37.240> of<00:06:37.300> convention<00:06:37.900> to

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
that we have some sort of convention to

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.130 
that we have some sort of convention to
follow<00:06:38.410> in<00:06:38.680> order<00:06:38.770> to<00:06:38.920> get<00:06:39.100> angles<00:06:39.490> all<00:06:39.730> in<00:06:40.140> the

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
follow in order to get angles all in the

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.810 
follow in order to get angles all in the
right<00:06:41.260> starting<00:06:41.860> in<00:06:41.950> the<00:06:42.010> right<00:06:42.040> spot<00:06:42.550> and

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
right starting in the right spot and

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.850 
right starting in the right spot and
having<00:06:43.570> this<00:06:43.690> convention<00:06:44.230> too<00:06:44.410> is<00:06:44.590> really

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
having this convention too is really

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.550 
having this convention too is really
important<00:06:45.340> so<00:06:45.780> there<00:06:46.780> you<00:06:46.870> go<00:06:46.960> next<00:06:47.290> video<00:06:47.470> we

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
important so there you go next video we

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.320 
important so there you go next video we
will<00:06:47.620> talk<00:06:47.770> about<00:06:47.890> reference<00:06:48.430> angles<00:06:48.940> so

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
will talk about reference angles so

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.990 
will talk about reference angles so
thanks<00:06:49.660> for<00:06:49.780> watching
