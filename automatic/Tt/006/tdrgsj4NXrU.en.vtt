00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.170
 very good day carlos martín and for 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.180
 you not following the 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.269
 easy concepts to use at home 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.669
 let's make another cocktail more in this 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.129
 occasion we are going to use techniques of what 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:18.160
 What is done in the mojito? 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.529
 use kiwi and obviously we're going to 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.560
 apply the lemon we will not use the water 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.330
 mineral or the area that is used for the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.400
 mojito let's make a version of a 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.869
 mojito a little more Ecuadorian 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.060
 taking advantage of all the fruits that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.590
 we have here in box throughout 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.900
 all this tour we will see those 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.730
 changed versions and a little bit says 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.830
 when you are going to attack the little 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.230
 but we're going to do it a little bit 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.790
 more towards the equatorial a little bit more 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.060
 towards style that works also in 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.770
 events ok even with that we're going to do the 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.680
 cut of him 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.820
 we know that they can use half a lemon to 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.110
 Half of me like to use simple lemon 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.110
 for aesthetics 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.190
 in 4 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.879
 three parts of plants 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.439
 we have here 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.439
 I use this English mix 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.250
 and proceeds to put cuts kim 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.250
 previously already cut 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.490
 the younger you put it, obviously, it's 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.490
 much less 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.670
 ah 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 let's use a little bit of the sugar already 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.780
 we put two we are going to put a little bit 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.080
 plus three teaspoons and a half 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.080
 two 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.719
 3 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.719
 and a half 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.189
 We are going to use our macerated 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.829
 and always trying not to dirty the 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.780
 external part we will protect the glass 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.899
 at the same time avoid touching the edge of the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.899
 glass 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.759
 we were also 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.200
 always trying to make that pill 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.190
 it's a bit thick when we go to 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.190
 macerate the cocktail 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:29.200
 if we realize the product is a 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.159
 helmet 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.180
 we clean stored and proceed to 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.850
 use the block 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.180
 I love rock 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.730
 to that feeling of being more elaborate and 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.270
 therefore, it will provide more roads to 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.270
 cocktail 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:54.450
 now we are not going to destroy 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.450
 the secret ingredient the peppermint 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.310
 to place this will be good 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.530
 a little bit more of the good of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.130
 peppermint cost 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.130
 all right 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.320
 You feel 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.670
 billboard 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.910
 well we are not putting any kind of 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.910
 Water 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.260
 if they realize the consistency that 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.260
 change the color 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.920
 ah 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.920
 for solar 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.140
 ah 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:04:00.120
 we remove the one from whom and this time 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:03.440
 let's use a double tail technique 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.080
 the double coladas 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.480
 is to put our caterpillar strainer in the 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.200
 shaker and use a napkin 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.200
 homemade 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.579
 just below the dosage 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.850
 and proceed this is a little bit of 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.850
 patience 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.260
 it's how you look for the last days 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.850
 there was a fruit that have peels 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.850
 even if it has seeds 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.889
 and so we are proceeding to fill 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.740
 the glass 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.740
 we must 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.879
 come on, come on, come on 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.180
 They realize consistency having 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.180
 this incredible concept 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.199
 the most point 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.470
 but we have the foam gentlemen the foam 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.729
 gives us a good indication that the cocktail 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.729
 is consistent 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:27.530
 let's proceed to decorate by the 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.569
 protest command of the glass we are going to put 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.569
 a full moon of lemon 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.000
 and we can not miss the grass web 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.160
 and only one type 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.600
 or the sides 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.600
 will be two to share 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.450
 we have here our kiwi mojito 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.810
 gentlemen to enjoy with martín and to 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.810
 your
