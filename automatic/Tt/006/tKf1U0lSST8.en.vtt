moisture and if you leave it flat on a
plate<00:05:03.440> it's<00:05:04.440> going<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:05.040> get<00:05:05.940> very<00:05:06.180> soggy<00:05:06.980> where

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
plate it's going to get very soggy where

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.550 
plate it's going to get very soggy where
it<00:05:08.070> sits<00:05:08.250> against<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.790> plate<00:05:09.030> so<00:05:09.960> I<00:05:09.990> leave<00:05:10.350> the
