00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.950 
version I don't think there's going to
be<00:01:28.409> framerate<00:01:28.740> drops<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.909> bet<00:01:30.210> me<00:01:30.420> he<00:01:30.600> says

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
be framerate drops so we bet me he says

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.350 
be framerate drops so we bet me he says
okay<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:31.920> framerate<00:01:32.400> drops<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
okay if there are framerate drops you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.149 
okay if there are framerate drops you
have<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.750> out<00:01:33.780> by<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> x1<00:01:34.590> version<00:01:35.040> of

have to go out by the x1 version of
advanced<00:01:35.820> warfare<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.509> said<00:01:36.960> okay<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.259> there's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
advanced warfare I said okay if there's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.100 
advanced warfare I said okay if there's
not<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.579> buy<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:39.090> me<00:01:39.240> he<00:01:39.689> agreed

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
not you have to buy it for me he agreed

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.889 
not you have to buy it for me he agreed
now<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> told<00:01:41.310> him<00:01:41.400> about<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.790> whole<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.750> know

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
now I told him about that whole you know

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.990 
now I told him about that whole you know
the<00:01:43.380> theory<00:01:43.680> behind<00:01:43.920> ghost<00:01:44.430> was<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the theory behind ghost was that the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.550 
the theory behind ghost was that the
frame<00:01:45.240> rates<00:01:45.479> were<00:01:45.630> actually<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.140> higher

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
frame rates were actually going higher

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.219 
frame rates were actually going higher
than<00:01:47.280> 60<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.119> why<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.479> stutters<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.020> bad

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
than 60 that's why it's stutters so bad

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.109 
than 60 that's why it's stutters so bad
he<00:01:50.040> said<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.490> dumbest<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:50.850> he's

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
he said that's the dumbest thing he's

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.609 
he said that's the dumbest thing he's
ever<00:01:51.210> heard<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.750> doesn't<00:01:52.110> make<00:01:52.170> sense<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.500> me

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
ever heard it doesn't make sense to me

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.920 
ever heard it doesn't make sense to me
either<00:01:52.770> I'd<00:01:53.490> never<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:54.090> even<00:01:54.149> verified<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
either I'd never really even verified it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.690 
either I'd never really even verified it
so<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.200> said<00:01:55.409> keep<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.710> internet<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
with the ps4 version there was a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.770 
with the ps4 version there was a
significant<00:02:39.640> amount<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.910> lag<00:02:40.090> my<00:02:40.360> first<00:02:40.630> two

significant amount of lag my first two

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.780 
significant amount of lag my first two
games<00:02:41.050> but<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.680> did<00:02:41.920> get<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.160> day<00:02:42.340> zero<00:02:42.700> edition
