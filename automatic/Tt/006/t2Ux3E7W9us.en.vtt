in<00:00:30.689> fourteen<00:00:31.109> different<00:00:31.320> colors<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:32.369> do

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
have a reflective finish and what I'll

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.490 
have a reflective finish and what I'll
do<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:38.120> sample<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> colors<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.290> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
do is sample some of the colors for you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so you can see really how they look on

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.950 
so you can see really how they look on
both<00:00:43.140> light<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.710> dark<00:00:44.480> metallic<00:00:45.480> finish

papers and matte finish papers and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
papers and matte finish papers and
you're<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.289> different

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you're going to see that different

colors look different on different

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.459 
colors look different on different
surfaces<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:53.300> let's<00:00:54.300> get<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.660> testing<00:00:55.199> if

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
surfaces so let's get to the testing if

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.760 
surfaces so let's get to the testing if
you'll<00:00:55.710> swing<00:00:56.250> around<00:00:56.399> mr.<00:00:57.000> cameraman<00:00:57.770> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you'll swing around mr. cameraman the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.010 
you'll swing around mr. cameraman the
first<00:00:59.039> paper<00:00:59.340> example<00:00:59.969> I'd<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
first paper example I'd like to use is a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.950 
first paper example I'd like to use is a
metallic<00:01:01.530> black<00:01:02.010> card<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.449> first<00:01:03.660> color

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
metallic black card and the first color

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.820 
metallic black card and the first color
sample<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> emerald<00:01:05.489> green<00:01:05.700> which<00:01:06.119> seems<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
sample is emerald green which seems to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.039 
sample is emerald green which seems to
really<00:01:07.830> show<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.250> nicely<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.750> metallic

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
really show up nicely on the metallic

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:23.390 
really show up nicely on the metallic
black<00:01:10.470> paper<00:01:15.770> next<00:01:16.770> let's<00:01:16.979> try<00:01:17.159> silver<00:01:22.400> both

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
black paper next let's try silver both

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
black paper next let's try silver both
of<00:01:23.580> those<00:01:23.670> look<00:01:23.909> pretty<00:01:24.180> nice<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.080> hope

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
of those look pretty nice I think I hope

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you're able to see that let's try one

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.179 
you're able to see that let's try one
more<00:01:28.490> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.549> gold<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.979> see

more this is gold and you can see

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.640 
more this is gold and you can see
because<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.670> left-handed<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.750> dangerously

because I'm left-handed I'm dangerously
close<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.009> my<00:01:38.369> hand<00:01:38.790> dragging<00:01:39.390> over<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.380> ink

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.789 
close to my hand dragging over my ink
which<00:01:41.100> would<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.729> good<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.180> these<00:01:42.590> inks<00:01:43.590> do

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
which would not be good as these inks do

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.069 
which would not be good as these inks do
take<00:01:44.040> quite<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> while<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.880> dry<00:01:45.090> right-handed

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
take quite a while to dry right-handed

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.660 
take quite a while to dry right-handed
people<00:01:46.200> might<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> little<00:01:47.040> easier<00:01:47.399> I'm

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
people might have it a little easier I'm

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.310 
people might have it a little easier I'm
not<00:01:47.850> sure<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:48.390> let's<00:01:49.259> change<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> card<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.759> a

little<00:01:54.180> stack<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.600> cards<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.530> let's<00:01:56.399> try

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
little stack of cards here let's try

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.340 
little stack of cards here let's try
some<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.119> same<00:01:57.329> colors<00:01:57.810> here's<00:01:58.170> that

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
some of the same colors here's that

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:07.150 
some of the same colors here's that
emerald<00:01:58.860> green<00:01:59.420> your<00:02:00.420> silver

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.550 

that<00:02:08.160> purple<00:02:08.660> doesn't<00:02:09.660> look<00:02:09.810> bad<00:02:10.050> let<00:02:10.229> me<00:02:10.320> try

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
that purple doesn't look bad let me try

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.130 
that purple doesn't look bad let me try
it<00:02:10.590> once<00:02:10.860> more<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:14.300> think<00:02:15.300> when<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> hold<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.870> pen

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it once more I think when I hold the pen

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.800 
it once more I think when I hold the pen
at<00:02:17.130> more<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.490> 90-degree<00:02:18.150> angle<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.660> works

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
at more of a 90-degree angle it works

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.140 
at more of a 90-degree angle it works
better<00:02:19.080> than<00:02:19.350> if<00:02:19.500> I've<00:02:20.130> really<00:02:20.310> got<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.670> angled

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
better than if I've really got it angled

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.110 
better than if I've really got it angled
down<00:02:21.360> at<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.840> 45<00:02:21.960> like<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.640> seems<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.940> be

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
down at a 45 like this it seems to be

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.410 
down at a 45 like this it seems to be
more<00:02:24.300> saturated<00:02:25.490> this<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> black<00:02:27.000> matte

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
more saturated this is a black matte

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.570 
more saturated this is a black matte
finish<00:02:28.130> let's<00:02:29.130> go<00:02:29.580> with<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.820> same<00:02:30.030> colors

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
finish let's go with the same colors

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.680 
finish let's go with the same colors
here's<00:02:32.580> emerald<00:02:33.120> green<00:02:38.240> silver<00:02:39.240> looks<00:02:39.420> really

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
here's emerald green silver looks really

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.680 
here's emerald green silver looks really
nice

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
nice

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.270 
nice
again<00:02:42.690> I'm<00:02:42.840> seeing<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.200> lot<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.500> silver<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.010> this

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
again I'm seeing a lot of silver in this

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.580 
again I'm seeing a lot of silver in this
sample<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.910> I'm<00:02:45.090> not<00:02:45.300> sure<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.410> can

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
sample and I'm not sure it that you can

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.520 
sample and I'm not sure it that you can
pick<00:02:46.800> this<00:02:46.950> up<00:02:47.010> from<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.490> different<00:02:47.820> angles

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
pick this up from the different angles

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.010 
pick this up from the different angles
but<00:02:49.530> at<00:02:49.950> certain<00:02:50.340> angles<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.300> more<00:02:51.540> purple

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
but at certain angles I see more purple

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.240 
but at certain angles I see more purple
and<00:02:52.230> at<00:02:52.290> certain<00:02:52.590> angles<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.070> see<00:02:53.310> more<00:02:53.610> silver

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
and at certain angles I see more silver

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.740 
and at certain angles I see more silver
so<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.340> can<00:02:56.550> see<00:02:56.790> you've<00:02:56.970> really<00:02:57.240> got<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.510> test

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
so you can see you've really got to test

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.750 
so you can see you've really got to test
the<00:02:57.930> colors<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.590> different<00:02:58.650> stocks<00:02:59.520> that
