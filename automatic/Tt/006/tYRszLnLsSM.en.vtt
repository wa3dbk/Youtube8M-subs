00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 and show another variety that too 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.809
 is winter it realizes even in 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:15.139
 March is the Poles vault but he too 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:19.590
 to implement already during his fits 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.390
 gaps between 40 legal we have it back 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.080
 later movie about later varieties 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.199
 show but he is ready to eat 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.070
 he has such a sweetly sour taste now 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.019
 a little later 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.940
 will get sweeter but apple size 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.370
 already gained and in principle in the implementation 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 you can already run it 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:43.250
 Here is such an interesting variety 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.250
 delicious 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.870
 He had an average winter hardiness honeycrisp 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.770
 let's say it is very high 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.770
 winter hardiness 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.470
 at the level of Antonovka with Antonovka 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.230
 and the only minus is his nike ear 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.690
 at risk that on the leaves some kind of birth 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.740
 we have claws 1 of this sort on this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.030
 much attention should not be paid because 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.310
 that the variety here is really very very 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.979
 known here's your common 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.570
 apples European varieties honeycrisp 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.300
 illegal here they are 2 things you can do with 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.149
 September, but to implement them 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.130
 I repeat this winter varieties 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:33.710
 but the radney in the fall is already possible 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.710
 they are already ready to realize 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.250
 The legal variety of many I have already said that he and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.950
 green in the garden is often with us 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.090
 painted bright red 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.290
 apple is pure sweet when stored 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.300
 becomes in special vaults she 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.130
 topping up in April to sell it 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.700
 starts she basically goes to poland 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.910
 greenish but we have it Vitebsk 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.069
 the area is painted so well of course 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.190
 the same 40 average hardy because 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:08.340
 imported here but I I would not 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.190
 gone though we only have 2 but 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.420
 apples are absolutely healthy here at seven 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.340
 winds so it stands on 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.690
 gardens quiet part 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.459
 if in industrial comb even 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.630
 Vitebsk let him sit and normal 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.280
 the only thing that feels like 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.610
 processed Poland need someone once 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.610
 Keep
