00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
have change it on TTL a-15 so I'm just

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:45.470 
have change it on TTL a-15 so I'm just
going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> put<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.219> camera<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:45.180> turn

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.810 
on and it's on TTL so it stays on TTL so
just<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> test<00:01:20.130> button<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.759> will<00:01:20.880> flash

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
just use a test button it will flash

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.719 
just use a test button it will flash
okay<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:23.970> much<00:01:24.479> leave<00:01:24.840> me<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
it's on TTL all right so if I press the

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.980 
it's on TTL all right so if I press the
test<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:40.240> here<00:01:40.570> so<00:01:41.560> yeah<00:01:42.039> it<00:01:42.429> recognizes

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
test on here so yeah it recognizes

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.690 
test on here so yeah it recognizes
flashes<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.659> in<00:01:49.869> see<00:01:50.079> what<00:01:50.350> now<00:01:50.890> I'll

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
flashes and this is in see what now I'll

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.770 
flashes and this is in see what now I'll
change<00:01:51.939> that<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.210> c1

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
change that to c1

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.100 
change that to c1
I'm<00:01:55.780> group<00:01:56.319> a<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.490> now<00:01:57.759> both<00:01:58.270> shoot<00:01:58.840> the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
I'm group a so now both shoot the

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.940 
I'm group a so now both shoot the
pressure<00:02:00.009> test<00:02:00.340> yep

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
pressure test yep

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.910 
pressure test yep
okay<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.369> now<00:02:03.549> I'm<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.880> manual<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:05.020> if<00:02:05.349> I<00:02:05.530> fire

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
okay so now I'm on manual so if I fire

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.449 
okay so now I'm on manual so if I fire
if<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.520> fire<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:08.110> camera<00:02:08.880> both<00:02:09.880> flash<00:02:10.209> files

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
if I fire the camera both flash files

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.120 
if I fire the camera both flash files
okay<00:02:12.459> so<00:02:12.940> now<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:14.549> change<00:02:15.549> that<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:18.010> if

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
okay so now I change that to what if

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.370 
okay so now I change that to what if
it's<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.400> super<00:02:18.730> sync<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.660> will<00:02:19.810> fire<00:02:20.019> as<00:02:20.230> well

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
it's on super sync it will fire as well

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.199 
it's on super sync it will fire as well
so<00:02:21.370> if<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.940> make<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.930> TTL<00:02:24.360> nothing<00:02:25.360> happens

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
so if I make that to TTL nothing happens

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.240 
so if I make that to TTL nothing happens
nothing<00:02:28.209> happens<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:30.299> if<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.420> press<00:02:31.630> test<00:02:32.250> is

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
nothing happens so if I press test is

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.729 
nothing happens so if I press test is
still<00:02:33.400> detects<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.900> does<00:02:35.139> detect

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
still detects it does detect

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.690 
still detects it does detect
um<00:02:35.829> I<00:02:36.549> change<00:02:37.150> aperture<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.380> changes<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.489> it's

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
um I change aperture it changes so it's

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.720 
um I change aperture it changes so it's
all<00:02:39.910> good<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:41.049> it<00:02:41.859> doesn't<00:02:42.810> fire<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:45.250> if<00:02:45.519> we

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
all good but it doesn't fire so if we

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:55.259 
all good but it doesn't fire so if we
change<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:48.209> back<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:50.489> menu<00:02:52.350> now<00:02:53.350> on<00:02:53.560> menu<00:02:54.269> it

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
change that back to menu now on menu it

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.809 
change that back to menu now on menu it
will<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.840> wolf

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
will a wolf

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.979 
will a wolf
okay<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.090> super<00:02:59.079> sync<00:02:59.459> file<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.480> on<00:03:02.100> TTL

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
okay and super sync file but on TTL

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:12.839 
okay and super sync file but on TTL
detail<00:03:07.859> it<00:03:08.859> won't<00:03:09.130> fire<00:03:09.660> okay<00:03:11.400> all<00:03:12.400> right<00:03:12.549> so

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
detail it won't fire okay all right so

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.270
