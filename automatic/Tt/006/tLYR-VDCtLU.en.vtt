00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:05.000
 ... you were fantastic, I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 puenta is ... 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 is there any point? 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 let's find the punch line. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 is there any point in my performance? 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 I would say it is ... 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 I have to. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 The world is like a ride in an amusement park 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 and when you decide on it, you think that you are going really, because our minds are so powerful. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 And the ride flies up and down and everywhere around, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 at times it is frightening, at times calm, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 and it is very colorful and it is very loud 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 and it's fun ... for a while. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.500
 Some have been on the ride for a long time 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.000
 and they start asking the question: 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 "Is this really happening or is it just a ride?" 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And other people who remember come to us and say: 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 "Hey, do not worry, do not be scared. Never. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Because... 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 it's just a ride. " 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 And we ... 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 we kill these people. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 "Silence him! 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 We have invested a lot in this ride. Quiet him! 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Look what wrinkles from worries I have, 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Look at my thick bank account 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 and for my family. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 It must be true. " 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 It's just a ride. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 But we always kill those good people who are trying to tell us. Have you noticed this? 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 And let the demons rule in amok. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 But it does not matter anyway, because ... 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 it's just a ride. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 And we can change it whenever we want. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 It's just a matter of choice. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 No effort, no work, no savings ... 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Just choose. Now. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Between fear and love. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 The eyes of fear want you to put on a bigger lock in the door, buy a gun, lock yourself in the house. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 The eyes of love instead perceive us all as one. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 So here's what we can do now to change the world. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 To have a better ride. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Take all the money we spend on arms each year 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 and allocate it to clothing, food and education for the poor of this world 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 which would turn out many times. No one would feel excluded. And we could conquer the universe. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Together. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Both internal and external ... 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 forever. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 In a room. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.533
 Bill Hicks (1961-1994)
