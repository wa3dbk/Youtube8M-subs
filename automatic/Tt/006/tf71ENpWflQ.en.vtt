because<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.140> general<00:00:07.410> structure<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.069> map

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
because the general structure of the map

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.910 
because the general structure of the map
is<00:00:08.429> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.849> be<00:00:08.970> completed<00:00:09.769> beyond<00:00:10.769> this

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
is going to be completed beyond this

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.410 
is going to be completed beyond this
point<00:00:11.190> all<00:00:11.370> that's<00:00:11.519> really<00:00:11.639> left<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> few

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
point all that's really left is a few

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.120 
point all that's really left is a few
minor<00:00:12.660> details<00:00:12.840> stuff<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.469> trees<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
minor details stuff like trees and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.919 
minor details stuff like trees and
crates<00:00:14.429> as<00:00:14.639> well<00:00:15.120> as<00:00:15.179> weapon<00:00:15.450> placements

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
crates as well as weapon placements

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.109 
crates as well as weapon placements
spawn<00:00:16.170> points<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.890> objective<00:00:17.550> placements

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
spawn points and objective placements

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.019 
spawn points and objective placements
but<00:00:19.080> here's<00:00:19.619> where<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.039> form<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> map

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
but here's where the form of the map

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.019 
but here's where the form of the map
truly<00:00:21.480> gets<00:00:21.660> defined<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.550> this<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> stuff

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
truly gets defined and this is the stuff

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.060 
truly gets defined and this is the stuff
that<00:00:24.060> won't<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.420> adjusted<00:00:24.869> too<00:00:25.080> much<00:00:25.320> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
that won't get adjusted too much you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
that won't get adjusted too much you
know<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.699> general<00:00:27.029> shape<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.840> look

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
know this is the general shape and look

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.320 
know this is the general shape and look
of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> map<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.699> you'll<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:29.970> seeing<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.269> this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
of the map that you'll be seeing in this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
of the map that you'll be seeing in this
video<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.050> sticking<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.830> put<00:00:32.730> in

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
video that I'm sticking with I put in

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.220 
video that I'm sticking with I put in
some<00:00:32.969> cliff<00:00:33.180> walls<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.690> fail<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:33.989> all<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
some cliff walls I fail out all the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.600 
some cliff walls I fail out all the
terrain<00:00:34.559> i<00:00:34.590> put<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> few<00:00:35.280> additional

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
terrain i put in a few additional

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.299 
terrain i put in a few additional
buildings<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.390> map<00:00:37.320> gets<00:00:37.559> very<00:00:37.800> close<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
buildings and the map gets very close to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.220 
buildings and the map gets very close to
completion<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.600> kind<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.809> brings<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.140> an

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
completion and it kind of brings up an

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.690 
completion and it kind of brings up an
interesting<00:00:40.320> fact<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.070> means<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.579> this

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
interesting fact that means that this

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400 
interesting fact that means that this
little<00:00:41.969> series<00:00:42.149> here<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.600> almost<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.230> end

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
often I I do enjoy making these I just

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
often I I do enjoy making these I just
don't<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.430> him<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.789> did<00:01:03.059> him<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.270> few<00:01:03.390> times<00:01:03.570> in

don't do him I did him a few times in
reach<00:01:03.960> maybe<00:01:04.920> once<00:01:05.280> or<00:01:05.430> twice<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.700> Halo<00:01:06.119> 4<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
reach maybe once or twice in Halo 4 and

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.899 
reach maybe once or twice in Halo 4 and
this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> first<00:01:08.130> one<00:01:08.430> I've<00:01:08.520> done<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.880> far

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
this is the first one I've done so far

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.370 
this is the first one I've done so far
and<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> course<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> little<00:01:10.140> bit<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and of course it's in a little bit of a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.130 
and of course it's in a little bit of a
different<00:01:10.740> format<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.420> due<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
different format but due to all the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.960 
different format but due to all the
feedback<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.979> pretty<00:01:14.610> much<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
feedback I'm pretty much going to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.330 
feedback I'm pretty much going to
continue<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.420> series<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:16.200> am<00:01:16.920> working<00:01:17.100> on

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
continue the series I am working on

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.920 
continue the series I am working on
another<00:01:17.549> map<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.000> moment<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.450> was<00:01:18.750> not

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
another map at the moment but I was not

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.090 
another map at the moment but I was not
recording<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> wasn't<00:01:19.860> paying<00:01:19.979> attention

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
recording it I wasn't paying attention

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.370 
recording it I wasn't paying attention
so<00:01:20.729> once<00:01:21.060> i'm<00:01:21.180> done<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.990> next<00:01:22.229> map

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
so once i'm done with that the next map

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.370 
so once i'm done with that the next map
by<00:01:22.530> build<00:01:22.770> i'll<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.310> sure<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.520> record<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
by build i'll be sure to record it and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
by build i'll be sure to record it and
maybe<00:01:25.380> bring<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.770> series<00:01:26.100> back<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.700> gonna

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
maybe bring this series back it is gonna

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.300 
maybe bring this series back it is gonna
take<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.150> bit<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.479> break<00:01:27.689> after<00:01:27.869> this

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
take a little bit of a break after this

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.429 
take a little bit of a break after this
and<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.939> when<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.600> returns<00:01:30.930> we'll<00:01:31.290> be

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and then when it returns we'll be

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.950 
and then when it returns we'll be
building<00:01:31.890> an<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.369> new<00:01:32.579> map<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.810> i<00:01:33.930> said

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
building an all new map but like i said

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 
building an all new map but like i said
you<00:01:34.320> guys<00:01:34.470> haven't<00:01:34.950> giving<00:01:35.310> me<00:01:35.430> some<00:01:35.640> feedback

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
you guys haven't giving me some feedback

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.780 
you guys haven't giving me some feedback
of<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.380> biggest<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> got<00:01:38.100> was<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.400> people

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
of the biggest one I got was that people

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.929 
of the biggest one I got was that people
wanted<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.630> slower<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.610> longer<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
wanted it to be slower or longer the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.280 
wanted it to be slower or longer the
feedback<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.509> kind<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> vague<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.020> people

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
feedback was kind of vague but people

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.840 
feedback was kind of vague but people
kept<00:01:43.409> saying<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.740> longer<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.220> again<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> think

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
kept saying was longer and again I think

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
kept saying was longer and again I think
what<00:01:45.119> they<00:01:45.210> meant<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.479> slower<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.979> episode

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
what they meant was slower this episode

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.670 
what they meant was slower this episode
is<00:01:47.310> technically<00:01:47.820> longer<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> time<00:01:49.409> lapse

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
is technically longer but the time lapse

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.950 
is technically longer but the time lapse
speed<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.610> whatever<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.750> want<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
speed or the the whatever you want to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.929 
speed or the the whatever you want to
call<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> playback<00:01:52.530> speed<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.579> same

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
call it the playback speed is the same

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.249 
call it the playback speed is the same
I've<00:01:54.180> kept<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> constant<00:01:54.960> throughout<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
I've kept it constant throughout the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.280 
I've kept it constant throughout the
series<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> sped<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.579> by<00:01:56.790> six<00:01:57.149> times<00:01:57.540> so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
series this is sped up by six times so

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.660 
series this is sped up by six times so
if<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.590> take<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> episodes<00:01:59.159> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
if you take all the episodes and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
if you take all the episodes and
multiply<00:02:00.149> them<00:02:00.180> out<00:02:00.420> by<00:02:00.570> six<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.020> figure

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
multiply them out by six you can figure

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.840 
multiply them out by six you can figure
out<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.560> exact<00:02:01.860> amount<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.130> time<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> took<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
out the exact amount of time I took to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.870 
out the exact amount of time I took to
build<00:02:03.000> all<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.219> it<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.430> be<00:02:05.579> quite<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
build all this and it can be quite a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999 
build all this and it can be quite a
while<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.960> off<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.320> top<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.500> my<00:02:07.680> head<00:02:07.740> I'm

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
while just off the top of my head I'm

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.529 
while just off the top of my head I'm
gonna<00:02:08.160> take<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> rough<00:02:08.489> guess<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.879> say<00:02:09.030> this

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
gonna take a rough guess and say this

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.090 
gonna take a rough guess and say this
took<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.349> know<00:02:10.440> four<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.979> five

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
took you know four to five

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.950 
took you know four to five
hours<00:02:12.340> that's<00:02:13.240> usually<00:02:13.390> what<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.630> takes<00:02:13.810> for

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
hours that's usually what it takes for

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.990 
hours that's usually what it takes for
me<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.050> forge<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.440> map<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.070> by<00:02:15.430> no<00:02:15.490> means<00:02:15.790> will<00:02:15.910> I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
me to forge a map so by no means will I

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.580 
me to forge a map so by no means will I
ever<00:02:16.150> do<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.480> series<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:16.930> real<00:02:17.110> time<00:02:17.350> that

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
ever do this series in real time that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.140 
ever do this series in real time that
will<00:02:17.710> take<00:02:17.890> way<00:02:18.250> too<00:02:18.280> long<00:02:18.550> they<00:02:18.910> get<00:02:19.030> through

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
will take way too long they get through

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.120 
will take way too long they get through
a<00:02:19.180> map<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:20.020> will<00:02:20.170> always<00:02:20.320> be<00:02:20.440> time-lapse<00:02:20.950> to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
a map it will always be time-lapse to

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.120 
a map it will always be time-lapse to
some<00:02:21.310> degree<00:02:21.490> but<00:02:22.360> when<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.840> returns<00:02:23.260> maybe

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
some degree but when this returns maybe

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.950 
some degree but when this returns maybe
I'll<00:02:24.400> play<00:02:24.580> with<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.910> little<00:02:25.060> bit<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.450> try

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
I'll play with that a little bit and try

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.420 
I'll play with that a little bit and try
different<00:02:26.020> speed<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.560> sail<00:02:26.800> people<00:02:27.070> like<00:02:27.220> it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
different speed and sail people like it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.950 
different speed and sail people like it
I<00:02:27.580> don't<00:02:28.060> want<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.240> episodes<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.600> be<00:02:28.690> super

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
I don't want the episodes to be super

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.030 
I don't want the episodes to be super
long<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.320> is<00:02:29.410> something<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:29.830> want

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
long this is something that I want

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.350 
long this is something that I want
people<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.280> just<00:02:30.430> be<00:02:30.520> able<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.730> jump<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.240> and

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
people to just be able to jump in and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.270 
people to just be able to jump in and
watch<00:02:31.540> really<00:02:31.870> quickly<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.470> don't<00:02:32.890> want<00:02:33.010> anyone

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
watch really quickly I don't want anyone

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.380 
watch really quickly I don't want anyone
to<00:02:33.370> have<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.550> commit<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.850> sitting<00:02:34.210> there<00:02:34.330> and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
to have to commit to sitting there and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.780 
to have to commit to sitting there and
watching<00:02:34.540> like<00:02:34.870> half<00:02:35.110> an<00:02:35.260> hour<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.500> footage

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
watching like half an hour of footage

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.890 
watching like half an hour of footage
the<00:02:36.790> longest<00:02:37.180> I'm<00:02:37.300> willing<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.540> go<00:02:37.720> is

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the longest I'm willing to go is

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.050 
the longest I'm willing to go is
probably<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.590> neighborhood<00:02:38.710> of<00:02:38.980> 12<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.670> 15

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
probably in the neighborhood of 12 to 15

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.590 
probably in the neighborhood of 12 to 15
minutes<00:02:40.300> if<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.900> do<00:02:40.960> want<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.470> make<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.680> slower

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
minutes if I do want to make it slower

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.820 
minutes if I do want to make it slower
currently<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> episodes<00:02:44.020> are<00:02:44.080> about<00:02:44.260> five<00:02:44.560> to

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
currently the episodes are about five to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.320 
currently the episodes are about five to
eight<00:02:44.860> minutes<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.790> probably<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
eight minutes this is probably the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.930 
eight minutes this is probably the
longest<00:02:46.480> one<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.930> series<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.410> far<00:02:47.940> but

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
longest one of the series so far but

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.430 
longest one of the series so far but
yeah<00:02:49.270> that's<00:02:49.420> enough<00:02:49.660> about<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.990> shell<00:02:50.230> let's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
yeah that's enough about the shell let's

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.600 
yeah that's enough about the shell let's
just<00:02:50.470> get<00:02:50.650> back<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.980> map<00:02:51.130> here<00:02:51.340> as<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.580> can

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
just get back to the map here as you can

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.460 
just get back to the map here as you can
see<00:02:51.700> like<00:02:51.910> i<00:02:51.940> said<00:02:52.120> it's<00:02:52.300> taken<00:02:52.630> shape<00:02:52.900> here<00:02:53.170> on

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
see like i said it's taken shape here on

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.540 
see like i said it's taken shape here on
the<00:02:53.650> original<00:02:53.890> map<00:02:54.040> there's<00:02:54.250> sort<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.460> a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
the original map there's sort of a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.520 
the original map there's sort of a
little<00:02:54.760> Hill<00:02:54.940> here<00:02:54.970> with<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.420> garage<00:02:55.690> on<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.350> so

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
little Hill here with a garage on it so

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.080 
little Hill here with a garage on it so
that's<00:02:56.770> what<00:02:56.890> I'm<00:02:56.950> constructing<00:02:57.340> right<00:02:57.760> here

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
that's what I'm constructing right here

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.490 
that's what I'm constructing right here
and<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.720> takes<00:02:58.870> me<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.050> while<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.200> get<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
and it takes me a while to get the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.440 
and it takes me a while to get the
garage<00:02:59.620> quite<00:03:00.070> right<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.700> has<00:03:00.850> sort<00:03:01.210> of<00:03:01.360> an

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
garage quite right it has sort of an

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.880 
garage quite right it has sort of an
interesting<00:03:01.630> structure<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.560> original

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
interesting structure on the original

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.250 
interesting structure on the original
map<00:03:03.040> has<00:03:03.250> his<00:03:03.400> ulti<00:03:03.760> shape<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.540> I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
map has his ulti shape to it and I

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.570 
map has his ulti shape to it and I
played<00:03:05.560> around<00:03:05.710> with<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.950> quite<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.220> bit<00:03:06.340> to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
played around with that quite a bit to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.240 
played around with that quite a bit to
kind<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.790> figure<00:03:06.970> out<00:03:07.090> what<00:03:07.210> I<00:03:07.240> wanted<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:08.250> of

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
kind of figure out what I wanted and of

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.620 
kind of figure out what I wanted and of
course<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.670> real<00:03:09.790> map<00:03:09.970> there's<00:03:10.270> sort<00:03:10.510> of

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
course in the real map there's sort of

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.240 
course in the real map there's sort of
roads<00:03:10.990> going<00:03:11.350> through<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.650> map<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.160> these

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
roads going through the map and these

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.220 
roads going through the map and these
blocked<00:03:12.550> off<00:03:12.730> streets<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.390> fences<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.020> stuff

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
blocked off streets and fences and stuff

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.290 
blocked off streets and fences and stuff
try<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:14.890> replicate<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.610> little<00:03:15.910> bit<00:03:16.030> in

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
try to replicate that a little bit in

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.300 
try to replicate that a little bit in
this<00:03:16.630> map<00:03:16.900> there's<00:03:17.260> no<00:03:17.380> fences<00:03:17.890> but<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.190> can

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
this map there's no fences but you can

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.950 
this map there's no fences but you can
get<00:03:18.430> an<00:03:18.520> idea<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:18.880> where<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.270> could<00:03:19.480> drive<00:03:19.690> in

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
get an idea of where you could drive in

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.380 
get an idea of where you could drive in
and<00:03:20.080> out<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:20.500> place<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:21.340> made<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.150> sort

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
and out of this place I made that sort

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.150 
and out of this place I made that sort
of<00:03:22.420> passageway<00:03:23.020> through<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.320> cliff<00:03:23.590> wall<00:03:23.860> but

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
of passageway through the cliff wall but

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.620 
of passageway through the cliff wall but
it's<00:03:24.310> been<00:03:24.490> caved<00:03:24.760> in<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.240> can't<00:03:25.420> leave

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
it's been caved in so you can't leave

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.570 
it's been caved in so you can't leave
that's<00:03:26.560> better<00:03:26.770> than<00:03:26.980> just<00:03:27.160> walling<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.520> the

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
that's better than just walling in the

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.890 
that's better than just walling in the
map<00:03:27.730> completely<00:03:28.270> I<00:03:28.300> think<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.630> adds<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.840> little

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
map completely I think it adds a little

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.660 
map completely I think it adds a little
bit<00:03:29.080> more<00:03:29.320> immersion<00:03:29.890> when<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.400> see

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
bit more immersion when you can see

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.700 
bit more immersion when you can see
where<00:03:31.240> you<00:03:31.660> might<00:03:31.690> have<00:03:31.930> come<00:03:32.230> from<00:03:32.260> how<00:03:32.650> you

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
where you might have come from how you

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.470 
where you might have come from how you
ended<00:03:33.010> up<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.370> place<00:03:33.550> even<00:03:33.880> though<00:03:34.360> you

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
ended up in this place even though you

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.560 
ended up in this place even though you
can't<00:03:34.720> leave<00:03:34.930> just<00:03:35.290> yet<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:37.180> want<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.510> do

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
can't leave just yet but I want to do

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.670 
can't leave just yet but I want to do
something<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:38.050> little<00:03:38.080> bit<00:03:38.290> different<00:03:38.590> for

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
something a little bit different for

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.870 
something a little bit different for
this<00:03:38.800> longer<00:03:39.040> episode<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.370> wanted<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.760> address

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
this longer episode I wanted to address

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.400 
this longer episode I wanted to address
some<00:03:40.090> questions<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.690> said<00:03:40.960> I<00:03:41.170> would<00:03:41.380> be

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
some questions I said I would be

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.010 
some questions I said I would be
addressing<00:03:41.800> a<00:03:42.160> few<00:03:42.240> in<00:03:43.240> previous<00:03:43.600> episode<00:03:43.900> to

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
addressing a few in previous episode to

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.870 
addressing a few in previous episode to
try<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.230> incorporate<00:03:44.560> them<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.250> we<00:03:45.670> might<00:03:45.790> as

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
try to incorporate them so we might as

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.860 
try to incorporate them so we might as
well<00:03:46.060> do<00:03:46.300> that<00:03:46.510> right<00:03:47.320> now<00:03:48.180> first<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.330> all<00:03:49.450> the

well do that right now first of all the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.950 
well do that right now first of all the
first<00:03:50.140> question<00:03:50.590> comes<00:03:50.800> from<00:03:51.210> mr.<00:03:52.210> polka<00:03:52.630> file

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
first question comes from mr. polka file

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.810 
first question comes from mr. polka file
actually<00:03:53.320> I<00:03:53.680> don't<00:03:53.920> know<00:03:54.160> if<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.460> wanted<00:03:54.700> me

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820

asking in the comments but it is a

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.280 
asking in the comments but it is a
question<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:58.210> I'm<00:03:58.420> thrown<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.840> in<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.050> video

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
question so I'm thrown it in the video

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.320 
question so I'm thrown it in the video
you<00:03:59.650> were<00:04:00.100> asking<00:04:00.400> me<00:04:00.460> what<00:04:00.490> weapons<00:04:01.150> I'm

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
you were asking me what weapons I'm

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330 
you were asking me what weapons I'm
planning<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.690> use<00:04:01.900> on<00:04:02.020> this<00:04:02.140> map<00:04:02.350> well<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.190> has

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
planning to use on this map well it has

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.570 
planning to use on this map well it has
been<00:04:03.370> technically<00:04:04.090> finished<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.230> i<00:04:05.740> can<00:04:06.400> say

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
been technically finished so i can say

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.220 
been technically finished so i can say
exactly<00:04:06.820> what's<00:04:07.150> on<00:04:07.270> there<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.720> kind<00:04:08.020> of<00:04:08.140> went

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
exactly what's on there I kind of went

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.490 
exactly what's on there I kind of went
into<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.590> with<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.220> hivemind<00:04:09.820> mindset<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.960> have

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
into it with a hivemind mindset I have

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.840 
into it with a hivemind mindset I have
set<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:11.770> my<00:04:11.860> own<00:04:11.890> game<00:04:12.160> mode<00:04:12.340> that's<00:04:12.490> similar

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
set up my own game mode that's similar

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.280 
set up my own game mode that's similar
to<00:04:12.910> hide<00:04:13.120> mine<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:13.510> play<00:04:13.690> on<00:04:13.780> some<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.050> my<00:04:14.170> own

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
to hide mine to play on some of my own

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.800 
to hide mine to play on some of my own
maps<00:04:14.530> because<00:04:15.430> honestly<00:04:16.180> actually<00:04:16.540> do<00:04:16.600> kind

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
maps because honestly actually do kind

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.440 
maps because honestly actually do kind
of<00:04:16.840> like<00:04:16.960> hive<00:04:17.170> mind<00:04:17.470> and

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
of like hive mind and

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.510 
of like hive mind and

Halo<00:05:07.920> 3<00:05:08.040> I<00:05:08.340> believe<00:05:08.700> and<00:05:08.940> for<00:05:09.090> infection<00:05:09.420> maps

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600

Halo 3 I believe and for infection maps
this<00:05:09.750> is<00:05:09.870> really<00:05:10.080> really<00:05:10.350> cool<00:05:10.620> because<00:05:10.800> you

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
this is really really cool because you

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.890 
this is really really cool because you
could<00:05:11.040> place<00:05:11.250> weapons<00:05:11.670> at<00:05:11.790> limited<00:05:12.210> ammo<00:05:12.540> you

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
could place weapons at limited ammo you

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.450 
could place weapons at limited ammo you
would<00:05:13.050> basically<00:05:13.260> limit<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:13.980> amount<00:05:14.100> of<00:05:14.310> time

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
would basically limit the amount of time

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.520 
would basically limit the amount of time
a<00:05:14.490> player<00:05:14.820> has<00:05:15.030> to<00:05:15.270> use<00:05:15.450> something<00:05:15.720> so<00:05:16.410> you<00:05:16.500> can

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
a player has to use something so you can

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.200 
a player has to use something so you can
set<00:05:16.770> down<00:05:16.920> a<00:05:16.950> sniper<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.640> only<00:05:17.790> has<00:05:18.000> one

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
set down a sniper that only has one

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.870 
set down a sniper that only has one
magazine<00:05:18.450> left<00:05:19.050> so<00:05:19.920> I<00:05:20.100> utilize<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.490> feature

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
magazine left so I utilize that feature

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.660 
magazine left so I utilize that feature
quite<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.180> bit<00:05:21.360> on<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.720> weapon<00:05:21.840> placements<00:05:22.500> and

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
quite a bit on the weapon placements and

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.380 
quite a bit on the weapon placements and
try<00:05:23.670> to<00:05:23.730> make<00:05:23.850> sure<00:05:24.000> that<00:05:24.120> they<00:05:24.180> stayed

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
try to make sure that they stayed

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.420 
try to make sure that they stayed
balance<00:05:24.780> so<00:05:25.350> when<00:05:25.650> you<00:05:25.740> first<00:05:25.950> play<00:05:26.130> this<00:05:26.280> it

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
balance so when you first play this it

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.170 
balance so when you first play this it
might<00:05:26.550> seem<00:05:26.700> like<00:05:26.730> there's<00:05:27.000> a<00:05:27.030> lot<00:05:27.120> of

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
might seem like there's a lot of

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.850 
might seem like there's a lot of
shotguns<00:05:27.720> around<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.140> lot<00:05:28.290> of<00:05:28.380> pistols<00:05:28.740> but

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
shotguns around a lot of pistols but

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.530 
shotguns around a lot of pistols but
they<00:05:28.980> all<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.100> very<00:05:29.370> low<00:05:29.640> ammo<00:05:30.000> probably<00:05:30.420> only

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
they all a very low ammo probably only

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.940 
they all a very low ammo probably only
one<00:05:30.720> mag<00:05:30.960> so<00:05:31.260> you<00:05:31.350> have<00:05:31.440> to<00:05:31.530> move<00:05:31.800> around

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
one mag so you have to move around

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.650 
one mag so you have to move around
collecting<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.790> bunch<00:05:32.940> of<00:05:33.090> them<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.330> really<00:05:33.480> get

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
collecting a bunch of them to really get

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.510 
collecting a bunch of them to really get
any<00:05:33.840> meaningful<00:05:34.260> amount<00:05:34.740> of<00:05:34.950> ammo<00:05:35.100> out<00:05:35.370> of

any meaningful amount of ammo out of
them<00:05:35.670> or<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:36.360> can<00:05:36.450> just<00:05:36.510> wait<00:05:36.750> till<00:05:36.900> the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
what my opinion on the obvious lighting

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.480 
what my opinion on the obvious lighting
issues<00:05:47.160> are<00:05:47.400> in<00:05:48.180> MCC<00:05:48.840> forge<00:05:49.320> yeah<00:05:50.160> there's

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
issues are in MCC forge yeah there's

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.390 
issues are in MCC forge yeah there's
some<00:05:50.670> issues<00:05:50.940> with<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.120> lighting<00:05:51.570> right<00:05:51.900> now

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
some issues with the lighting right now

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.290 
some issues with the lighting right now
for<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.460> most<00:05:53.580> part<00:05:53.700> it<00:05:53.910> works<00:05:54.090> beautifully

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
for the most part it works beautifully

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.790 
for the most part it works beautifully
and<00:05:54.780> everything<00:05:55.050> looks<00:05:55.230> really<00:05:55.320> nice<00:05:55.560> but

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
and everything looks really nice but

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.770 
and everything looks really nice but
there's<00:05:55.980> a<00:05:56.070> few<00:05:56.250> key<00:05:56.400> objects<00:05:56.820> that<00:05:57.450> just

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
there's a few key objects that just

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.240 
there's a few key objects that just
don't<00:05:57.900> play<00:05:58.200> well<00:05:58.410> with<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:58.620> lighting<00:05:58.890> system

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
don't play well with the lighting system

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.190 
don't play well with the lighting system
specifically<00:05:59.970> foliage<00:06:00.540> that's<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:00.900> one<00:06:01.080> that

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
specifically foliage that's the one that

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.930 
specifically foliage that's the one that
I've<00:06:01.350> run<00:06:01.530> into<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.860> most<00:06:02.040> I<00:06:02.310> haven't<00:06:02.760> seen<00:06:02.910> a

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
I've run into the most I haven't seen a

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.490 
I've run into the most I haven't seen a
definitive<00:06:03.450> list<00:06:03.630> of<00:06:03.840> which<00:06:03.930> objects<00:06:04.380> have

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
definitive list of which objects have

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.290 
definitive list of which objects have
this<00:06:04.710> issue<00:06:04.890> but<00:06:05.340> in<00:06:05.520> my<00:06:05.640> own<00:06:05.670> experiences

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
this issue but in my own experiences

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.870 
this issue but in my own experiences
foliage<00:06:07.110> always<00:06:07.500> gives<00:06:07.680> me<00:06:07.740> trouble<00:06:08.040> now

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
foliage always gives me trouble now

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.670 
foliage always gives me trouble now
originally<00:06:09.480> on<00:06:09.660> this<00:06:09.840> map<00:06:10.020> I<00:06:10.200> wanted<00:06:10.470> to<00:06:10.560> use

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
originally on this map I wanted to use

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.470 
originally on this map I wanted to use
those<00:06:10.800> big<00:06:11.040> leafy<00:06:11.580> trees<00:06:11.850> the<00:06:12.000> deciduous

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
those big leafy trees the deciduous

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.720 
those big leafy trees the deciduous
trees<00:06:12.750> because<00:06:13.080> they<00:06:13.230> look<00:06:13.470> nice<00:06:13.730> but

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
trees because they look nice but

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.040 
trees because they look nice but
unfortunately<00:06:15.540> it<00:06:15.630> looks<00:06:15.690> like<00:06:15.870> they're

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
unfortunately it looks like they're

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.990 
unfortunately it looks like they're
constantly<00:06:16.500> in<00:06:16.800> shadow<00:06:16.830> even<00:06:17.580> if<00:06:17.670> they're<00:06:17.850> out

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
constantly in shadow even if they're out

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.120 
constantly in shadow even if they're out
in<00:06:18.030> the<00:06:18.330> middle<00:06:18.510> of<00:06:18.810> a<00:06:18.990> giant<00:06:19.440> open<00:06:19.800> field

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
in the middle of a giant open field

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.830 
in the middle of a giant open field
directly<00:06:20.700> in<00:06:20.880> sunlight<00:06:21.270> and<00:06:21.480> they'll<00:06:21.630> still

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
directly in sunlight and they'll still

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.900 
directly in sunlight and they'll still
be<00:06:21.870> dark<00:06:22.230> and<00:06:22.440> they<00:06:22.890> don't<00:06:23.040> cast<00:06:23.310> any<00:06:23.520> shadows

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
be dark and they don't cast any shadows

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.760 
be dark and they don't cast any shadows
themselves<00:06:24.510> now<00:06:24.960> that's<00:06:25.200> a<00:06:25.350> problem<00:06:25.560> that

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
themselves now that's a problem that

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.680 
themselves now that's a problem that
extends<00:06:26.160> to<00:06:26.310> all<00:06:26.520> of<00:06:26.730> the<00:06:26.820> foliage<00:06:27.180> none<00:06:27.660> of

extends to all of the foliage none of
the<00:06:27.930> foliage<00:06:28.260> in<00:06:28.410> the<00:06:28.500> game<00:06:28.680> will<00:06:28.860> cast<00:06:29.070> a

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
the foliage in the game will cast a

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.400 
the foliage in the game will cast a
shadow<00:06:29.540> for<00:06:30.540> the<00:06:30.630> most<00:06:30.780> part<00:06:30.930> of<00:06:31.140> it<00:06:31.230> sticking

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
shadow for the most part of it sticking

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.300 
shadow for the most part of it sticking
this<00:06:31.590> stuff<00:06:31.770> like

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
this stuff like

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.680 
this stuff like
trees<00:06:32.520> in<00:06:32.670> the<00:06:32.730> pine<00:06:32.970> trees<00:06:33.270> because<00:06:33.510> at<00:06:33.600> least

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
trees in the pine trees because at least

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.350 
trees in the pine trees because at least
they<00:06:33.840> look<00:06:33.990> bright<00:06:34.260> and<00:06:34.700> they<00:06:35.700> will<00:06:35.910> look<00:06:36.030> dark

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
they look bright and they will look dark

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.340 
they look bright and they will look dark
when<00:06:36.510> you<00:06:36.570> put<00:06:36.750> them<00:06:36.840> in<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:36.990> shadow<00:06:37.230> of

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
when you put them in the shadow of

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.960 
when you put them in the shadow of
something<00:06:37.860> but<00:06:37.980> again<00:06:38.280> they<00:06:38.430> don't<00:06:38.610> cash<00:06:38.760> out

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
something but again they don't cash out

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.510 
something but again they don't cash out
as<00:06:39.090> themselves<00:06:39.600> and<00:06:40.380> in<00:06:40.530> this<00:06:40.650> map<00:06:40.860> I<00:06:41.070> ended<00:06:41.430> up

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
as themselves and in this map I ended up

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.610 
as themselves and in this map I ended up
going<00:06:41.760> with<00:06:41.850> the<00:06:42.030> pine<00:06:42.480> trees<00:06:42.750> over<00:06:43.110> the<00:06:43.230> leafy

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
going with the pine trees over the leafy

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.430 
going with the pine trees over the leafy
trees<00:06:43.920> just<00:06:44.160> for<00:06:44.340> that<00:06:44.460> issue<00:06:44.610> alone<00:06:45.030> and<00:06:45.440> it

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
trees just for that issue alone and it

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.220 
trees just for that issue alone and it
still<00:06:46.860> seems<00:06:47.130> like<00:06:47.400> on<00:06:47.640> very<00:06:48.300> large<00:06:48.570> maps<00:06:48.960> I

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
still seems like on very large maps I

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
still seems like on very large maps I
haven't<00:06:49.440> confirmed<00:06:49.710> this<00:06:49.890> one<00:06:50.040> hundred

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
haven't confirmed this one hundred

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.980 
haven't confirmed this one hundred
percent<00:06:50.280> but<00:06:50.850> stuff<00:06:51.180> in<00:06:51.300> the<00:06:51.390> distance<00:06:51.810> gets

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
percent but stuff in the distance gets

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.830 
percent but stuff in the distance gets
kind<00:06:52.200> of<00:06:52.290> a<00:06:52.350> haze<00:06:52.590> around<00:06:52.860> it<00:06:53.480> this<00:06:54.480> happens

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
kind of a haze around it this happens

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.480 
kind of a haze around it this happens
specifically<00:06:55.470> in<00:06:55.590> theater<00:06:55.920> mode<00:06:56.130> a<00:06:56.190> lot

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
specifically in theater mode a lot

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.610 
specifically in theater mode a lot
you'll<00:06:57.360> get<00:06:57.510> this<00:06:57.690> kind<00:06:57.870> of<00:06:57.930> weird<00:06:58.050> little<00:06:58.350> box

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
you'll get this kind of weird little box

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.900 
you'll get this kind of weird little box
of<00:06:58.860> lights<00:06:59.070> right<00:06:59.340> in<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.520> middle<00:06:59.730> of<00:06:59.820> the

of lights right in the middle of the

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.100 
of lights right in the middle of the

screen and everything around the edges

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.080 
screen and everything around the edges
is<00:07:01.380> in<00:07:01.620> shadow<00:07:01.860> I<00:07:02.040> don't<00:07:02.430> know<00:07:02.550> what's<00:07:02.760> going

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090 
is in shadow I don't know what's going

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.360 
is in shadow I don't know what's going
on<00:07:03.210> with<00:07:03.390> that<00:07:03.420> we<00:07:04.410> had<00:07:04.560> lighting<00:07:04.920> issues<00:07:05.220> with

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
on with that we had lighting issues with

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.490 
on with that we had lighting issues with
theater<00:07:05.640> mode<00:07:05.820> in<00:07:06.090> Halo<00:07:06.390> 4<00:07:06.750> for<00:07:07.110> quite<00:07:07.260> a<00:07:07.290> bit

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
theater mode in Halo 4 for quite a bit

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.080 
theater mode in Halo 4 for quite a bit
before<00:07:07.710> they<00:07:07.950> patched<00:07:08.190> it<00:07:08.460> and<00:07:08.670> it<00:07:08.760> seems<00:07:08.940> like

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
before they patched it and it seems like

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.970 
before they patched it and it seems like
there's<00:07:09.240> lighting<00:07:09.420> issues<00:07:09.750> once<00:07:10.080> again<00:07:10.440> which

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
there's lighting issues once again which

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.850 
there's lighting issues once again which
is<00:07:11.100> a<00:07:11.130> little<00:07:11.340> bit<00:07:11.610> annoying<00:07:12.530> and<00:07:13.530> it's<00:07:13.650> kind

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
is a little bit annoying and it's kind

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.350 
is a little bit annoying and it's kind
of<00:07:13.920> the<00:07:14.010> opposite<00:07:14.400> problem<00:07:14.820> this<00:07:14.940> time<00:07:15.000> in

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
of the opposite problem this time in

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.050 
of the opposite problem this time in
Halo<00:07:15.510> 4<00:07:15.780> everything<00:07:16.110> was<00:07:16.230> just<00:07:16.410> really<00:07:16.710> bright

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
Halo 4 everything was just really bright

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.700 
Halo 4 everything was just really bright
there<00:07:18.060> was<00:07:18.180> like<00:07:18.300> no<00:07:18.420> shadows<00:07:18.780> at<00:07:18.870> all<00:07:18.990> and<00:07:19.200> now

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:19.710 
there was like no shadows at all and now

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.630 
there was like no shadows at all and now
in<00:07:19.890> theater<00:07:20.160> mode<00:07:20.280> it<00:07:20.400> looks<00:07:20.520> like

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
in theater mode it looks like

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.700 
in theater mode it looks like
everything's<00:07:21.150> in<00:07:21.330> shadow<00:07:21.600> so<00:07:22.050> I<00:07:22.290> don't<00:07:22.620> know

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
everything's in shadow so I don't know

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.680 
everything's in shadow so I don't know
what's<00:07:22.860> going<00:07:23.100> on<00:07:23.220> there<00:07:23.520> hopefully<00:07:24.330> it'll<00:07:24.570> be

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690 
what's going on there hopefully it'll be

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.410 
what's going on there hopefully it'll be
something<00:07:24.900> they<00:07:25.080> fix<00:07:25.350> soon<00:07:26.000> and<00:07:27.000> it's<00:07:27.180> just

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420 
something they fix soon and it's just

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.820 
something they fix soon and it's just
forced<00:07:27.750> me<00:07:27.870> to<00:07:27.990> take<00:07:28.350> some<00:07:28.530> different

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
forced me to take some different

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.650 
forced me to take some different
approaches<00:07:29.100> in<00:07:29.370> forging<00:07:29.700> maps<00:07:29.910> now<00:07:30.180> I<00:07:30.420> don't

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 
approaches in forging maps now I don't

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.930 
approaches in forging maps now I don't
use<00:07:30.900> leafy<00:07:31.230> trees<00:07:31.470> very<00:07:31.680> much<00:07:31.920> purely<00:07:32.700> because

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
use leafy trees very much purely because

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.690 
use leafy trees very much purely because
that<00:07:33.210> issue<00:07:33.390> and<00:07:33.750> I<00:07:34.740> just<00:07:35.160> kind<00:07:35.370> of<00:07:35.400> stick<00:07:35.550> to

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:35.700 
that issue and I just kind of stick to

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.460 
that issue and I just kind of stick to
pine<00:07:35.880> trees<00:07:36.120> pine<00:07:36.270> trees<00:07:36.660> and<00:07:36.870> palm<00:07:37.020> trees<00:07:37.050> or

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.470 
pine trees pine trees and palm trees or

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.780 
pine trees pine trees and palm trees or
all<00:07:37.590> you'll<00:07:37.740> pretty<00:07:37.950> much<00:07:38.040> see<00:07:38.340> on<00:07:38.460> my<00:07:38.580> maps

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:38.790 
all you'll pretty much see on my maps

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.300 
all you'll pretty much see on my maps
anymore<00:07:39.060> until<00:07:39.960> the<00:07:40.290> leafy<00:07:40.560> trees<00:07:40.740> have<00:07:40.920> fixed

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.310 
anymore until the leafy trees have fixed

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.090 
right now that has leafy trees there's a

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.520 
right now that has leafy trees there's a
preview<00:07:45.420> of<00:07:45.480> it<00:07:45.660> it's<00:07:45.840> called<00:07:45.930> watchers

prospect I may still have to go back and
tweak<00:07:48.630> that<00:07:48.870> one<00:07:49.110> and<00:07:49.290> change<00:07:49.470> the<00:07:49.590> plants<00:07:49.950> out

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.070

tweak that one and change the plants out
