00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.410 

tastes<00:01:08.940> slightly<00:01:09.180> different<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:11.240> almost<00:01:12.240> hit

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420

a little aftertaste to it the Felinos
goes<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> original<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.700> mean<00:01:17.700> I'll<00:01:17.790> finish

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
goes the original but I mean I'll finish

this<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> think<00:01:19.290> I'll<00:01:19.409> stick<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
this one but I think I'll stick with the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.460 
this one but I think I'll stick with the
original<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:26.690> can't<00:01:27.690> really<00:01:27.899> put<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.200> what's

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
original I can't really put on what's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.870 
original I can't really put on what's
different<00:01:28.830> about<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.190> it's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> little

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
different about it is it's a little

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.520 
different about it is it's a little
sugar<00:01:30.060> thing<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:33.750> usually<00:01:33.899> basically

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
sugar thing but it's usually basically

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.139 
sugar thing but it's usually basically
if<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.710> could<00:01:34.860> also<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.220> into<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> whole<00:01:35.850> logo
