00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
now we're basically gonna be going for

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.330 
now we're basically gonna be going for
the<00:03:49.780> first<00:03:50.020> blood<00:03:50.380> killcam<00:03:50.920> they're<00:03:51.100> gonna<00:03:51.220> be

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
the first blood killcam they're gonna be

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.560

on<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.460> bridge<00:03:51.610> we're<00:03:51.790> going<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.000> go<00:03:52.090> then

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
on the bridge we're going to go then

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.000 
on the bridge we're going to go then
I'll<00:03:52.690> probably<00:03:52.810> cut<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.230> so<00:03:53.350> they<00:03:53.500> can<00:03:53.680> go<00:03:53.830> and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
I'll probably cut it so they can go and

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.140 
I'll probably cut it so they can go and
so<00:03:54.130> on<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.340> so<00:03:54.430> forth<00:03:54.490> because<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.940> takes<00:03:55.060> a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
so on and so forth because it takes a
