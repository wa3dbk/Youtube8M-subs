00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:10.290
 there's no more weight, there's nothing left 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:14.309
 a little pollution then the fishermen a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:21.509
 little with little else when in the end there 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.319
 there is nothing left to do in the last 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.349
 four years has changed so much changed 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:30.409
 fishing or or that the fish is more difficult 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:35.190
 appropriate what a decline means 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:36.629
 wait for us before we brought home from 7 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.719
 of the 10 canoe boxes that the sony 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.550
 we bring home not even 45 years 45 years 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.870
 we have always seen it fall by missing it 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.500
 heavily in quotes calculating 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 that the boats are halved including 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.640
 porto garibaldi rain the boats are 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.460
 much less to think here there were more than 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.109
 100 boats remained forty 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.539
 quality comes less and quantities 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.120
 sell less on many price products 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.190
 remained firm in the ten years ago 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.340
 decreasing the amount obviously carano 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.710
 that collections and expenses increase 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.590
 taxes increase diesel costs 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.380
 of employee salaries, expenses 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.230
 he lives on material that we all are 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.510
 years maintenance on the boats that yes 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.270
 it was heated it heated the water votes 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.150
 we find there just little oxygen 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.000
 here in front of our house that then 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.910
 he was not running away from us here 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.620
 precisely because of the greater pollution e 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.980
 fishing effort sprouts from time 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.320
 of rebirth re-growing did not fail 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.060
 despite the three days despite the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.820
 fishing catch despite the boats are 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.680
 come without the fish comes to less 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.840
 and it is not that we fish more us 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.539
 problem is that 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.509
 above us there is 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.630
 something else than heating 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.579
 we do not know water pollution 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.549
 how to say that the fisherman for the day 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.390
 there is this is the work we have 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.190
 undertook 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.360
 let's get on with this 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.299
 my grandfather was a cancer fisherman 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.200
 the fisherman's father died at sea 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.030
 retired as a fisherman and have remained e 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.790
 Now even finished our expedition 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.310
 as the Italian children there was a 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.880
 bad mom full weight and ready 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.150
 use 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.489
 you do n't have to pull the plugs I think you don't 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.489
 we know where fish come from that we do 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.720
 go all the traceability stuff is 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.379
 instead they will buy who comes 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.500
 from abroad we don't know who has it 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.450
 fished pil did then fishermen yes 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.549
 complain of a situation that 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.910
 a few years has seen a decline for good over 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.859
 these three here especially the first two 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.069
 excessive at the fishing port itself 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.410
 perpetuated over time and according to 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.630
 compromise of systems with 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.090
 fund that also carries this damage 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.480
 quite important 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.120
 plus an excess of substances 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.810
 such as the nitrogen the phosphorus coming into 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.549
 primis from the bit that triggers a phenomenon 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.579
 which carries the authorization name of 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.769
 an excessive proliferation of algae between 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.510
 in general, the most compromised areas 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.630
 this point of view on those china 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.290
 delta of po and above all emiliano 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.290
