00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.570 
conditioner and then all the treatments
and<00:04:35.780> stuff<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:36.199> we<00:04:36.320> do<00:04:36.440> are<00:04:36.650> here<00:04:36.979> but<00:04:37.490> you

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
and stuff that we do are here but you

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.529 
and stuff that we do are here but you
know<00:04:37.699> the<00:04:37.789> curly<00:04:38.120> hair<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.360> actually

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
know the curly hair is actually

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.450 
know the curly hair is actually
naturally<00:04:40.840> less<00:04:41.840> strong<00:04:42.199> than<00:04:42.250> straight<00:04:43.250> here

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
naturally less strong than straight here

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.850 
naturally less strong than straight here
i<00:04:43.490> think<00:04:43.639> that's<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:44.060> lot<00:04:44.210> of<00:04:44.240> times<00:04:44.539> why<00:04:44.870> we

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
i think that's a lot of times why we

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.290 
i think that's a lot of times why we
tend<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.190> feel<00:04:46.370> like<00:04:46.490> our<00:04:46.639> hairs<00:04:46.820> not<00:04:47.000> growing

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
tend to feel like our hairs not growing

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.629 
tend to feel like our hairs not growing
but<00:04:47.659> it<00:04:47.750> really<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.110> really<00:04:48.139> is<00:04:48.500> growing<00:04:48.889> it

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
but it really it really is growing it

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.189 
but it really it really is growing it
just<00:04:49.789> takes<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.180> little<00:04:50.330> while<00:04:50.539> longer<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.960> see

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
just takes a little while longer to see

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.050 
just takes a little while longer to see
the<00:04:51.320> progress<00:04:51.560> because<00:04:52.039> it's<00:04:52.340> not<00:04:52.550> straight

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
the progress because it's not straight

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.420 
the progress because it's not straight
it's<00:04:53.860> curly<00:04:54.860> boiled<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:56.320> in<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.710> end<00:04:57.860> this<00:04:58.370> is

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
it's curly boiled so in the end this is

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.370 
it's curly boiled so in the end this is
my<00:04:58.669> first<00:04:58.909> time<00:04:59.030> using<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.449> products<00:04:59.960> i'll
