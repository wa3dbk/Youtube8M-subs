fire and I'll put that in here and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.900 
fire and I'll put that in here and
and<00:01:52.400> break<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.790> up<00:01:54.010> with<00:01:55.010> it<00:01:55.190> that's<00:01:55.550> enough

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
and break it up with it that's enough

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.260 
and break it up with it that's enough
right<00:01:56.060> there<00:01:56.120> for<00:01:56.510> this<00:01:56.720> much<00:01:57.020> amount<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.270> put

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
right there for this much amount and put

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.890 
right there for this much amount and put
it<00:01:59.390> together

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
it together

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.930 
it together
got<00:02:00.620> a<00:02:00.650> creek<00:02:00.920> water<00:02:01.160> in<00:02:01.310> there<00:02:01.430> from<00:02:01.850> the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
got a creek water in there from the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.720 
got a creek water in there from the
creek<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.420> wouldn't<00:02:02.810> drink<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.140> straight<00:02:03.730> you

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
creek I wouldn't drink it straight you

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.350 
creek I wouldn't drink it straight you
know<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:06.380> this<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.340> depend<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:07.760> a<00:02:07.820> nonminor<00:02:08.119> way

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
know so this is depend on a nonminor way

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.970 
know so this is depend on a nonminor way
but<00:02:08.630> like<00:02:09.530> camping<00:02:09.950> but<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:12.380> Indians<00:02:12.740> used<00:02:12.890> to

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
but like camping but the Indians used to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.330 
but like camping but the Indians used to
dig<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:14.210> with<00:02:14.330> clay<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:16.720> get<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.800> some<00:02:18.800> rocks<00:02:19.070> on

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
dig it with clay and get a some rocks on

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.580 
dig it with clay and get a some rocks on
the<00:02:19.460> side<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:21.610> they<00:02:22.610> would<00:02:23.260> heat<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.410> rocks

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the side and they would heat the rocks

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.290 
the side and they would heat the rocks
up<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.310> dollar<00:02:25.550> size<00:02:25.850> fits<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.720> size<00:02:27.280> and

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
up that dollar size fits in size and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.100 
up that dollar size fits in size and
then<00:02:29.300> there<00:02:29.540> would<00:02:31.480> dig<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.570> hole<00:02:32.690> put<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.930> play

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
then there would dig a hole put a play

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.170 
then there would dig a hole put a play
like<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.290> said<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:35.470> pit<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:37.550> my<00:02:37.820> stews<00:02:38.150> in

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
like I said and pit and my stews in

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.030 
like I said and pit and my stews in
there<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.780> dump<00:02:39.020> your<00:02:39.140> hot<00:02:39.350> rocks<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.800> the

there and you dump your hot rocks in the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.170 
there and you dump your hot rocks in the
water<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.600> then<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:43.400> know<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.880> then<00:02:44.030> it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
water and then you know that and then it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.150 
water and then you know that and then it
would<00:02:44.300> work<00:02:45.050> seven<00:02:45.320> days<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.560> water<00:02:45.740> was<00:02:45.860> pure

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
would work seven days the water was pure

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.620 
would work seven days the water was pure
they<00:02:46.370> didn't<00:02:46.520> have<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.730> add<00:02:46.820> no<00:02:47.030> charcoal<00:02:47.450> to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
they didn't have to add no charcoal to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.500 
they didn't have to add no charcoal to
filter<00:02:47.960> that<00:02:48.110> but<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:49.100> get<00:02:49.220> most<00:02:49.430> out<00:02:49.670> by<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
filter that but you get most out by the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.780 
filter that but you get most out by the
fire<00:02:50.750> will<00:02:50.960> boiling<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.350> with<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.280> don't<00:02:52.520> get

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
fire will boiling it with that don't get

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.930 
fire will boiling it with that don't get
the<00:02:53.180> charcoal<00:02:53.630> will<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:53.960> out<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.850> then<00:02:55.850> you

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the charcoal will get out and then you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.690 
the charcoal will get out and then you

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
course with charcoal but the reason

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.400 
course with charcoal but the reason
demonstrating<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.450> can<00:04:09.599> make<00:04:10.170> coffee

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
demonstrating this you can make coffee

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.610 
demonstrating this you can make coffee
this<00:04:10.680> way<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:12.209> purify<00:04:12.660> water<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.079> way<00:04:13.349> by

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
this way you purify water this way by

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.440 
this way you purify water this way by
that<00:04:13.829> fire<00:04:14.160> as<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.400> know<00:04:14.640> purifies<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.480> water

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
that fire as you know purifies the water

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.060 
that fire as you know purifies the water
and<00:04:18.450> therefore<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.930> charcoal<00:04:19.410> added<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.919> it

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and therefore the charcoal added to it

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.949 
and therefore the charcoal added to it
is<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.700> simple<00:04:21.090> way<00:04:21.209> there's<00:04:21.419> other<00:04:21.540> methods

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
is the simple way there's other methods

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.350 
is the simple way there's other methods
this<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.070> way<00:04:23.220> I've<00:04:23.400> been<00:04:23.430> using<00:04:23.820> just

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
this is the way I've been using just

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.070 
this is the way I've been using just
right<00:04:24.570> out<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.810> creek<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:29.669> hot<00:04:29.970> but<00:04:30.660> by

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
right out of the creek and hot but by

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.719 
right out of the creek and hot but by
the<00:04:31.260> creek<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.650> would<00:04:31.830> never<00:04:31.979> drink<00:04:32.250> it

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
the creek I would never drink it

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.330 
the creek I would never drink it
you're<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.720> worst<00:04:34.139> scenario<00:04:34.340> diarrhea

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
you're the worst scenario diarrhea

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.930 
you're the worst scenario diarrhea
stomach<00:04:35.760> aches<00:04:36.180> no<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.660> other<00:04:36.810> scenario<00:04:37.139> but

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
stomach aches no the other scenario but

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.389 
stomach aches no the other scenario but
pretty<00:04:38.940> much<00:04:38.970> it
