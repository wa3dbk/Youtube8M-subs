many baking recipes call for separating

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.599 
many baking recipes call for separating
the<00:00:02.280> egg<00:00:02.460> yolk<00:00:02.850> from<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.629> egg<00:00:03.720> white<00:00:04.609> so

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
the egg yolk from the egg white so

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.680 
the egg yolk from the egg white so
that's<00:00:05.700> what<00:00:05.940> we'll<00:00:06.060> show<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:06.240> how<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.540> do

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
that's what we'll show you how to do

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.400 
that's what we'll show you how to do
today<00:00:07.250> first<00:00:08.250> thing<00:00:08.400> you'll<00:00:08.519> need<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:09.410> some

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
today first thing you'll need is some

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.270 
today first thing you'll need is some
eggs<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.370> first<00:00:11.639> step<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.570> crack<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.049> egg

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
eggs the first step is to crack the egg

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.340 
eggs the first step is to crack the egg
now<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:14.429> most<00:00:14.580> people<00:00:15.000> will<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:16.080> they'll

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
now what most people will do is they'll

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.410 
now what most people will do is they'll
just<00:00:16.529> go<00:00:16.710> ahead<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.190> crack<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> egg<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
just go ahead and crack the egg on the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.390 
just go ahead and crack the egg on the
lip<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.779> whatever<00:00:18.960> bold<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:19.500> using<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
lip of whatever bold are using the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.890 
lip of whatever bold are using the
problem<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:20.970> method<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.539> drive

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
problem with this method is to drive

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.810 
problem with this method is to drive
shell<00:00:22.230> fragments<00:00:22.769> into<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.400> white<00:00:23.580> where

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
shell fragments into the white where

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.340 
shell fragments into the white where
they're<00:00:23.939> hard<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.269> get<00:00:24.420> out<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:25.230> also

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
they're hard to get out and can also

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.650 
they're hard to get out and can also
cause<00:00:25.680> too<00:00:25.980> much<00:00:26.160> damage<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.880> shell<00:00:27.150> if

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
cause too much damage to the shell if

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.269 
cause too much damage to the shell if
the<00:00:27.810> shell<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.140> damaged<00:00:28.470> too<00:00:28.619> much<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.070> just

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the shell is damaged too much it just

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.160 
the shell is damaged too much it just
leads<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.670> big<00:00:29.910> sticky<00:00:30.300> mess<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.869> can't

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
leads to a big sticky mess and you can't

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.680 
leads to a big sticky mess and you can't
separate<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> egg<00:00:31.920> properly<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:33.300> easiest

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
separate the egg properly the easiest

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.660 
separate the egg properly the easiest
and<00:00:33.960> safest<00:00:34.200> way<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> crack<00:00:34.950> an<00:00:35.130> egg<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and safest way to crack an egg is to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.780 
and safest way to crack an egg is to
always<00:00:36.030> crack<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.770> flat<00:00:37.770> surface<00:00:37.800> keep

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
always crack it on a flat surface keep

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.790 
always crack it on a flat surface keep
your<00:00:39.000> first<00:00:39.270> bowl<00:00:39.629> right<00:00:39.960> next<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.530> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
your first bowl right next to you so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.900 
your first bowl right next to you so
that<00:00:40.920> you'll<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.100> somewhere<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> put<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
that you'll have somewhere to put the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.619 
that you'll have somewhere to put the
egg<00:00:42.030> once<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.480> cracked<00:00:44.059> just<00:00:45.059> use<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> light

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
egg once it's cracked just use a light

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.459 
egg once it's cracked just use a light
tap<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.480> need<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> little<00:00:48.840> more<00:00:49.110> force

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
tap and if you need a little more force

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.670 
tap and if you need a little more force
just<00:00:49.890> increase<00:00:51.050> with<00:00:52.050> each<00:00:52.289> time<00:00:54.620> now<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
just increase with each time now the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.619 
just increase with each time now the
eggs<00:00:55.949> cracked<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.699> we're<00:00:56.850> ready<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> transfer

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
eggs cracked and we're ready to transfer

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.439 
eggs cracked and we're ready to transfer
to<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> bowl<00:00:58.190> as<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.850> I've<00:01:00.239> got<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to the bowl as you can see I've got a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
to the bowl as you can see I've got a
nice<00:01:00.690> crack<00:01:01.170> running<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:01.680> through<00:01:01.920> here

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
nice crack running down through here

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
nice crack running down through here
very<00:01:02.820> few<00:01:03.120> shell<00:01:03.390> fragments<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.140> all<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.379> want

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
very few shell fragments so all you want

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.580 
very few shell fragments so all you want
to<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.640> hold<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.600> whatever<00:01:06.990> side

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to do is hold it with whatever side

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.330 
to do is hold it with whatever side
seems<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.549> more<00:01:09.240> room<00:01:09.630> facing<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.650> in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
seems to have more room facing up in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.789 
seems to have more room facing up in
this<00:01:11.460> case<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.570> way<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.619> you

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
this case I think it's this way and you

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.330 
this case I think it's this way and you
just<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> pull<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> open<00:01:15.210> very<00:01:15.240> gently

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
just want to pull it open very gently

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.719 
just want to pull it open very gently
and<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> yoke<00:01:18.450> should<00:01:18.689> flow<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.259> bottom

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.380 

and<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.210> let<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> white<00:01:24.780> trip<00:01:25.200> out

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.980 

to<00:01:29.390> pull<00:01:29.719> back<00:01:30.999> see<00:01:31.999> that<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.240> yoke<00:01:32.450> stays<00:01:32.810> in

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
to pull back see that the yoke stays in

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.179 
to pull back see that the yoke stays in
place

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.639 

and<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.280> white<00:01:37.429> falls<00:01:37.700> away<00:01:38.079> to<00:01:39.079> separate<00:01:39.560> it

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
and the white falls away to separate it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:40.929 
and the white falls away to separate it
completely<00:01:40.249> because<00:01:40.490> there's<00:01:40.670> still<00:01:40.909> a

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
completely because there's still a

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.819 
completely because there's still a
little<00:01:41.119> bit<00:01:41.359> of<00:01:41.450> white<00:01:41.630> left<00:01:41.899> simply<00:01:42.289> pass<00:01:42.590> the

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
little bit of white left simply pass the

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.950 
little bit of white left simply pass the
yoke<00:01:43.009> back<00:01:43.340> into<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.939> other<00:01:44.090> portion<00:01:44.689> of<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
yoke back into the other portion of the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.620 
yoke back into the other portion of the
egg<00:01:45.579> gently<00:01:47.079> let<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.109> remainder<00:01:48.679> drip<00:01:49.399> out

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
egg gently let the remainder drip out

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.149 
egg gently let the remainder drip out
you<00:01:50.630> can<00:01:50.780> pass<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.200> back<00:01:51.319> and<00:01:51.530> forth<00:01:51.740> as<00:01:51.859> many

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
you can pass it back and forth as many

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.120 
you can pass it back and forth as many
times<00:01:52.490> as<00:01:52.670> necessary<00:01:52.939> or<00:01:53.829> to<00:01:54.829> free<00:01:55.219> up<00:01:55.369> any<00:01:56.209> of

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
times as necessary or to free up any of

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:05.260 
times as necessary or to free up any of
the<00:01:58.130> remaining<00:01:58.719> white<00:02:03.280> now<00:02:04.280> simply<00:02:04.759> repeat

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the remaining white now simply repeat

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:15.410 
the remaining white now simply repeat
the<00:02:05.450> process<00:02:05.689> for<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.740> rest<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.069> your<00:02:07.189> batch

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.740 

now<00:02:16.420> we<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.719> our<00:02:16.870> egg<00:02:17.079> whites<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:19.060> our<00:02:19.510> yolks

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
now we have our egg whites and our yolks

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.140 
now we have our egg whites and our yolks
nicely<00:02:20.230> separated<00:02:20.439> and<00:02:20.950> ready<00:02:21.099> to<00:02:21.189> go<00:02:21.430> that's
