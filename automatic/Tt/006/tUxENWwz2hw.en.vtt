00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.650
 and 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.119
 hello finally we waited 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:30.420
 the second part of this project is crazy 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:32.930
 delusional use but we commit 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.129
 I've ever had a project 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:43.470
 here I started assembling the rear axle 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 I collected it and it came out as a surprise 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.460
 such that I had 4 transfers back 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.070
 she forward that is torque 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.219
 the engine is not a bridge I did not match 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.280
 I will turn on the moment and so I had to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:06.780
 and almost the whole brain was transmitted 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 almost all the work here is the bridge I have it 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.280
 for a long time I was very tormented to take it apart 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.030
 get the half shafts because the bearings 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.660
 Because of Karelia, I am very strong 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.479
 here it is small. 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.520
 because of the ear barely unpacked them 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.319
 bridges hum here I got the differential to me 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.380
 he had to be turned 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.300
 but before I flipped, I noticed 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.950
 that this here 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:43.369
 gear gear she starts to hurt 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.369
 filling window 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:51.050
 plate namaste back end 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.950
 in order to prevent this from happening 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.380
 I will have to cut this part all 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.890
 Pasha 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.300
 cut and and 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.300
 and shut down programmatically
