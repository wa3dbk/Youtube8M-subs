think four different kinds of enemies

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.159 
think four different kinds of enemies
now<00:04:16.570> that<00:04:16.870> giant<00:04:17.500> guy<00:04:17.769> right<00:04:18.280> there<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.989> have

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
now that giant guy right there you have

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.770 
now that giant guy right there you have
one<00:04:20.470> with<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.739> gun<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.640> shoots<00:04:21.910> at<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.240> you

have<00:04:22.960> these<00:04:23.260> various<00:04:23.710> different<00:04:24.840> knife

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
have these various different knife

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.550 
have these various different knife
wielding<00:04:26.470> enemies<00:04:27.310> for<00:04:28.270> only<00:04:28.539> they<00:04:29.260> only<00:04:29.380> do

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
wielding enemies for only they only do

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.340 
wielding enemies for only they only do
damage<00:04:29.919> when<00:04:30.130> there

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
damage when there

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.220 
damage when there
close<00:04:30.470> up<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.850> have<00:04:32.030> little<00:04:32.360> dogs<00:04:32.900> that

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
close up and you have little dogs that

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:42.340 
close up and you have little dogs that
run<00:04:33.410> around<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.890> attack<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:41.230> once<00:04:42.230> you

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
run around and attack you so once you

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.960 
run around and attack you so once you
start<00:04:42.590> really<00:04:42.770> getting<00:04:42.860> into<00:04:43.220> this<00:04:43.370> game<00:04:43.730> I

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
start really getting into this game I

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.520 
start really getting into this game I
think<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.720> can<00:04:44.900> become<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.260> little<00:04:45.500> bit

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
think that it can become a little bit

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.170 
think that it can become a little bit
monotonous<00:04:46.840> it's<00:04:47.840> very<00:04:47.960> repetitive<00:04:49.180> there

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
monotonous it's very repetitive there

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.360 
monotonous it's very repetitive there
aren't<00:04:50.480> very<00:04:50.540> many<00:04:50.980> actually<00:04:51.980> there's<00:04:52.190> no

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
aren't very many actually there's no

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.310 
aren't very many actually there's no
variety<00:04:52.790> of<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.240> game<00:04:53.420> getting<00:04:53.900> past<00:04:54.170> the

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
variety of the game getting past the

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.560 
variety of the game getting past the
fact<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:55.460> have<00:04:55.730> four<00:04:56.060> different<00:04:56.210> kinds

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
fact that you have four different kinds

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.220 
fact that you have four different kinds
of<00:04:56.930> levels<00:04:57.820> but<00:04:58.820> other<00:04:59.270> than<00:04:59.480> that<00:04:59.540> there's<00:05:00.050> no

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
of levels but other than that there's no

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.590 
of levels but other than that there's no
variety<00:05:01.330> so<00:05:03.100> it<00:05:04.100> can<00:05:04.370> become<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:05.060> little<00:05:05.210> bit

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
variety so it can become a little bit

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.800 
variety so it can become a little bit
repetitive<00:05:06.880> but<00:05:07.880> that's<00:05:08.240> probably<00:05:08.480> the<00:05:08.780> only
