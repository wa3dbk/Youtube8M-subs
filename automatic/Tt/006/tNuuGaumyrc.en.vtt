00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:15.710
 to a Mexican cuisine this time we're going to 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.630
 to make refried beans here we are going to do 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.330
 little time to make some frijolitos from the 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.029
 I'm going to show you the pot 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.250
 delicious these are beans like 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.279
 two people 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.980
 we made a quarter of a kilo of beans 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.899
 Now, what are we going to do to 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:39.679
 We need half an onion 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:45.379
 chopped a more or less large 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:47.089
 press here half chile serrano minced and 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.089
 we will need to to achieve 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.999
 our beans I have here enough 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.550
 oil nothing more to be able to fry my 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.350
 beans and first what we are going to do 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.829
 is let's put 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.050
 the garlic and what we want is that this garlic 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.700
 take out all its flavor 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.200
 inside the oil and I use canola oil 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.270
 because it is an oil that only 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.270
 burning at very high temperatures 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.080
 onion we will last until 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.000

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.250

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.930

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.990
