00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.320
 ice 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.829
 for those who do not know the choice of fire and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 ice gave rise to hbo tv series 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.730
 game of thrones which is very well known 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.399
 still being champion of audience 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.420
 winning several awards and I never 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.489
 I followed the series 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.620
 I never saw any books so I 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.660
 I have this collection here is going to be great 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.219
 that I'll try, right? 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.989
 the story for the first time after the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.809
 follow the series together to see how 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.480
 was adapted for the cinematography that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.620
 they have this box in case I paid 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.199
 $ 115 show what's in it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.869
 we have the author's name in george 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.840
 martin the master of worlds including 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.650
 men 1 2 3 4 and 5 of the fire fence and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.799
 ice 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.630
 I'm there and here it's good here we have 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.130
 a normal box a box 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.950
 basically I think of cardboard a thing 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.970
 so it also a grid in one of the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.350
 sides 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.259
 We'll have to use the synopsis of each one. 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 of books that the war of thrones fury 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.240
 Kings storm stops 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.000
 The room is sad, this is the feast of the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.720
 forums and then dance of dragons 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.259
 It has a small bar all but to help 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.420
 Boss, we're going to use my knife. 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.909
 Tramontina ambó itself has to be for the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.140
 crowd and our books because a lot of 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.909
 people who want to buy this type of 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.470
 collection that is called collection pokers 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.329
 because they are smaller books 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.340
 adaptations to save money 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.049
 material to make matter to stay 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.909
 more practical to carry is afraid that 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.350
 the letters are too small 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.360
 books are very fragile than the leaves. 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.280
 If only there, then we'll see it there. 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.869
 verify whether it actually proceeds or 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.650
 of course not 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.540
 around here if you 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.340
 the child still does not use objects 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.920
 like this is the knife to cut 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.420
 here's some meat to take a piece of 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.730
 your two-ring 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.349
 I found it super beautiful to keep for 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.939
 collectors, right? 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.959
 I got it because I was more into account 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.120
 this edition of what buys the books 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.829
 was much more in 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.709
 each book they would like thirty 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.840
 forty reais and once 115 by the five 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.560
 books then a really cool economy 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.290
 for me 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.790
 I bought there on the cold spot through their website. 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.700
 even if the best price 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.980
 know a little more expensive here people 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.109
 will have all the books then leave 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:54.010
 change the angle here for you 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:55.690
 put closer here illustration that the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.470
 author chose not to 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.299
 then call 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.489
 Let's see how I get out of here. 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:08.349
 I'm going to have to take it out like it's a 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:11.980
 lasagna even we here is very soldier 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.659
 car is heavy get the first one here 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.579
 so that the others already leave much more 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.099
 easy 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.750
 so here the first book ready, right? 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.220
 george march arrival of the troops to 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.220
 collection was the ice book 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.409
 we have our time and little bit of it 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.239
 Taiwan 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.579
 Let me give you some bastard advice. 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.409
 never forget who it is because it is 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.799
 certain that the world does not remember 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:43.209
 make it your strength so you can not 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:45.699
 never be your weakness with this 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.970
 and it can never be used 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:50.530
 for the marola then the finish of the 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.109
 book is very nice 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.440
 the cover also lasts it does not come loose 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.209
 easy to at least see first and I go 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.459
 show some of the lyrics to you already 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.650
 begins in the prologue here they are not 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.000
 small in size good to read then 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.209
 You do not think you do lyrics. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.109
 small size of this size is very 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.370
 Nice book has pocket edition xvii 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:17.919
 It does not have pages markup is even 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.680
 I have about a thousand pages only 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.810
 book one and this one is a lot better than 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.270
 other right 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.669
 So let me put it here to our 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:32.220
 new angle then 2 historical book 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:36.870
 of ice and fire is what I say I see that 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.850
 the fury of kings is more resounding 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.680
 Each one with the color is an illustration of 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.850
 different texture 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.690
 The Storm Sword Book 4 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.040
 the festin of bodies the book 5 that the 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.260
 huge right 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.510
 the dragons dance then basically 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.210
 those that you should have about 5 thousand 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.710
 pages clear the pocket version then the 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.820
 People have to tell that they are less vague. 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.180
 than normal size but it is 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.380
 a good read and you should have what 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.570
 button gives an idea of ​​how long it takes when 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.470

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.120
 direct take at least a month a month 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.370
 and half a month and a half basically for
