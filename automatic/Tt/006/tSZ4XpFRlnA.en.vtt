I'll<00:00:05.730> show<00:00:05.759> you<00:00:06.029> how<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.330> create<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.779> target

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
I'll show you how to create a target

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.770 
I'll show you how to create a target
effector<00:00:07.589> which<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:07.950> really<00:00:08.220> cool<00:00:08.510> cinema<00:00:09.510> 4d

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
effector which is really cool cinema 4d

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.100 
effector which is really cool cinema 4d
so<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:11.190> can<00:00:11.370> animate<00:00:11.940> thousands<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.840> clones

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
so you can animate thousands of clones

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.110 
so you can animate thousands of clones
object<00:00:13.710> following<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.370> target

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
object following and target

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.929 
object following and target
let's<00:00:16.049> move<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:18.529> it's<00:00:19.529> very<00:00:19.560> simple<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.460> I

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
let's move this it's very simple and I

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.900 
let's move this it's very simple and I
think<00:00:21.720> it's<00:00:22.050> very<00:00:22.109> cool<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> by<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.519> way<00:00:23.699> this

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
think it's very cool and by the way this

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.240 
think it's very cool and by the way this
is<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> space<00:00:24.390> octopus<00:00:24.810> character<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.619> have

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
is a space octopus character that I have

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.050 
is a space octopus character that I have
tutorial<00:00:26.730> about<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.330> YouTube<00:00:29.029> create<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
tutorial about it in YouTube create a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.500 
tutorial about it in YouTube create a
new<00:00:30.269> file<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.949> create<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> cube<00:00:32.360> change<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
new file here create a cube change the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.000 
new file here create a cube change the
size<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.110> 5

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
size to 5

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
size to 5
um<00:00:35.960> 2<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.290> 5<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.520> then<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.360> want<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> clone<00:00:39.840> my

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
um 2 and 5 and then I want to clone my

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.840 
um 2 and 5 and then I want to clone my
object<00:00:40.500> go<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> my<00:00:40.980> graph<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.489> select<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
object go to my graph and select the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.360 
object go to my graph and select the
clone<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.210> object<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:43.010> drag<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> cube

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
clone or object here drag the cube

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.760 
clone or object here drag the cube
inside<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> clone<00:00:45.149> or<00:00:45.270> object<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.469> have

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
inside the clone or object now you have

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.180 
inside the clone or object now you have
3<00:00:47.100> cubes<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:48.050> go<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> corner<00:00:49.620> object

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
3 cubes in here go to the corner object

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.389 
3 cubes in here go to the corner object
and<00:00:50.430> under<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> object<00:00:51.870> tab<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.469> box

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
and under the object tab there is a box

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.450 
and under the object tab there is a box
called<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.059> mode<00:00:54.329> change<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.590> grid<00:00:56.129> array

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
called like mode change it to grid array

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.000 
called like mode change it to grid array
and<00:00:57.199> change<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> counts<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.980> 25<00:00:59.960> 1<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:02.120> 25<00:01:04.010> ok

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and change the counts to 25 1 and 25 ok

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.060 
and change the counts to 25 1 and 25 ok
now<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.640> about<00:01:05.820> 225<00:01:06.780> objects<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.770> here

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
now we have about 225 objects in here

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.590 
now we have about 225 objects in here
and<00:01:08.750> I'm<00:01:09.750> gonna<00:01:09.930> change<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.530> color<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
and I'm gonna change the color here so

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.630 
and I'm gonna change the color here so
we<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.799> corner<00:01:14.100> object<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.610> little

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
we can see this corner object a little

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.380 
we can see this corner object a little
bit<00:01:14.909> better<00:01:16.009> of<00:01:17.009> course<00:01:17.070> green<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.060> design

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
bit better of course green and design

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.899 
bit better of course green and design
this<00:01:18.600> material<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> corner<00:01:19.710> object<00:01:22.909> ok

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
this material to the corner object ok

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.219 
this material to the corner object ok
now<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.960> next<00:01:25.110> step<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.740> um<00:01:26.990> creating<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
now the next step is um creating a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.679 
now the next step is um creating a
target<00:01:28.619> effector<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.880> sure<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> color

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
target effector make sure that the color

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.249 
target effector make sure that the color
object<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.939> select<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
object is on select it and then go to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.230 
object is on select it and then go to
more<00:01:34.560> graph<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.159> create<00:01:36.290> target<00:01:37.290> effector

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
more graph and create target effector

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240 
more graph and create target effector
see<00:01:39.240> immediately<00:01:39.930> everything<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.650> following

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
see immediately everything is following

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.210 
see immediately everything is following
these<00:01:42.060> arrows<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.740> move<00:01:43.979> these

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
these arrows in here and if I move these

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.620 
these arrows in here and if I move these
arrows<00:01:44.640> everything<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.810> reacting<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:47.630> ok

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
arrows everything is reacting to that ok

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.370 
arrows everything is reacting to that ok
now<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.590> next<00:01:49.890> step<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.939> create<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> sphere

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
now the next step is to create a sphere

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.560 
now the next step is to create a sphere
and<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.909> my<00:01:54.060> new<00:01:54.270> target

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and that's going to be you my new target

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.069 
and that's going to be you my new target
object<00:01:55.460> create<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> sphere<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.810> pretty

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
object create a sphere and it's pretty

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.520 
object create a sphere and it's pretty
big<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:59.130> change<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> radius<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.930> 10

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
big and I change the radius to like 10

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
big and I change the radius to like 10
and<00:02:02.570> then<00:02:03.570> go<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> target<00:02:04.950> effector<00:02:05.520> under

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and then go to the target effector under

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.119 
and then go to the target effector under
the<00:02:06.509> effector<00:02:06.899> tab<00:02:07.200> there<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.799> something

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the effector tab there is something

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.550 
the effector tab there is something
called<00:02:08.310> target<00:02:08.729> object<00:02:09.270> drag<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> sphere

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
called target object drag the sphere

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.250 
called target object drag the sphere
inside<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> target<00:02:11.700> object<00:02:11.910> field

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
inside the target object field

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.350 
inside the target object field
now<00:02:13.739> all<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.040> these<00:02:14.280> clones<00:02:14.610> gotta<00:02:15.090> follow

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
now all of these clones gotta follow

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.770 
now all of these clones gotta follow
this<00:02:16.290> object<00:02:17.659> click<00:02:18.659> on<00:02:18.780> spear<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.470> move<00:02:19.709> it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.250 

and<00:02:25.280> one<00:02:26.280> more<00:02:26.489> step<00:02:26.730> going<00:02:27.659> to<00:02:27.959> target

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and one more step going to target

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.710 
and one more step going to target
effector<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:29.040> under<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.060> effector<00:02:30.450> tab

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
effector and under the effector tab

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.770 
effector and under the effector tab
check<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.620> repel<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:34.049> now<00:02:34.590> move<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.010> sphere
