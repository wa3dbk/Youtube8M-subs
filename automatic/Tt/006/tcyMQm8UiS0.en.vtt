00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 the peugeot 206 to get you out explained a 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.990
 problem that was having this 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.950
 people here him after what 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.759
 happened 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.090
 The engine got hot and did not turn off. 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.199
 then the following stopped 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.269
 some place to be able to stop on the spot 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.920
 a market for example you what I 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.930
 I used to walk a lot when I left 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.410
 stopped not wanting to pick up or not 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.649
 take more of the hot engine only with the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.510
 cold engine there I changed the coil to 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.930
 a reserve coil did not solve the problem. 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.700
 I did not even start looking for the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.020
 problem turning off the legal sensors 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.030
 sensormatic 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 the air sensor and looked at the cell was 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.079
 Correct everything right and I was the one 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.160
 rotation sensor which is here side 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.230
 the filter below I took the club 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.390
 put record again nothing ever 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.420
 It will work hot there I told you I'll do it 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.949
 a test problem when it 's hot 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.220
 and a bottle of cold water I threw 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.810
 plenty of ice water on top of the sensor 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.619
 hit from the car ran on 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.890
 hour 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.630
 I bought another sensor here, there's the old one. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.890
 and if from here siemens 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.640
 I bought a sensor I put in place. 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.530
 I paid around 70 reais and put 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.290
 in the place resolved the problem does not have 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.939
 more problem does not happen but the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.150
 his problem is hot not wanting 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.680
 call solved something else that I did 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.700
 here is also changing the nozzle game 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.130
 injector will stay here รณ compensates more 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 change what to do cleaning the game of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.040
 power is very cheap I paid on the market 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.170
 free with the freight 160 reais in a workshop 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.119
 mechanics charged me 40 reais to 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.219
 clean each nozzle 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:03.259
 so it 's better to change the game that goes 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:06.719
 here an ancient game of death of the ancient 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.659
 could have cleaned more between new and 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:13.810
 clean better new part 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:15.400
 there was no easy place to take the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.469
 install the nozzle set and will come back 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.170
 here with the 10 key the coil will come back 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:24.930
 for me it's tight here it's going to pull and it's 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:30.129
 shoot and shoot the two for rifle ak 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.959
 drop the Mangueirinha back here to 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.480
 fuel enters 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.569
 there behind the flute in that direction in the middle 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.189
 of an electric whip claimed to 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.859
 to detach the electric lash 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.329
 this bolt here holds you short and 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.340
 then carefully 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.730
 Just pull her up and put her on. 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.780
 in fiction pressure trapped in pressure by 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.700
 These rubber bands that for these 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.639
 that goes in there in the snug 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.209
 so it 's good to spend a little bit of 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:06.599
 vaseline that when assembling the defense 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.599
 folks
