come<00:04:08.880> together<00:04:09.060> but<00:04:09.570> they<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.810> have<00:04:09.930> very

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
come together but they you have very

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.180 
come together but they you have very
different<00:04:10.320> characteristics<00:04:10.680> in<00:04:11.040> every

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
different characteristics in every

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.500 
different characteristics in every
episode<00:04:11.280> obviously<00:04:11.940> otherwise<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.360> wouldn't

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
episode obviously otherwise it wouldn't

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.509 
episode obviously otherwise it wouldn't
be<00:04:12.570> interesting<00:04:12.780> but<00:04:13.560> there<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.370> an

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
be interesting but there is an

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.020 
be interesting but there is an
underlying<00:04:15.680> cohesion<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.830> that<00:04:17.340> cohesion<00:04:17.729> is

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
underlying cohesion and that cohesion is

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.360 
underlying cohesion and that cohesion is
very<00:04:18.510> very<00:04:18.870> well<00:04:19.080> noticed<00:04:19.410> by<00:04:19.500> people<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:20.040> if

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
very very well noticed by people so if

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.949 
very very well noticed by people so if
you<00:04:20.549> do<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.729> cohesion<00:04:21.180> in<00:04:21.270> your<00:04:21.390> wardrobe<00:04:21.780> even

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
you do a cohesion in your wardrobe even

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.450 
you do a cohesion in your wardrobe even
if<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.349> step<00:04:22.530> out<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.770> box<00:04:22.890> occasionally

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
if you step out of the box occasionally

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.070 
if you step out of the box occasionally
with<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.610> few<00:04:23.760> pieces<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.479> cohesion<00:04:24.840> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
with a few pieces the cohesion the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.960 
with a few pieces the cohesion the
underlying<00:04:25.440> cohesion<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:26.039> definitely

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
underlying cohesion is definitely

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.550 
underlying cohesion is definitely
noticed<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.450> maybe<00:04:27.870> people<00:04:28.110> don't<00:04:28.320> mention

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
noticed and maybe people don't mention

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.950 
noticed and maybe people don't mention
it<00:04:28.800> but<00:04:28.950> they<00:04:29.099> notice<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.030> trust<00:04:30.330> me<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.690> it's

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960
