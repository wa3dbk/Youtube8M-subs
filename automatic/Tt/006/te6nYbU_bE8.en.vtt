00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.950 
they're all really great especially the
ODST<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.180> haven't<00:01:03.300> had<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> ODST

armor yet and i've got to say i love it
the<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:08.460> downside<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.689> ODST<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the only downside to the ODST and the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
the only downside to the ODST and the
air<00:01:11.100> assault<00:01:11.400> helmets<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.299> fact<00:01:12.510> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
air assault helmets is the fact that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.179 
air assault helmets is the fact that
they<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.560> small<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.040> look

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
they are a little bit small they look

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.890 
they are a little bit small they look
more<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.400> they'd<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.880> scale<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.420> maybe

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
more like they'd be in scale for maybe

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.190 
more like they'd be in scale for maybe
the<00:01:16.049> female<00:01:16.380> Spartans<00:01:17.600> I'm<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.750> exactly<00:01:18.990> sure

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the female Spartans I'm not exactly sure

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.609 
the female Spartans I'm not exactly sure
why<00:01:19.890> they're<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.580> small<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.170> definitely

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
why they're so small but they definitely

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.990 
why they're so small but they definitely
do<00:01:22.979> feel<00:01:23.009> small<00:01:23.460> especially<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.909> got

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
do feel small especially when you got

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.070 
do feel small especially when you got
the<00:01:24.240> head<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.080> figure<00:01:25.350> itself<00:01:26.659> but<00:01:27.659> anyway

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the head on the figure itself but anyway

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.719 
the head on the figure itself but anyway
overall<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.710> would<00:01:28.860> still<00:01:29.130> give<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> 5<00:01:29.700> out

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
overall I would still give this a 5 out

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.190 
overall I would still give this a 5 out
of<00:01:29.880> 5<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.210> would<00:01:30.329> still<00:01:30.540> pick<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.020> you

just<00:01:35.670> pass<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.509> red<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.020> your

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
just pass on this if red is not your

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.990 
just pass on this if red is not your
thing<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.770> there's<00:01:37.920> not<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.549> there's<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.880> at

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
thing if there's not if there's not at

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
thing if there's not if there's not at
least<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.509> set<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.960> armor<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.799> you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
least one set of armor in here that you

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.109 
least one set of armor in here that you
could<00:01:41.040> piece<00:01:41.189> together<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> really

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
could piece together that you really

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.050 
could piece together that you really
want<00:01:42.420> I'd<00:01:43.049> probably<00:01:43.320> recommend<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.640> passing

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
want I'd probably recommend just passing

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.030 
want I'd probably recommend just passing
on<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.360> although<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.869> got<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> say<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.590> ODST

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
on it although I got to say the ODST

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.550 
on it although I got to say the ODST
chest<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.790> shoulders<00:01:48.329> are<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.659> beast<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
chest and shoulders are just beast I

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.139 
chest and shoulders are just beast I
love<00:01:50.399> them<00:01:50.579> they're<00:01:50.790> awesome

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
love them they're awesome

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.200 
love them they're awesome
so<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> first<00:01:53.399> opportunity<00:01:53.880> you've

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
so this is the first opportunity you've

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.370 
so this is the first opportunity you've
had<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.509> able<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.689> purchase<00:01:54.990> these<00:01:55.110> armor

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
had to be able to purchase these armor

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.789 
had to be able to purchase these armor
sets<00:01:56.750> that's<00:01:57.750> pretty<00:01:57.960> much<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> detail<00:01:58.770> on

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
sets that's pretty much it the detail on

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
sets that's pretty much it the detail on
these<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.369> course<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.790> still<00:01:59.969> McFarland

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
these of course is still McFarland

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.060 
these of course is still McFarland
standards<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.200> great<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> paint<00:02:01.829> jobs

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
standards so it's great the paint jobs

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.030 
standards so it's great the paint jobs
are<00:02:02.219> great<00:02:03.020> I'd<00:02:04.020> say<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> shade<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.799> red

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
are great I'd say that the shade of red

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.859 
are great I'd say that the shade of red
appears<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.909> very<00:02:06.570> close<00:02:07.429> to<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.819> EBA<00:02:09.479> here

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
appears to be very close to the EBA here

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
appears to be very close to the EBA here
and<00:02:10.050> previous<00:02:11.039> red<00:02:11.250> Spartans<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.700> don't<00:02:11.849> have

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
and previous red Spartans I don't have

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.360 
and previous red Spartans I don't have
any<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.420> sadly<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.959> be<00:02:13.020> able<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
any with and sadly to be able to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.229 
any with and sadly to be able to
comparison<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.430> they<00:02:14.549> do<00:02:14.640> seem<00:02:14.819> very<00:02:14.969> similar

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
comparison but they do seem very similar

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.559 
comparison but they do seem very similar
so<00:02:15.780> that's<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.049> good<00:02:16.200> thing<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:17.340> guess<00:02:17.819> that's

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
so that's a good thing I guess that's

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.020 
so that's a good thing I guess that's
pretty<00:02:18.870> much<00:02:19.109> everything<00:02:19.639> I'm<00:02:20.639> going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.879> put

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
pretty much everything I'm going to put

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.819 
pretty much everything I'm going to put
some<00:02:21.180> pictures<00:02:21.510> after<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.290> review<00:02:22.709> is

some pictures after this review is
finished<00:02:22.980> where<00:02:23.639> I<00:02:23.670> have<00:02:24.329> all<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.629> armor<00:02:24.870> on

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
finished where I have all the armor on

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.420 
finished where I have all the armor on
the<00:02:25.260> figure<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.739> can<00:02:25.889> kind<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.129> see<00:02:26.280> what

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the figure so you can kind of see what

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.709 
the figure so you can kind of see what
it<00:02:26.519> looks<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:26.819> actually<00:02:26.969> on<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.450> figure

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
it looks like actually on the figure

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.990 
it looks like actually on the figure
instead<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.079> just<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.439> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> table<00:02:29.000> next

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
instead of just like on the table next

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.509 
instead of just like on the table next
to<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.239> figure<00:02:30.659> in<00:02:31.650> case<00:02:31.829> you're<00:02:31.980> wondering<00:02:32.099> all
