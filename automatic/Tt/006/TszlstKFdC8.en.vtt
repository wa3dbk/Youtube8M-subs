00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 so following events on 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.830
 the attraction so now that 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.670
 motor-engraving box are deposited 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 begins to see much clearer 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.650
 in this engine compartment so there down 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.900
 in fact now I'm really going all 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.029
 thoroughly clean 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 remove all there any painting any 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.439
 the grime all the grease all that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.880
 can hang out 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.340
 I'm also clearing this area a bit 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.070
 contentious see exactly how far he 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.050
 remove the rotten plate to weld 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.090
 clean sheet and 9 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.440
 I'm going for a quick tour 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.300
 way my words from all the compartment 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:44.280
 to know what is or then 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.600
 here we have a screw in the room that a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:55.910
 hole here the fixing of motors that are 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.910
 there what moves there 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:10.420
 spring that positioned behind the 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:10.420
 support torsion bars here toyo 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:33.240
 I have to put their side too 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.240
 driver that's how it's done 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.360
 in these cases the most 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.150
 spectacular 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:22.740
 of the year I removed the sorting ointment 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.510
 bituminous lake was there how to know the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:31.610
 sheet metal still remains a lot to remove but 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.610
 good i would find it progresses 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.540
 so I will remove this device to 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.120
 What I have three vice unpunished if the a 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.189
 for these two there is the leg 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.959
 metallic rubik here that is to say that 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.900
 does it slow down so I'm going to use 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.359
 a screwdriver and a hammer for actually 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:58.599
 flatten lato here to be able to do 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.599
 turn the lily so I flattened the sheet 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.639
 good after that it's 12.1 no doctor 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.159
 who and no mystery but finally that 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.299
 it's a bolt so there are groups 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.700
 that we can go for the other 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.609
 side here so that's it's nothing 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.480
 of incredible still be careful 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.609
 when you go when you take off 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.040
 this blond to do hardly that the 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.629
 crous bar not not the nut the washer 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.810
 do not fight in the ham is 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.000
 a bit boring so here is the time 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.159
 at the engine bay I'm going 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.120
 now make a pass of thinner 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.060
 cellulosic 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.000
 so that's what I'm going to use then 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.260
 we do not rely much shake puts by 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.659
 precaution my mask I do not film 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.639
 this operation there since in fact I 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.579
 forgot my tripod 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.409
 but now here is the milan 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.030
 cellulosic and I'm going rubbing all 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.379
 all I can at the level of 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.049
 compartment then we will see after this 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.359
 that it gives good I spread pretty well 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.290
 the cellulosic thinner a little 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:02.750
 everywhere there is a little pig steak a 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.190
 poured with but there is still a lot 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.579
 I think I have to redo a 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.739
 passes from heat gun spatula to 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.549
 background it's really not exciting to 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.650
 watch 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.780
 it is very difficult case is strong 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.940
 not funny to do that does not have much 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.949
 interest that I show you all this but 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.549
 so here I am on a step that 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.829
 is still 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.159
 a little long not very exciting but 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.409
 that's good I'll leave you there 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.720
 so the video is going to be a bit 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:31.580
 short I agree but of another 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.860
 side if it's to look at a mic 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.789
 rub with the toys of the spatula during 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.090
 a quarter of an hour is not really the 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.699
 trouble 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.159
 so here I think that after this step 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.419
 there will still be steps one 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.300
 little more interesting to watch 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.949
 here soon then for info all of 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.979
 even so here I have my train before that 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:51.289
 waiting in my garage at home I am 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.330
 waiting for tools I will receive 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.930
 their German within a day or two of 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.699
 extractors that will allow to 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.190
 really disassociate the full the 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.129
 cradle finally we see here 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.530
 front train elements so of 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.090
 suspension triangles in the end 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.139
 so that's going to happen soon 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.060
 soon I hope to be able to do that after 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.250
 tomorrow night maybe Saturday we'll see 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.250
 well here are going to follow
