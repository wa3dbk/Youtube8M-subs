with<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.530> build<00:00:37.740> quality<00:00:37.830> but<00:00:38.670> most<00:00:38.970> of<00:00:39.150> all

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
with the build quality but most of all

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.110 
with the build quality but most of all
they<00:00:39.570> claim<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.080> the<00:00:40.680> new<00:00:40.830> 23<00:00:41.460> mil<00:00:41.670> lens<00:00:41.880> they

we<00:00:45.060> will<00:00:45.150> certainly<00:00:45.450> put<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.900> test

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
we will certainly put that to the test

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.290 
we will certainly put that to the test
at<00:00:46.410> some<00:00:46.620> point<00:00:46.920> very<00:00:47.130> soon<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.060> couldn't

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
at some point very soon but we couldn't

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270 
at some point very soon but we couldn't
wait<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.600> get<00:00:48.720> one<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.990> our<00:00:49.079> videos<00:00:49.160> across<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
wait to get one of our videos across to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.470 
wait to get one of our videos across to
you<00:00:50.990> the<00:00:51.990> lens<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.790> 23<00:00:53.790> millimeters<00:00:54.060> but

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you the lens is 23 millimeters but

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.100 
you the lens is 23 millimeters but
equates<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.079> 35<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.310> an<00:00:56.520> aps-c<00:00:57.150> size

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
equates to a 35 because an aps-c size

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.350 
equates to a 35 because an aps-c size
sensor<00:00:58.220> very<00:00:59.220> similar<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.640> what<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.970> get<00:01:00.180> an

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
sensor very similar to what you get an

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.050

and<00:01:21.780> knobs<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.260> buttons<00:01:22.430> that's<00:01:23.430> what<00:01:23.580> we

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and knobs and buttons that's what we

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.430 
and knobs and buttons that's what we
feel<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.240> lot<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> photographers<00:01:24.659> want

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
feel that a lot of photographers want

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.440 
feel that a lot of photographers want
rather<00:01:25.979> than<00:01:26.159> touch<00:01:26.729> screen<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
rather than touch screen and and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.830 
rather than touch screen and and
submenus<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:28.890> very<00:01:29.070> easy<00:01:29.190> to<00:01:29.610> operate

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
submenus so it's very easy to operate

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.520 
submenus so it's very easy to operate
very<00:01:31.280> logically<00:01:32.280> laid<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.510> very<00:01:33.810> simple

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
very logically laid out very simple

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.990 
very logically laid out very simple
straightforward<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.190> use<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:36.330> camera<00:01:36.630> has<00:01:37.080> a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
straightforward to use the camera has a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.480 
straightforward to use the camera has a
card<00:01:39.000> fitting<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> bottom<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.490> will

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
card fitting in the bottom and will

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.560 
card fitting in the bottom and will
actually<00:01:41.820> take<00:01:42.060> SD<00:01:42.860> sdhc<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.540> SDXC<00:01:45.540> memory

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
actually take SD sdhc and SDXC memory

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.870 
actually take SD sdhc and SDXC memory
cards<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.799> keeps<00:01:47.100> everything<00:01:47.430> nice<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
cards so keeps everything nice and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.330 
cards so keeps everything nice and
portable<00:01:48.270> small<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.740> think<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.189> is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
portable small and we think this is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520 
portable small and we think this is
going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.760> an<00:01:50.880> absolute<00:01:51.450> winner<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.140> real

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
going to be an absolute winner a real

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.640 
going to be an absolute winner a real
