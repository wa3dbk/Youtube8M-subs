magic online is failing big time and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.840 
magic online is failing big time and
they<00:00:58.020> big<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.500> best<00:00:58.710> example<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.309> for

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
they big the best example I have for

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.020 
they big the best example I have for
magic<00:01:00.149> online<00:01:00.890> not<00:01:01.890> being<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.489> good<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
magic online not being as good as it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.969 
magic online not being as good as it
could<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.600> ten<00:01:03.930> years<00:01:03.960> ago<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.650> looked<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
could be is ten years ago it looked the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.520 
could be is ten years ago it looked the
same<00:01:05.159> as<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.460> play<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.080> looks<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
same as I play now like it looks it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.670 
same as I play now like it looks it
looks<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.310> feels<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.180> interacts<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.350> very

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
looks and feels and interacts the very

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
looks and feels and interacts the very
same<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:13.580> guess<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> most<00:01:14.970> clear<00:01:15.360> example

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
same way I guess the most clear example

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.870 
same way I guess the most clear example
is<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.799> still<00:01:17.189> don't<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> mac

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
is they do they still don't have a mac

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120 
is they do they still don't have a mac
version<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.740> don't<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
version of it and they don't have a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520 
version of it and they don't have a
deadline<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.299> mac<00:01:21.570> version<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.290> if

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
deadline to make a mac version of it if

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.100 
deadline to make a mac version of it if
I<00:01:23.220> assume<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.000> fifty<00:01:24.540> percent<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.990> people

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
I assume that fifty percent of people

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.460 
I assume that fifty percent of people
are<00:01:25.380> using<00:01:25.530> Mac's<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.659> maybe<00:01:27.659> forty<00:01:28.049> percent<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
are using Mac's or maybe forty percent I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.249 
are using Mac's or maybe forty percent I
personally<00:01:29.369> all<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.820> friends<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.360> max<00:01:30.630> I'm

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
personally all my friends use max I'm

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.620 
personally all my friends use max I'm
the<00:01:31.500> only<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.799> who<00:01:31.950> uses<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.280> pc<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.270> Lawrence

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the only one who uses a pc but Lawrence

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
the only one who uses a pc but Lawrence
majority<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.439> large<00:01:35.390> group<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.600> people<00:01:38.030> use

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
majority or a large group of people use

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.469 
majority or a large group of people use
macs<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.720> they<00:01:39.869> cannot<00:01:40.200> play<00:01:40.530> magic<00:01:41.009> online

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
macs and they cannot play magic online

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.870 
macs and they cannot play magic online
so<00:01:42.479> what<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.170> option<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.950> buy<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> pc

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so what is the option to go buy a pc

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.990 
so what is the option to go buy a pc
that<00:01:45.229> they<00:01:46.229> probably<00:01:46.500> will<00:01:47.009> never<00:01:47.130> use<00:01:47.549> except

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that they probably will never use except

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.810 
that they probably will never use except
to<00:01:48.090> play<00:01:48.240> magic<00:01:48.600> online<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.860> doesn't<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:50.520> any

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
to play magic online it doesn't make any

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.780 
to play magic online it doesn't make any
sense<00:01:51.619> when<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> kind<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.130> look<00:01:53.280> at<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.549> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
sense when you kind of look at it that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.350 
sense when you kind of look at it that
way<00:01:53.820> where<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.420> have<00:01:54.570> 10<00:01:54.930> years<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.619> create

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
way where you have 10 years to create

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.050 
way where you have 10 years to create
some<00:01:57.360> type<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.680> program<00:01:58.680> at<00:01:58.829> least<00:01:59.009> attempt<00:01:59.670> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
some type of program at least attempt to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.830 
some type of program at least attempt to
create<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.509> program<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.409> set<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> deadline<00:02:02.840> for
