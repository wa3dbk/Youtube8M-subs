the near you'll see to the near number
under<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.140> chest<00:02:06.380> plate<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:07.100> close<00:02:07.340> the

we're going to continue to run our feet
through<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.579> process<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:11.269> we<00:02:11.329> got<00:02:11.450> momentum

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
through the process but we got momentum

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.810 
through the process but we got momentum
on<00:02:12.079> our<00:02:12.170> side<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:13.010> what<00:02:13.130> we<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.790> a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
on our side so what we can do this is a

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.150 
on our side so what we can do this is a
great<00:02:14.030> way<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.180> finish<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.510> guy<00:02:14.720> off<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.920> if<00:02:16.040> I'm

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
great way to finish a guy off so if I'm

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.729 
great way to finish a guy off so if I'm
running<00:02:16.250> here<00:02:16.670> let's<00:02:17.209> close<00:02:17.389> the<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.530> I

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
running here let's close the can and I

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.530 
running here let's close the can and I
can't<00:02:18.980> get<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.820> near<00:02:20.060> side<00:02:20.299> enough

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
can't get to that that near side enough

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.509 
can't get to that that near side enough
number<00:02:21.109> so<00:02:21.739> I'm<00:02:21.859> going<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.010> take<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.340> going<00:02:22.430> to

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
underneath the armpit here this is

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.460 
underneath the armpit here this is
another<00:02:56.270> way<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.480> go<00:02:56.690> just<00:02:57.110> underneath<00:02:57.320> the

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
another way to go just underneath the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.170 
another way to go just underneath the
armpit<00:02:57.740> just<00:02:57.920> another<00:02:58.160> pressure<00:02:58.430> point<00:02:58.730> what

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
armpit just another pressure point what

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.880 
armpit just another pressure point what
we're<00:02:59.300> trying<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.510> do<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.840> key<00:02:59.990> is<00:03:00.140> we're

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
we're trying to do and the key is we're

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.040 
we're trying to do and the key is we're
not<00:03:01.040> just<00:03:01.280> torquing<00:03:01.700> sideways<00:03:02.150> there's<00:03:02.960> a

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
not just torquing sideways there's a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.410 
not just torquing sideways there's a
slight<00:03:03.260> lift<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.740> it's<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.310> lift<00:03:04.520> but<00:03:05.300> it's

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
slight lift to this it's a lift but it's

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.420 
slight lift to this it's a lift but it's
all<00:03:05.540> hip<00:03:05.750> it's<00:03:06.020> all<00:03:06.110> driven<00:03:06.320> by<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.590> hips<00:03:06.860> okay

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
all hip it's all driven by the hips okay

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.700 
all hip it's all driven by the hips okay
so<00:03:07.910> if<00:03:08.030> Colin<00:03:08.330> gums<00:03:08.540> up<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.960> don't<00:03:09.290> get<00:03:09.500> here<00:03:09.680> I

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
so if Colin gums up I don't get here I

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.260 
so if Colin gums up I don't get here I
get<00:03:09.860> over<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.190> armpit<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:10.970> can<00:03:11.120> finish

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
get over to the armpit and I can finish

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.230 
get over to the armpit and I can finish
this<00:03:11.540> way<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:13.340> one<00:03:13.460> thing<00:03:13.550> I<00:03:13.670> like<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.910> do<00:03:14.030> is

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
this way so one thing I like to do is

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.790 
this way so one thing I like to do is
freeze<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.630> eyes<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.990> the<00:03:15.050> linebacker<00:03:15.410> and

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
freeze the eyes of the linebacker and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.100 
freeze the eyes of the linebacker and
you<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.100> do<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.370> by<00:03:16.850> flashing<00:03:17.270> a<00:03:17.330> hand<00:03:17.570> okay

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
you can do that by flashing a hand okay

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.840 
you can do that by flashing a hand okay
so<00:03:18.620> we're<00:03:19.070> gonna<00:03:19.160> smullin<00:03:19.580> Terrell<00:03:19.790> II

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
so we're gonna smullin Terrell II

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.970 
so we're gonna smullin Terrell II
stunned<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.330> eyes<00:03:20.710> stun<00:03:21.710> that<00:03:21.740> the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
stunned the eyes stun that the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
of his periphery view which is a great

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.449 
of his periphery view which is a great
way<00:03:26.240> to<00:03:26.270> get<00:03:26.540> up<00:03:26.660> on<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> guy<00:03:27.020> that's<00:03:27.410> he's<00:03:28.340> gonna

periphery he's not going to turn and
look<00:03:43.310> at<00:03:43.520> it<00:03:43.670> but<00:03:44.570> from<00:03:44.720> evolutionary

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
look at it but from evolutionary

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.150 
look at it but from evolutionary
standards<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.770> know<00:03:45.860> if<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.040> got<00:03:46.130> a

that that piece of this vision is
peripheral<00:04:04.880> vision<00:04:05.209> it's<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:05.660> great<00:04:05.870> way<00:04:05.989> to

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
peripheral vision it's a great way to

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.900 
peripheral vision it's a great way to
get<00:04:06.230> up<00:04:06.320> on<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.500> linebacker<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:07.610> do<00:04:07.730> that
