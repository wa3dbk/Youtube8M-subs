00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:14.059
 Today I will show you how to keep 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.830
 1.6 point 1 for marc for windows for 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:22.730
 what they want 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:26.270
 I know a lot of Spanish will be treated 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.009
 because magnesium users is very 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.710
 difficult to get things from 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.250
 but I already managed to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.250
 to get it 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.170
 the link that I left in the inscription goes 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.230
 to be going to get contain this 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.100
 binder 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.270
 laurines 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.220
 today 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.010
 we open it 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.890
 and contend this new main after point 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.800
 farc and the launcher x files points 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.310
 heart 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.300
 the first step 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.720
 that is, it would be good if it was to come 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.290
 bookstore 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.860
 apply support 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:14.440
 good in windows would be and it would be 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.440
 percent apple app button 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:24.780
 and there it would come out the folder is that is 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:29.150
 a point and in windows point main 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.260
 what do we want with this peace 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.260
 for the trash 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.960
 look at this moment 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.840
 this does not work for us now so now 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.340
 What we do is grab this 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.000
 Push 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.000
 we open it 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.659
 if it opens it will open this in the new 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.659
 launcher charging strand 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.790
 and we do not wait 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.090
 now we close it 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.480
 without waiting for the blue or green bar that 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.390
 cool there 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.260
 and now as you will see here he returned to 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.260
 appear the bed 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.480
 but what we do is grab this 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.790
 always launcher profiles point by case 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.120
 we do it with mans or control it 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.180
 depending on what you have we paste it 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.330
 here 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.710
 and as you will see that as you will see 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.710
 that is, do not leave this 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.200
 and it appears to us will appear not in another type 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.740
 of photos here here in more 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.390
 please be short text edit 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.750
 in the windows what will have to be done 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.470
 is to open it with the note pad with the pad 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.790
 of notes 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.400
 here will come here say of a in here 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.430
 then here what we are going to do as 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.010
 says there exposes in our name I 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.700
 I will put better 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.700
 You'll see 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:16.150
 yes my name is and now what we do 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.819
 is here will come another and put as flag 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.659
 the yesterday 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.659
 and also 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.830
 no need to put on windows I will stop 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.330
 will have to 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.330
 to put you save but 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.750
 in maxi save by default 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.400
 but what we do 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.930
 we come back here 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.359
 center 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.359
 and now it will open very well very nice 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.610
 to open the truth that is a bit 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.610
 disappointing 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.030
 work work a lot the demons that 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.569
 doing this because we do not hack it and 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.370
 another and now how much is it a day and 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.269
 we can pirate all of them 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.930
 fishes 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:16.310
 then pc mac linux I do not know if it's not here 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.769
 are here here is the new system of 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.410
 portals they made 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.740
 which is for example if I what if I 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.229
 I want a folder lived and for example 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.060
 I want to play with more news and 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.569
 fox comfort 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.370
 at the same time but not but in the world 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.920
 depending on the bander module it would be 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.140
 well that sometimes they are not compatible 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.930
 So here, here comes why 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.760
 why do you select a folder and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.250
 it can also be for the selection if 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.660
 you want to play in another in another version and 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.780
 starts 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.770
 and as you can see it says play off line but 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.629
 also better but it also works 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.970
 although there is play off line too 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:01.310
 works online 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.990
 Liar is a liar 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.380
 and like summer that is being downloaded 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.380
 by 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.960
 and here they come to know there is some day 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.670
 perhaps made a video explaining 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:24.480
 is guaranteeing higher point point 6.1 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:27.060
 today how beautiful the icon of a plateau 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.100
 and as you will see here it comes out 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.550
 this is all and it is also for 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.970
 preserve our worlds what would 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.970
 what to do is 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.180
 before doing all this 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.180
 grab the backrest 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.620
 the backup 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.500
 and here I have the fan texts and the 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.250
 six we grabbed I know 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.250
 all our worlds 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.810
 this 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.810
 it is saved by 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:22.360
 everything be saved 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:24.680
 we grab you we put you back men 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.380
 state 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.800
 and it's good this is the folder the 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.030
 folder was made we do not have the backing 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.030
 now let's go folder 6 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.910
 and all will come another folder 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:48.630
 We seized to sell to Tehran and also 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.630
 there are 6 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:07:03.890
 then I know 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.890
 taking control 6 control 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.920
 copy paste 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:14.380
 you are going to give as an editor to live and as 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.790
 come there they will be able to have 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.900
 and it is already 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.680
 that has been all 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.680
 see you later
