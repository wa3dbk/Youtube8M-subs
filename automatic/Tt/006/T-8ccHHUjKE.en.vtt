grease a half an inch up the sides of the
pan.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.330
If you prefer, you can use many loaf pans
instead of 1 big pan.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.829
Into a large bowl with 2 cups of all-purpose
flour, add two-thirds of a cup of pack brown

of baking soda, and a quarter of a teaspoon

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.270

add 2 beaten eggs, two-thirds of a cup of

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.500
milk, and a third cup of canola oil and stir
to combine.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.960

It will take about 55 to 60 minutes.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.500
if the loaf is browning too quickly at this
point, cover it with foil and continue baking.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.930
Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick
near the center of the loaf to see if it comes

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.930
out clean.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.680

at room temperature at least overnight before

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.680
slicing.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.900
It can stay at room temperature for up to
3 days or you can freeze it for up to 3 months.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.869
When you're just about ready to serve the
bread, it's time to make the cream cheese

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.850

Beat everything together until it's smooth
and glaze like.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.010

of butter in a skillet over medium heat.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.760

Spread the candied carrots on waxed paper
or paper towels to cool.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.200
