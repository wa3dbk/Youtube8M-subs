normal track it's from the video game I
set<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> subsequent<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.090> there's<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.450> much

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630

going<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.120> transformation<00:02:19.750> process<00:02:20.820> so

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
going to the transformation process so

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.220 
going to the transformation process so
the<00:02:22.030> first<00:02:22.150> thing<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.480> have<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.690> do<00:02:22.900> in<00:02:23.140> the

the first thing you have to do in the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.520 
the first thing you have to do in the
transformation<00:02:23.830> it's<00:02:24.010> too<00:02:25.020> feared<00:02:26.020> rooftop

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
transformation it's too feared rooftop

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.620 
transformation it's too feared rooftop
just<00:02:26.980> take<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.850> off<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.180> put<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:29.710> right<00:02:29.830> down

of<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.310> tire<00:02:49.560> like<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:51.209> will<00:02:52.209> do<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.510> same

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
of the tire like that will do the same

00:02:52.630 --> 00:03:00.750 
of the tire like that will do the same
here<00:02:54.270> push<00:02:55.270> down<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.260> through<00:02:56.890> side<00:02:59.250> and<00:03:00.250> your

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
here push down and through side and your

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.940 
here push down and through side and your
thing<00:03:01.180> we<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.630> do<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.989> just<00:03:02.200> pull<00:03:02.709> this

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
thing we have to do it just pull this

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.540 
thing we have to do it just pull this
off<00:03:04.800> use<00:03:05.800> height<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.520> behind<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.209> hood

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
off use height this behind the hood

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.699 
off use height this behind the hood
these<00:03:09.550> are<00:03:09.730> going<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.090> become<00:03:10.320> payloads<00:03:11.320> legs

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
these are going to become payloads legs

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.729 
these are going to become payloads legs
so<00:03:12.130> we're<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.700> separate<00:03:13.330> them<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.870> I'm

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
so we're going to separate them and I'm

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.960 
so we're going to separate them and I'm
going<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.130> rotate<00:03:15.370> 180<00:03:16.239> degrees<00:03:19.650> ok<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.730> you

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
going to rotate 180 degrees ok that you

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.870 
going to rotate 180 degrees ok that you
have<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.360> do<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.989> bend<00:03:23.440> these<00:03:23.709> from<00:03:24.580> because

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
have to do just bend these from because

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.250 
have to do just bend these from because
these<00:03:25.030> are<00:03:25.269> going<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.750> become<00:03:26.310> payloads<00:03:27.310> p

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
these are going to become payloads p

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.289 
these are going to become payloads p

is very hard to get and get this thing
to<00:04:57.000> stem<00:04:58.430> she'll<00:04:59.430> be<00:04:59.460> able<00:04:59.760> to<00:05:00.000> do<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:03.800> very

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
to stem she'll be able to do it very

well<00:06:04.830> details<00:06:05.520> you<00:06:05.820> can<00:06:05.880> see<00:06:06.380> but<00:06:07.380> I<00:06:07.410> still

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
well details you can see but I still

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.770 
well details you can see but I still
don't<00:06:07.919> don't<00:06:08.460> like<00:06:08.640> that<00:06:08.910> in<00:06:09.690> a

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
don't don't like that in a

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.029 
don't don't like that in a
transformation<00:06:10.380> process<00:06:10.770> there<00:06:10.919> is<00:06:10.979> a

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
transformation process there is a

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.490 
transformation process there is a
problem<00:06:11.340> an<00:06:11.490> issue<00:06:11.610> because<00:06:11.880> this<00:06:12.330> will<00:06:13.200> tend

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
problem an issue because this will tend

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.350 
problem an issue because this will tend
to<00:06:13.680> come<00:06:13.860> off<00:06:13.890> I<00:06:14.280> don't<00:06:14.520> know<00:06:14.610> why<00:06:14.789> they<00:06:15.300> do

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
to come off I don't know why they do

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.440 
to come off I don't know why they do
this<00:06:16.010> to<00:06:17.010> take<00:06:17.520> this<00:06:17.700> off<00:06:17.970> maybe<00:06:18.870> two<00:06:20.240> did<00:06:21.240> you

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
this to take this off maybe two did you

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.190 
this to take this off maybe two did you
play<00:06:21.870> with<00:06:22.050> this<00:06:22.289> and<00:06:23.330> you<00:06:24.330> simulate<00:06:24.570> that<00:06:24.810> you

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
play with this and you simulate that you

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.810 
play with this and you simulate that you
destroy<00:06:25.620> this<00:06:25.800> guy<00:06:26.039> like<00:06:26.280> in<00:06:26.430> the<00:06:26.490> video<00:06:26.640> game

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
destroy this guy like in the video game

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.469 
destroy this guy like in the video game
all<00:06:27.390> the<00:06:27.570> parts<00:06:27.840> will<00:06:27.990> just<00:06:28.350> fall<00:06:29.039> out<00:06:29.070> I<00:06:29.490> think

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
all the parts will just fall out I think

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.070 
all the parts will just fall out I think
that's

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
that's

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.950 
that's
too<00:06:32.199> thin<00:06:32.379> I<00:06:32.669> don't<00:06:33.669> know<00:06:36.659> the<00:06:37.659> other<00:06:37.810> thing

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
too thin I don't know the other thing

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.809 
too thin I don't know the other thing
that<00:06:37.990> I<00:06:38.139> don't<00:06:38.349> like<00:06:38.470> is<00:06:38.650> this<00:06:38.889> thing<00:06:39.220> holding

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:39.819 
that I don't like is this thing holding

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.390 
that I don't like is this thing holding
on<00:06:40.000> to<00:06:40.180> the<00:06:40.300> back<00:06:40.479> this<00:06:40.930> doesn't<00:06:40.990> allow<00:06:41.620> the

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
on to the back this doesn't allow the

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.659 
on to the back this doesn't allow the
video<00:06:42.669> to<00:06:42.819> stand<00:06:43.090> up<00:06:43.210> very<00:06:43.449> well<00:06:43.569> we<00:06:44.169> have<00:06:44.289> to

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
video to stand up very well we have to

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.140 
video to stand up very well we have to
really<00:06:45.669> get<00:06:46.569> to<00:06:46.780> work<00:06:46.990> here<00:06:47.319> because

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
really get to work here because

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.990 
really get to work here because
sometimes<00:06:49.150> you<00:06:49.389> just<00:06:49.509> won't<00:06:49.780> stand<00:06:50.139> well<00:06:51.000> but

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
sometimes you just won't stand well but

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.659 
sometimes you just won't stand well but
this<00:06:52.389> is<00:06:52.870> part<00:06:53.169> of<00:06:53.319> the<00:06:53.650> robot<00:06:54.310> gimmick

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
this is part of the robot gimmick

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.010 
this is part of the robot gimmick
because<00:06:55.030> if<00:06:55.360> you<00:06:55.479> push<00:06:55.719> this<00:06:56.550> right<00:06:57.550> there

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
because if you push this right there

because if you push this right there
each<00:06:59.020> other<00:06:59.229> gimmick<00:06:59.650> in<00:06:59.889> the<00:07:00.039> front<00:07:00.310> here<00:07:00.490> now

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830 
like the transformation process because

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:42.240 
like the transformation process because
it's<00:07:36.159> a<00:07:36.279> little<00:07:36.550> bit<00:07:37.139> complicated<00:07:40.620> drama<00:07:41.620> it's
