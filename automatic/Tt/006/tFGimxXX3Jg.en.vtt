they have to play against other parties

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.840 
they have to play against other parties
at<00:02:40.410> least<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> majority<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.400> time<00:02:41.580> if

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
at least the majority of the time if

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.910 
at least the majority of the time if
there<00:02:42.030> are<00:02:42.180> other<00:02:42.300> parties<00:02:42.780> available<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.800> be

there are other parties available to be

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.070 
there are other parties available to be
matched<00:02:44.130> up<00:02:44.400> with<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.180> think<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.989> that

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
matched up with so I think that that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.470 
matched up with so I think that that
would<00:02:46.320> be<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.470> really<00:02:46.709> good<00:02:46.920> idea<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:47.940> far<00:02:48.239> with

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
would be a really good idea so far with

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.120 
would be a really good idea so far with

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.289 
to be changed for call of duty ghosts
that<00:03:45.239> way<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:46.350> will<00:03:46.530> lower<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.850> gameplay

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
that way it will lower the the gameplay

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.550 
that way it will lower the the gameplay
ceiling<00:03:48.780> because<00:03:49.049> there<00:03:49.170> will<00:03:49.260> be<00:03:49.380> less

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
ceiling because there will be less

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.289 
ceiling because there will be less
support<00:03:50.040> parties<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.579> less<00:03:50.670> support<00:03:51.090> game

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
support parties and less support game

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.449 
support parties and less support game
plays<00:03:51.600> if<00:03:52.049> those<00:03:52.350> aren't<00:03:52.650> your<00:03:52.860> type<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.220> thing

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
plays if those aren't your type of thing

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.090 
plays if those aren't your type of thing
and<00:03:53.700> then<00:03:54.209> as<00:03:54.329> far<00:03:54.600> as<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.680> game<00:03:55.860> plays

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
and then as far as the the game plays

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.310 
and then as far as the the game plays
where<00:03:56.310> you're<00:03:56.459> playing<00:03:56.700> solo<00:03:57.269> you're<00:03:58.170> not

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
where you're playing solo you're not

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.509 
where you're playing solo you're not
gonna<00:03:58.470> have<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.709> worry<00:03:58.890> about<00:03:59.100> running<00:03:59.340> into

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
gonna have to worry about running into

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.819 
gonna have to worry about running into
these<00:03:59.760> nine-man<00:04:00.239> parties<00:04:00.720> or<00:04:01.049> at<00:04:01.380> least<00:04:01.590> it

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
these nine-man parties or at least it

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.500 
these nine-man parties or at least it
will<00:04:01.920> be<00:04:02.070> less<00:04:02.340> frequent<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.090> think<00:04:03.360> that<00:04:03.480> that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
will be less frequent I think that that

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.509 
will be less frequent I think that that
would<00:04:03.720> be<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.840> really<00:04:04.079> good<00:04:04.290> idea<00:04:04.519> something

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
would be a really good idea something

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.310 
would be a really good idea something
that<00:04:05.760> they<00:04:05.850> could<00:04:05.910> definitely<00:04:06.269> implement<00:04:06.660> and

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
that they could definitely implement and

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.530 
that they could definitely implement and
I<00:04:07.680> think<00:04:08.070> that<00:04:08.370> if<00:04:08.640> most<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.180> guys<00:04:09.239> agree

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
I think that if most of you guys agree

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.690 
I think that if most of you guys agree
with<00:04:09.630> me<00:04:09.930> we<00:04:10.380> can<00:04:10.530> probably<00:04:10.739> get<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.250> done<00:04:11.430> if

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
with me we can probably get it done if

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.970 
with me we can probably get it done if
we<00:04:11.850> tweet<00:04:12.150> her<00:04:12.299> enough<00:04:12.600> so<00:04:12.959> hopefully<00:04:13.920> you
