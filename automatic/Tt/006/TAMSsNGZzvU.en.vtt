I'm<00:00:27.240> not<00:00:27.420> sure<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:27.689> I'm<00:00:27.840> pronouncing<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.410> right

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it right

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.040 
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it right
so<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.859> apologize<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.929> can

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
so I apologize for that but as you can

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.389 
so I apologize for that but as you can
see<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.410> looks<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.830> standard<00:00:32.160> iron

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
see it looks like a standard iron

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.310 
see it looks like a standard iron
Warhammer<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:33.329> makes<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.719> different<00:00:33.960> is

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
Warhammer but what makes it different is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.979 
Warhammer but what makes it different is
that<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:35.100> does<00:00:35.370> five<00:00:35.760> points<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> frost<00:00:36.750> damage

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
that it does five points of frost damage

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.869 
that it does five points of frost damage
to<00:00:37.260> both<00:00:37.350> health<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.710> stamina<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.700> makes

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
to both health and stamina so that makes

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.869 
to both health and stamina so that makes
it<00:00:39.000> pretty<00:00:39.450> pretty<00:00:40.100> powerful<00:00:41.100> for<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> for

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it pretty pretty powerful for it for

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.779 
it pretty pretty powerful for it for
compared<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.390> other<00:00:42.840> war<00:00:43.110> hammers<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.789> you

basically an orcish war hammer but the
good<00:02:01.460> thing<00:02:01.490> about<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:02.060> is<00:02:02.240> that<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.870> moves<00:02:03.080> a

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
good thing about it is that it moves a

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.960 
good thing about it is that it moves a
lot<00:02:03.440> faster<00:02:03.500> than<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.250> average<00:02:04.370> war<00:02:04.700> hammer

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970

lot faster than the average war hammer
and<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:06.290> moves<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.620> mean<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.860> swings<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.280> lot

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
and it moves I mean it swings a lot

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.090 
and it moves I mean it swings a lot
faster<00:02:07.970> it's<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.630> has<00:02:09.170> pretty<00:02:09.619> much<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.920> same

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
faster it's and has pretty much the same

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.980 
faster it's and has pretty much the same
damage<00:02:10.310> values<00:02:10.789> it's<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.330> faster<00:02:11.810> moving

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
damage values it's just a faster moving

something that's pretty tough and it'll

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.089 
something that's pretty tough and it'll
be<00:05:33.750> hitting<00:05:34.050> me<00:05:34.169> but<00:05:34.349> every<00:05:34.560> time<00:05:34.590> I<00:05:34.770> hit<00:05:35.039> it

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
be hitting me but every time I hit it

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:36.950

back<00:05:35.400> I'll<00:05:35.669> regain<00:05:36.060> whatever<00:05:36.389> health<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.780> just

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
back I'll regain whatever health it just

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.810 
back I'll regain whatever health it just
took<00:05:37.080> for<00:05:37.320> me<00:05:37.440> which<00:05:38.070> obviously<00:05:38.280> will<00:05:38.789> make

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
took for me which obviously will make

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.379 
took for me which obviously will make
you<00:05:39.120> very<00:05:39.150> powerful<00:05:40.099> now<00:05:41.099> when<00:05:41.849> you<00:05:41.940> first<00:05:42.120> get

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
you very powerful now when you first get

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.060 
you very powerful now when you first get
it<00:05:42.539> it<00:05:42.690> takes<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:43.110> certain<00:05:43.289> amount<00:05:43.530> of<00:05:43.680> health<00:05:43.860> I

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
it it takes a certain amount of health I

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.499 
it it takes a certain amount of health I
think<00:05:44.099> something<00:05:44.550> like<00:05:44.699> 10<00:05:44.970> points<00:05:45.270> of<00:05:45.360> health

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
think something like 10 points of health

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.050 
think something like 10 points of health
for<00:05:45.900> every<00:05:46.169> hit<00:05:46.320> that<00:05:46.530> you<00:05:46.620> take<00:05:46.830> on<00:05:47.070> an<00:05:47.909> enemy

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
for every hit that you take on an enemy

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.010 
for every hit that you take on an enemy
but<00:05:48.990> by<00:05:49.259> killing<00:05:50.190> someone<00:05:50.820> who<00:05:51.060> trusts<00:05:51.539> you<00:05:51.599> so

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
but by killing someone who trusts you so

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.320 
but by killing someone who trusts you so
every<00:05:52.680> time<00:05:52.860> you<00:05:52.979> kill<00:05:53.250> a<00:05:53.279> friendly<00:05:53.729> NPC

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
every time you kill a friendly NPC

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330 
every time you kill a friendly NPC
it'll<00:05:54.900> get<00:05:55.050> a<00:05:55.080> little<00:05:55.259> more<00:05:55.470> powerful<00:05:55.979> and<00:05:56.159> it

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
it'll get a little more powerful and it

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.850 
it'll get a little more powerful and it
can<00:05:56.520> take<00:05:56.759> more<00:05:57.389> and<00:05:57.509> more<00:05:57.569> health<00:05:57.870> from<00:05:58.289> your

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
can take more and more health from your

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.619 
can take more and more health from your
enemies<00:05:59.220> so<00:05:59.250> I<00:05:59.460> think<00:05:59.610> if<00:05:59.970> you<00:06:00.090> kill<00:06:00.330> something

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
enemies so I think if you kill something

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.520 
enemies so I think if you kill something
like<00:06:00.810> 8<00:06:01.080> friendly<00:06:01.560> NPCs<00:06:02.099> then<00:06:03.000> it'll<00:06:03.569> end<00:06:03.840> up

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
like 8 friendly NPCs then it'll end up

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.230 
like 8 friendly NPCs then it'll end up
taking<00:06:04.800> 40<00:06:05.370> points<00:06:05.639> of<00:06:05.699> health<00:06:05.849> from<00:06:06.060> your

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
taking 40 points of health from your

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.719 
taking 40 points of health from your
enemies<00:06:06.539> which<00:06:06.750> is<00:06:06.930> of<00:06:07.080> course<00:06:07.729> super

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
enemies which is of course super

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.439 
enemies which is of course super
powerful<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.560> so<00:06:10.560> friendly<00:06:10.979> NPCs<00:06:11.550> can<00:06:11.580> be

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
powerful and so friendly NPCs can be

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.020 
powerful and so friendly NPCs can be
conjured<00:06:12.990> familiars<00:06:13.409> they<00:06:13.620> can<00:06:13.830> be<00:06:14.030> people

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
conjured familiars they can be people

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.209 
conjured familiars they can be people
like<00:06:15.419> beggars<00:06:15.750> who<00:06:16.139> you've<00:06:16.289> given<00:06:16.590> coins<00:06:16.889> to
