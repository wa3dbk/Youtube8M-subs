have<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.239> USB<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:47.870> I'll<00:02:48.140> just<00:02:48.290> take<00:02:48.829> this<00:02:48.950> out

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
have the USB so I'll just take this out

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.110 
have the USB so I'll just take this out
and<00:02:53.409> there<00:02:54.409> we<00:02:54.530> go<00:02:54.680> it's<00:02:54.890> easy<00:02:55.069> as<00:02:55.400> 1-2-3

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
and there we go it's easy as 1-2-3

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.880 
and there we go it's easy as 1-2-3
though<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.959> will<00:02:57.140> be<00:02:57.260> able<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.500> see<00:02:57.650> this

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
though you will be able to see this

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.349 
though you will be able to see this
let's<00:02:58.159> just<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:59.690> there's<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.680> actual<00:03:00.950> Y<00:03:01.519> USB

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
let's just so there's the actual Y USB

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.809 
let's just so there's the actual Y USB
adapter<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.290> that's<00:03:04.129> what<00:03:04.310> makes<00:03:04.519> your

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
adapter and that's what makes your

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.559 
adapter and that's what makes your
keyboard<00:03:05.780> wireless<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:08.030> very<00:03:08.239> clever

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
keyboard wireless it's very clever

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.360 
keyboard wireless it's very clever
actually<00:03:08.810> it's<00:03:09.140> very<00:03:09.319> tiny<00:03:09.650> it's<00:03:09.950> literally

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
actually it's very tiny it's literally

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.559 
actually it's very tiny it's literally
about<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.700> size<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.269> maybe<00:03:11.510> my<00:03:11.810> phone<00:03:12.049> male<00:03:13.569> 1

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
about the size of maybe my phone male 1

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.210 
about the size of maybe my phone male 1
I<00:03:14.599> can<00:03:14.810> see<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:16.579> looks<00:03:16.790> looks<00:03:17.450> quite<00:03:17.720> nice<00:03:17.900> so

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
I can see the looks looks quite nice so

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.710 
I can see the looks looks quite nice so
anyway<00:03:19.220> there<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.459> go<00:03:19.609> there's<00:03:19.910> what's<00:03:20.540> in

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
anyway there you go there's what's in

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.780 
anyway there you go there's what's in
the<00:03:20.810> box<00:03:21.049> you've<00:03:21.380> just<00:03:21.590> got<00:03:21.769> this<00:03:21.919> there<00:03:22.519> and

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
the box you've just got this there and

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.849 
the box you've just got this there and
the<00:03:22.970> box<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.419> that's<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:25.160> oh<00:03:29.859> they'll

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
the box and that's it so oh they'll

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.619 
the box and that's it so oh they'll
actually<00:03:31.010> nearly<00:03:31.430> drop<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.910> key<00:03:32.060> ball<00:03:32.269> itself

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
actually nearly drop the key ball itself

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.319 
actually nearly drop the key ball itself
then<00:03:33.099> may<00:03:34.099> have<00:03:34.220> been<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.430> little<00:03:34.700> bit<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.180> a

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
then may have been a little bit of a

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.759 
then may have been a little bit of a
disaster<00:03:35.660> for<00:03:36.079> me<00:03:36.290> but<00:03:38.199> there<00:03:39.199> we<00:03:39.349> go

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
disaster for me but there we go

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.839 
disaster for me but there we go
so<00:03:40.760> as<00:03:40.849> a<00:03:40.970> keyboard<00:03:42.190> initial<00:03:43.190> impressions<00:03:43.790> of

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
so as a keyboard initial impressions of

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.300 
so as a keyboard initial impressions of
the<00:03:43.970> keyboard<00:03:44.680> it's<00:03:45.680> nice<00:03:45.949> it's<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:49.190> know

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
the keyboard it's nice it's you know

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.890 
the keyboard it's nice it's you know
responsive<00:03:49.970> it's<00:03:50.150> what<00:03:50.299> our<00:03:50.389> key<00:03:50.540> body's

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
responsive it's what our key body's

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.229 
responsive it's what our key body's
meant<00:03:51.109> to<00:03:51.260> do<00:03:51.410> but<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.370> would<00:03:52.699> say<00:03:52.970> that

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
meant to do but I would say that

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.289 
meant to do but I would say that
probably<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:54.459> build<00:03:55.459> quality<00:03:55.669> isn't<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
probably the build quality isn't the

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.550 
probably the build quality isn't the
best<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.780> world<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.109> know<00:03:57.260> you<00:03:57.319> can't

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
best in the world you know you can't

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.680 
best in the world you know you can't
expect<00:03:57.949> this<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.280> be<00:03:58.400> made<00:03:58.669> of<00:03:58.879> I<00:03:59.090> suppose

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
expect this to be made of I suppose

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.220 
expect this to be made of I suppose
metal<00:04:00.470> because<00:04:01.069> for<00:04:01.849> 24<00:04:02.269> pounds<00:04:02.780> it's<00:04:02.959> not

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
metal because for 24 pounds it's not

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.610 
metal because for 24 pounds it's not
what<00:04:03.410> you're<00:04:03.530> going<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.709> get<00:04:03.859> but<00:04:04.790> then<00:04:05.620> from

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
what you're going to get but then from

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.680 
what you're going to get but then from
what<00:04:06.829> I<00:04:06.859> can<00:04:06.949> hear<00:04:07.129> what<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:07.579> can<00:04:07.790> feel<00:04:08.090> does

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
what I can hear what I can feel does

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.050 
what I can hear what I can feel does
seem<00:04:09.139> a<00:04:09.169> good<00:04:09.680> decent<00:04:09.919> keyboard<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:10.940> they<00:04:11.000> do

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
seem a good decent keyboard and they do

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.199 
seem a good decent keyboard and they do
like<00:04:11.299> a<00:04:11.569> Logitech<00:04:12.500> logo<00:04:12.530> up<00:04:12.980> there<00:04:13.090> gives<00:04:14.090> you

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
like a Logitech logo up there gives you

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.409 
like a Logitech logo up there gives you
a<00:04:14.389> keyboard<00:04:14.989> a<00:04:15.109> sense<00:04:15.319> of<00:04:15.440> identity<00:04:15.949> I<00:04:16.070> suppose

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
a keyboard a sense of identity I suppose

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.319 
a keyboard a sense of identity I suppose
and<00:04:18.289> there<00:04:18.560> we<00:04:18.650> go<00:04:18.799> now<00:04:19.250> can<00:04:19.639> I<00:04:19.729> just<00:04:19.759> point<00:04:20.120> out

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
and there we go now can I just point out

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.399 
and there we go now can I just point out
that<00:04:20.509> this<00:04:20.629> does<00:04:20.900> need

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
that this does need

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.959 
that this does need
I<00:04:21.789> believe<00:04:22.789> it's<00:04:22.939> triple-a<00:04:23.419> batteries<00:04:24.969> and

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:25.969 
I believe it's triple-a batteries and

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:31.209 
I believe it's triple-a batteries and
you<00:04:26.030> just<00:04:26.210> pull<00:04:26.449> this<00:04:26.539> tag<00:04:26.810> out<00:04:27.969> and<00:04:30.099> then<00:04:31.099> you

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:31.219 
you just pull this tag out and then you

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.730 
you just pull this tag out and then you
can<00:04:31.729> get<00:04:31.909> into<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.240> which<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.139> cannot<00:04:33.590> at<00:04:33.680> the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
can get into it which I cannot at the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.640 
can get into it which I cannot at the
moment<00:04:34.069> so<00:04:34.280> spare<00:04:35.270> with<00:04:35.449> me<00:04:35.599> but<00:04:36.439> what<00:04:36.590> I'm

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
moment so spare with me but what I'm

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.540 
moment so spare with me but what I'm
going<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.830> do<00:04:36.979> is<00:04:37.069> I'm<00:04:37.159> going<00:04:37.189> to<00:04:37.370> leave<00:04:37.520> that

going to do is I'm going to leave that
take<00:04:38.000> my<00:04:38.120> wire<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.599> is<00:04:38.750> triple-a<00:04:39.289> batteries

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
take my wire it is triple-a batteries

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.570 
take my wire it is triple-a batteries
