00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 the ecclesiastes book or the preacher 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.990
 chapter 1 words of the son preacher 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.480
 of David King of Jerusalem Vanity of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.150
 vanities said the vanity preacher of 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.039
 vanities everything is vanity what profit 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.740
 has the man all his work with 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.320
 that is busy under the sun generation 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.289
 goes and generation comes over the earth 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.330
 the sun always comes out and it gets 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.179
 the sun and rushes back to the place 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.030
 from where the wind rises pull towards 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.399
 the south and it surrounds to the north it goes turning of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.760
 continuous and its turns turns the wind 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.070
 again the rivers all go to the sea and the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.290
 sea ​​is not filled to the place where the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.379
 rivers came there they go back to run 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.969
 again all things are fatiguing 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.239
 more than what man can express 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.449
 never satiate the eye to see nor the ear 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.390
 to hear is what it was the same as 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.199
 what is the same thing that has been done 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.149
 it will be done in nothing and new under the sun 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.760
 there is something of what can be said here 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 this is new it was already in the centuries that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.450
 they have preceded us 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.520
 there is no memory of what preceded or 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.280
 neither of what will happen there will be memory 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.230
 in which will be after I the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 preacher was king over israel in 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.450
 jerusalem and from my heart to inquire and to 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.970
 search with wisdom about everything that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.800
 it is done under the sky this painful 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 work of hatred to the children of the 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.900
 men so that they take care of him look 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.810
 all the works that are done under the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.750
 sun and here all this is vanity and 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.210
 affliction of spirit what is twisted is not 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.120
 can right and the incomplete can not 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.640
 to be counted I speak in my heart saying 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.650
 behold, I am magnified and I have grown 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.560
 in wisdom about all who were 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.619
 before me in Jerusalem and my heart has 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.300
 perceived a lot of wisdom and science and 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.550
 dedicate my heart to know the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.280
 wisdom and also to understand the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.010
 madness and the ravings I knew that still 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.800
 this was affliction of spirit because in 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.990
 the much wisdom there is much annoyance and 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.990
 who adds science adds pain
