you<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.560> could<00:00:22.710> use<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.010> regular

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
you just you could use this regular

paper if you want to but paper towels
work<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.340> lot<00:00:26.460> better

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.340 

silicone<00:00:31.810> in<00:00:32.230> a<00:00:32.380> spray<00:00:32.590> can<00:00:32.940> hmm<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:35.050> is<00:00:35.200> the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
silicone in a spray can hmm this is the

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.060 
silicone in a spray can hmm this is the
best<00:00:35.530> lubrication<00:00:36.540> product<00:00:37.540> there<00:00:37.900> is<00:00:38.170> you

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
best lubrication product there is you

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.040 
best lubrication product there is you
can<00:00:39.130> use<00:00:39.340> other<00:00:39.670> things<00:00:40.090> but<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.540> doesn't<00:00:40.900> work

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
can use other things but it doesn't work

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.770 
can use other things but it doesn't work
as<00:00:41.290> well<00:00:41.320> at<00:00:41.950> silicon<00:00:42.610> I<00:00:42.820> started<00:00:43.210> out<00:00:43.390> with

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
as well at silicon I started out with

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.920 
as well at silicon I started out with
just<00:00:45.690> patrolling<00:00:46.690> them<00:00:46.960> gel<00:00:47.860> or<00:00:48.100> Vaseline<00:00:49.090> and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
just patrolling them gel or Vaseline and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.570 
just patrolling them gel or Vaseline and
I<00:00:50.050> put<00:00:50.260> it<00:00:50.350> in<00:00:50.470> there<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:50.860> it<00:00:50.950> helped<00:00:51.190> it

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
I put it in there and it helped it

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.160 
I put it in there and it helped it
smooths<00:00:52.360> out<00:00:52.660> but<00:00:53.230> not<00:00:53.410> as<00:00:53.620> much<00:00:53.770> silicone<00:00:54.309> did

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
smooths out but not as much silicone did

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.560 
smooths out but not as much silicone did
so<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.200> recommend<00:00:56.680> using<00:00:57.360> silicone<00:00:58.360> in<00:00:58.480> the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
so I recommend using silicone in the

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.110 
so I recommend using silicone in the
spray<00:00:58.809> can<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.350> get<00:00:59.890> anywhere<00:01:00.340> near<00:01:00.580> any

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
spray can and get anywhere near any

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.380 
spray can and get anywhere near any
hardware<00:01:01.480> store<00:01:01.629> I<00:01:02.170> got<00:01:02.410> this<00:01:02.530> at<00:01:02.680> Walmart<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
hardware store I got this at Walmart so

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.060 
hardware store I got this at Walmart so
just<00:01:05.080> about<00:01:05.260> anywhere<00:01:05.650> that<00:01:05.830> there's<00:01:05.920> an

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
just about anywhere that there's an

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.820 
just about anywhere that there's an
automotive<00:01:06.400> department<00:01:07.120> you<00:01:07.240> can<00:01:07.390> find

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
automotive department you can find

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.649 
automotive department you can find
Scylla<00:01:08.830> coding<00:01:09.159> this<00:01:09.280> break-in<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.540> what<00:01:13.540> you

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
Scylla coding this break-in so what you

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.020 
Scylla coding this break-in so what you
want<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.840> do<00:01:13.900> first<00:01:14.140> is<00:01:15.000> disassemble<00:01:16.000> your

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
want to do first is disassemble your

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.610 
want to do first is disassemble your
cube<00:01:16.980> alright<00:01:17.980> so<00:01:18.250> with<00:01:18.700> lubrication<00:01:19.620> you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
cube alright so with lubrication you

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.320 
cube alright so with lubrication you
don't<00:01:20.800> want<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.729> want<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.030> take<00:01:22.180> the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
don't want to you you want to take the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.180 
don't want to you you want to take the
core<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.570> just<00:01:22.900> put<00:01:23.320> it<00:01:23.350> away<00:01:23.500> somewhere<00:01:23.650> for

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
core and just put it away somewhere for

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.890 
core and just put it away somewhere for
now<00:01:24.340> you<00:01:24.790> don't<00:01:24.970> want<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.180> lubricate<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.720> core

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
now you don't want to lubricate the core

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.960 
now you don't want to lubricate the core
because<00:01:26.260> it's<00:01:26.440> rather<00:01:26.590> pointless<00:01:27.040> what<00:01:27.850> you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
because it's rather pointless what you

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.240 
because it's rather pointless what you
want<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.240> lubricate<00:01:28.360> are<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.020> pieces<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
want to lubricate are the pieces and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
want to lubricate are the pieces and
what<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:34.299> want<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.659> do<00:01:34.869> is<00:01:35.170> spray<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.430> thin

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
what you want to do is spray a thin

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.440 
what you want to do is spray a thin
layer<00:01:37.509> of<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:38.020> silicon<00:01:38.439> across<00:01:38.920> all<00:01:39.189> of<00:01:39.610> the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
layer of the silicon across all of the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.620 
layer of the silicon across all of the
black<00:01:40.689> sides<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.490> they<00:01:42.610> slide<00:01:42.820> across<00:01:43.270> each

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
black sides so they slide across each

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.649 
black sides so they slide across each
other<00:01:43.899> smooth<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.180> edge<00:01:46.299> pieces

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
other smooth it with the edge pieces

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.990 
other smooth it with the edge pieces
you've<00:01:46.899> got<00:01:47.079> this<00:01:47.259> whole<00:01:47.530> this<00:01:48.280> hollow<00:01:48.520> point

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
you've got this whole this hollow point

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.550 
you've got this whole this hollow point
here<00:01:49.299> you<00:01:49.990> don't<00:01:50.110> really<00:01:50.229> need<00:01:50.409> to<00:01:50.530> worry

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
here you don't really need to worry

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.800 
here you don't really need to worry
about<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:51.070> because<00:01:51.369> it's<00:01:51.640> not<00:01:52.299> a<00:01:52.329> part<00:01:52.659> that

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
about that because it's not a part that

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.310 
about that because it's not a part that
slides<00:01:53.229> around<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
slides around on the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.940 
slides around on the
so<00:01:59.320> what<00:01:59.440> I<00:01:59.470> do<00:01:59.590> for<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.010> edges<00:02:00.370> is<00:02:00.910> I<00:02:01.800> put<00:02:02.800> them

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
so what I do for the edges is I put them

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.730 
so what I do for the edges is I put them
all<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.370> wear<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:03.670> solid<00:02:04.210> piece<00:02:04.480> is<00:02:04.750> facing

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
all to wear this solid piece is facing

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:25.630 
all to wear this solid piece is facing
up<00:02:05.970> like<00:02:06.970> this

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.610 

I<00:02:25.700> mean<00:02:26.330> yeah<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.960> you<00:02:27.050> just<00:02:27.260> take<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
I mean yeah that's a you just take the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.720 
I mean yeah that's a you just take the
silicone<00:02:28.190> shake<00:02:29.150> well<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:30.280> then<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.459> spray

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
silicone shake well and then just spray

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.710 
silicone shake well and then just spray
a<00:02:31.760> very<00:02:32.060> thin<00:02:32.420> layer<00:02:32.800> over<00:02:33.800> all<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.520> pieces<00:02:34.880> we

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
a very thin layer over all the pieces we

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.059 
a very thin layer over all the pieces we
make<00:02:35.959> sure<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.260> cover<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.709> entire<00:02:36.800> surface

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
make sure to cover the entire surface

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.860 
make sure to cover the entire surface
but<00:02:37.520> not<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.850> put<00:02:38.060> too<00:02:38.090> much<00:02:38.420> because<00:02:38.750> if<00:02:38.840> you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
but not to put too much because if you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.550 
but not to put too much because if you
use<00:02:39.080> too<00:02:39.290> much<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.680> can<00:02:40.040> slow<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.459> down<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.720> hold

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
use too much a can slow it down so hold

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.630 
use too much a can slow it down so hold
it<00:02:42.740> about<00:02:44.650> three<00:02:45.650> or<00:02:45.680> four<00:02:45.860> inches<00:02:46.190> away<00:02:46.490> from

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
it about three or four inches away from

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.600 
it about three or four inches away from
the<00:02:46.880> pieces<00:02:48.700> right

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
dries and then you'll rotate it and

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.240 
dries and then you'll rotate it and
spray<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.220> other<00:03:23.490> side<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.890> I'm<00:03:25.890> going<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.070> cut

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
spray the other side so I'm going to cut

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.820 
spray the other side so I'm going to cut
for<00:03:26.400> about<00:03:26.550> 10<00:03:26.700> minutes<00:03:27.410> all<00:03:28.410> right<00:03:28.530> let's

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
pretty dry um you're probably going to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.770 
pretty dry um you're probably going to
see<00:03:32.010> when<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.550> win<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:32.910> 1st<00:03:33.090> arts<00:03:33.390> ajar<00:03:33.630> you'll

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
see when you win a 1st arts ajar you'll

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.410 
see when you win a 1st arts ajar you'll
see<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.050> white<00:03:34.290> film<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:35.580> top<00:03:36.060> all<00:03:36.270> the

see this white film on top all the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.060 
see this white film on top all the
pieces<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.900> that's<00:03:37.050> not<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> bad<00:03:37.530> thing<00:03:37.560> that's

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
okay so now you're going to rotate all

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.540 
okay so now you're going to rotate all
the<00:03:40.890> pieces<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.959> for<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.290> corners<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.920> just

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
all right now and bring back the core

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.190 
all right now and bring back the core
put<00:05:18.170> it<00:05:18.260> back<00:05:18.350> together<00:05:18.940> they<00:05:19.940> have<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:20.390> yet

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
put it back together they have it yet

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.800 
put it back together they have it yet
areas<00:05:21.530> have<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.740> Rubik's<00:05:22.100> Cube

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.700 

Oh

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.540 

and<00:05:31.010> it's<00:05:31.130> pretty<00:05:31.340> much<00:05:31.430> that<00:05:33.460> so<00:05:34.460> after

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
and it's pretty much that so after

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.870 
and it's pretty much that so after
you've<00:05:34.760> reassembled<00:05:35.180> it<00:05:35.480> it<00:05:35.690> might<00:05:35.990> seem<00:05:36.290> a

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
you've reassembled it it might seem a

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.930 
you've reassembled it it might seem a
little<00:05:37.880> slower<00:05:38.710> at<00:05:39.710> first<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.430> it<00:05:40.550> does<00:05:40.700> make

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
little slower at first and it does make

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.220 
little slower at first and it does make
sense<00:05:41.150> that<00:05:41.480> silicone<00:05:42.170> can<00:05:42.410> gum<00:05:42.560> it<00:05:42.680> up

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.140 

but<00:05:46.440> what<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.650> want<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.830> do<00:05:46.920> is<00:05:47.100> wipe<00:05:47.490> off<00:05:47.700> any

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
but what you want to do is wipe off any

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.230 
but what you want to do is wipe off any
of<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.200> excess<00:05:49.230> on<00:05:49.920> the<00:05:50.040> stickers<00:05:50.430> so<00:05:51.180> you

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
of the excess on the stickers so you

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.430 
of the excess on the stickers so you
don't<00:05:51.420> get<00:05:51.510> all<00:05:51.660> over<00:05:51.690> your<00:05:51.960> hands<00:05:52.260> when<00:05:52.380> you

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
don't get all over your hands when you

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.810 
don't get all over your hands when you
do<00:05:52.560> it's<00:05:52.680> all

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.670 

and<00:06:00.150> then<00:06:00.480> you<00:06:00.570> want<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.780> do<00:06:00.840> about<00:06:00.960> two<00:06:01.530> or

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
and then you want to do about two or

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.850 
and then you want to do about two or
three<00:06:01.920> salts<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:03.320> then<00:06:04.320> it<00:06:04.440> will<00:06:04.560> start<00:06:04.800> to

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
three salts and then it will start to

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.180 
three salts and then it will start to
loosen<00:06:05.220> up<00:06:05.370> and<00:06:05.640> smooth<00:06:06.450> out<00:06:07.010> this<00:06:08.010> was

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
loosen up and smooth out this was

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.830 
loosen up and smooth out this was
already<00:06:08.550> pretty<00:06:08.760> smooth<00:06:09.560> just<00:06:10.560> cuz<00:06:10.860> I

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
already pretty smooth just cuz I

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.650 
already pretty smooth just cuz I
lubricated<00:06:12.840> about<00:06:13.080> a<00:06:13.110> month<00:06:13.350> and<00:06:13.470> a<00:06:13.530> half<00:06:13.560> ago

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
lubricated about a month and a half ago

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.760 
lubricated about a month and a half ago
it<00:06:15.660> was<00:06:15.780> pretty<00:06:15.990> smooth<00:06:16.290> before<00:06:16.590> I<00:06:16.620> even

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
it was pretty smooth before I even

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.970 
it was pretty smooth before I even
started<00:06:18.200> you<00:06:19.200> just<00:06:19.380> want<00:06:19.530> to<00:06:19.590> work<00:06:19.710> it<00:06:19.860> in

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
started you just want to work it in

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.140 
started you just want to work it in
there<00:06:20.190> and<00:06:20.520> do<00:06:21.150> a<00:06:21.180> few<00:06:21.300> stalls<00:06:22.820> there<00:06:23.820> just<00:06:24.030> a

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
there and do a few stalls there just a

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:32.180 
there and do a few stalls there just a
few<00:06:24.230> long<00:06:25.230> algorithm<00:06:30.650> and<00:06:31.650> then<00:06:31.950> it<00:06:32.070> will

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
few long algorithm and then it will

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.580 
few long algorithm and then it will
loosen<00:06:32.910> itself<00:06:33.450> up<00:06:33.660> and<00:06:33.900> you'll<00:06:34.230> be<00:06:34.260> able<00:06:34.440> to

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
loosen itself up and you'll be able to

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.050 
loosen itself up and you'll be able to
improve<00:06:34.830> your<00:06:34.890> times<00:06:35.190> because<00:06:35.460> lubricating

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
improve your times because lubricating

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.580 
improve your times because lubricating
your<00:06:36.090> tube<00:06:36.710> will<00:06:37.710> be<00:06:37.920> able<00:06:38.010> to<00:06:38.280> take<00:06:38.460> your<00:06:38.640> time

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
your tube will be able to take your time

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.560 
your tube will be able to take your time
from<00:06:41.240> 30<00:06:42.240> or<00:06:42.600> rather<00:06:43.290> for<00:06:43.590> like<00:06:43.710> a<00:06:43.740> minute<00:06:44.040> to

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
from 30 or rather for like a minute to

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.180 
from 30 or rather for like a minute to
40<00:06:45.570> seconds<00:06:46.050> that's<00:06:46.650> what<00:06:46.800> happened<00:06:47.100> the

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
40 seconds that's what happened the

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.250 
40 seconds that's what happened the
first<00:06:47.220> time<00:06:47.520> I<00:06:47.610> lubricated<00:06:48.210> my<00:06:48.300> cube<00:06:48.570> I<00:06:48.780> cut<00:06:49.020> 10

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
first time I lubricated my cube I cut 10

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.200 
first time I lubricated my cube I cut 10
seconds<00:06:49.710> off<00:06:49.860> of<00:06:49.890> my<00:06:50.100> first<00:06:50.340> solve<00:06:50.610> with<00:06:51.120> the

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
seconds off of my first solve with the

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.660 
seconds off of my first solve with the
lubricated<00:06:51.750> cube<00:06:51.990> so<00:06:52.830> lubrication<00:06:53.250> is<00:06:53.490> very

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
lubricated cube so lubrication is very

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.620 
lubricated cube so lubrication is very
good<00:06:55.550> just<00:06:56.550> make<00:06:56.730> sure<00:06:56.760> to<00:06:56.910> do<00:06:57.120> it<00:06:57.210> right<00:06:57.360> not

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
good just make sure to do it right not

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.290 
good just make sure to do it right not
to<00:06:57.780> use<00:06:57.930> too<00:06:58.140> much<00:06:58.350> and<00:06:58.910> like<00:06:59.910> I<00:07:00.000> said<00:07:00.060> don't

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
to use too much and like I said don't

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.090 
to use too much and like I said don't
get<00:07:00.480> worried<00:07:00.840> if<00:07:01.470> they<00:07:01.530> get<00:07:01.860> the<00:07:01.980> little

get worried if they get the little

get worried if they get the little
