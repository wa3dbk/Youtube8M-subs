00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.700

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.599
 doing a little bit 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.999
 late but I will try to install 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.199
 the picture 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:16.429
 all that was happening moment 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.720
 disassembly 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:21.919
 whether something is not parts here's a radiator 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.490
 fans 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:31.230
 TV but now I will explain everything 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:36.290
 in order to start remove the positive 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.930
 the terminal can and minus but it does not matter 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:46.170
 then unscrew the grille on the mounted 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:51.920
 in two lots here tv also these 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.400
 the bolt was bolted and the bumper then 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.970
 pulling the bumper 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.590
 Here from such a creeper here are two 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:07.880
 there are latches later 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:12.930
 rivets that are attached to the protection 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:18.500
 the fender called 2 we take out 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:22.230
 these snaps mean then special 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.710
 unscrew this protection with a key with a cap 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.710
 from bumper 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 it is screwed like that 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:36.110
 bolts and screws do the same thing 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.110
 and on the other hand 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.390
 then pay attention in one place 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:50.679
 The bumper is bolted to the subframe with a bolt on 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.700
 6 I sell the nut is not convenient to unscrew 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:57.640
 the key is to lash the court to keep the nut well 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.520
 unscrewed but necessary after 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.299
 removed the bumper need to unfasten and 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.840
 neatly here are the clamps to the whole 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.569
 wiring that passes here was 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.690
 released but since I have clamps 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.090
 the other side of them can be unscrewed sharp 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.700
 items click a sharp object click 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.470
 over here but since the clamps are turned to me 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.340
 the other side had to pull them out but 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:33.030
 as you can see all the antennae are whole means 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.910
 you can use them again 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.340
 then unscrew the tube conditioner 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:49.109
 the connection is right here 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:51.819
 refueling places refueling spot and here 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.040
 this way you can do all the wiring 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.660
 put on the engine so she doesn't 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.889
 interfered with 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.290
 hereinafter to pull out the TV 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:05.139
 then you can unscrew this protection 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.510
 so that the dirt that flies on the road is not 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:14.530
 got on the radiator me on here it is 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:18.780

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.709
 remove it is fastened with two bolts and 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.280
 three by three 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.639
 TV further unscrews itself 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.540
 TV from I do not know only there 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:34.500
 called beam this here it is tv 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.500
 fastened with four bolts 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.489
 here is this beam here pay attention 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.420
 will i have stayed here not 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.660
 gets out 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:51.140
 will have to drill also this one then 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:58.310
 unscrew this beam itself 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:04:05.700
 it is fastened with 8 bolts 4 on the right four 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:07.319
 left yes forgot to say after 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.500
 removed the bumper need to appreciate 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:16.739
 chip from the left headlight and from the right and also 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.100
 Unscrew the headlight itself otkruchivatsya on here 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:27.060
 two bolts on top and one bolt 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.840
 side and bottom one bolt means further as 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.139
 see i don't have a pit and enough for me 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.160
 it was easy to lift the car 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.630
 jacking 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.979
 and substitute a block of this will be enough 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:50.120
 to crawl under the bottom of the car and 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.120
 unscrew the lower pipe from the radiator 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.110
 also from this position you will need 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.229
 unscrew 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:08.750
 I'll get where it is when spinning 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:08.750
 air conditioner and sensor to it fits 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:19.120
 it is located directly under the whole body 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:22.039
 where do we lay the air filter 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:31.039
 here he is his principle can be removed so he 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:35.210
 I do not interfere so I did not do it after 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:40.090
 how did they remove this beam tv 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.090
 This place goes free 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:47.560
 with radiator only 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:57.830
 means unscrew the radiator 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:58.969
 bolts and rate it from plastic 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.629
 frame 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:07.639
 where the fan is mounted and 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:13.879
 expansion tank required 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:15.159
 the disassembly tool is a screwdriver with 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:24.439
 everyones 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:30.169
 tipped removable and key with 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:33.550
 ratchet 12 may also need 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.699
 hammer knock on bolts 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.349
 from where 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:43.339
 I turned off here because they are very 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:46.460
 strongly stick there are bolts for 6 which 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:53.740
 Do not remove that then have 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:53.740
 drill out they icon 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:02.480
 Here they screwed setups around 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:07.930
 see one bolt into place they screwed 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:14.390
 not broke it keeps fasteners which 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:24.320
 that means that the hood snaps on 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:27.590
 he himself this fastener means so that later 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:31.970
 when installing this beam came up on its 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:35.770
 place since then may be uneven 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:41.270
 closed hood I made two tags 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:45.590
 it's him here and then on site 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:47.860
 here it is exactly the same with the other 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.860
 parties
