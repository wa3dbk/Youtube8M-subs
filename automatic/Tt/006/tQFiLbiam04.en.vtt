going to do blue is the first one so you
get<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.010> jelly<00:00:41.550> crystals<00:00:42.530> known<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.590> gelatin

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
get the jelly crystals known as gelatin

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.580 
get the jelly crystals known as gelatin
or<00:00:45.239> jello<00:00:47.420> looks<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.940> then<00:00:50.940> add

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
now just leave this here to glyco phi

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
now just leave this here to glyco phi
for<00:01:08.250> about<00:01:08.400> 5<00:01:08.820> minutes<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.689> those<00:01:09.810> who<00:01:09.990> don't

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
know what the unflavored gelatin does it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.679 
know what the unflavored gelatin does it
makes<00:01:13.290> things<00:01:14.150> gummy<00:01:15.150> firm<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:17.150> just<00:01:18.150> repeat

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
makes things gummy firm so just repeat

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.350 
makes things gummy firm so just repeat
this<00:01:18.869> process<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:20.070> every<00:01:20.549> color<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> wish

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
to use once this is done we'll start on

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.890 
to use once this is done we'll start on
the<00:01:25.409> next<00:01:25.680> part<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.150> has<00:01:27.390> glug<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the next part now that this has glug of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.890 
the next part now that this has glug of
5<00:01:28.080> put<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> stove<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.909> turn<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.659> stove

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
5 put it on the stove and turn the stove

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
5 put it on the stove and turn the stove
up<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.380> anywhere<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:32.100> low<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.880> medium<00:01:34.400> now<00:01:35.400> we

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
up to anywhere from low to medium now we

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030 
up to anywhere from low to medium now we
just<00:01:35.700> want<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.000> dissolve<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.170> crystals<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
just want to dissolve the crystals so it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.109 
just want to dissolve the crystals so it
becomes<00:01:38.369> clear<00:01:39.710> just<00:01:40.710> give<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:41.640> stir

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
becomes clear just give it a good stir

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.270 
becomes clear just give it a good stir
every<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.829> should<00:01:44.100> only

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
every now and then now this should only

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.620 
every now and then now this should only
take<00:01:45.110> three<00:01:46.110> or<00:01:46.200> four<00:01:46.380> minutes<00:01:47.450> maybe<00:01:48.450> not

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
gumminess now there's always a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.570 
gumminess now there's always a
possibility<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
possibility that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.570

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.180 
as well get a little funnel now put this
in<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> freezer<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.940> about<00:02:48.110> ten<00:02:49.110> minutes<00:02:49.800> or

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
in the freezer for about ten minutes or

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.630 
in the freezer for about ten minutes or
so<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.670> then<00:02:50.730> do<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.600> next<00:02:51.630> layer<00:02:52.640> whatever

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
so and then do the next layer whatever

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.510 
so and then do the next layer whatever
layer<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.180> choose<00:02:54.770> choose<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.830> similar<00:02:56.370> or

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
layer you choose choose a similar or

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.510 
layer you choose choose a similar or
same<00:02:56.820> color<00:02:57.470> skittles<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.250> for

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
same color skittles and you do that for

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.449 
same color skittles and you do that for
all<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.060> levels<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.690> want<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.020> use<00:03:01.459> now

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
all the levels that you want to use now

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.160 
all the levels that you want to use now
throw<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.880> your<00:03:03.000> next<00:03:03.209> lot<00:03:03.510> I'm<00:03:03.780> going<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.050> do

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
throw in your next lot I'm going to do

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.380 
throw in your next lot I'm going to do
green<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.930> I'm<00:03:07.080> putting<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.470> green<00:03:08.300> skittles

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
green so I'm putting in green skittles

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.199 
green so I'm putting in green skittles
then<00:03:10.200> pour<00:03:10.770> this<00:03:11.310> layer<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:13.850> see<00:03:14.850> how<00:03:15.030> it's

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
then pour this layer on see how it's

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.350 
then pour this layer on see how it's
already<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.690> little<00:03:15.900> bit<00:03:16.050> jelly<00:03:16.500> like<00:03:17.060> I'd<00:03:18.060> like

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
already a little bit jelly like I'd like

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.190 
already a little bit jelly like I'd like
to<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:21.150> reduces<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.989> likelihood

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
to do that so it reduces the likelihood

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.289 
to do that so it reduces the likelihood
of<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.100> food<00:03:23.459> coloring<00:03:24.560> coming<00:03:25.560> off<00:03:26.299> the

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
of the food coloring coming off the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.660 
of the food coloring coming off the
skittles<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:28.799> once<00:03:29.010> again<00:03:29.100> put<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.459> in<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
skittles and once again put this in the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.030 
skittles and once again put this in the
freezer<00:03:29.910> for<00:03:30.150> about<00:03:30.239> ten<00:03:30.540> minutes<00:03:30.950> now<00:03:31.950> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
freezer for about ten minutes now the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.190 
freezer for about ten minutes now the
next<00:03:32.370> layer<00:03:32.549> I'm<00:03:32.670> going<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.910> make<00:03:33.060> yellow<00:03:33.840> so

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
next layer I'm going to make yellow so

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.120
