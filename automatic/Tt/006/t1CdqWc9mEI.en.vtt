00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:20.570

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.430
 use the mixer everywhere there 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.430
 such opportunity 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.460
 all mixed all you looks like a thick 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.460
 sour cream but see how it flows 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:57.650
 Now we cover everything with a towel and give 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:02:02.990

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.989
 sweat on the forehead 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.980
 but it 's somewhere around 40 minutes and now 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:47.290
 cover the dough with a towel and let her 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.409

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.890
 remove the towel and what we did 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.690
 here is the dough and now we take our 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.280
 dough 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.280
 unloading slowly on a baking sheet 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.800
 try to make it all centered 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.850
 then a little tweak due to be 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.060
 a little bad lay the dough on trial 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.450
 dough a little uneven lay on the form 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.790
 wet our hands 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.920
 we give them a more rounded look 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.590
 smooth out the betrayed bread form and now 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.740
 cover it and give 20 minutes again 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.730
 climb I built such a 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:44.660
 design and cover with a towel 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:48.450
 let it stand for 20 minutes and rise 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.720
 20 minutes have passed the oven is heated and 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.530

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.680
 him 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.350
 and cover our bread with a beaten egg 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.920
 all they could have done 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:08.520
 bread covered face he sleeps about what he 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:13.980
 beautiful and now we put it in the oven 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:16.350
 warmed to 220 degrees for 1 hour 1 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.440
 an hour passed in the oven; bread was prepared 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.200
 because it rose beautifully but slightly 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.080
 cracks but it had nothing to do 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.410
 better smooth well and now take 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.440
 from our girls 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.460
 wet with a brush well and water to 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.900
 the crust was you soft 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.050
 Now I cover with water and even hear 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.530
 they crackle a little 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:49.190
 500 pairs and now we will cut bread 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.789
 and cover with a towel and give the bread 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.900
 to our 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:58.370
 cool down but it will take an hour you can plan 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.550
 two hours passed 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.180
 bread still warm but I 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.270
