00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that in anyway so if there is in fact we

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.039 
that in anyway so if there is in fact we
may<00:01:05.820> even<00:01:05.909> make<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.270> accessible<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:06.960> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
may even make it accessible if there is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.890 
may even make it accessible if there is
a<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.470> onto<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> roof<00:01:08.270> then<00:01:09.270> yeah<00:01:09.750> the

other than that is basically we went

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
other than that is basically we went
against<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> world<00:01:21.930> painter<00:01:22.350> idea<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.740> making

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
against the world painter idea of making

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.789 
against the world painter idea of making
a<00:01:23.189> generic<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> world<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.840> fought<00:01:25.049> make

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
a generic kind of world we fought make

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.560 
a generic kind of world we fought make
it<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> looks<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.700> been<00:01:26.909> built<00:01:27.330> by

confinement<00:01:44.790> however<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> whole<00:01:45.659> aspect<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
confinement however the whole aspect of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.160 
confinement however the whole aspect of
solitary<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.790> put<00:01:48.149> into<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.540> map<00:01:48.689> it's

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
solitary that we put into the map it's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.139 
solitary that we put into the map it's
kind<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.619> faded<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.340> didn't<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.759> become<00:01:50.909> as

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
kind of faded it didn't really become as

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
kind of faded it didn't really become as
prominent<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.869> thought<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.079> would<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
prominent as we thought it would but you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.880 
prominent as we thought it would but you
know<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.460> building<00:01:53.970> goes<00:01:54.200> dude<00:01:55.200> so

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
know that's how building goes dude so

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.709 
know that's how building goes dude so
yeah<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> whole<00:01:57.090> exteriors

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
yeah as you can see the whole exteriors

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.999 
yeah as you can see the whole exteriors
don't<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.079> believe<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.380> show<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> last

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
don't I believe I show that in the last

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.649 
don't I believe I show that in the last
one<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> hold<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> island<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.390> also

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
one but a hold of the island is also

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.569 
one but a hold of the island is also
done<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.350> over<00:02:01.829> idea<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.399> there's

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
done the over idea is that there's

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.340 
done the over idea is that there's
cliffs<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.149> things<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> eventually

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
cliffs and things and then it eventually

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.020 
cliffs and things and then it eventually
just<00:02:04.560> goes<00:02:04.860> off<00:02:05.070> into<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.399> flat<00:02:05.729> landscape

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
just goes off into a flat landscape

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.479 
just goes off into a flat landscape
which<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.409> water<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.340> it's

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
which is going to have water so it's

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.369 
which is going to have water so it's
just<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.869> trapped<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.349> a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
just going to be like you trapped on a

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.040 
just going to be like you trapped on a
on<00:02:10.739> an<00:02:11.190> island<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.480> next<00:02:12.510> thing<00:02:12.959> that's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
on an island and the next thing that's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.700 
on an island and the next thing that's
going<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.260> be<00:02:13.349> happening

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
going to be happening

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.130 
going to be happening
his<00:02:13.830> redstone<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> don't<00:02:15.000> think<00:02:15.210> it's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
his redstone but I don't think it's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.110 
his redstone but I don't think it's
accessible<00:02:17.130> right<00:02:17.280> now<00:02:17.490> it's<00:02:17.790> not<00:02:17.880> really

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
accessible right now it's not really

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.880 
accessible right now it's not really
much<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.540> share<00:02:18.750> yeah<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.080> not<00:02:19.200> much<00:02:19.380> and

the<00:02:41.130> spawn<00:02:41.400> room<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:41.940> very<00:02:42.090> snazzy<00:02:42.360> unless

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
the spawn room it's very snazzy unless

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.930 
the spawn room it's very snazzy unless
it's<00:02:42.990> been<00:02:43.170> shown<00:02:43.440> before<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.310> don't<00:02:44.730> think

it has this is basically if it says
cells<00:02:48.540> their<00:02:49.130> cells<00:02:50.130> are<00:02:50.310> here<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.850> can

cells their cells are here so you can

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.210 
cells their cells are here so you can
see<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.270> very<00:02:51.510> small<00:02:51.930> available<00:02:52.560> four<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:53.010> them

let's say you want to do an idea even
put<00:04:41.480> in<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.630> comments<00:04:42.110> below<00:04:42.200> so<00:04:42.320> what<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.620> did

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
put in the comments below so what I did

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.290 
put in the comments below so what I did
yeah<00:04:43.010> that's<00:04:43.250> that's<00:04:43.490> not<00:04:43.610> what<00:04:43.670> I<00:04:43.820> do

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.880 

there'll<00:04:47.300> be<00:04:47.330> no<00:04:47.480> jump<00:04:47.840> boost<00:04:48.110> one<00:04:48.440> because

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
there'll be no jump boost one because

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.510 
there'll be no jump boost one because
obviously<00:04:49.450> prison<00:04:50.450> which<00:04:50.570> would<00:04:50.660> be<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:52.310> does

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
obviously prison which would be it does

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.570 
obviously prison which would be it does
rely<00:04:52.970> on<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.150> lot<00:04:53.510> of<00:04:53.860> role-playing<00:04:54.860> though<00:04:55.340> so

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
rely on a lot of role-playing though so

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.040 
rely on a lot of role-playing though so
most<00:04:55.790> of<00:04:55.910> these<00:04:56.000> would<00:04:56.270> ruin<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.660> game<00:04:56.840> if

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
most of these would ruin the game if

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.840 
most of these would ruin the game if
people<00:04:57.500> didn't<00:04:57.710> play<00:04:57.830> them<00:04:58.010> right<00:04:58.160> true

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
people didn't play them right true

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.030 
people didn't play them right true

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
your ideas and we'll stick them in the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.910 
your ideas and we'll stick them in the
year<00:05:02.540> in<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.200> game<00:05:03.440> if<00:05:03.590> they're<00:05:03.710> good<00:05:03.830> enough

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
year in the game if they're good enough

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.000 
year in the game if they're good enough
and<00:05:04.280> if<00:05:04.520> they've<00:05:04.730> gonna<00:05:04.940> work<00:05:05.150> good<00:05:05.540> enough

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
and if they've gonna work good enough

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.870 
and if they've gonna work good enough
it's<00:05:07.010> not<00:05:07.100> pretty<00:05:07.280> much<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:07.550> for<00:05:07.670> the<00:05:07.760> whole

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
it's not pretty much it for the whole

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.260 
it's not pretty much it for the whole
thing

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
thing

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.330 
thing
nice<00:05:08.510> primo<00:05:08.870> yeah<00:05:09.230> let's<00:05:09.710> look<00:05:10.130> at<00:05:10.250> the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
nice primo yeah let's look at the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.620 
nice primo yeah let's look at the
Redstone<00:05:10.760> but<00:05:10.970> there's<00:05:11.090> not<00:05:11.210> very<00:05:11.240> much<00:05:11.450> to

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
Redstone but there's not very much to

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.800 
Redstone but there's not very much to
show<00:05:11.780> us<00:05:12.550> fairly<00:05:13.550> unimpressive<00:05:14.000> gosh<00:05:14.690> you

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
show us fairly unimpressive gosh you

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.420 
show us fairly unimpressive gosh you
know<00:05:14.930> this<00:05:15.080> bit<00:05:15.230> looks<00:05:15.410> like<00:05:15.560> it's<00:05:16.130> been<00:05:16.250> looks

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
know this bit looks like it's been looks

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.920 
know this bit looks like it's been looks
quite<00:05:16.610> cool<00:05:16.760> ok<00:05:17.330> fair<00:05:17.570> enough

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
quite cool ok fair enough

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.360 
quite cool ok fair enough
so<00:05:18.320> this<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.650> like<00:05:18.830> if<00:05:19.130> this<00:05:19.550> one<00:05:19.820> works<00:05:21.370> don't

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
so this is like if this one works don't

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.250 
so this is like if this one works don't
turn<00:05:22.550> off<00:05:22.669> this<00:05:22.850> one<00:05:23.060> basically<00:05:23.600> with<00:05:23.750> these

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
turn off this one basically with these

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.040 
turn off this one basically with these
two<00:05:25.090> we<00:05:26.090> thought<00:05:26.270> it'd<00:05:26.360> be<00:05:26.419> a<00:05:26.450> bit<00:05:26.660> weird

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
two we thought it'd be a bit weird

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.720 
two we thought it'd be a bit weird
well<00:05:27.200> it<00:05:27.740> probably<00:05:27.770> would<00:05:28.130> work<00:05:28.340> he<00:05:28.520> probably

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
well it probably would work he probably

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.860 
well it probably would work he probably
wouldn't<00:05:29.000> really<00:05:29.120> that'd<00:05:29.330> be<00:05:29.510> that<00:05:29.690> much<00:05:29.840> of

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
wouldn't really that'd be that much of

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.720 
wouldn't really that'd be that much of
an<00:05:30.080> issue<00:05:30.200> but<00:05:30.650> as<00:05:30.890> it<00:05:31.190> stands<00:05:31.520> at<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.640> moment

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730
