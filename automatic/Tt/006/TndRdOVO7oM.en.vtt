00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
basically the way we freeze it most

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.680 
basically the way we freeze it most
places<00:00:49.070> it's<00:00:49.520> stupid<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.120> put<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.390> onto<00:00:50.570> a

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
places it's stupid and put it onto a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.790 
places it's stupid and put it onto a
cone<00:00:50.960> we<00:00:51.260> actually

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800
