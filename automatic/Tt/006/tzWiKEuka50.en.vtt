the majority of which is henna so it is
a<00:00:32.009> great<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> use<00:00:32.940> especially<00:00:33.149> when<00:00:33.540> I'm

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
a great one to use especially when I'm

a great one to use especially when I'm
in<00:00:33.960> between<00:00:34.380> my<00:00:34.559> mods<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:35.100> I'm<00:00:35.399> too<00:00:35.670> lazy<00:00:35.910> to

in between my mods or I'm too lazy to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.970 
in between my mods or I'm too lazy to
kind<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.450> combine<00:00:36.660> mud<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
kind of combine mud this is the one I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.549 
kind of combine mud this is the one I
always<00:00:38.399> reach<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:38.910> now<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.690> downside<00:00:40.020> with

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
always reach for now the downside with

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.560 
always reach for now the downside with
this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.489> henna<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.420> you're

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this is it has henna so if you're

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020 
this is it has henna so if you're
apprehensive<00:00:43.350> about<00:00:43.469> henna<00:00:44.340> coloring<00:00:44.820> your

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
apprehensive about henna coloring your

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
apprehensive about henna coloring your
hair<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.690> you're<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.260> concerned

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
hair then you're right to be concerned

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.190 
hair then you're right to be concerned
with<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.579> however<00:00:48.329> there<00:00:48.690> are<00:00:48.930> ways

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
with this one however there are ways

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200 
with this one however there are ways
around<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.460> those<00:00:50.579> ways<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
around it and one of those ways is to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.660 
around it and one of those ways is to
mix<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.079> right<00:00:52.320> before<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.829> use<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.100> because

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
mix it right before you use it because

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.939 
mix it right before you use it because
henna<00:00:54.090> needs<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.600> least<00:00:54.660> four<00:00:55.379> hours<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
henna needs at least four hours for the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.760 
henna needs at least four hours for the
dye<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> release<00:00:56.789> properly<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> number<00:00:58.500> two

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
dye to release properly and number two

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
dye to release properly and number two
is<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.370> leave<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.910> your<00:01:00.090> hair<00:01:00.359> less<00:01:01.020> than<00:01:01.320> an

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
is to leave it on your hair less than an

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.950 
is to leave it on your hair less than an
hour<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> half<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.399> also<00:01:03.329> that's<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.750> same

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
hour and a half and also that's the same

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.109 
hour and a half and also that's the same
reason<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.409> henna<00:01:04.979> requires<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.760> bit<00:01:06.090> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
reason because henna requires a bit of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.510 
reason because henna requires a bit of
time<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.720> mix<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.350> melanin<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
time to mix with the melanin and a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
time to mix with the melanin and a
melanin<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.210> hair<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.840> order<00:01:10.229> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
melanin in your hair in order to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.620 
melanin in your hair in order to
highlight<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.909> denied<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
highlight it so if you denied that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.780 
highlight it so if you denied that
opportunity<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.560> will<00:01:13.799> not<00:01:14.070> color<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.760> hair

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
opportunity it will not color your hair

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300 
opportunity it will not color your hair
so<00:01:15.450> those<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:15.780> two<00:01:15.960> ways<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.560> around<00:01:17.100> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
so those are two ways to go around it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
so those are two ways to go around it
back<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> coconut<00:01:18.630> milk<00:01:18.990> coconut<00:01:19.290> milk<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
back to the coconut milk coconut milk to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340 
back to the coconut milk coconut milk to
me<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.130> actually<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.580> superfood<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:22.110> got<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
me is actually a superfood it's got a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.109 
me is actually a superfood it's got a
lot<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.680> trace<00:01:23.070> minerals<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.670> lot<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.970> Vita

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
lot of trace minerals a lot of Vita

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.030 
lot of trace minerals a lot of Vita
means<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.659> lot<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.990> protein<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.830> lot<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
means a lot of protein and a lot of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.850 
means a lot of protein and a lot of
water<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.759> well<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.960> downside<00:01:28.170> with

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
water as well but the downside with

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.460 
water as well but the downside with
coconut<00:01:29.310> milk<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.479> saturated<00:01:30.780> fat

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
coconut milk is it has saturated fat

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800 
coconut milk is it has saturated fat
which<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.100> make<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.460> very<00:01:32.790> very<00:01:32.909> bad<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
which can make it very very bad for you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.590 
which can make it very very bad for you
so<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.590> take<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.310> used<00:01:35.729> coconut<00:01:36.030> milk<00:01:36.390> in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
so I take a used coconut milk in

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.390 
so I take a used coconut milk in
moderation<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.860> trying<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.189> get

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
moderation because I'm not trying to get

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.069 
moderation because I'm not trying to get
myself<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.450> stroke<00:01:39.810> or<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> heart

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
myself to have a stroke or a heart

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.710 
myself to have a stroke or a heart
attack<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.979> using<00:01:41.430> moderation<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.540> is

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
attack but using moderation it really is

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.100 
attack but using moderation it really is
of<00:01:43.079> high<00:01:43.740> nutritional<00:01:44.460> value<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.869> has<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
of high nutritional value and it has a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.069 
of high nutritional value and it has a
lot<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> protein<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.490> milk<00:01:48.299> normal<00:01:48.840> milk

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
lot of protein in it milk normal milk

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.190 
lot of protein in it milk normal milk
has<00:01:49.290> about<00:01:49.590> five<00:01:49.950> maybe<00:01:50.430> four<00:01:50.549> percent<00:01:51.329> fat

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
has about five maybe four percent fat

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
has about five maybe four percent fat
but<00:01:52.680> coconut<00:01:53.100> milk<00:01:53.340> has<00:01:53.490> about<00:01:53.759> 22<00:01:54.270> percent

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
but coconut milk has about 22 percent

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.230 
but coconut milk has about 22 percent
fat<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> apply<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.820> your<00:01:56.880> hair

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240

you're getting kind of the same benefits
you're<00:01:59.250> getting<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.640> proteins<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.600> trace

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you're getting the proteins the trace

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.020 
you're getting the proteins the trace
minerals<00:02:01.229> which<00:02:01.740> include<00:02:02.130> sodium<00:02:02.670> calcium

b3 b5 I mean it is

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.680 
b3 b5 I mean it is
packed<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.459> finally<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.550> has<00:02:13.790> protein<00:02:14.269> so

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
packed and finally it has protein so

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.059 
packed and finally it has protein so
when<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.930> apply<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.230> on<00:02:15.470> your<00:02:15.500> hair

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
work just fine however since we're

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.280 
work just fine however since we're
talking<00:02:31.069> about<00:02:31.370> mixing<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:32.120> mod<00:02:32.629> or<00:02:32.840> using<00:02:33.170> it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
talking about mixing a mod or using it

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.979 
talking about mixing a mod or using it
as<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.470> mixing<00:02:33.860> medium<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.430> first<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.450> all<00:02:35.510> get<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
as a mixing medium I first of all get it

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.900 
as a mixing medium I first of all get it
out<00:02:36.379> of<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.650> pantry<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.400> put<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.849> a

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
out of the pantry and I put it in a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.970 
out of the pantry and I put it in a
container<00:02:38.299> with<00:02:38.480> hot<00:02:38.840> water<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.500> that's

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
container with hot water and that's

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.830 
container with hot water and that's
because<00:02:40.400> when<00:02:40.640> I'm<00:02:40.730> mixing<00:02:40.940> my<00:02:41.299> mud<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.750> am

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
because when I'm mixing my mud I am

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.229 
because when I'm mixing my mud I am
trying<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.680> keep<00:02:43.129> all<00:02:43.370> my<00:02:43.519> mixing<00:02:43.879> mediums

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
trying to keep all my mixing mediums

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.080 
trying to keep all my mixing mediums
higher<00:02:44.840> than<00:02:45.349> room<00:02:46.010> temperature<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.819> that's

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
higher than room temperature and that's

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.660 
higher than room temperature and that's
because<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.720> don't<00:02:47.780> want<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.290> mud<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.829> clump<00:02:49.129> up

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
because I don't want the mud to clump up

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.880 
because I don't want the mud to clump up
so<00:02:50.000> because<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.569> coconut<00:02:50.780> oil<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.379> sealed<00:02:51.680> the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
so because the coconut oil is sealed the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.229 
so because the coconut oil is sealed the
only<00:02:52.280> way<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.430> can<00:02:52.700> raise<00:02:52.879> its<00:02:53.150> temperature

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
only way you can raise its temperature

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.650 
only way you can raise its temperature
is<00:02:53.780> by<00:02:54.019> immersing<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.829> in<00:02:54.859> a<00:02:55.370> jar<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.940> hot<00:02:56.359> water

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
is by immersing it in a jar of hot water

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.289 
is by immersing it in a jar of hot water
and<00:02:57.079> as<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:57.379> can<00:02:57.560> see<00:02:57.799> it<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.340> effortless<00:02:58.879> use

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
and as you can see it is effortless use

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.210 
and as you can see it is effortless use
after<00:02:59.690> these<00:02:59.870> I<00:03:00.049> just<00:03:00.109> opened<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.799> con<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.040> I

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
after these I just opened the con and I

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.339 
after these I just opened the con and I
started<00:03:01.609> a<00:03:01.700> little<00:03:01.819> bit<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.660> consistency

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
started a little bit and the consistency

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.720 
started a little bit and the consistency
is<00:03:03.410> awesome<00:03:03.859> and<00:03:04.069> I<00:03:04.340> raise<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.700> temperature

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
is awesome and I raise the temperature

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.030 
is awesome and I raise the temperature
as<00:03:05.269> well<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.810> it's<00:03:05.959> kind<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.290> like<00:03:06.440> killing<00:03:06.859> two

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
as well so it's kind of like killing two

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.490 
as well so it's kind of like killing two
birds<00:03:07.069> with<00:03:07.400> one<00:03:07.670> stone<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:08.239> I'm<00:03:08.930> using<00:03:09.290> about

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
birds with one stone and I'm using about

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.460 
birds with one stone and I'm using about
150<00:03:10.430> grams<00:03:10.700> this<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.060> because<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.810> am<00:03:11.930> very<00:03:12.230> very

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
150 grams this is because I am very very

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.559 
150 grams this is because I am very very
generous<00:03:12.829> with<00:03:13.129> the<00:03:13.430> nap<00:03:13.730> or<00:03:13.970> henna<00:03:14.299> and

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
generous with the nap or henna and

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.089 
generous with the nap or henna and
that's<00:03:14.959> because<00:03:15.260> it's<00:03:15.410> not<00:03:15.590> very<00:03:15.620> expensive

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
that's because it's not very expensive

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.129 
that's because it's not very expensive
and<00:03:16.370> it's<00:03:16.549> really<00:03:17.090> effective<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:17.720> whenever<00:03:18.079> I

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
and it's really effective so whenever I

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.830 
and it's really effective so whenever I
use<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.739> kind<00:03:19.099> of<00:03:19.220> just<00:03:19.489> slather<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.329> on<00:03:20.569> my

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
use it I kind of just slather it on my

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.710 
use it I kind of just slather it on my
hair<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:21.349> also<00:03:22.069> I<00:03:22.310> used<00:03:22.579> almost<00:03:23.120> all<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.359> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
hair and also I used almost all of the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.809 
hair and also I used almost all of the
coconut<00:03:24.169> milk<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.889> reason<00:03:25.340> why<00:03:25.459> this<00:03:25.519> is

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
coconut milk and the reason why this is

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.930 
coconut milk and the reason why this is
important<00:03:26.419> is<00:03:26.599> that<00:03:26.739> since<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.340> coconut<00:03:28.730> milk

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
important is that since the coconut milk

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.240 
important is that since the coconut milk
has<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.150> lot<00:03:29.389> of<00:03:29.419> protein<00:03:29.959> in<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.980> hen

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
has a lot of protein in it and the hen

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.030 
has a lot of protein in it and the hen
as<00:03:31.430> well<00:03:31.669> behaves<00:03:32.120> like<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.780> protein<00:03:33.319> in<00:03:33.769> the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
as well behaves like a protein in the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.800 
as well behaves like a protein in the
end<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.579> knew<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:34.970> would<00:03:35.299> need<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.630> deep

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
end I knew I would need to deep

end I knew I would need to deep
condition<00:03:36.290> my<00:03:36.319> hair<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.829> restore<00:03:37.310> moisture

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
condition my hair to restore moisture

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.330

and<00:03:38.169> rebalance<00:03:39.169> the<00:03:39.349> softness<00:03:39.799> after<00:03:40.160> this

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
and rebalance the softness after this

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.460 
and rebalance the softness after this
because<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.209> their<00:03:41.359> strengthening<00:03:41.840> ability

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
because of their strengthening ability

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.289 
because of their strengthening ability
they<00:03:42.620> will<00:03:42.769> suck<00:03:43.130> out<00:03:43.310> almost<00:03:43.639> all<00:03:44.120> the

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
they will suck out almost all the

they will suck out almost all the
moisture<00:03:44.810> from<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.290> hair<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:45.739> it<00:03:45.859> doesn't

moisture from the hair so it doesn't

eventually<00:03:48.139> after<00:03:49.069> you<00:03:49.190> rinse<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.639> will

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
eventually after you rinse you will

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.849 
eventually after you rinse you will
notice<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.569> hair<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:50.859> exceptionally

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
notice that the hair is exceptionally

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.009 
notice that the hair is exceptionally
dry<00:03:52.069> now<00:03:52.669> I'm<00:03:52.910> not<00:03:53.150> saying<00:03:53.389> that<00:03:53.450> henna<00:03:53.810> is<00:03:53.930> our

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
dry now I'm not saying that henna is our

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.479 
dry now I'm not saying that henna is our
protein<00:03:54.500> because<00:03:54.799> I<00:03:54.829> don't<00:03:55.129> have<00:03:55.280> any

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
protein because I don't have any

protein because I don't have any
evidence<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.120> I'm<00:03:56.540> saying<00:03:56.810> it's<00:03:57.079> protein

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
evidence of that I'm saying it's protein

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.470 
evidence of that I'm saying it's protein
like<00:03:57.889> meaning<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.700> results<00:03:59.180> you<00:03:59.269> get<00:03:59.419> from

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
like meaning the results you get from

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.449 
like meaning the results you get from
using<00:04:00.019> henna<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.650> which<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.280> highest

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
using henna of which is the highest

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
concentration in these are in this

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.740 
concentration in these are in this
package<00:04:04.129> is<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:05.060> hair<00:04:05.269> is<00:04:05.299> going<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.599> be

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
package is that the hair is going to be

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.319 
package is that the hair is going to be
very<00:04:06.049> dry<00:04:06.379> almost<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:07.069> same<00:04:07.310> as<00:04:07.579> how<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.000> feel

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
very dry almost the same as how you feel

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.199 
very dry almost the same as how you feel
after<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:08.780> rinse<00:04:08.989> like<00:04:09.349> me<00:04:09.590> after<00:04:10.129> G<00:04:10.730> two-step

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
after you rinse like me after G two-step

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.970 
after you rinse like me after G two-step
I<00:04:11.389> think<00:04:11.569> it's<00:04:11.690> called<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.199> like<00:04:12.530> that<00:04:12.769> it's

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
I think it's called it's like that it's

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.890 
I think it's called it's like that it's
very<00:04:13.069> very<00:04:13.519> hard<00:04:13.819> so<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.150> need<00:04:14.419> to<00:04:14.599> rebalance

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
very very hard so you need to rebalance

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.050 
very very hard so you need to rebalance
the<00:04:15.260> moisture<00:04:15.829> after<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.340> do<00:04:16.519> this<00:04:16.729> treatment

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
the moisture after you do this treatment

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.390 
the moisture after you do this treatment
but<00:04:17.840> aside<00:04:18.109> from<00:04:18.169> that<00:04:18.530> coconut<00:04:18.799> milk<00:04:19.220> is

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
but aside from that coconut milk is

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.130 
but aside from that coconut milk is
really<00:04:19.729> exceptional<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.479> one<00:04:20.690> of<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.930> things

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
really exceptional and one of the things

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.469 
really exceptional and one of the things
you'll<00:04:21.349> notice<00:04:21.739> it<00:04:21.979> is<00:04:22.099> it<00:04:22.640> will<00:04:22.849> make<00:04:22.880> the

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
you'll notice it is it will make the

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.840 
you'll notice it is it will make the
application<00:04:23.719> a<00:04:24.409> whole

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
application a whole

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.520 
application a whole
lot<00:04:24.970> smoother<00:04:25.540> I<00:04:25.630> think<00:04:25.870> it's<00:04:26.020> because<00:04:26.260> it<00:04:26.380> has

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
lot smoother I think it's because it has

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.400 
lot smoother I think it's because it has
so<00:04:26.800> much<00:04:26.980> fat<00:04:27.310> in<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.670> and<00:04:27.850> it's<00:04:28.330> very<00:04:28.420> slimy<00:04:29.020> so

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
so much fat in it and it's very slimy so

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.800 
so much fat in it and it's very slimy so
it<00:04:29.680> kind<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:30.130> just<00:04:30.370> makes<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.730> easy<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.360> apply

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
it kind of just makes it easy to apply

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.410 
it kind of just makes it easy to apply
the<00:04:32.080> spread<00:04:32.560> ability<00:04:33.040> of<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.310> mud<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.730> super

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
the spread ability of the mud is super

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.260 
the spread ability of the mud is super
super<00:04:34.650> enhanced<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.890> this<00:04:36.430> makes<00:04:36.730> coconut

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
super enhanced and this makes coconut

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.080 
super enhanced and this makes coconut
milk<00:04:37.600> one<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:38.020> probably<00:04:38.740> my<00:04:39.010> top<00:04:39.460> mixing

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
milk one of probably my top mixing

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.150 
milk one of probably my top mixing
mediums<00:04:40.480> and<00:04:40.660> even<00:04:41.470> though<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.710> have<00:04:42.130> been

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
mediums and even though I have been

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.850 
mediums and even though I have been
using<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:43.150> herbal<00:04:43.750> oils<00:04:44.110> it's<00:04:44.320> just<00:04:44.590> because

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
using the herbal oils it's just because

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.980 
using the herbal oils it's just because
I<00:04:44.890> have<00:04:45.100> been<00:04:45.340> really<00:04:45.790> lazy<00:04:46.030> but<00:04:46.600> now<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.900> I'm

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
I have been really lazy but now that I'm

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.570 
I have been really lazy but now that I'm
back<00:04:47.020> on<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.680> think<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:48.130> will<00:04:48.370> be

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
back on it I think I will be

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.850 
back on it I think I will be
interchanging<00:04:49.420> between<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.840> herbal<00:04:50.290> oil<00:04:50.620> and

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
interchanging between the herbal oil and

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.640 
interchanging between the herbal oil and
the<00:04:51.280> coconut<00:04:52.210> milk<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:53.350> can<00:04:53.530> use

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
the coconut milk and you can use

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.980 
the coconut milk and you can use
anything<00:04:54.040> you<00:04:54.220> like<00:04:54.340> for<00:04:54.820> example<00:04:54.910> one<00:04:55.330> of<00:04:55.360> the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
anything you like for example one of the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.930 
anything you like for example one of the
deep<00:04:56.170> conditioners<00:04:56.710> I<00:04:56.890> like<00:04:57.100> is<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.370> mix<00:04:57.730> of

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
deep conditioners I like is a mix of

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.390 
deep conditioners I like is a mix of
like<00:04:58.210> coconut<00:04:58.840> milk<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.320> yogurt<00:04:59.920> with<00:05:00.370> a

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
like coconut milk and yogurt with a
