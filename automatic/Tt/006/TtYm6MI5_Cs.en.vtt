00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.229 
console at the moment it's a really big
emission<00:03:43.859> from<00:03:43.980> sony<00:03:44.459> i'm<00:03:44.519> really<00:03:44.879> surprised

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
emission from sony i'm really surprised

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.369 
emission from sony i'm really surprised
they<00:03:45.449> knew<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:45.930> would<00:03:46.079> be<00:03:46.199> an<00:03:46.260> issue

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
they knew that this would be an issue

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.140 
they knew that this would be an issue
when<00:03:46.620> they<00:03:46.709> release<00:03:46.949> the<00:03:47.069> playstation<00:03:47.669> 4<00:03:47.970> and

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
when they release the playstation 4 and

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.629 
when they release the playstation 4 and
that's<00:03:48.690> probably<00:03:48.870> my<00:03:49.139> main<00:03:49.379> gripe<00:03:49.650> with<00:03:50.099> Sonja

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
that's probably my main gripe with Sonja

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.930 
that's probably my main gripe with Sonja
I<00:03:50.669> am<00:03:50.849> slightly<00:03:51.750> Sony<00:03:52.260> biased<00:03:52.859> but<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.819> be

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
I am slightly Sony biased but to be

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.360 
I am slightly Sony biased but to be
honest<00:03:54.239> they<00:03:54.419> are<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.870> slow<00:03:55.319> sometimes

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
honest they are so slow sometimes

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.770 
honest they are so slow sometimes
patching<00:03:56.370> stuff<00:03:56.579> like<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:57.030> does<00:03:57.239> great<00:03:57.750> a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
patching stuff like that it does great a

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.689 
patching stuff like that it does great a
little<00:03:58.079> bit<00:03:58.319> especially<00:03:58.829> when<00:03:59.099> our<00:03:59.190> Sundays

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
little bit especially when our Sundays

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.879 
little bit especially when our Sundays
I'll<00:03:59.879> turn<00:04:00.120> on<00:04:00.269> i<00:04:00.299> might<00:04:00.569> have<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:01.199> know<00:04:01.530> 10<00:04:01.859> or

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
I'll turn on i might have you know 10 or

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.210 
I'll turn on i might have you know 10 or
15<00:04:02.370> requests<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.299> play<00:04:03.510> on<00:04:03.660> UFC<00:04:04.319> i<00:04:04.590> don't<00:04:05.040> have

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
15 requests to play on UFC i don't have

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.099 
15 requests to play on UFC i don't have
to<00:04:05.370> delete<00:04:05.639> that<00:04:05.699> three<00:04:06.209> times<00:04:06.540> on<00:04:06.780> my<00:04:06.870> Vita

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
to delete that three times on my Vita

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.860 
to delete that three times on my Vita
playstation<00:04:08.010> 3<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.220> playstation<00:04:08.609> 4<00:04:09.359> so<00:04:09.810> it

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
playstation 3 and playstation 4 so it

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.530 
playstation 3 and playstation 4 so it
doesn't<00:04:10.169> replicate<00:04:10.319> so<00:04:10.980> i<00:04:11.250> think<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:12.389> long

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
doesn't replicate so i think the long

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.509 
doesn't replicate so i think the long
and<00:04:12.659> short<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.079> is<00:04:13.230> i'm<00:04:13.560> probably<00:04:13.829> going<00:04:14.220> to

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
and short of it is i'm probably going to

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.509 
and short of it is i'm probably going to
box<00:04:15.090> up<00:04:15.269> my<00:04:15.299> playstation<00:04:15.840> 3<00:04:16.349> and<00:04:16.380> just<00:04:17.220> have<00:04:17.370> my

xbox 360 and another massive

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.990 
xbox 360 and another massive
contributing<00:04:20.070> factor<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.609> it's<00:04:20.729> one<00:04:20.849> of
