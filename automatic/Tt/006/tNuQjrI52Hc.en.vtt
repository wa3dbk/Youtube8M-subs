hey<00:00:00.390> guys<00:00:00.840> imagine<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.560> disaster<00:00:02.040> situation

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hey guys imagine a disaster situation

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.160 
hey guys imagine a disaster situation
that's<00:00:02.730> so<00:00:02.909> dangerous<00:00:03.360> we<00:00:03.570> can't<00:00:03.840> send<00:00:04.020> people

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
that's so dangerous we can't send people

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.990 
that's so dangerous we can't send people
in<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.440> fix<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.830> problem<00:00:05.190> so<00:00:05.670> what<00:00:05.759> do<00:00:05.819> you<00:00:05.910> do

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
in to fix the problem so what do you do

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.299 
in to fix the problem so what do you do
about<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.270> well<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.290> Robo<00:00:07.589> simian<00:00:07.950> and

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
about that well this is Robo simian and

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.680 
about that well this is Robo simian and
that's<00:00:08.429> exactly<00:00:08.670> what<00:00:08.940> he's<00:00:09.059> designed<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.540> do

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
that's exactly what he's designed to do

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.570 
that's exactly what he's designed to do
we're<00:00:10.260> gonna<00:00:10.380> talk<00:00:10.559> all<00:00:10.769> about<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.370> this

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
we're gonna talk all about that on this

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:20.740 
we're gonna talk all about that on this
episode<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.059> crazy<00:00:12.450> engineering

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750

he's leading the charge here on the Robo
simian<00:00:24.570> project<00:00:24.990> hey<00:00:25.260> Brett<00:00:25.470> could<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.860> just

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
simian project hey Brett could you just

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.470 
simian project hey Brett could you just
tell<00:00:26.190> us<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.340> little<00:00:26.430> bit<00:00:26.580> about<00:00:26.640> Robo<00:00:27.090> simian

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
tell us a little bit about Robo simian

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.550 
tell us a little bit about Robo simian
what<00:00:27.810> were<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.960> guys<00:00:28.050> trying<00:00:28.290> to<00:00:28.320> accomplish

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
what were you guys trying to accomplish

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.200 
what were you guys trying to accomplish
with<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.860> robot<00:00:29.100> Robo<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:29.670> means<00:00:29.790> actually<00:00:30.180> a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
with the robot Robo see means actually a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.630 
with the robot Robo see means actually a
line<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.020> limbed<00:00:31.350> robots<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:32.310> we've<00:00:32.460> done

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
line of limbed robots that we've done

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.490 
line of limbed robots that we've done
here<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:32.880> JPL<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:33.480> specifically<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.440> was

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
here at JPL but specifically it was

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.840 
here at JPL but specifically it was
designed<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.010> built<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.670> DARPA

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
designed and built for the DARPA

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.820 
designed and built for the DARPA
Robotics<00:00:36.059> Challenge<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:37.350> disaster

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
Robotics Challenge it's disaster

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.010 
Robotics Challenge it's disaster
response<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.430> life-saving<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> exemplar

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
response not life-saving so the exemplar

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
response not life-saving so the exemplar
that<00:00:40.379> DARPA<00:00:40.620> uses<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> Fukushima<00:00:41.640> nuclear

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that DARPA uses the Fukushima nuclear

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
that DARPA uses the Fukushima nuclear
reactors<00:00:42.360> after<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.900> earthquake<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
reactors after the earthquake and the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.830 
reactors after the earthquake and the
tsunami<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> lot<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.300> damage<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
tsunami there was a lot of damage to the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.210 
tsunami there was a lot of damage to the
reactor<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.470> they<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.890> needed<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.100> be

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
reactor and they really needed to be

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.950 
reactor and they really needed to be
able<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.400> get<00:00:47.550> inside<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> few<00:00:48.930> things

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
able to get inside and do a few things

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.479 
able to get inside and do a few things
that<00:00:49.350> would<00:00:49.410> made<00:00:49.620> everything<00:00:49.920> better<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.400> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
that would made everything better and it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.710 
that would made everything better and it
could<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:50.909> simple<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.300> flipping<00:00:51.540> a<00:00:51.690> switch

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
could be as simple as flipping a switch

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.470 
could be as simple as flipping a switch
or<00:00:52.470> turning<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.769> valve<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.610> JPL<00:00:54.150> is<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.420> of

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
or turning a valve so JPL is kind of

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.570 
or turning a valve so JPL is kind of
known<00:00:54.659> for<00:00:54.960> making<00:00:55.140> Rovers<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.519> know

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
known for making Rovers and you know

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.680 
known for making Rovers and you know
everyone<00:00:56.820> knows<00:00:56.909> that<00:00:56.970> Rovers<00:00:57.330> have<00:00:57.449> wheels

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
everyone knows that Rovers have wheels

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.000 
everyone knows that Rovers have wheels
and<00:00:57.900> we<00:00:57.960> kind<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.199> climb<00:00:58.350> over<00:00:58.470> rocks

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and we kind of climb over rocks

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
and we kind of climb over rocks
why<00:00:59.400> did<00:00:59.580> your<00:00:59.760> team<00:00:59.970> decide<00:01:00.269> to<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.510> with

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
why did your team decide to go with

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.119 
why did your team decide to go with
limbs<00:01:00.870> instead<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.290> wheels<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.769> know<00:01:01.830> if<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
limbs instead of wheels you know if you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.649 
limbs instead of wheels you know if you
can<00:01:02.339> get<00:01:02.489> away<00:01:02.610> with<00:01:02.940> wheels<00:01:03.180> wheels<00:01:03.479> are

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
can get away with wheels wheels are

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.000 
can get away with wheels wheels are
great<00:01:03.930> they're<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> most<00:01:04.440> efficient<00:01:04.830> way<00:01:04.890> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
great they're the most efficient way of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.500 
great they're the most efficient way of
getting<00:01:05.190> around<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.820> once<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.210> into<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
getting around but once you get into the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.180 
getting around but once you get into the
terrain<00:01:06.720> that's<00:01:06.960> too<00:01:07.170> rough<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.979> need<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
terrain that's too rough then we need to

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.130 
terrain that's too rough then we need to
switch<00:01:08.370> over<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.850> different<00:01:09.030> method<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.020> how

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
switch over to a different method so how

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.930 
switch over to a different method so how
does<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> robot<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.830> where<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
does the robot know where it is and

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.640 
does the robot know where it is and
where<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.050> it<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.590> gonna

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
where it's going so if it can it's gonna

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.649 
where it's going so if it can it's gonna
use<00:01:13.979> perception<00:01:14.670> systems<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.180> cameras<00:01:15.540> in

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
use perception systems it's cameras in

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.360 
use perception systems it's cameras in
the<00:01:15.720> lidar<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.229> actually<00:01:16.560> build<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.860> 3d<00:01:17.190> map

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
the lidar to actually build this 3d map

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.010 
the lidar to actually build this 3d map
and<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> sends<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:18.000> information<00:01:18.600> back<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and it sends that information back to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
and it sends that information back to
the<00:01:19.110> operator<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.620> operator<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:20.190> decides

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the operator the operator then decides

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.430 
the operator the operator then decides
where<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.940> should<00:01:21.120> go<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.960> even<00:01:22.260> if<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
where it should go but even if it

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.530 
where it should go but even if it
doesn't<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.770> good<00:01:22.980> data<00:01:23.190> about<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.420> its

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
doesn't have good data about what its

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.120 
doesn't have good data about what its
environment<00:01:24.960> looks<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.470> also<00:01:25.650> got

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
environment looks like it's also got

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
environment looks like it's also got
four<00:01:26.400> sensors<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.120> wrists<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.570> ankles

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
four sensors and it's wrists and ankles

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
four sensors and it's wrists and ankles
so<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.410> can<00:01:28.500> actually<00:01:28.740> feel<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.160> terrain<00:01:29.460> as

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so it can actually feel the terrain as

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.490 
so it can actually feel the terrain as
it's<00:01:29.820> walking<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.330> well<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.440> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's walking as well so we have the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.290 
it's walking as well so we have the
capability<00:01:32.010> of<00:01:32.040> basically<00:01:32.610> moving<00:01:32.820> around<00:01:33.090> by

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
capability of basically moving around by

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.840 
capability of basically moving around by
Braille<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.290> exactly<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.010> do<00:01:35.160> given

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
Braille so what exactly can it do given

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.010 
Braille so what exactly can it do given
the<00:01:35.880> fact<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.330> sort<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.570> human<00:01:36.780> scale

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the fact that it's sort of human scale

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.900 
the fact that it's sort of human scale
we<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> robot<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.370> lot<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.640> things

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
we can have the robot do a lot of things

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.760 
we can have the robot do a lot of things
that<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> human<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.510> do<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.410> long<00:01:40.500> as

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
that a human can do actually as long as

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.720 
that a human can do actually as long as
you're<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:40.950> too<00:01:41.100> concerned<00:01:41.400> about<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.640> moving

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
you're not too concerned about it moving

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.970 
you're not too concerned about it moving
fast<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.870> kinds<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.230> hands<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:43.830> end

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
fast what kinds of hands or end

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.170 
fast what kinds of hands or end
effectors<00:01:44.370> can<00:01:44.550> you<00:01:44.610> put<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:44.910> the<00:01:45.000> end<00:01:45.120> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
effectors can you put at the end of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.460 
effectors can you put at the end of
these<00:01:45.270> limbs<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.900> went<00:01:46.110> through<00:01:46.260> a<00:01:46.290> couple

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
these limbs we went through a couple

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.680 
these limbs we went through a couple
sets<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.010> hands<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.360> where<00:01:48.510> we've

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
sets of hands and this is where we've

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.530 
sets of hands and this is where we've
ended<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:49.020> today<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.830> not<00:01:50.160> for<00:01:50.640> dexterous

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
ended up today it's not for dexterous

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.330 
ended up today it's not for dexterous
manipulation<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.170> things<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.800> they<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.250> do

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
manipulation of things but they can do

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.250 
manipulation of things but they can do
most<00:01:53.550> things<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.820> need<00:01:54.090> which<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.480> to<00:01:54.600> grab<00:01:55.020> on

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
most things you need which is to grab on

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.020 
most things you need which is to grab on
to<00:01:55.500> objects<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.280> able<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> pull<00:01:56.700> them<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
to objects be able to pull them with a

lot of force and also manipulate certain
things<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.690> in<00:02:00.930> particular<00:02:01.110> human<00:02:01.800> tools<00:02:02.630> so

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
things and in particular human tools so

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.060 
things and in particular human tools so
look<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:03.870> this<00:02:04.020> arm<00:02:04.230> it<00:02:04.440> looks<00:02:04.470> pretty

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
look at this arm it looks pretty

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.740 
look at this arm it looks pretty
advanced<00:02:05.490> actually<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.970> limb<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.390> actually

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
advanced actually this limb is actually

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.839 
advanced actually this limb is actually
very<00:02:06.960> similar<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.830> yours<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.489> other<00:02:08.640> ways

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
very similar to yours and other ways

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.490 
very similar to yours and other ways
particularly<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.690> number<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.959> joints<00:02:10.229> it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
particularly in the number of joints it

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
particularly in the number of joints it
has<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.950> even<00:02:11.340> though<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.459> doesn't<00:02:11.580> look<00:02:11.700> like

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
has so even though it doesn't look like

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.940 
has so even though it doesn't look like
it<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.510> actually<00:02:12.870> about<00:02:13.110> as<00:02:13.349> dexterous<00:02:13.769> as

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it it's actually about as dexterous as

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.860 
it it's actually about as dexterous as
your<00:02:14.069> own<00:02:14.190> arm<00:02:14.370> you've<00:02:14.879> got<00:02:15.000> seven<00:02:15.390> joints<00:02:15.780> I'm

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
your own arm you've got seven joints I'm

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
your own arm you've got seven joints I'm
assuming<00:02:16.170> seven<00:02:16.470> independent<00:02:16.739> motors<00:02:17.280> you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
assuming seven independent motors you

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.920 
assuming seven independent motors you
tell<00:02:17.909> us<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> little<00:02:18.060> bit<00:02:18.239> about<00:02:18.330> these<00:02:18.569> motors

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
tell us a little bit about these motors

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.270 
tell us a little bit about these motors
what<00:02:19.110> torque<00:02:19.409> capability<00:02:19.890> they<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.099> how

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
what torque capability they have how

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.040 
what torque capability they have how
fast<00:02:20.519> they<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.819> go<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.480> every<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.900> these

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
fast they can go and every one of these

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.660 
fast they can go and every one of these
joints<00:02:22.440> they<00:02:22.769> have<00:02:22.860> exactly<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.640> same

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670

yeah<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.680> have<00:02:39.860> this<00:02:40.010> one<00:02:40.190> little<00:02:40.340> thing<00:02:40.490> we<00:02:40.819> can

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
yeah I have this one little thing we can

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.670 
yeah I have this one little thing we can
actually<00:02:41.120> get<00:02:41.360> as<00:02:41.510> much<00:02:41.630> torque<00:02:42.020> as<00:02:42.140> an<00:02:42.230> f-150

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
actually get as much torque as an f-150

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.370 
actually get as much torque as an f-150
truck<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.940> I'm<00:02:44.000> imagining<00:02:44.209> Robo<00:02:44.750> simian<00:02:45.140> kind

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
truck so I'm imagining Robo simian kind

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.540 
truck so I'm imagining Robo simian kind
of<00:02:45.440> crawling<00:02:45.650> its<00:02:45.830> way<00:02:45.860> through<00:02:46.069> building<00:02:46.459> and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
of crawling its way through building and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.460 
of crawling its way through building and
then<00:02:46.640> over<00:02:46.819> difficult<00:02:47.270> terrain<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:48.050> that's

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
then over difficult terrain and that's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.260 
then over difficult terrain and that's
all<00:02:48.650> happening<00:02:48.890> here<00:02:49.190> on<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.400> earth<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.850> it

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
all happening here on the earth is it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.180 
all happening here on the earth is it
even<00:02:50.480> possible<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.870> send<00:02:51.110> us<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.319> space<00:02:51.530> well

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
even possible to send us a space well

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.130 
even possible to send us a space well
the<00:02:52.400> exact<00:02:52.790> technology<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.630> goes<00:02:53.720> into<00:02:53.780> that

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
the exact technology that goes into that

the exact technology that goes into that
would<00:02:54.800> be<00:02:55.040> different<00:02:55.310> than<00:02:55.550> what<00:02:56.209> we<00:02:56.300> haven't

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
would be different than what we haven't

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.510 
would be different than what we haven't

problem<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.569> same<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.260> yes

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
problem is the same and so yes

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.500 
problem is the same and so yes
absolutely<00:03:01.220> we<00:03:01.280> think<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.700> send<00:03:01.970> these<00:03:02.090> to

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
absolutely we think that send these to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.060 
absolutely we think that send these to
the<00:03:02.600> cliffs<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.959> Mars<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.590> outside<00:03:03.980> of
