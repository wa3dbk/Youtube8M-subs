00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
Nikon Pentax real notice on your sony

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.920 
Nikon Pentax real notice on your sony
your<00:01:40.680> sony<00:01:40.950> already<00:01:41.400> has<00:01:41.730> on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> FL<00:01:42.480> flashes

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
your sony already has on the FL flashes

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.840 
your sony already has on the FL flashes
that<00:01:43.110> already<00:01:43.350> has<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.560> head<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:44.490> that'll<00:01:44.730> go

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that already has the head so that'll go

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.280 
that already has the head so that'll go
vertical<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.450> horizontal<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.050> you<00:01:46.110> don't

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
vertical and horizontal so you don't

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.900 
vertical and horizontal so you don't
need<00:01:46.410> to<00:01:46.530> actually<00:01:47.070> couldn't<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.700> the

need to actually couldn't do the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.730 
need to actually couldn't do the
perpendicular<00:01:48.540> turn<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:49.410> to<00:01:49.470> mount

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
perpendicular turn now to mount

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.070 
perpendicular turn now to mount
basically<00:01:50.430> put<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.820> 45-degree<00:01:51.630> angle<00:01:51.930> like

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
basically put it on 45-degree angle like

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.160 
basically put it on 45-degree angle like
this<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.940> put<00:01:53.940> it<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.480> then<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.870> pull

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
this and put it on and then just pull

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
this and put it on and then just pull
straight<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.730> you've<00:01:56.820> got

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
straight up like that and you've got

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.240 
straight up like that and you've got
yourself<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.260> lights<00:01:58.470> for<00:01:58.590> claps<00:01:58.890> well<00:01:59.130> man

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
yourself the lights for claps well man

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.000 
yourself the lights for claps well man
it<00:01:59.430> now<00:01:59.940> I've<00:02:00.450> also<00:02:00.720> designed<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
it now I've also designed it so that

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.790 
it now I've also designed it so that
when<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.490> collapse<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.320> always<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
when you collapse it you always do it

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.880 
when you collapse it you always do it
face<00:02:05.010> down<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:06.120> I<00:02:06.300> don't<00:02:06.960> didn't<00:02:07.710> want

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
face down like that I don't didn't want

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.800 
face down like that I don't didn't want
you<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.190> able<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.459> collapse<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.300> this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you to be able to collapse it like this

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.869 
you to be able to collapse it like this
because<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.920> bumped<00:02:11.190> into<00:02:11.250> something<00:02:11.580> it

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
because if you bumped into something it

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.729 
because if you bumped into something it
would<00:02:11.970> collapse<00:02:12.180> unintentionally<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.560> that's

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
would collapse unintentionally so that's

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.080 
would collapse unintentionally so that's
why<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.980> always<00:02:14.069> put<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.459> face<00:02:14.670> down<00:02:14.700> when

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
why you always put it face down when

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.030 
why you always put it face down when
you're<00:02:15.209> collapsing<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.500> when<00:02:16.799> you<00:02:16.859> put

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
you're collapsing and then when you put

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.250 
you're collapsing and then when you put
it<00:02:17.129> on<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.730> that

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
it on like that

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.130 
it on like that
it's<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.280> very<00:02:19.489> strong<00:02:19.790> cold<00:02:19.970> as<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:20.959> see

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
it's a very strong cold as you can see

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.229 
it's a very strong cold as you can see
it<00:02:21.500> won't<00:02:21.709> come<00:02:21.860> off<00:02:21.890> but<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:22.700> order<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:22.970> pull
