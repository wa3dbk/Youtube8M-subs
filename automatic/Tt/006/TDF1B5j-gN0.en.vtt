00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.080
 Hello, I want to make a small 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.680
 Obzchchik such a power source then 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:24.120
 have he on 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:29.350
 Exactly inexpensive its current to 1 ampere 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:32.470
 voltage up to 15 volts for power 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:37.470
 small low current electronics 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:43.090
 quite fit that is 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:47.550
 inclusion here is regulated by us 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.170
 the voltage here respectively shows 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.410
 the load that is how much we have 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:58.980
 consumes also he has protection against 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:05.969
 short circuit or overload 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.969
 Then we close the contacts 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.040
 voltage let's say 5 volts 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.250
 we close everything he goes to our defense and 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:25.250
 the red light is on, ie contacts 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.600
 breaks the circuit is restored and the probes 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.540
 of course there is not much 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 so powerful if in time you can 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.740
 will be how to change what else is convenient in 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:47.470
 Probes made a hole that is possible 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:50.630
 paste test leads also 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.450
 quite convenient thing that is possible 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.140
 here are unscrewing pins and 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.619
 connect directly here plus 7x 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.619
 plus and minus 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.479
 the tomato side has it 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:17.370
 fuse in order from 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:22.920
 overload also led him on just 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.860
 return such luck will be enough 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.470
 not bad 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:35.640
 Long thought than you can quickly check 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:40.470
 Only the return of this device and found 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.900
 such a motor that was with the chamber 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:52.190
 already implanted do not reach to 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.190
 do we connect the power to the motor 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.790
 we are starting to spin accordingly 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.480
 already shows 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.480
 some kind of fetish 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.060
 we press the arm of the cartridge here with us 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.860
 already shows 09 more amps 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.860
 accordingly, immediately goes into defense 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:31.640
 the only thing a little bit was he not accurate but 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:34.880
 what's convenient here are dial gauges and 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.890
 there are small regulators that is 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.410
 can be a screwdriver if there is a lunar 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.800
 says either current consumer on it 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.410
 set exactly 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.560
 consumption or voltage that is 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.690
 if there is a good multimeter 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.510
 fairly accurate tol expose also 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.400
 to fix the small arrow 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:05.200
 limits I strongly do not recommend turning them 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.200
 itâ€™s better not to twist them at all 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:15.380
 a link where I bought I will leave in 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:20.890
 the description is pretty good more convenient 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.890
 thanks for watching 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.540
 subscribe leave comments 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.540
 all questions all bye
