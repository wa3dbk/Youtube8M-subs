00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.650
 and then guys all right and I'll more 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 a video and this time saying more 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.799
 video here 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.389
 and that's what I'm bringing here in our 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.510
 Dude, I said this time doing it here. 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.510
 bringing here 36 good but today I am 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.369
 bringing bring back is a texture 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.740
 that the first time I'm going to bring a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.439
 texture in the channel that this texture calls 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.330
 neither discards one is a texture and the cartouche 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.940
 as the name already says, it's absurd as well 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.270
 Nice and I do not really like textures 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.790
 but if it were to play and play with this 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.879
 ok let's start here that you can 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.800
 see there that leaves your minecraft 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.230
 enough room to see the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.260
 Grass layouts that grass looks good 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.910
 different even a very heavy texture 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.250
 People, I recommended that you have a good pc. 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.300
 going out with her I thought it was good but I'm 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 playing good 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.820
 the books here the potions business 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 apavt will give you a modified view 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.030
 She's going to change, yes, I'm late now. 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.790
 So I did a business out there to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.990
 show you how the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.759
 good minerals here is the apex lazuli stands 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.180
 almost almost the same everyone is the gold 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:30.000
 or coal the diamond here at 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.710
 time served pretty good even the network 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.259
 stone is that the blocks are not 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.540
 here the woods woods galley that 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.930
 here from the street aquidauana trunk a lot 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.479
 cool in the middle of a print of I know 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:49.200
 there to make maps montages some is 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.970
 type pixel art with that law came 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.670
 get too much because the type has a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.600
 my black stroke here and it improves 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.380
 improves type leaving scene 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.290
 more relevant the business that most 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.989
 liked it was the lighter because the lighter 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.280
 that time and moving and has a 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.230
 nice texture that otto also I do not 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.120
 I know why the normal minecraft left 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.680
 It's that way it's very weird to the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.290
 animals that stay well 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.209
 bypassed 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.209
 I forgot the name of the game you really want 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.850
 so I forgot, man I have 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.100
 fans to record I would talk about the game but I 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.500
 forgot to tell us in the comments name of the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.430
 game that I forgot 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.530
