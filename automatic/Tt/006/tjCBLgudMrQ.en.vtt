be<00:02:50.880> two<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.180> three<00:02:51.209> years<00:02:51.630> down<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.959> track<00:02:52.140> and

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
be two to three years down the track and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.830 
be two to three years down the track and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
then sure enough the year and probably

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.840 
then sure enough the year and probably
two<00:02:55.170> months<00:02:55.290> later<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:55.860> opened<00:02:56.220> up<00:02:56.370> busy<00:02:56.730> and
