00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
levels which is pretty big nerve

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.520 
levels which is pretty big nerve
considering<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.180> before<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.780> max<00:00:43.079> Q<00:00:43.440> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
considering that before at max Q you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.319 
considering that before at max Q you
could<00:00:43.710> silence<00:00:43.860> someone<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.370> 2.5<00:00:44.910> seconds

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
could silence someone for 2.5 seconds

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.900 
could silence someone for 2.5 seconds
and<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.410> gonna<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.649> 1.5<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.700> all

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and now it's just gonna be 1.5 at all

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
and now it's just gonna be 1.5 at all
levels<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.420> that's<00:00:48.600> gonna<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.170> hard

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
levels so that's gonna be kind of hard

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.790 
levels so that's gonna be kind of hard
to<00:00:49.620> uh<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.600> trade<00:00:51.960> people<00:00:52.199> later<00:00:52.559> on

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
to uh you know out trade people later on

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.319 
to uh you know out trade people later on

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
because especially losing that extra

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
because especially losing that extra
second<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> pretty<00:00:55.559> big<00:00:55.710> deal<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.980> Karen

farming<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.409> getting<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.829> passive

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
farming and getting up that passive

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
farming and getting up that passive
rather<00:01:41.790> than<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.329> relying<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.500> know

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
rather than just relying on it you know

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.679 
rather than just relying on it you know
as<00:01:43.979> soon<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.460> level<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:45.000> moving<00:01:45.600> on

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
as soon as you level it up moving on

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.870 
as soon as you level it up moving on
though<00:01:45.780> too<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.020> e<00:01:46.290> his<00:01:46.680> base<00:01:47.220> damage<00:01:47.520> has

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
though too is e his base damage has

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.600 
though too is e his base damage has
received<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.540> pretty<00:01:49.079> huge<00:01:49.500> buff<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.159> pretty

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
received a pretty huge buff it's pretty

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.840 
received a pretty huge buff it's pretty
much<00:01:50.729> doubled<00:01:51.299> for<00:01:52.259> his<00:01:52.320> e<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:53.579> does

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
much doubled for his e and it now does

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.429 
much doubled for his e and it now does
twenty-five<00:01:54.270> percent<00:01:54.420> less<00:01:54.840> damage<00:01:55.290> when

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
twenty-five percent less damage when

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.260 
twenty-five percent less damage when
hitting<00:01:55.590> multiple<00:01:55.829> units<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.850> no<00:01:57.030> longer

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
hitting multiple units and it no longer

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.539 
hitting multiple units and it no longer
does<00:01:57.630> reduce<00:01:57.869> damage<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.649> minions<00:01:58.950> which<00:01:59.399> is

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
does reduce damage to minions which is

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.950 
does reduce damage to minions which is
kind<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.790> convenient<00:02:00.149> it'll<00:02:00.479> mean<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> he's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
kind of convenient it'll mean that he's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.929 
kind of convenient it'll mean that he's
able<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> push<00:02:01.350> lanes<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.280> faster<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.790> this

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
able to push lanes a lot faster and this

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.819 
able to push lanes a lot faster and this
is<00:02:03.060> why<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.240> think<00:02:03.509> Darren<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.619> turning

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
is why I think Darren is kind of turning

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.859 
is why I think Darren is kind of turning
into<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> ad<00:02:05.939> bruiser<00:02:06.509> rather

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
into the more of the ad bruiser rather

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.559 
into the more of the ad bruiser rather
than<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.439> huge<00:02:08.369> tanky<00:02:08.940> son<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
than the huge tanky son of a

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.479 
than the huge tanky son of a
bitch<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> he<00:02:10.080> was<00:02:10.229> before<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:11.370> they're

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
bitch that he was before I think they're

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.430 
bitch that he was before I think they're
really<00:02:11.849> trying<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.239> get<00:02:12.360> players<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:13.050> build

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
really trying to get players to build

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.880 
really trying to get players to build
him<00:02:13.560> as<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:14.670> more<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.510> carry<00:02:16.230> rather<00:02:16.680> than

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
him as a more of a carry rather than

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.470 
him as a more of a carry rather than
just<00:02:17.070> someone<00:02:17.250> who<00:02:17.430> runs<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.090> takes<00:02:18.330> all

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
just someone who runs in and takes all

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.240 
just someone who runs in and takes all
the<00:02:18.540> damage<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.960> team<00:02:19.200> which<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.530> really

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the damage of the team which I really

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.280 
the damage of the team which I really
like<00:02:20.580> I'm<00:02:21.390> glad<00:02:21.600> they're<00:02:21.870> kind<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.080> straying

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
like I'm glad they're kind of straying

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.260 
like I'm glad they're kind of straying
away<00:02:22.410> from<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.890> huge<00:02:23.160> tank<00:02:23.520> meta<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.060> was

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
away from the huge tank meta that was

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.510 
away from the huge tank meta that was
before<00:02:24.680> even<00:02:25.680> though<00:02:25.770> Garen<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.280> still<00:02:26.490> a

before even though Garen is still a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.150 
before even though Garen is still a
pretty<00:02:26.850> tanky<00:02:27.210> champion<00:02:27.660> he's<00:02:28.170> less<00:02:28.590> reliant

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
pretty tanky champion he's less reliant

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.340 
pretty tanky champion he's less reliant
on<00:02:29.250> all<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.940> his<00:02:30.030> health<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.480> defensive<00:02:31.110> stats

and were reliant on the ad and something

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.270 
and were reliant on the ad and something
you<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.510> build<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:33.810> him<00:02:33.960> but<00:02:34.500> moving<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.010> oh

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
you can build on him but moving on oh

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.070 
you can build on him but moving on oh
and<00:02:35.550> one<00:02:35.670> more<00:02:35.700> thing<00:02:35.820> about<00:02:36.000> his<00:02:36.210> e<00:02:36.330> cuz<00:02:36.870> II

and one more thing about his e cuz II

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.750 
and one more thing about his e cuz II
can<00:02:37.290> still<00:02:37.590> critically<00:02:38.130> strike<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.610> was

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
can still critically strike that was

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.310 
can still critically strike that was
actually<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.180> added<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.750> few<00:02:39.900> days<00:02:40.020> ago<00:02:40.170> to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
actually just added a few days ago to

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.660 
actually just added a few days ago to
the<00:02:40.470> PBE<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.010> they<00:02:41.070> took<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.280> off<00:02:41.460> for<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the PBE and they took it off for a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.180 
the PBE and they took it off for a
little<00:02:41.820> while<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.930> noticed<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.740> lot<00:02:44.010> when

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
little while and I noticed it a lot when

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.160 
little while and I noticed it a lot when
I<00:02:44.250> first<00:02:44.490> started<00:02:44.790> playing<00:02:44.940> because<00:02:45.480> I'm<00:02:45.870> so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
I first started playing because I'm so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.510 
I first started playing because I'm so
used<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.590> being<00:02:46.740> able<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.980> crit<00:02:47.250> with<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.490> E

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
used to being able to crit with the E

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.790 
used to being able to crit with the E
and<00:02:47.910> E<00:02:48.360> no<00:02:48.480> building<00:02:48.780> infinity<00:02:49.290> edge<00:02:49.470> and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
and E no building infinity edge and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.320 
and E no building infinity edge and
other<00:02:50.010> great<00:02:50.550> items<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:51.030> would<00:02:51.090> definitely

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
other great items that would definitely

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.060 
other great items that would definitely
help<00:02:51.510> out<00:02:51.720> Garen<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.260> wasn't<00:02:52.680> able<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.890> do<00:02:52.950> that

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
help out Garen I wasn't able to do that

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.710 
help out Garen I wasn't able to do that
at<00:02:53.190> first<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:53.880> that's<00:02:54.030> why<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.300> won't<00:02:54.510> see

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
at first and so that's why you won't see

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.090 
at first and so that's why you won't see
me<00:02:54.810> crit<00:02:55.020> in<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.230> video<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:55.560> they<00:02:55.680> did<00:02:55.890> add

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
me crit in this video but they did add

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.250 
me crit in this video but they did add
that<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.060> few<00:02:57.090> days<00:02:57.300> ago<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.080> that's

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
that just a few days ago so that's

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.680 
that just a few days ago so that's
pretty<00:02:58.470> awesome<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:59.370> finally<00:02:59.610> his<00:03:00.030> art<00:03:00.390> was

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
pretty awesome but finally his art was

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.420 
pretty awesome but finally his art was
the<00:03:00.900> last<00:03:01.110> thing<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.410> was<00:03:01.680> changed<00:03:02.130> his<00:03:02.280> new

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the last thing that was changed his new

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.060 
the last thing that was changed his new
ultimate<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.090> uh<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.350> actually<00:03:04.770> has<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> new

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
ultimate is uh it actually has a new

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.130 
ultimate is uh it actually has a new
passive<00:03:05.520> now<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:05.970> actually<00:03:06.390> marks<00:03:07.020> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
passive now and it actually marks the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.450

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
to the villain for every basic attack

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.580 
to the villain for every basic attack
that<00:03:12.660> he<00:03:12.750> does<00:03:12.930> i<00:03:12.960> think<00:03:13.170> it's<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:13.380> one

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
that he does i think it's like one

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.070 
that he does i think it's like one
percent<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.070> their<00:03:14.160> maximum<00:03:14.640> health<00:03:14.790> and

percent of their maximum health and
another<00:03:16.080> also<00:03:16.440> unique<00:03:16.710> thing<00:03:16.830> about<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.220> is

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
another also unique thing about this is

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.400 
another also unique thing about this is
he'll<00:03:17.640> deal<00:03:17.820> true<00:03:18.180> damage<00:03:18.600> if<00:03:18.780> he<00:03:18.930> olds<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
he'll deal true damage if he olds the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.870 
he'll deal true damage if he olds the
person<00:03:19.709> who's<00:03:19.830> considered<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.310> villain<00:03:20.730> so

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
person who's considered the villain so

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.180 
person who's considered the villain so
that's<00:03:21.060> going<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.420> be<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.870> ton<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.530> damage<00:03:22.860> just

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
that's going to be a ton of damage just

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.190 
that's going to be a ton of damage just
coming<00:03:23.520> from<00:03:23.640> Garen<00:03:23.970> salt<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.390> only<00:03:24.750> problem

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
coming from Garen salt the only problem

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.970 
coming from Garen salt the only problem
is<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.920> right<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.580> kind<00:03:27.270> of<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.930> feel<00:03:28.890> like

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
is is that right is kind of I feel like

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.290 
is is that right is kind of I feel like
it's<00:03:29.160> sort<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.430> crutch<00:03:29.700> for<00:03:29.730> Garen

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
it's sort of a crutch for Garen

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.240 
it's sort of a crutch for Garen
especially<00:03:30.750> for<00:03:30.959> new<00:03:31.080> players<00:03:31.380> they're<00:03:32.160> gonna

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
especially for new players they're gonna

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.670 
especially for new players they're gonna
be<00:03:32.459> using<00:03:32.820> this<00:03:32.910> as<00:03:33.060> an<00:03:33.150> excuse<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.690> focus<00:03:34.320> you

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
be using this as an excuse to focus you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.170 
be using this as an excuse to focus you
know<00:03:34.709> someone<00:03:35.190> who<00:03:35.280> they<00:03:35.430> might<00:03:35.610> not<00:03:35.820> want<00:03:36.120> to

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
know someone who they might not want to

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.760 
know someone who they might not want to
focus<00:03:36.360> like<00:03:36.720> say<00:03:36.959> for<00:03:36.989> example<00:03:37.140> you're<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.709> a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
focus like say for example you're in a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.920 
focus like say for example you're in a
teamfight<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.970> support<00:03:39.360> gets<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.750> last

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
teamfight and the support gets the last

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.270 
teamfight and the support gets the last
kill<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.709> don't<00:03:40.860> know<00:03:40.980> who<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.250> go

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
kill and you don't know who to go

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.070 
kill and you don't know who to go
forward<00:03:41.760> because<00:03:42.000> obviously<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.870> should<00:03:42.900> go

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
forward because obviously you should go

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.080 
forward because obviously you should go
for<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.320> ad<00:03:43.410> carry<00:03:43.709> or<00:03:43.980> protect<00:03:44.730> your<00:03:44.940> ad

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
for the ad carry or protect your ad

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.970 
for the ad carry or protect your ad
carry<00:03:45.330> for<00:03:45.510> someone<00:03:45.720> else<00:03:45.870> but<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.680> see<00:03:46.890> this

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
carry for someone else but you see this

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.680 
carry for someone else but you see this
little<00:03:47.190> symbol<00:03:47.519> above<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.090> person<00:03:48.510> and

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
little symbol above the person and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.940 
little symbol above the person and
you're<00:03:48.780> like<00:03:48.900> oh<00:03:48.989> I'm<00:03:49.200> just<00:03:49.380> gonna<00:03:49.470> focus<00:03:49.709> the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
you're like oh I'm just gonna focus the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.530 
you're like oh I'm just gonna focus the
support<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.550> think<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:50.940> gonna<00:03:51.120> be<00:03:51.360> a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
support so I think this is gonna be a

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.750 
support so I think this is gonna be a
little<00:03:52.380> more<00:03:52.500> difficult<00:03:52.769> for<00:03:53.040> newer<00:03:53.400> players

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
little more difficult for newer players

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.830 
little more difficult for newer players
but<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:53.970> think<00:03:54.150> anyone<00:03:54.480> who's<00:03:54.660> like

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
but I think anyone who's like

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.080 
but I think anyone who's like
experienced<00:03:55.530> with<00:03:55.650> garren<00:03:55.980> will<00:03:56.160> know<00:03:56.370> who<00:03:56.940> to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
experienced with garren will know who to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.600 
experienced with garren will know who to
focus<00:03:57.420> at<00:03:57.570> what<00:03:57.810> time<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:59.220> think<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.550> a

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
focus at what time and I think it's a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.280 
focus at what time and I think it's a
pretty<00:03:59.790> good<00:03:59.910> change<00:04:00.300> I<00:04:00.510> really<00:04:01.110> do<00:04:01.260> enjoy
