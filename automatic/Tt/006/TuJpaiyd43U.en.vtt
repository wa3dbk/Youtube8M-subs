second<00:02:11.770> is<00:02:12.330> secondly<00:02:13.330> we<00:02:14.319> have<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:15.610> little

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
second is secondly we have a little

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.270 
second is secondly we have a little
ribbon<00:02:16.209> cable<00:02:16.360> down<00:02:16.900> here<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.440> side<00:02:17.680> and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
ribbon cable down here on the side and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.490 
ribbon cable down here on the side and
if<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.760> look<00:02:18.910> real<00:02:19.120> closely<00:02:19.450> at<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
if you look real closely at it the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.840 
if you look real closely at it the
ribbon<00:02:23.800> cable<00:02:25.110> removes<00:02:26.110> up<00:02:26.349> is<00:02:26.739> right<00:02:27.550> here

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
ribbon cable removes up is right here

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.940 
ribbon cable removes up is right here
and<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.060> removes<00:02:28.360> up<00:02:28.600> out<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.200> connector

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
and it removes up out of the connector

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.580 
and it removes up out of the connector
here<00:02:30.310> sometimes<00:02:30.819> there's<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.090> little<00:02:31.260> sides<00:02:32.260> on

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
here sometimes there's a little sides on

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.520 
here sometimes there's a little sides on
the<00:02:32.709> connector<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.400> pull<00:02:33.670> back<00:02:34.530> this

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the connector that you pull back this

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.350 
the connector that you pull back this
locks<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.130> place<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.610> grasp<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.090> sides

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
locks it in place you grasp the sides

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.990 
locks it in place you grasp the sides
and<00:02:37.600> pull<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.900> sides<00:02:38.140> up<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.590> releases<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
and pull the sides up it releases the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.090 
and pull the sides up it releases the
ribbon<00:02:40.480> cable<00:02:41.099> also<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.530> little<00:02:44.800> piece

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
ribbon cable also this is a little piece

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.650 
ribbon cable also this is a little piece
that<00:02:45.160> falls<00:02:45.550> off<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.970> ribbon<00:02:46.239> cable<00:02:46.569> at

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
that falls off of the ribbon cable at

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.030 
that falls off of the ribbon cable at
times<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.110> has<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.350> go<00:02:47.470> back<00:02:47.620> into<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
times it has to go back into the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.770 
times it has to go back into the
connector<00:02:48.400> with<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.730> ribbon<00:02:49.120> cable<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:49.630> that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
connector with the ribbon cable so that

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.770 
connector with the ribbon cable so that
it<00:02:49.840> makes<00:02:49.989> proper<00:02:50.380> contact<00:02:50.910> now<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.630> will

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
it makes proper contact now this will

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.250 
it makes proper contact now this will
remove<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.140> face<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:54.720> allow<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.780> hopefully

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
remove the face and allow you hopefully

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.240 
remove the face and allow you hopefully
to<00:02:56.850> shake<00:02:57.850> out<00:02:58.060> any<00:02:58.269> coins<00:02:58.750> debris<00:02:59.380> paper<00:02:59.860> clip

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
to shake out any coins debris paper clip
