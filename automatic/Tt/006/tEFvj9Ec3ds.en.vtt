 and when the government to celebrate 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.529
 international year of astronomy three 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.160
 NASA flagship observatory 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.170
 gave a new rotation to the galaxy 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.469
 Russian whirlpool 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.469

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.359
 with 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.960
 these days you must have heard a little 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.490
 more noise about countries than usual all this 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.650
 because international 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.479
 astronomical union unesco 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.119
 have called 2009 the international year 

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.940
 Astronomy Agency 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.720
 but for what reason 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.200
 this year marks 400 years from 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.290
 time when here it looked here 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.500
 Rudenko 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.660
 nike 1609 was held for the first time drew 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.630
 telescopes aren't rich in telling us 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.170
 things that changed our forever 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.870
 view of the universe 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.220
 Kikabidze to mark this new 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.220
 the way of observing was not great 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.250
 NASA observatories united to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.840
 show a completely new approach to 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570
 observations of the famous galaxy 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.570
 whirl or as a story 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.210
 for 400 years the technology lasted almost so 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.320
 same as our understanding of the hall 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.330
 China today astronomers regularly 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.260
 explore the sky with amazing 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.420
 telescopes 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.180
 many of whom see the light of such 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.040
 kind of which galleries did not even guess and 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.220
 accepted 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.490
 the seventies of the last century this 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.590
 galaxy picture swirl made 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.990
 national observatory kitt peak 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.710
 as a result was considered one of 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.240
 the best in their time 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.990
 moreover large telescopes 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.390
 experts carry out the same continued 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.390
 take images with 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.479
 30 space list 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.460
 observatories brought 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.050
 amazing new ways of seeing familiar 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.240
 Objects such as am101 in these new 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.860
 space images 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.579
 telescopes list chandra quiet don 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.579
 sometimes have time 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.059
 combo image 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:19.689
 consists of three different parts 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.579
 spectrum bringing together x-rays apparently 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.649
 infrared rays 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.969
 how can we make a picture when we 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.969
 use the light that we do not see 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.469
 quiet human eye is wonderful 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.719
 biological student who 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.369
 accepts electromagnetic 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.819
 radiation and foxes 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.119
 there are special eye receptors 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.449
 called heaps allow us 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.379
 perceive independently three different 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.199
 the area of ​​the light spectrum will pay 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.199
 red green and blue 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.429
 Almaty all other colors of the spectrum which 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:56.799
 we see no more than combinations of these 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.699
 three years old 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.209
 wholly in addition 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.869
 experts are much more than we can 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.539
 see our sun look the most 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.169
 bright yellow green range 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.259
 and this is not surprising 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.759
 millions of years of evolution had to create in 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.139
 eyes which are the best 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.659
 take advantage of 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.639
 sun radiation range 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.899
 iphone if people evolved 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.999
 near the cold star their visible 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.919
 the light would turn on the one we call 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.549
 infrared 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.249
 they could probably be considered incited 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:30.950
 as we are 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.020
 but in reality their red blue 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.260
 greens would be completely different from 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.980
 ours so why not use 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.150
 technology to devote a little and 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.459
 our colors 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.929
 15 a consequence of how our eyes work 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:44.739
 we can separate each color 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.369
 image on red green blue 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.589
 Components 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:50.539
 but what we can show in principle 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.539
 can come from any part of the spectrum 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.829
 i.e 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.089
 for example this is a whirlpool galaxy photo 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.969
 spitzer contains for any just 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.969
 infrared spectrum 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.659
 but the figure is in colors that 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.489
 understandable to man 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.559
 go away we'll do the same with this photo 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:11.689
 telescope chandra but in this case as 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:12.699
 source used 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.359
 x-ray target to 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.259
 which we see here means something 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.259
 completely different from photos 530 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.490
 sometimes such a photo 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.050
 called an image 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.210
 fake colors that makes you think about 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.520
 what a fake 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.150
 This is true 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.629
 but it is better to assume that this is a conditional flower 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.020
 that replace real chaos 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 which we cannot move 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.599
 for example we could say that 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.529
 Naturally in colors, we are with him so that one 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.369
 ahalkalak since he is more or less 

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:47.939
 20 appears as ours see them 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.279
 eyes of color taking into account that we are 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:51.839
 we can actually see something 

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:54.629
 so tiny and dull 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.599
 later new snapshot goes even further 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:58.819
 combining all mentioned 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.990
 results in one 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.749
 blue indicated x-rays 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:07.309
 red infrared 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:09.659
 but apparently the light is marked yellow gave 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.239
 in which turn is 

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:13.999
 combination of green and red is not accurate 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:16.039
 a formula that would indicate exactly 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.929
 attribute these colors in this case 

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:20.039
 come into play with science and art and 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.039
 aesthetics nasa 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.999
 we could change a little different 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:27.839
 quotes presenting these results 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.409
 markevich 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.319
 scales this version emphasize 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.050
 different properties and possesses 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.099
 certain visual 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.719
 exposure some people could 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.779
 would think that it is even better despite 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.099
 the fact that it shows the same 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.610
 data 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.710
 Corr 400 years ago, all that could be 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.830
 Galileo to explore the sky is 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.960
 little brackets big curiosity 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.900
 today heaven is only 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.530
 in a few mouse clicks much more 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.770
 rich color palette than galilee 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.400
 may be and dreams of becoming fathers with 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.449
 Petersburg scientific center I am a doctor 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.410
 Robert to remind you that there is hidden 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.470
 a universe that with a small digital 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.449
 help can see 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.449
 residents
