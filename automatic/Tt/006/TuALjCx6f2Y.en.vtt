shot hook a little tiny guy that's about

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.520 
shot hook a little tiny guy that's about
a<00:00:10.530> size<00:00:11.450> I'm<00:00:12.450> going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> guess<00:00:12.870> it's<00:00:13.049> about<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.290> 1

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
a size I'm going to guess it's about a 1

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.310 
a size I'm going to guess it's about a 1
or<00:00:14.719> a<00:00:15.719> 2<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:17.420> then<00:00:18.420> I'm<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> make<00:00:19.289> this

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
or a 2 and then I'm going to make this

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.380 
or a 2 and then I'm going to make this
leader<00:00:19.710> about<00:00:20.039> 8<00:00:20.430> inches<00:00:20.490> long<00:00:21.000> i'm<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
leader about 8 inches long i'm going to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.920 
leader about 8 inches long i'm going to
do<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> Palomar<00:00:21.960> knot<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:24.480> trick<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.900> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
do a Palomar knot and the trick is to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.560 
do a Palomar knot and the trick is to
get<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.410> through<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> eye<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.939> these<00:00:27.300> small

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
get that through the eye on these small

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.929 
get that through the eye on these small
hooks<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.990> can<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.170> difficult<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:29.070> sometimes

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
hooks it can be difficult and sometimes

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.830 
hooks it can be difficult and sometimes
it's<00:00:30.359> easier<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> go<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:32.719> this<00:00:33.719> way

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
it's easier to go in this way

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.020 
it's easier to go in this way
like<00:00:36.840> this

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.590 

bring<00:00:40.899> it<00:00:40.989> down<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:45.449> bring<00:00:46.449> it<00:00:46.570> back

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
bring it down and then bring it back

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.569 
bring it down and then bring it back
through<00:00:47.110> now<00:00:47.320> that's<00:00:47.530> if<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:48.010> diameter<00:00:48.250> of

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
through now that's if the diameter of

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.200 
through now that's if the diameter of
the<00:00:48.879> eye<00:00:49.089> is<00:00:49.449> very<00:00:49.839> small<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.640> can<00:00:51.820> do<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.059> like

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
the eye is very small you can do it like

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.240 
the eye is very small you can do it like
that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760 

now<00:00:56.850> I'm<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.450> just<00:00:57.990> tie<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> standard

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
now I'm going to just tie a standard

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.110 
now I'm going to just tie a standard
Palomar<00:00:59.220> knot

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.500 

bring<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.810> together

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.610 

not<00:01:10.140> my<00:01:10.290> best<00:01:10.500> work<00:01:10.770> but

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.880 

we'll<00:01:17.190> get<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.550> thing<00:01:17.760> cinched<00:01:18.090> down

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.130 

there<00:01:24.490> we<00:01:24.610> go

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
there we go

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.920 
there we go
now<00:01:26.740> here's<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.100> trick<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:28.270> take<00:01:28.479> that<00:01:28.630> tag

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
now here's the trick you take that tag

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.320 
now here's the trick you take that tag
end<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.490> you're<00:01:30.640> going<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:30.820> bring<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.150> back

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
end and you're going to bring it back

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.920 
end and you're going to bring it back
through<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.690> eye<00:01:31.720> of<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.990> hook<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:34.750> that

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
through the eye of the hook what that

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.810 
through the eye of the hook what that
does<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.229> allows<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:35.950> hope<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.400> stay<00:01:36.610> in<00:01:36.729> the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
does is allows that hope to stay in the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.590 
does is allows that hope to stay in the
upright<00:01:37.240> position<00:01:37.270> I<00:01:38.400> want<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:39.580> that<00:01:40.119> not<00:01:40.390> to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
upright position I want that that not to

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.130 
upright position I want that that not to
turn<00:01:40.900> on<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.860> inside<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.610> eye<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:44.020> what

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
turn on the inside of the eye see what

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.880 
turn on the inside of the eye see what
that<00:01:44.259> hook<00:01:44.470> does<00:01:44.680> now<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:46.000> position<00:01:46.450> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that hook does now it's in position to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.430 
that hook does now it's in position to
set<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.009> hook<00:01:48.130> on<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.369> fish

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
set the hook on a fish

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.200 
set the hook on a fish
it's<00:01:50.980> important<00:01:51.370> to<00:01:51.430> get<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:51.670> not<00:01:51.880> taught

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
it's important to get that not taught

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.240 
it's important to get that not taught
really<00:01:52.900> tight<00:01:53.140> too<00:01:53.440> because<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:53.950> doesn't

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
really tight too because so it doesn't

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.060 
really tight too because so it doesn't
slip<00:01:54.490> around<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.940> eye<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.210> hook<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.890> it's

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
slip around the eye of the hook if it's

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.920 
slip around the eye of the hook if it's
not<00:01:57.130> real<00:01:57.430> title<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:57.880> tend<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.120> slip<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.600> come

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
not real title to tend to slip and come

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.270 
not real title to tend to slip and come
off<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> side<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.710> then<00:01:59.830> your<00:01:59.950> hook<00:02:00.100> will

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
off to the side and then your hook will

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.340 
off to the side and then your hook will
end<00:02:00.430> up

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
end up

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.620 
end up
turning<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.729> being<00:02:02.909> crooked<00:02:03.090> like

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
turning on you and being crooked like

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.350 
turning on you and being crooked like
that<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> when<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.189> set<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.520> hook<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.150> hooks

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that so when you set the hook that hooks

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.090 
that so when you set the hook that hooks
not<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.780> go<00:02:06.869> right<00:02:07.049> up<00:02:07.200> into<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> top

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
not going to go right up into the top

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.680 
not going to go right up into the top

lip of the fish's mouth and get a good
hook<00:02:09.869> set<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.679> may<00:02:10.860> miss<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.100> couple<00:02:11.310> fish<00:02:11.640> that

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
hook set you may miss a couple fish that
