00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:06.779 
which going to take 12 hours and then i

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:09.290 
which going to take 12 hours and then i
can<00:02:06.959> do<00:02:07.200> another<00:02:07.590> upgrade<00:02:07.889> tonight<00:02:08.550> before<00:02:09.090> i

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
can do another upgrade tonight before i

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.460 
can do another upgrade tonight before i
go<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.479> bed<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.099> then<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.670> means<00:02:11.819> we<00:02:11.970> have

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
go to bed and then that means we have

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.530 
go to bed and then that means we have
180,000<00:02:13.470> go<00:02:13.560> left<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.160> some<00:02:14.400> walls<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.940> i

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
180,000 go left to do some walls and i

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.690 
180,000 go left to do some walls and i
think<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.500> what<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:16.950> are<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.430> do

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
think that is what we are going to do

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.330 
think that is what we are going to do
because<00:02:18.420> for<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> rest<00:02:19.410> there<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.740> nothing<00:02:20.220> we

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
because for the rest there is nothing we

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.470 
because for the rest there is nothing we
can<00:02:20.520> build<00:02:20.670> not<00:02:21.060> a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480

105<00:03:39.099> this<00:03:39.459> is<00:03:39.669> a<00:03:39.700> really<00:03:39.970> good<00:03:40.090> rate<00:03:40.410> if<00:03:41.410> we<00:03:41.590> can

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
105 this is a really good rate if we can

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.319 
105 this is a really good rate if we can
pull<00:03:41.919> this<00:03:41.950> off<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.489> first<00:03:42.730> main<00:03:43.060> thing<00:03:43.299> is

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
pull this off the first main thing is

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.030 
pull this off the first main thing is
going<00:03:43.569> to<00:03:43.690> be<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:44.319> get<00:03:44.440> rid<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.829> mortar

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
going to be to get rid of the mortar

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.289 
going to be to get rid of the mortar
here<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:46.049> does<00:03:47.049> he<00:03:47.169> have<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.290> second<00:03:47.620> mortar<00:03:47.919> I

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
here and does he have a second mortar I

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.210 
here and does he have a second mortar I
know<00:03:49.299> he's<00:03:49.480> number<00:03:49.780> he<00:03:49.989> said<00:03:50.290> he's<00:03:50.530> hella<00:03:50.739> five

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
know he's number he said he's hella five

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.280 
know he's number he said he's hella five
I<00:03:51.250> thought<00:03:51.639> he<00:03:52.239> was<00:03:52.359> tearing<00:03:52.660> all<00:03:52.780> level<00:03:53.019> six

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
I thought he was tearing all level six

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.720 
I thought he was tearing all level six
because<00:03:53.590> then<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.889> have<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.069> second<00:03:54.430> mortar

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
because then you have a second mortar

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.759 
because then you have a second mortar
let's<00:03:55.329> get<00:03:55.480> rid<00:03:55.599> of<00:03:55.660> our<00:03:56.019> sheet<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.410> was<00:03:56.440> right

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
let's get rid of our sheet I was right

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.879 
let's get rid of our sheet I was right
there<00:03:57.069> also<00:03:58.030> another<00:03:58.180> one<00:03:58.419> here<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.049> these

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
there also another one here and these

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.589 
there also another one here and these
cannons<00:04:00.400> as<00:04:00.489> well<00:04:00.730> as<00:04:00.879> he<00:04:01.060> will<00:04:01.359> probably

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
cannons as well as he will probably

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.520 
cannons as well as he will probably
three<00:04:02.049> stars<00:04:02.319> base<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:03.579> that<00:04:03.879> can<00:04:04.120> as<00:04:04.329> well

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
three stars base and that can as well

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.319 
three stars base and that can as well
okay<00:04:05.530> that's<00:04:06.190> taken<00:04:06.609> care<00:04:06.639> of<00:04:06.849> most<00:04:07.150> the

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
okay that's taken care of most the

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.830 
okay that's taken care of most the
defense's<00:04:07.840> there<00:04:08.079> we<00:04:08.769> can<00:04:09.250> get<00:04:10.000> some<00:04:10.269> goblins

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
defense's there we can get some goblins

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.589 
defense's there we can get some goblins
going<00:04:11.139> in<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:12.459> will<00:04:12.609> probably<00:04:13.030> take<00:04:13.180> all<00:04:13.449> the

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
going in and will probably take all the

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.930 
going in and will probably take all the
resources<00:04:13.959> which<00:04:14.739> is<00:04:14.919> quite<00:04:15.190> nice<00:04:15.400> as<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.819> can

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
resources which is quite nice as you can

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.539 
resources which is quite nice as you can
see<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.120> that<00:04:16.599> resource<00:04:17.440> count<00:04:17.680> is<00:04:17.859> going

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
see that that resource count is going

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.000 
see that that resource count is going
quite<00:04:18.820> fast<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:19.329> very<00:04:19.570> good<00:04:19.780> i'm<00:04:20.199> happy<00:04:20.739> i<00:04:20.769> can

working<00:04:28.510> on<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.720> storage<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.260> everything

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
working on the storage is everything

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.760 
working on the storage is everything
that's<00:04:30.490> going<00:04:30.940> very<00:04:31.120> very<00:04:31.270> nice<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:32.290> all<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
that's going very very nice so all the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.800 
that's going very very nice so all the
elixir<00:04:33.100> has<00:04:33.250> been<00:04:33.430> stolen<00:04:33.700> though<00:04:34.090> we're<00:04:34.690> up

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
elixir has been stolen though we're up

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.150 
elixir has been stolen though we're up
again<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:36.690> 380,000<00:04:37.690> elixir<00:04:38.110> which<00:04:38.290> is<00:04:38.890> quite<00:04:39.100> a

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
again to 380,000 elixir which is quite a

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.290 
again to 380,000 elixir which is quite a
lot<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.550> we're<00:04:39.850> up<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:41.340> 190,000<00:04:42.340> goal<00:04:42.550> so<00:04:43.180> we

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
lot and we're up to 190,000 goal so we

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.090 
lot and we're up to 190,000 goal so we
can<00:04:43.450> actually<00:04:43.570> do<00:04:43.900> three<00:04:44.260> more<00:04:44.290> walls<00:04:44.830> before

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
can actually do three more walls before

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.970 
can actually do three more walls before
we're<00:04:45.340> going<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.580> upgrade<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.300> cannons<00:04:46.690> and

base<00:04:51.940> design<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.450> don't<00:04:52.870> know<00:04:52.960> where's<00:04:53.170> Otto

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
base design I don't know where's Otto

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.340 
base design I don't know where's Otto
wall<00:04:53.710> so<00:04:53.890> he<00:04:53.950> only<00:04:54.190> has<00:04:54.550> fuels<00:04:55.090> for<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.170> town

Alixe very very good in my opinion ok
let's<00:05:08.500> see<00:05:08.680> what<00:05:08.800> we<00:05:08.890> can<00:05:08.920> do<00:05:09.190> when<00:05:09.370> we're<00:05:09.550> back

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
let's see what we can do when we're back

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.880 
let's see what we can do when we're back
to<00:05:09.910> base<00:05:10.090> we<00:05:10.810> can<00:05:10.990> deal<00:05:11.140> with<00:05:11.230> some<00:05:11.380> more<00:05:11.560> walls

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
to base we can deal with some more walls

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.600 
to base we can deal with some more walls
which<00:05:12.250> will<00:05:12.640> definitely<00:05:13.390> do<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:14.220> yeah<00:05:15.220> we<00:05:15.370> won

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
which will definitely do and yeah we won

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.540 
which will definitely do and yeah we won
the<00:05:15.930> 96,000<00:05:16.930> that's<00:05:17.170> going<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.500> be<00:05:17.620> 30,000

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
the 96,000 that's going to be 30,000

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.500 
the 96,000 that's going to be 30,000
that<00:05:19.150> is<00:05:19.330> 30,000<00:05:20.110> and<00:05:20.230> that<00:05:20.680> is<00:05:21.390> 30,000<00:05:22.390> as

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
that is 30,000 and that is 30,000 as

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.570 
that is 30,000 and that is 30,000 as
well<00:05:22.840> so<00:05:23.380> that<00:05:23.500> actually<00:05:23.650> looks<00:05:24.070> very<00:05:24.340> nice

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
well so that actually looks very nice

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.560 
well so that actually looks very nice
half<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.270> square<00:05:25.960> of<00:05:26.140> gold<00:05:26.680> walls<00:05:26.980> and<00:05:27.570> yeah

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
half a square of gold walls and yeah

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.700 
half a square of gold walls and yeah
that's<00:05:28.750> upgrade<00:05:29.080> Nick<00:05:29.200> Cannon<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:29.590> I'm

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
that's upgrade Nick Cannon and I'm

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.650 
that's upgrade Nick Cannon and I'm
actually<00:05:29.860> that's<00:05:30.190> actually<00:05:30.370> going<00:05:30.670> to<00:05:30.850> be<00:05:30.970> at

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
actually that's actually going to be at

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.570 
actually that's actually going to be at
the<00:05:31.780> end<00:05:31.900> for<00:05:32.020> this<00:05:32.290> episode<00:05:32.560> we're<00:05:32.980> at<00:05:33.190> five

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
the end for this episode we're at five

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.860 
the end for this episode we're at five
and<00:05:33.700> a<00:05:33.790> half<00:05:33.820> minutes<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.270> think<00:05:34.300> that's<00:05:34.600> a<00:05:34.720> good

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
and a half minutes I think that's a good

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.900 
and a half minutes I think that's a good
length<00:05:35.080> for<00:05:35.200> an<00:05:35.410> episode<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.700> base<00:05:36.880> is

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
length for an episode so the base is

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.580 
length for an episode so the base is
progressing<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:38.610> next<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:39.730> will<00:05:39.850> do<00:05:40.780> probably

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
progressing and next I will do probably

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.910 
progressing and next I will do probably
the<00:05:42.340> archer<00:05:42.670> towers<00:05:43.090> because<00:05:43.560> they're<00:05:44.560> so

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
the archer towers because they're so

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.980 
the archer towers because they're so
ugly<00:05:45.130> right<00:05:45.340> now<00:05:45.520> and<00:05:45.850> our<00:05:46.270> tea<00:05:46.450> towels<00:05:46.810> are

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
ugly right now and our tea towels are

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.780 
ugly right now and our tea towels are
really<00:05:47.020> really<00:05:47.530> good<00:05:47.620> I'll<00:05:48.400> just<00:05:48.610> keep

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
really really good I'll just keep

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
level 2 and level 3 if i'm not mistaken

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.690 
level 2 and level 3 if i'm not mistaken
now<00:06:11.230> only<00:06:11.500> level<00:06:11.710> 2<00:06:11.920> I<00:06:11.980> think<00:06:12.070> and<00:06:12.280> we<00:06:12.550> also

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
now only level 2 I think and we also

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.550 
now only level 2 I think and we also
have<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:13.090> wizard<00:06:13.420> I<00:06:13.570> think<00:06:14.170> we<00:06:14.290> can<00:06:14.380> upgrade

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
have the wizard I think we can upgrade

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.440 
have the wizard I think we can upgrade
that<00:06:14.740> to<00:06:14.860> level<00:06:15.250> two<00:06:15.400> if<00:06:15.670> we<00:06:16.860> if<00:06:17.860> if<00:06:18.370> we<00:06:18.580> get<00:06:19.330> the

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
that to level two if we if if we get the

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.750 
that to level two if we if if we get the
birth<00:06:19.630> level<00:06:20.020> seven<00:06:20.350> and<00:06:20.470> also<00:06:20.770> the<00:06:21.010> lightning

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
birth level seven and also the lightning

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.980 
birth level seven and also the lightning
spell<00:06:21.940> I<00:06:21.970> think<00:06:22.210> we<00:06:22.270> can<00:06:22.390> equate<00:06:22.570> that<00:06:22.720> as<00:06:22.840> well

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
spell I think we can equate that as well

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.660 
spell I think we can equate that as well
so<00:06:23.140> that's<00:06:23.800> going<00:06:24.010> to<00:06:24.070> really<00:06:24.220> enter<00:06:24.550> this

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670
