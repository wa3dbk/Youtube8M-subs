00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
strikes the string at an angle if the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.850 
strikes the string at an angle if the
string<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.840> want<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> pick<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.649> come

string is here you want the pick to come

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.420 
string is here you want the pick to come

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
down through it like that or like that

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.260 
down through it like that or like that
this<00:01:48.329> will<00:01:48.570> create<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.140> better<00:01:49.350> guitar<00:01:49.619> tone

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
this will create a better guitar tone

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
this will create a better guitar tone
give<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:51.689> expressivity<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.680> also<00:01:52.920> let

give you more expressivity and also let

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.959 
give you more expressivity and also let
you<00:01:53.189> play<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> lot<00:01:53.850> faster<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.869> needed<00:01:55.969> look

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
you play a lot faster one needed look

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.550 
you play a lot faster one needed look
with<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> left<00:01:57.540> hand<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.899> very<00:01:57.930> important

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
with the left hand it's very important

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
with the left hand it's very important
that<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.610> place<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.829> fingertips<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.990> on

the<00:02:04.770> string

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.309 

so<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:14.300> spent<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.690> little<00:02:14.780> bit<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.020> time

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
so it spent a little bit of time

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.890 
so it spent a little bit of time
especially<00:02:16.100> with<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.880> fourth<00:02:17.150> finger<00:02:17.270> these

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
especially with the fourth finger these

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.720 
especially with the fourth finger these
are<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.140> fingers<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.530> retirement<00:02:19.040> in

are the fingers of retirement in

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.440 
are the fingers of retirement in
election<00:02:20.180> one<00:02:20.780> two<00:02:21.170> three<00:02:21.530> four<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:23.000> make<00:02:23.209> sure

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
election one two three four to make sure

play faster and avoid hitting wrong
notes<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.640> whether<00:02:41.600> you're<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.900> beginner<00:02:42.140> or<00:02:42.380> an

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
notes so whether you're a beginner or an

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.770 
notes so whether you're a beginner or an
expert<00:02:42.770> player<00:02:43.220> make<00:02:43.489> sure<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.450> focus

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
expert player make sure that you focus

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.380 
expert player make sure that you focus
on<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:45.260> as<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.560> start<00:02:46.160> these<00:02:46.550> exercises

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
on this as you start these exercises

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.640 
on this as you start these exercises
so<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.470> first<00:02:48.680> exercise<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.760> aimed<00:02:50.720> at<00:02:51.110> court

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
so this first exercise is aimed at court

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.290 
so this first exercise is aimed at court
and<00:02:51.800> in<00:02:51.920> both<00:02:52.100> hands<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.700> it's<00:02:52.820> basically<00:02:53.180> a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
and in both hands and it's basically a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.020 
and in both hands and it's basically a
very<00:02:53.900> simple<00:02:54.470> alternate<00:02:54.980> picking<00:02:55.370> exercise

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
very simple alternate picking exercise

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.790 
very simple alternate picking exercise
that's<00:02:56.239> going<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.540> use<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.840> first<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.440> second

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
that's going to use the first and second

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.670 
that's going to use the first and second
fingers<00:02:58.190> in<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.910> left<00:02:59.150> hand<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.690> we're<00:03:00.560> just

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
fingers in the left hand and we're just

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.180 
fingers in the left hand and we're just
going<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:00.980> use<00:03:01.420> up<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.630> down<00:03:02.690> strums<00:03:03.620> or

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
going to use up and down strums or

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.990 
going to use up and down strums or
strokes<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:05.320> prefer<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.440> start<00:03:06.860> with<00:03:07.010> up

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
strokes I prefer to start with up

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.660 
strokes I prefer to start with up
strokes<00:03:08.390> for<00:03:08.930> muscle<00:03:09.800> scalp<00:03:10.040> as<00:03:10.250> just<00:03:10.489> but

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
strokes for muscle scalp as just but

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.850 
strokes for muscle scalp as just but
that's<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.450> personal<00:03:11.780> preference<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.410> can

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
that's a personal preference you can

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.680 
that's a personal preference you can
also<00:03:13.130> just<00:03:13.549> try<00:03:13.820> using<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.900> Down<00:03:15.110> stroke<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.690> for

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
also just try using a Down stroke so for

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.539 
also just try using a Down stroke so for
the<00:03:17.750> sake<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.170> lesson<00:03:18.410> maybe<00:03:18.650> all<00:03:18.950> say

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
the sake of this lesson maybe all say

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.470 
the sake of this lesson maybe all say
down<00:03:20.150> stroke<00:03:20.480> then<00:03:20.780> top<00:03:20.959> stroke<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:22.700> it's<00:03:23.180> kind

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
down stroke then top stroke so it's kind

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.020 
down stroke then top stroke so it's kind
of<00:03:23.540> arbitrary<00:03:23.720> where<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.380> we<00:03:24.620> start<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.670> this

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
of arbitrary where you we start the this

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.670 
of arbitrary where you we start the this
exercise<00:03:26.570> but<00:03:26.750> let's<00:03:26.959> just<00:03:27.110> start<00:03:27.350> on<00:03:27.560> the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
exercise but let's just start on the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.400 
exercise but let's just start on the
third<00:03:27.950> string<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.579> G<00:03:28.790> on<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.780> second<00:03:30.170> fret

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
third string the G on the second fret

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.199 
third string the G on the second fret
that's<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.890> note<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.730> we're<00:03:31.850> going<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.090> be

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
that's a note a and we're going to be

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.500 
that's a note a and we're going to be
playing<00:03:32.450> an<00:03:32.570> egg

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.780 

it's<00:03:39.510> kind<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.080> Jostein<00:03:40.830> this<00:03:43.580> but<00:03:44.580> back

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
it's kind of the Jostein this but back

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.470 
it's kind of the Jostein this but back
to<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:47.010> no<00:03:47.580> here<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.790> then<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.150> don't<00:03:51.300> play

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
to the a no here and then you don't play

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.720 
to the a no here and then you don't play
that<00:03:51.510> four<00:03:51.930> times<00:03:52.080> our<00:03:52.350> row<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.740> move<00:03:53.430> the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
that four times our row and move the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:04.770 
that four times our row and move the
hand<00:03:53.940> one<00:03:54.480> fret<00:03:54.750> higher

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.650 

you<00:04:05.780> can<00:04:05.900> use<00:04:06.020> a<00:04:06.050> metronome<00:04:06.470> for<00:04:06.770> this<00:04:06.920> and

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
you can use a metronome for this and

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.960 
you can use a metronome for this and
gradually<00:04:08.660> speed<00:04:09.020> up<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.370> click<00:04:10.610> on<00:04:10.820> the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
gradually speed up the the click on the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.340 
gradually speed up the the click on the
metronome<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.690> should<00:04:11.840> try<00:04:12.020> it<00:04:12.080> on<00:04:12.170> all

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
metronome and you should try it on all

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.660 
metronome and you should try it on all
the<00:04:12.590> strings<00:04:15.220> okay<00:04:17.140> all<00:04:18.140> right<00:04:18.320> well

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
the strings okay all right well

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.110 
the strings okay all right well
metronomes<00:04:19.670> a<00:04:20.530> lot<00:04:21.530> of<00:04:21.709> people<00:04:22.130> ask<00:04:22.550> me<00:04:22.910> and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
metronomes a lot of people ask me and

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.470 
metronomes a lot of people ask me and
readers<00:04:23.540> write<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.050> me<00:04:24.200> about<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:25.480> whether

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
readers write to me about the whether

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.420 
readers write to me about the whether
they<00:04:26.690> should<00:04:26.750> use<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.140> metronome<00:04:27.680> or<00:04:27.980> not<00:04:28.130> and

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
they should use a metronome or not and

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.290 
they should use a metronome or not and
they're<00:04:28.550> playing<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:29.000> they're<00:04:29.090> practicing

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
they're playing and they're practicing

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.390 
they're playing and they're practicing
and<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.810> generally<00:04:30.140> think<00:04:30.200> it's<00:04:30.590> a<00:04:30.680> good<00:04:30.890> idea

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
and I generally think it's a good idea

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.450 
and I generally think it's a good idea
to<00:04:32.090> use<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.510> metronome<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:34.040> should<00:04:34.250> use

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
to use the metronome and you should use

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.460 
to use the metronome and you should use
it<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.910> conjunction<00:04:35.120> with<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:36.050> kind<00:04:36.590> of

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
it in conjunction with a kind of

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.620 
it in conjunction with a kind of
practice<00:04:39.470> journal<00:04:40.280> or<00:04:40.580> assignment<00:04:41.300> book<00:04:41.480> so

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
practice journal or assignment book so

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.180 
practice journal or assignment book so
that<00:04:41.750> you<00:04:41.780> can<00:04:42.050> keep<00:04:42.260> track<00:04:42.530> of<00:04:42.590> your<00:04:43.130> progress

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
that you can keep track of your progress

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.850 
that you can keep track of your progress
with<00:04:44.030> technical<00:04:44.750> things<00:04:44.960> like<00:04:45.050> scales<00:04:45.560> and

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
with technical things like scales and

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.320 
with technical things like scales and
arpeggios<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:48.620> it's<00:04:48.740> also<00:04:48.920> good<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.520> isolate

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
arpeggios and it's also good to isolate

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.690 
arpeggios and it's also good to isolate
certain<00:04:50.540> sections<00:04:51.170> of<00:04:51.350> pieces<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:51.890> songs<00:04:52.280> and

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
certain sections of pieces of songs and

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.610 
certain sections of pieces of songs and
use<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.150> metronome<00:04:53.510> with<00:04:53.960> those<00:04:55.600> the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
use the metronome with those the

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.620 
use the metronome with those the
sometimes<00:04:57.620> it's<00:04:58.040> a<00:04:58.190> good<00:04:58.340> idea<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.700> just<00:04:59.300> set

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
sometimes it's a good idea to just set

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.880 
sometimes it's a good idea to just set
the<00:04:59.840> metronome<00:05:00.140> aside<00:05:00.620> when<00:05:00.770> you're

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
the metronome aside when you're

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.950 
the metronome aside when you're
practicing<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.430> scales<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:01.970> play<00:05:03.040> very<00:05:04.040> fast

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
practicing the scales and play very fast

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.470 
practicing the scales and play very fast
passages<00:05:05.960> even<00:05:06.380> if<00:05:06.590> they<00:05:06.830> are<00:05:07.010> kind<00:05:07.940> of<00:05:08.030> sloppy

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
passages even if they are kind of sloppy

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.410 
passages even if they are kind of sloppy
and<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.200> idea<00:05:09.560> for<00:05:09.890> this<00:05:10.040> is<00:05:10.100> that<00:05:10.340> your<00:05:11.030> hands

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
and the idea for this is that your hands

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.480 
and the idea for this is that your hands
even<00:05:11.720> if<00:05:12.020> you're<00:05:12.170> making<00:05:12.380> mistakes<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:13.370> don't

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
even if you're making mistakes and don't

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.310 
even if you're making mistakes and don't
worry<00:05:13.790> about<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.180> mistakes<00:05:14.570> in<00:05:14.810> this<00:05:14.960> kind<00:05:15.260> of

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
worry about the mistakes in this kind of

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.890 
worry about the mistakes in this kind of
specific<00:05:16.040> practising<00:05:16.600> even<00:05:17.600> though<00:05:17.690> your

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
specific practising even though your

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.930 
specific practising even though your
hands<00:05:18.170> are<00:05:18.320> making<00:05:18.710> some<00:05:19.340> mistakes<00:05:19.730> and

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
hands are making some mistakes and

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.120 
hands are making some mistakes and
taking<00:05:20.150> some<00:05:20.300> wrong<00:05:20.510> notes<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:21.830> know<00:05:21.890> they'll

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
taking some wrong notes you know they'll

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.580 
taking some wrong notes you know they'll
get<00:05:22.400> used<00:05:22.640> to<00:05:22.820> playing<00:05:23.060> faster<00:05:23.900> than<00:05:24.320> you're

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
get used to playing faster than you're

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.370 
get used to playing faster than you're
normally<00:05:25.100> used<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:25.790> this<00:05:26.350> was<00:05:27.350> a

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
normally used to and this was a

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.890 
normally used to and this was a
technique<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:28.210> Sean<00:05:29.210> Lane<00:05:29.450> the<00:05:29.690> great

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
technique that Sean Lane the great

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.710 
technique that Sean Lane the great
guitarist<00:05:30.640> suggested<00:05:31.640> for<00:05:31.850> a<00:05:31.880> lot<00:05:32.090> of<00:05:32.120> players

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
guitarist suggested for a lot of players

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.080 
guitarist suggested for a lot of players
and<00:05:33.200> I<00:05:33.350> think<00:05:33.530> it's<00:05:33.650> an<00:05:33.740> effective<00:05:34.160> one<00:05:34.280> not

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
and I think it's an effective one not

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.790 
and I think it's an effective one not
exclusively<00:05:35.720> to<00:05:35.900> use<00:05:36.080> but<00:05:36.380> in<00:05:36.590> conjunction

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
exclusively to use but in conjunction

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.620 
exclusively to use but in conjunction
with<00:05:37.250> using<00:05:38.000> a<00:05:38.150> metronome<00:05:40.150> okay<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.420> last

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
with using a metronome okay the last

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.180 
with using a metronome okay the last
thing<00:05:41.810> I'd<00:05:42.050> like<00:05:42.230> to<00:05:42.320> talk<00:05:42.530> about<00:05:42.830> in<00:05:43.070> this

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
thing I'd like to talk about in this

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.380 
thing I'd like to talk about in this
video<00:05:43.400> is<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:44.440> use<00:05:45.440> of<00:05:45.470> a<00:05:46.040> practice<00:05:46.790> journal

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
video is the use of a practice journal

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.070 
video is the use of a practice journal
or<00:05:47.600> a<00:05:47.930> kind<00:05:48.290> of<00:05:48.380> assignment<00:05:49.040> pad<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.520> that<00:05:50.510> I

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
or a kind of assignment pad and that I

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.560 
or a kind of assignment pad and that I
think<00:05:51.380> this<00:05:51.470> is<00:05:51.590> a<00:05:51.620> great<00:05:51.980> method<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:53.060> keep

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
think this is a great method to keep

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.659 
think this is a great method to keep
track<00:05:53.840> of<00:05:53.960> your<00:05:54.050> progress<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:55.070> also<00:05:55.190> set

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
track of your progress and also set

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.580 
track of your progress and also set
practice<00:05:56.240> goals<00:05:56.540> especially<00:05:56.840> for<00:05:57.290> technical

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
practice goals especially for technical

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.860 
practice goals especially for technical
things<00:05:57.919> which<00:05:58.190> sometimes<00:05:58.880> are<00:05:59.270> not<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.630> most

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
things which sometimes are not the most

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.890 
things which sometimes are not the most
fascinating<00:06:00.620> aspects<00:06:01.430> of<00:06:01.610> music<00:06:02.090> but<00:06:02.630> they're

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
fascinating aspects of music but they're

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.770 
fascinating aspects of music but they're
very<00:06:03.140> important<00:06:03.740> so<00:06:03.950> and<00:06:04.910> the<00:06:05.710> journal<00:06:06.710> or

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
very important so and the journal or

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.480 
very important so and the journal or
assignment<00:06:08.780> pad<00:06:08.930> can<00:06:09.140> be<00:06:09.260> done<00:06:09.440> with<00:06:09.830> just<00:06:10.010> an

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
assignment pad can be done with just an

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.290 
assignment pad can be done with just an

scales and arpeggios and chords then
another<00:06:35.090> part<00:06:35.449> would<00:06:35.660> be<00:06:35.690> the<00:06:35.840> songs<00:06:36.259> you're

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:41.610 
working on and then a third pipe part
might<00:06:39.740> be<00:06:39.949> something<00:06:40.370> like<00:06:40.400> sight<00:06:40.849> reading<00:06:41.300> or
