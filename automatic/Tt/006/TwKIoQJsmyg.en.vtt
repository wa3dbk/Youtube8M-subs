begin<00:00:57.620> we'll<00:00:58.620> first<00:00:58.859> start<00:00:59.160> with<00:00:59.520> removing

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
begin we'll first start with removing

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.420 
begin we'll first start with removing
the<00:01:00.149> lower<00:01:00.270> ring<00:01:00.750> which<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> generally<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the lower ring which is generally the

o-ring that causes most of the problem

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.990 
o-ring that causes most of the problem
we<00:01:04.650> always<00:01:04.799> recommend<00:01:05.220> using<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.790> little

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
we always recommend using a little

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.760 
we always recommend using a little
silicone<00:01:06.270> lubricant<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.080> spray<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.439> inside

the check valve to make the removal

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.469 
the check valve to make the removal
process<00:01:10.409> easier<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.400> lubricates<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> o-rings

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
process easier it lubricates the o-rings

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.990 
process easier it lubricates the o-rings
and<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> springs<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> valve<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.159> they'll

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and the springs and the valve so they'll

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.320
