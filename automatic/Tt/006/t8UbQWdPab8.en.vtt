00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 and then guys leandro and autocar engines 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.220
 there 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.870
 today I'm bringing is one more 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:18.439
 cool video is for you, and it's not 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:26.880
 with this 3.0 turbo diesel sw4 engine 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:28.680
 I had made a video there about that car. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.849
 But but what does it matter here? 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.230
 personal 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.600
 so I think I have a little bit of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 attention deficit and I just forget 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 I'll tell you little 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.149
 but it's ok, it 's okay in this life I want 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.200
 show a very nice procedure to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.480
 you 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.610
 this car did not want to run it went 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.260
 try to take off the nail 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.079
 I thought he was not armed here. 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.700
 objectors is down there and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.969
 chain anyway the car did not catch 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:00.210
 right off the master of the masters here 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.190
 workshop owner said it could be 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.640
 burnt candle 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.340
 I want to show you here how it is 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 That we test candles here, I say 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.240
 passing is kind of strange 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.520
 learning a lot of difficult thing but 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.369
 I did not know that the sailing contest I learned 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.840
 today we use a normal car of 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.330
 battery connects it on the positive there 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 quiet can be another up a wire 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.350
 you might be a wire also 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:35.240
 It works so you lose in here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:39.600
 workshop be holding it and uses thread 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.110
 favela the thread negative side and see if 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.180
 up here will start smoking come out of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.270
 exchange that she is doing here but only 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.070
 placed the smallest is good 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.719
 the smoke does not know if the lid can 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.719
 focus right red points right 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.869
 this one is good 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.159
 Let's try the other ones. 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.459
 shaq that as always make that mark 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.140
 face alone there's nobody for more 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.140
 down to the galley understand there right? 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:35.920
 Look there, it's burnt red. 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:59.160
 there they are there with the tip of the finger not 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:59.160
 Warm up you're in the process. 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.610
 Look there guys who also lives there. 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.610
 I can speak with the tip of my finger 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.530
 also burned 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:21.430
 So that's it , we'll be there. 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.920
 replacing those of her leaving 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.030
 and it is very likely that it will work as a dream. 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.130
 Wolf 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.260
 so cool curiosity there for 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.239
 Who knows how to test yourself? 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.160
 at least here in the workshop that brings together 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.850
 27 table of diesel cars and that's it 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.180
 guys 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:46.329
 hug there there machine there romario 75 is 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.870
 absurd galley is an absurd thing I 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:52.329
 I'm going to change a focus I had for you, my 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.900
 local partner that results from 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:04:00.420
 it 's beating 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.939
 and she's really cool, she's already 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.030
 had I seen an interview with the 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:08.879
 new mistake that when we arrived at 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.140
 Signs You braked the engine off the 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.290
 open sign you took your foot off the brake 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.810
 engine was running again and then a 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.850
 one a popular 2015 car is seeing 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.470
 this technology was expected to 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.639
 this technology was from some car 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.240
 imported 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.520
 So, what's up, man? This is good. 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.110
 legal without stopping at the sign aa que and 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.930
 turns itself off and the touch from 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.850
 car is very fast both 10 book as 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.039
 call me if I think in two seconds 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.699
 motorcycle running in seconds 12 to 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.130
 working 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.660
 It's very cool, and then I'm going to give it to you. 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.650
 a fugitive that in this computer of 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:50.130
 board is calmer there have to be so 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.710
 plays like that does not teach him 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.050
 leaves him avoided and is afraid of 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.199
 cause some problem 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.070
 This is it, people, embrace, stay with God.
