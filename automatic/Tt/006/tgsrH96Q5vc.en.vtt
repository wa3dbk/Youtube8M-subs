00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.430 

I'll<00:03:23.230> take<00:03:23.440> my<00:03:23.620> pliers<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.870> I'll<00:03:25.870> start<00:03:26.260> on

one end and I'll take and I'll pull the
slack<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.690> then<00:03:35.200> I'll<00:03:35.320> come<00:03:35.560> up<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.890> I'll

and<00:03:48.490> you<00:03:48.670> can<00:03:48.820> see<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.150> difference<00:03:49.540> in<00:03:50.020> how

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
and you can see the difference in how

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.620 
and you can see the difference in how
that<00:03:50.320> turns<00:03:50.710> out<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.910> then<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.240> finished

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
and depending on the cord you only need

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.420 
and depending on the cord you only need
