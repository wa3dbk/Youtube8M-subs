from<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.930> perspective<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.949> say<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
from that perspective you can say that

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
from that perspective you can say that
well<00:00:53.760> Road<00:00:54.390> Traffic<00:00:54.629> Safety<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
well Road Traffic Safety is not really a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.439 
well Road Traffic Safety is not really a
problem<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.250> much<00:00:56.430> much<00:00:56.579> more<00:00:56.789> than<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.120> it's

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
problem is much much more than that it's

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.380 
problem is much much more than that it's
it's<00:00:57.989> an<00:00:58.140> epidemic<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.370> course<00:00:59.670> we<00:01:00.090> need<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
it's an epidemic so of course we need to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.510 
it's an epidemic so of course we need to
address<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.199> knowledge<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
address that and knowledge is really the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.250 
address that and knowledge is really the
key<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.300> really<00:01:03.870> what<00:01:04.110> this

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
key here and that's really what this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
key here and that's really what this

to try to prevent this in the future and
it's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> matter<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.590> fact<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.100> Volvo<00:01:11.400> calls

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it's a matter of fact that Volvo calls

track in another car which can travel

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.999 
track in another car which can travel
from<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.369> tunnel<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.380> this<00:01:28.380> tunnel<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.860> be

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
from this tunnel and this tunnel can be

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.960 

because<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.390> real<00:01:36.540> world<00:01:37.460> any<00:01:38.460> crash<00:01:38.790> can

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
because in the real world any crash can

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
because in the real world any crash can
occur<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.870> can<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.590> an<00:01:40.710> impact<00:01:40.800> in<00:01:41.159> any

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
occur so you can have an impact in any

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670 
occur so you can have an impact in any
angle<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:41.940> this<00:01:42.720> facility<00:01:43.260> makes<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
angle and this facility makes it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.670 
angle and this facility makes it
possible<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.600> reconstruct<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:46.350> these

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
save it this is the the tunnel that is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.810 
save it this is the the tunnel that is
used<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.570> conduct<00:02:15.900> both<00:02:16.290> car<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.920> car<00:02:17.160> crashes

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
used to conduct both car to car crashes

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.600 
used to conduct both car to car crashes
as<00:02:18.180> well<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:19.350> crash<00:02:19.890> course<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.520> the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
as well as to crash course on the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.880 
as well as to crash course on the
outside<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.480> building<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.590> tunnel

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
outside of the building so the tunnel

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.270 
outside of the building so the tunnel
here<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.970> actually<00:02:24.320> movable<00:02:25.320> on<00:02:25.680> our<00:02:25.890> cushions

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
here is actually movable on our cushions

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.479 
here is actually movable on our cushions
it<00:02:26.430> wasted<00:02:26.820> 650<00:02:27.690> tons<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.920> movable<00:02:29.370> so

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
it wasted 650 tons and it's movable so

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.580 
it wasted 650 tons and it's movable so
we<00:02:29.580> can<00:02:29.760> get<00:02:29.880> any<00:02:30.120> angle<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.690> into<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
we can get any angle on it into the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:48.970 
we can get any angle on it into the
center<00:02:31.950> here<00:02:32.220> from<00:02:32.850> 0<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.420> 2<00:02:33.930> 90<00:02:34.260> degrees<00:02:38.690> 54

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.760 

the<00:02:49.980> track<00:02:50.220> here<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:51.020> reversible<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:52.620> can

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
the track here is reversible so we can

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.980 
the track here is reversible so we can
shoot<00:02:52.890> cars<00:02:53.190> both<00:02:53.400> into<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.970> building<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.569> we

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
shoot cars both into the building and we

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.870 
shoot cars both into the building and we
can<00:02:55.140> shoot<00:02:55.260> cars<00:02:55.560> out<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.370> building<00:02:56.520> so

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
can shoot cars out of the building so

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.360 
can shoot cars out of the building so
behind<00:02:57.420> me<00:02:57.630> here<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> see<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.140> gate<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.709> on

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
behind me here you see the gate and on

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.160 
behind me here you see the gate and on
the<00:02:59.610> outside<00:02:59.730> there<00:03:00.300> we<00:03:00.420> can<00:03:00.600> actually<00:03:00.780> build

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
the outside there we can actually build

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.350 
the outside there we can actually build
different<00:03:01.680> traffic<00:03:02.310> scenarios<00:03:02.940> from<00:03:03.090> real

life all crashes here in the lab are

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:23.770 
life all crashes here in the lab are
filmed<00:03:10.020> with<00:03:10.200> special<00:03:10.650> high-speed<00:03:10.860> cameras

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.690 

we<00:03:24.780> need<00:03:24.959> all<00:03:25.140> these<00:03:25.350> high-speed<00:03:25.650> cameras<00:03:26.459> in

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
we need all these high-speed cameras in

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.520 
we need all these high-speed cameras in
order<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.090> capture<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.630> whole<00:03:27.840> crash<00:03:28.170> event

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
order to capture the whole crash event

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.070 
order to capture the whole crash event
from<00:03:28.890> all<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.280> different<00:03:29.610> angles<00:03:29.970> because<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
from all the different angles because a

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.590 
from all the different angles because a
crash<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.560> over<00:03:31.950> with<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.519> less<00:03:32.820> than<00:03:33.060> 10<00:03:33.420> for

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
crash is over with in less than 10 for

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.259 
crash is over with in less than 10 for
the<00:03:33.690> second<00:03:34.140> that's<00:03:34.830> shorter<00:03:35.760> time<00:03:35.940> than<00:03:35.970> you

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
the second that's shorter time than you

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.120 
the second that's shorter time than you
can<00:03:36.420> blink<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:37.290> need<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.620> have<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.860> all<00:03:37.950> on

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
can blink so we need to have it all on

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.130 
can blink so we need to have it all on
film<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.640> order<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:38.940> do<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> proper<00:03:39.480> analysis

film in order to do a proper analysis
afterwards<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:43.200> major<00:03:43.410> advantage<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:44.160> this

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
afterwards the major advantage of this

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.280 
afterwards the major advantage of this
installation<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:45.720> possible<00:03:45.930> to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
installation is that it is possible to

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.890 
installation is that it is possible to
create<00:03:46.560> completely<00:03:47.400> realistic<00:03:47.790> crashes<00:03:48.390> from

create completely realistic crashes from

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.470 
create completely realistic crashes from
in<00:03:49.110> principle<00:03:49.709> any<00:03:49.920> angle<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.850> at<00:03:50.940> any<00:03:51.120> speed

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
in principle any angle and at any speed

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.690 
in principle any angle and at any speed
which<00:03:52.079> provides<00:03:52.500> invaluable<00:03:52.860> knowledge<00:03:53.160> and

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
which provides invaluable knowledge and

competence first of all it gives us a
unique<00:03:56.540> flexibility<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.780> sense<00:03:58.049> that<00:03:58.200> we

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
unique flexibility in the sense that we

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.350 
unique flexibility in the sense that we
can<00:03:58.739> do<00:03:58.890> not<00:03:59.130> only<00:03:59.370> car<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.640> car<00:03:59.820> crashes<00:04:00.239> but
