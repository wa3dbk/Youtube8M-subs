00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
all of the edges but for our purposes we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.430 
all of the edges but for our purposes we
don't<00:00:46.829> need<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.309> quite<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.940> exact<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.350> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
don't need to be quite that exact so you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.420 
don't need to be quite that exact so you
want<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> cut<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.309> about<00:00:50.969> 30<00:00:51.510> pieces

want to cut it up into about 30 pieces

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.740

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
so you're going to start probably about

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.439 
so you're going to start probably about
an<00:00:54.960> inch<00:00:55.289> apart<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.629> then<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.960> using<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.710> nice

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
an inch apart and then just using a nice

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.469 
an inch apart and then just using a nice
strong<00:01:00.449> heavy<00:01:01.260> knife<00:01:01.609> you<00:01:02.609> want<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.320> cut<00:01:04.320> off

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
nice large chunks of fudge and it's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.899 
nice large chunks of fudge and it's
probably<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> stick<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you want a good heavy knife because it's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.609

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.990 
going to cut through the fudge a little
bit<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.860> easily<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:20.189> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> continue

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
bit more easily you want to continue

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.160 
bit more easily you want to continue
cutting<00:01:21.560> until<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.689> of<00:01:24.689> your

when<00:01:32.310> cutting<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> removing<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> knife

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
when cutting it and removing the knife

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.410 
when cutting it and removing the knife
you<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.369> do<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.640> while<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.939> fudge<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you want to do this while the fudge is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
you want to do this while the fudge is
still<00:01:36.630> nice<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:36.900> cool<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.220> doesn't

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
still nice and cool so that it doesn't

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.300 
still nice and cool so that it doesn't
get<00:01:38.670> sticky<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.450> warm<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.710> comes<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.159> room

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
get sticky and warm as it comes to room

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.370 
get sticky and warm as it comes to room
temperature

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
temperature

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.980 
temperature
once<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> cut<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.579> direction<00:01:45.180> then

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
once you have it cut one direction then

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.340 
once you have it cut one direction then
you<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.409> cut<00:01:47.299> slightly<00:01:48.299> smaller<00:01:48.720> amounts

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you want to cut slightly smaller amounts

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.710 
you want to cut slightly smaller amounts
in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> opposite<00:01:50.159> direction<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.880> don't<00:01:51.570> want

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
in the opposite direction you don't want

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
in the opposite direction you don't want
to<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:51.899> huge<00:01:52.200> pieces<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.799> fudge<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
to have huge pieces of fudge but you

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.600 
to have huge pieces of fudge but you
don't<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.210> them<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.540> teeny<00:01:54.810> tiny<00:01:55.200> either

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
don't want them to be teeny tiny either

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.740 
don't want them to be teeny tiny either
so<00:01:56.610> we're<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.060> keep<00:01:57.270> cutting<00:01:57.479> this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
so we're just going to keep cutting this

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780 
so we're just going to keep cutting this
all<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> way<00:01:58.140> across<00:01:58.469> until<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.549> all<00:01:59.579> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
