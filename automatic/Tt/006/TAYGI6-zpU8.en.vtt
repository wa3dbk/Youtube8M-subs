00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
released and that is a video on how

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.369 
released and that is a video on how
pistons<00:00:14.429> perform<00:00:15.000> what<00:00:15.690> they're<00:00:15.839> capable<00:00:16.020> of

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
pistons perform what they're capable of

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.160 
pistons perform what they're capable of
and<00:00:16.710> also<00:00:17.279> planting<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.789> few<00:00:17.970> ideas<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.600> am<00:00:18.960> for

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
and also planting a few ideas I am for

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.259 
and also planting a few ideas I am for
people<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.650> would<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.670> expand<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.720> am

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
people that would like to expand on am

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.420 
people that would like to expand on am
on<00:00:24.269> bigger<00:00:24.510> bills<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.619> had<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> start<00:00:26.250> off

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
on bigger bills so I had to start off

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.400 
on bigger bills so I had to start off
we're<00:00:26.670> gonna<00:00:26.789> make<00:00:27.000> our<00:00:27.210> first<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.990> piston

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
we're gonna make our first and piston

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.999 
we're gonna make our first and piston
and<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.490> by<00:00:29.789> getting<00:00:30.090> your<00:00:30.330> cobblestone

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
and that is by getting your cobblestone

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.880 
and that is by getting your cobblestone
placing<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.130> walk<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> side<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
placing it walk to on the side and

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
placing it walk to on the side and
getting<00:00:34.890> redstone<00:00:35.460> dust<00:00:35.670> put<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
getting redstone dust put it on the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.080 
getting redstone dust put it on the
bottom<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.070> morning<00:00:38.070> good<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.579> top<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
bottom and morning good on top of that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.639 
bottom and morning good on top of that
redstone<00:00:39.570> dust<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.820> 3m<00:00:41.989> pieces<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.110> wood<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
redstone dust and 3m pieces of wood so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.799 
redstone dust and 3m pieces of wood so
now<00:00:43.829> where<00:00:44.550> are<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> make<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> sticky

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
now where are you going to make a sticky

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.410 
now where are you going to make a sticky
piston<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.469> by<00:00:46.590> getting<00:00:46.800> slime<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.059> putting

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
piston just by getting slime and putting

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
piston just by getting slime and putting
on<00:00:48.480> top<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.960> piston<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.950> now<00:00:50.070> we're<00:00:50.219> going

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
on top of that piston so now we're going

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.389 
on top of that piston so now we're going
to<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.579> how<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.090> piss<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.480> works<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
to see how would that piss and works and

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.610 
to see how would that piss and works and
if<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.550> plant<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> down<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.809> actually<00:00:55.230> see

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
if we plant it down here we actually see

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.000 
if we plant it down here we actually see
extends<00:00:56.309> fully<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.079> yeah<00:00:58.590> we're<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
extends fully so yeah we're going to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.240 
extends fully so yeah we're going to
come<00:00:59.129> around<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> other<00:00:59.550> side<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:01.039> yeah<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
come around the other side and yeah and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.700 
come around the other side and yeah and
put<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> dirt<00:01:03.449> block<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.870> front<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.290> show<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
put a dirt block in front and show you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.850 
put a dirt block in front and show you
how<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.489> pushes<00:01:06.000> blocks<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.530> see<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
how it pushes blocks as you can see it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
how it pushes blocks as you can see it
pushed<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.760> didn't<00:01:08.970> bring<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> back

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
pushed it but didn't bring it back

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
pushed it but didn't bring it back
because<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.080> sticky<00:01:10.470> piston<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.520> we

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
because it's not sticky piston so we

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.730 
because it's not sticky piston so we
destroy<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> put<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> sticky

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
destroy here and put down a sticky

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800 
destroy here and put down a sticky
piston<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
piston and as you can see it's going to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.810 
piston and as you can see it's going to
pull<00:01:16.680> back<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.729> block<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.900> which<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
pull back to block and which is a is a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.899 
pull back to block and which is a is a
great<00:01:21.180> feature<00:01:21.420> also<00:01:22.170> AM<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.400> depends<00:01:23.820> on

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
great feature also AM it depends on

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.030 
great feature also AM it depends on
which<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.330> look<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> ground<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.710> as

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
which way you look at the ground so as

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.640 
which way you look at the ground so as
you<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.310> see<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.200> we've<00:01:28.200> looked<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you can see and we've looked at the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.560 
you can see and we've looked at the
ground<00:01:28.770> planted<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.729> pissing<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.270> never

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
ground planted are pissing and never

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.990 
ground planted are pissing and never
pushes<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.890> am<00:01:32.159> yeah<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> great

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
pushes up so am yeah it's a great

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.770 
pushes up so am yeah it's a great
feature<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.450> maybe<00:01:33.900> lifts<00:01:34.560> or<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.360> really

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
feature for maybe lifts or so on really

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.289 
feature for maybe lifts or so on really
or<00:01:36.990> whatever<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.560> bring<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:38.850> yeah

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
or whatever i can bring on so I'm yeah

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.210 
or whatever i can bring on so I'm yeah
this<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.659> kind<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.170> an<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.070> off<00:01:41.159> switch

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
this is kind of a an on and off switch

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.080 
this is kind of a an on and off switch
em<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.630> redstone<00:01:43.350> dust<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.759> looks<00:01:44.939> pretty

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
em for redstone dust and it looks pretty

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.179 
em for redstone dust and it looks pretty
cool<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.960> hundred<00:01:46.259> percent<00:01:46.439> sure<00:01:46.829> how

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
cool or not a hundred percent sure how

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.039 
cool or not a hundred percent sure how
it<00:01:47.250> works<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> looks<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.810> current

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
it works what it looks like the current

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.639 
it works what it looks like the current
travels<00:01:49.470> through<00:01:49.829> grad<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.579> glass<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.649> so

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
travels through grad the glass and so

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.730 
travels through grad the glass and so
always<00:01:53.220> interesting<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.270> how<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:55.530> these

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
always interesting to see how have these

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.700 
always interesting to see how have these
things<00:01:56.100> work<00:01:56.340> also<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.719> very<00:01:57.990> cool<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.469> am

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
things work also this is very cool I am

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.789 
things work also this is very cool I am
I<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.880> could<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.899> used<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.439> maybe

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
I think this could be used for maybe

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.520 
I think this could be used for maybe

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
castle wars or whatever if you have a

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
castle wars or whatever if you have a
full<00:02:04.860> wall<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:06.180> pistons<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.439> could

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
full wall and of pistons and you could

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.999 
full wall and of pistons and you could
extend<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.509> increase<00:02:09.509> your<00:02:10.009> defenses

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
extend that and increase your defenses

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.770 
extend that and increase your defenses
and<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:12.000> instance<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:12.599> that's<00:02:13.080> what

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and for instance but that's what

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.559 
and for instance but that's what
reminded<00:02:14.290> me<00:02:14.380> when<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.590> first<00:02:14.800> seen<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.569> also

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
reminded me when I first seen that also

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.140 
reminded me when I first seen that also
and<00:02:16.870> here's<00:02:17.709> tree<00:02:18.040> blocks<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.760> cannot

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
and here's tree blocks that you cannot

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.380 
and here's tree blocks that you cannot
move<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:20.050> am<00:02:20.200> pistons<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.100> i'm<00:02:21.819> not<00:02:21.940> sure<00:02:22.000> if

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
move with am pistons and i'm not sure if

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.360 
move with am pistons and i'm not sure if
there's<00:02:22.600> any<00:02:22.780> more<00:02:23.050> but<00:02:23.350> i<00:02:23.380> do<00:02:23.500> know<00:02:23.860> these

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
there's any more but i do know these

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.809 
there's any more but i do know these
tree<00:02:24.700> do<00:02:25.000> don't<00:02:25.480> move<00:02:25.840> at<00:02:26.050> all<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.440> I'm<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.490> want

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
tree do don't move at all and I'm I want

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.750 
tree do don't move at all and I'm I want
to<00:02:27.880> find<00:02:28.060> out<00:02:28.240> can<00:02:28.660> obsidian<00:02:29.350> move<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.040> which

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
to find out can obsidian move and which

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.940 
to find out can obsidian move and which
is<00:02:30.940> something<00:02:31.720> I'd<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.290> find<00:02:32.500> out<00:02:32.650> soon

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
is something I'd like to find out soon

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.250 
is something I'd like to find out soon
and<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.239> probably<00:02:34.390> my<00:02:34.690> favorite<00:02:35.080> feature

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
and this is probably my favorite feature

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.890 
and this is probably my favorite feature
of<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.680> piston<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.069> that<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.120> turning<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.750> and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
of the piston and that is turning on and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.470 
of the piston and that is turning on and
off<00:02:38.020> water<00:02:38.350> well<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.400> flow<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.610> water<00:02:39.850> at<00:02:40.270> that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
off water well the flow of water at that

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.199 
off water well the flow of water at that
I<00:02:40.720> think<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.650> would<00:02:41.860> be<00:02:41.890> very<00:02:42.250> cool<00:02:42.550> for<00:02:42.910> dams

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
I think this would be very cool for dams

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.699 
I think this would be very cool for dams
or<00:02:44.280> harvesting<00:02:45.280> your<00:02:45.310> crops<00:02:45.550> or<00:02:46.350> even<00:02:47.350> am

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
or harvesting your crops or even am

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.220 
or harvesting your crops or even am
streams<00:02:48.519> for<00:02:48.820> boats<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.360> is<00:02:49.540> very<00:02:49.750> very<00:02:50.019> cool

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
streams for boats that is very very cool

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.770 
streams for boats that is very very cool
and<00:02:50.410> this<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.550> redstone<00:02:52.030> little<00:02:52.420> circuit

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
and this is a redstone little circuit

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.500 
and this is a redstone little circuit
and<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.110> shows<00:02:53.320> you<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.100> if<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.940> plant<00:02:55.239> a

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
and it shows you that and if you plant a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.740 
and it shows you that and if you plant a
redstone<00:02:55.870> torch<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.940> under<00:02:57.940> another<00:02:58.450> block

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
redstone torch and under another block

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.570 
redstone torch and under another block
it<00:02:58.930> actually<00:02:59.260> works<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.890> that's<00:03:00.160> very<00:03:00.370> cool

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
it actually works so that's very cool

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.240 
it actually works so that's very cool
and<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:02.019> is<00:03:02.230> something<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.560> really<00:03:02.860> want<00:03:03.160> to

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
and this is something I really want to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.210 
and this is something I really want to
get<00:03:03.489> into<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.630> an<00:03:05.200> entrance<00:03:06.069> into

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
get into and that is a an entrance into

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.370 
get into and that is a an entrance into
your<00:03:06.430> house<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.870> can<00:03:07.989> see<00:03:08.019> we're

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
your house and as you can see we're

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.740 
your house and as you can see we're
going<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.590> expand<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.330> very<00:03:10.690> very

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
going to expand it and that is very very

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.170 
going to expand it and that is very very
cool<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.380> actually<00:03:12.190> really<00:03:12.610> like<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:12.970> and

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
cool I actually really like that and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.740 
cool I actually really like that and
it's<00:03:13.840> very<00:03:14.050> compact<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.209> something<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.450> can

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
it's very compact and something I can

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.780 
it's very compact and something I can
see<00:03:16.900> myself<00:03:17.080> building<00:03:17.650> in<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.340> future

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
see myself building in the in the future

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.850 
see myself building in the in the future
when<00:03:18.910> these<00:03:19.060> come<00:03:19.239> out<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.630> as<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.709> can<00:03:20.829> see

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
when these come out and as you can see

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.550 
when these come out and as you can see
it's<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.970> two<00:03:22.150> Pistons<00:03:22.750> push<00:03:22.959> out<00:03:23.200> both

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
it's the two Pistons push out both

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.759 
it's the two Pistons push out both
wonder<00:03:24.370> pistons<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.269> block<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.769> then

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
wonder pistons and the block and then

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.190 
wonder pistons and the block and then
that<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.430> piston<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.180> gets<00:03:28.540> pushed<00:03:28.810> out<00:03:28.989> it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
that and piston that gets pushed out it

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.560 
that and piston that gets pushed out it
pushes<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.709> black<00:03:29.890> Ford<00:03:30.220> as<00:03:30.430> well<00:03:31.120> as<00:03:31.299> the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
pushes the black Ford as well as the

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.900 
pushes the black Ford as well as the
stairs<00:03:31.930> there's<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.650> two<00:03:32.920> sets<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.280> stairs<00:03:33.489> one

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
stairs there's a two sets of stairs one

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.140 
stairs there's a two sets of stairs one
moves<00:03:34.180> one<00:03:34.570> doesn't<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.250> put<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.370> looks<00:03:36.670> it

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
moves one doesn't and put it looks it

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.940 
moves one doesn't and put it looks it
looks<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.450> bit<00:03:37.570> complicated<00:03:37.750> I'd<00:03:38.380> love<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.769> see

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
looks a bit complicated I'd love to see

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.580 
looks a bit complicated I'd love to see
the<00:03:39.519> schematics<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:40.780> find<00:03:41.019> out<00:03:41.170> how<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.380> do

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
the schematics and to find out how to do

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.160 
the schematics and to find out how to do
it<00:03:41.620> but<00:03:42.340> I'm<00:03:42.549> sure<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.150> they<00:03:43.900> will<00:03:44.049> be

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
it but I'm sure and they will be

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.640 
it but I'm sure and they will be
floating<00:03:44.440> around<00:03:44.530> after<00:03:45.070> 1.7<00:03:45.790> update<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.530> now

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
floating around after 1.7 update so now

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.130 
floating around after 1.7 update so now
we<00:03:47.709> see<00:03:48.010> data<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.820> pushes<00:03:49.239> opened<00:03:49.570> down<00:03:49.690> blocks

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
we see data it pushes opened down blocks

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.199 
we see data it pushes opened down blocks
as<00:03:50.350> we<00:03:50.650> seen<00:03:50.859> before<00:03:51.190> but<00:03:51.730> now<00:03:51.850> we're<00:03:52.000> going<00:03:52.120> to

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
as we seen before but now we're going to

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.500 
as we seen before but now we're going to
find<00:03:52.500> some<00:03:53.500> sand<00:03:53.799> and<00:03:54.130> plant<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.090> sand<00:03:55.329> on<00:03:55.450> top

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
find some sand and plant the sand on top

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.210 
find some sand and plant the sand on top
and<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.109> is<00:03:56.260> actually<00:03:56.380> show<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:57.070> they

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
and this is actually show you that they

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.599 
and this is actually show you that they
have<00:03:57.430> gone<00:03:57.730> into<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.600> physics<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.609> show

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
have gone into the physics and show

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.509 
have gone into the physics and show
it'll<00:04:01.150> show<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.840> that<00:04:02.290> after<00:04:02.980> some

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
it'll show you and that after some

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.640 
it'll show you and that after some
stress<00:04:03.880> of<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.299> sand<00:04:04.570> it'll<00:04:05.019> actually<00:04:05.109> break

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
stress of the sand it'll actually break

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.880 
stress of the sand it'll actually break
down<00:04:05.680> into<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.280> smaller<00:04:06.670> block<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.650> yeah<00:04:08.650> that

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
down into a smaller block and yeah that

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.340 
down into a smaller block and yeah that
happens<00:04:09.190> right<00:04:09.370> here<00:04:09.579> so<00:04:10.480> that's<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.109> pretty

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
happens right here so that's a pretty

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.990 
happens right here so that's a pretty
cool<00:04:11.560> feature<00:04:11.769> it'll<00:04:12.220> probably<00:04:12.459> work<00:04:12.579> with

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
cool feature it'll probably work with

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.870 
cool feature it'll probably work with
gravel<00:04:13.420> as<00:04:13.540> well<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.049> and<00:04:14.709> yeah<00:04:15.579> this<00:04:15.760> is

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
gravel as well and and yeah this is

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.870 
gravel as well and and yeah this is
going<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.180> show<00:04:16.329> you<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.859> little<00:04:17.859> repeater<00:04:18.310> that

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
going to show you a little repeater that

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.270 
going to show you a little repeater that
is<00:04:19.060> connected<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.720> four<00:04:20.289> different<00:04:20.709> pistons

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
is connected to four different pistons

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.240 
is connected to four different pistons
and<00:04:21.549> as<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.570> can<00:04:22.690> see<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:23.080> rotates<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.830> two

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
and as you can see it rotates the two

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.960 
and as you can see it rotates the two
blocks<00:04:24.550> around<00:04:24.700> each<00:04:25.030> other

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
blocks around each other

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.450 
blocks around each other
around<00:04:26.390> I<00:04:26.660> can't<00:04:27.290> actually<00:04:27.440> wait<00:04:27.710> until<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:28.130> see

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
around I can't actually wait until I see

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.530 
around I can't actually wait until I see
more<00:04:29.030> bills<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:30.310> 1.7<00:04:31.310> comes<00:04:31.460> out<00:04:31.640> and<00:04:31.790> see<00:04:32.510> how

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
more bills and 1.7 comes out and see how

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.480 
more bills and 1.7 comes out and see how
this<00:04:32.840> is<00:04:32.960> implemented<00:04:33.530> so<00:04:33.710> yeah<00:04:34.130> that's<00:04:34.340> it

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
this is implemented so yeah that's it

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.570 
this is implemented so yeah that's it
really<00:04:34.760> for<00:04:35.000> this<00:04:35.300> video<00:04:36.140> I'm<00:04:36.380> again<00:04:37.010> will

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
really for this video I'm again will

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.670 
really for this video I'm again will
probably<00:04:38.030> be<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.180> pear<00:04:38.540> tree<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:39.020> this<00:04:39.170> well<00:04:39.560> as

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
probably be a pear tree to this well as

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.830 
probably be a pear tree to this well as
we<00:04:39.890> get<00:04:40.070> closer<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.430> closer<00:04:40.670> to<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.000> 1.7<00:04:41.720> and

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
we get closer and closer to the 1.7 and

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.560 
we get closer and closer to the 1.7 and
more<00:04:42.140> information<00:04:42.830> gets<00:04:43.040> released<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.610> I'd

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
more information gets released and I'd

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.410 
more information gets released and I'd
like<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:44.750> say<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.320> there<00:04:45.830> is<00:04:46.160> an<00:04:46.700> two<00:04:47.150> links

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
like to say that there is an two links

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.450 
like to say that there is an two links
in<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.600> description<00:04:48.020> there's<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.560> link<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:49.070> boy

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
in the description there's a link to boy
