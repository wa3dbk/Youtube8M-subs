00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
if I have let's say 515 ATMs that means

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.800 
if I have let's say 515 ATMs that means
500<00:01:43.290> tank<00:01:43.740> which<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.250> 750<00:01:44.790> liters<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.630> go

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
500 tank which is 750 liters in one go

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.679 
500 tank which is 750 liters in one go
so<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.619> again<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:48.060> fill<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.360> one

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so I can again like I can fill it in one

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
so I can again like I can fill it in one
go<00:01:48.840> itself<00:01:49.170> though<00:01:49.799> some<00:01:50.040> 800<00:01:50.640> families<00:01:50.850> have
