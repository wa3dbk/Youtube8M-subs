in the comments down below as I very

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.360 
in the comments down below as I very
much<00:05:46.259> appreciate<00:05:46.740> it<00:05:46.770> would<00:05:47.219> you<00:05:47.280> actually

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
much appreciate it would you actually

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.010 
much appreciate it would you actually
put<00:05:47.610> out<00:05:47.729> a<00:05:47.759> strongest<00:05:48.210> possible<00:05:48.479> score<00:05:48.690> the

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
put out a strongest possible score the

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.779 
put out a strongest possible score the
only<00:05:49.199> one<00:05:49.440> change<00:05:49.680> would<00:05:49.889> make<00:05:50.219> was<00:05:50.580> that

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
only one change would make was that

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.879 
only one change would make was that
kimono<00:05:51.539> was<00:05:51.780> playing<00:05:52.080> on<00:05:52.289> the<00:05:52.320> wing<00:05:52.560> instead

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
kimono was playing on the wing instead

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:53.659 
kimono was playing on the wing instead
of<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.250> demur

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
of a demur

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.129 
of a demur
and<00:05:53.759> the<00:05:54.210> reason<00:05:54.479> being<00:05:54.659> I<00:05:54.780> think<00:05:54.960> is<00:05:55.020> a<00:05:55.050> little

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
and the reason being I think is a little

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.020 
and the reason being I think is a little
bit<00:05:55.319> quicker<00:05:55.469> and<00:05:55.800> he's<00:05:55.889> two<00:05:56.280> ratings<00:05:56.849> higher

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
bit quicker and he's two ratings higher

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.029 
bit quicker and he's two ratings higher
so<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.270> wasn't<00:05:57.449> sure<00:05:57.780> I'm<00:05:58.229> so<00:05:58.500> not<00:05:58.650> sure<00:05:58.800> who's

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
so I wasn't sure I'm so not sure who's

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.350 
so I wasn't sure I'm so not sure who's
the<00:05:59.159> better<00:05:59.280> player<00:05:59.370> but<00:05:59.789> I<00:05:59.880> have<00:06:00.000> to<00:06:00.090> wait<00:06:00.210> and

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
the better player but I have to wait and

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.850 
the better player but I have to wait and
see<00:06:00.389> but<00:06:00.719> we<00:06:01.050> do<00:06:01.139> get<00:06:01.259> good<00:06:01.349> chances<00:06:01.740> and

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
see but we do get good chances and

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.020 
see but we do get good chances and
bowler<00:06:02.069> has<00:06:02.280> a<00:06:02.310> shot<00:06:02.550> but<00:06:02.699> it<00:06:02.759> gets<00:06:02.909> deflected

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
bowler has a shot but it gets deflected

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.159 
bowler has a shot but it gets deflected
