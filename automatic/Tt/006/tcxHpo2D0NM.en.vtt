00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.300 

and<00:01:08.750> for<00:01:09.750> any<00:01:09.840> six<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> drives<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:10.980> nicely

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and for any six it drives really nicely

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.910 
and for any six it drives really nicely
actually<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> proper<00:01:12.690> High<00:01:12.840> Line<00:01:13.080> it's

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
actually it is a proper High Line it's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.080 
actually it is a proper High Line it's
got<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.220> leather<00:01:14.400> dash<00:01:14.670> top<00:01:14.910> and

everything and leather headlining

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
everything and leather headlining
leather<00:01:17.490> seats<00:01:17.790> we've<00:01:18.690> got<00:01:18.780> leather<00:01:18.930> seats

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
leather seats we've got leather seats

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
leather seats we've got leather seats
but<00:01:19.350> they're<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> headlining<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.850> door

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
but they're the headlining and door

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.420 
but they're the headlining and door
panels<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.480> things<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.310> finished<00:01:23.310> in

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
panels and things like that finished in

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.220 
panels and things like that finished in
royal<00:01:23.640> blue<00:01:23.730> with<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.120> leather<00:01:24.780> color<00:01:25.080> is

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
royal blue with the leather color is

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.420 
royal blue with the leather color is
called<00:01:25.350> silver<00:01:27.050> tracks<00:01:28.050> pretty<00:01:28.230> straight<00:01:31.430> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
called silver tracks pretty straight the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.730 
called silver tracks pretty straight the
problems<00:01:32.790> there's<00:01:33.030> possibly<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.990> quarter

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
problems there's possibly a quarter

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.170 
problems there's possibly a quarter
degree<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> left<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
degree out to the left but there is a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.600 
degree out to the left but there is a
camber<00:01:36.510> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.690> road<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.170> maybe<00:01:38.100> accounting

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
camber on the road so maybe accounting

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.190 
camber on the road so maybe accounting
for<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.940> now<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.510> finger<00:01:39.900> track<00:01:40.050> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
for it now I think it's finger track and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
for it now I think it's finger track and
actually<00:01:40.410> dead<00:01:40.560> straight<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> SI<00:01:42.300> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
actually dead straight just the SI the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.320 
actually dead straight just the SI the
roads<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.840> very<00:01:43.020> slow<00:01:43.170> camber<00:01:45.710> yeah<00:01:46.710> so

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
roads with a very slow camber yeah so

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.460 
roads with a very slow camber yeah so
engine<00:01:48.330> wires<00:01:48.510> starts<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.080> button<00:01:49.350> no

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
engine wires starts on the button no

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.860 
engine wires starts on the button no
misfiring<00:01:49.950> hesitancy<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:51.240> overheating<00:01:51.660> at

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
misfiring hesitancy or overheating at

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.620 
misfiring hesitancy or overheating at
all<00:01:52.020> no<00:01:52.170> funny<00:01:52.440> noises<00:01:53.030> gearbox<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.180> nice<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
all no funny noises gearbox is nice the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.270 
all no funny noises gearbox is nice the
change<00:01:54.870> court<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> very<00:01:55.530> very<00:01:55.740> smooth<00:01:55.980> on<00:01:56.160> this

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
change court is very very smooth on this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.370 
change court is very very smooth on this
one<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.120> it<00:01:57.240> goes<00:01:57.420> into<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> lockout<00:01:58.110> top

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
one and it goes into the lockout top

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.570 
one and it goes into the lockout top
gear<00:01:59.720> the<00:02:00.720> whole<00:02:00.840> drivetrain<00:02:01.140> feels<00:02:01.710> really

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
gear the whole drivetrain feels really

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.060 
gear the whole drivetrain feels really
quite<00:02:02.850> solid<00:02:03.270> actually<00:02:03.710> there<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.950> been

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
quite solid actually there have been

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.530 
quite solid actually there have been
perhaps<00:02:05.160> criticized<00:02:05.730> on<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.970> drivetrain

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
perhaps criticized on the drivetrain

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.180 
perhaps criticized on the drivetrain
there<00:02:07.050> is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.680> vibration

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
there is a little bit of vibration

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.390 
there is a little bit of vibration
through<00:02:08.760> the<00:02:08.850> steering<00:02:09.830> which<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.010> can<00:02:11.160> drive

there is a little bit vibration if you

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.380 
there is a little bit vibration if you
look<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> nearside<00:02:17.730> front<00:02:17.760> wheel<00:02:18.209> there

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
look at the nearside front wheel there

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.760 
look at the nearside front wheel there
is<00:02:18.450> quite<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> large<00:02:18.840> dent<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.410> nearside

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
is quite a large dent in the nearside

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.520 
is quite a large dent in the nearside
front<00:02:19.800> wheel<00:02:20.190> rim<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.090> probably<00:02:21.540> is

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
front wheel rim so that probably is

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.890 
front wheel rim so that probably is
causing<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.950> wheel<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.250> be<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.550> little<00:02:23.820> bit<00:02:23.970> out

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
causing the wheel to be a little bit out

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.949

it's<00:02:28.320> around<00:02:28.560> about<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> sort<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.160> 60<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.520> 70

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910
