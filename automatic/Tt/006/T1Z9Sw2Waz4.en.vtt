 this suite so for the box well 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.399
 sure and advises the 39 episodes and we 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.560
 is also a few 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.409
 interesting supplements one does believe a 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.230
 episode in English we have banana 11 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.870
 about four minutes from the second 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.240
 season we also showed you 

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:16.890
 inside we have here of course the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.340
 start with the other one here is the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:29.270
 volume 1 to 4 which first four 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:33.950
 records from syria this is the second 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.950
 which contains the volumes 5 1 8 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.920
 other records as other content 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.040
 we find we are here their Roman the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.440
 road dollars that support adaptation 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.310
 TV shows but it is the novel 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.140
 who inspired the TV series so that's 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.540
 a good idea to include it in this 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.090
 box to really understand the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.750
 origins of leaving the course it's 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.290
 pau there are points to 7 in this novel 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.709
 luxury no tone that do not exist 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.180
 compared to the TV series example 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:22.380
 tao is not in this hour what 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.140
 will be bad so it's useless to look for it and 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.310
 then we find as others 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.989
 supplements we have a notepad with 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:38.220
 the effigy of art cities as well as 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:42.060
 four postcards with the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:49.440
 characters are estevam esteban and 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:54.140
 hao estève baho pezilla as well as tao 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:58.790
 so this completes the content 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.790
 the box counts the contents of the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.220
 cabinet chest that is really very 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.530
 beautiful box is that this agency very 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.540
 well who completes reign series 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.360
