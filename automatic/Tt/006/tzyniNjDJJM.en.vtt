00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.350
 cultivated model faithful driving with a train is the desire every 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.280
 Modellbahner 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.669
 who runs his hobby with appropriate seriousness and consistency 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.040
 The dedicated modeler is based on the original 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.160
 and try as many density operating conditions as possible in 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
 to bring his plant 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.210
 to meet these demands 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.090
 the prohibition from grandmother 's times the city center had to 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.649
 who wants to be on the track with several trains 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.640
 a system must also divide sections into blocks 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.640
 The routes must be repaired for a model-equitable driving operation 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.340
 Feeder should not, for example, on a double-railed slope 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.170
 speed up 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.190
 on the contrary 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.870
 he should drive slower but 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.739
 Without the contracts to operate a demand that is not further problematic 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:55.910
 appear 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.190
 the return on the slope piece 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.079
 but should not slow down significantly but his ride 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.910
 Keep speeds as constant as possible 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.290
 Electronics are the panacea for operational safety 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.140
 but there is something else between electronics and control the automatic 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.430
 Here an automatic slow driving distance is installed 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.450
 very easily 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.530
 the desired route is separated under power via a resistor 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.550
 done advantage of the hobbyists can do it themselves 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.950
 This is just a bit more complicated for double track tracks 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.940
 Problem, however, with single-track slopes 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.350
 the controller stands at medium speed our workhorse 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.420
 slower and passes safely through the slope 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.050
 the resistance fulfills its demand 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.870
 you do not have to watch out when the train comes down the slope 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.320
 Slow driving distances are divided indirectly and cause a deceleration 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.659
 same controller position for the return 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.420
 Let's wait and see what happens 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.929
 he achieved the slow driving distances significantly from the speeds 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.780
 finally he stops completely 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.909
 There is also a circuit to cancel the command 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.260
 Electronics ends up being fun to think of the circuits 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.290
 fully automatic react that is at a large plant at least one 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.360
 excellent performance and that it works 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.360
 to see that 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.540
 mutually independently affect switching of turnouts and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.519
 Unfortunately, signals are often the result of automation 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.000
 However, it is true track if you yourself as routes from the perspective of 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.760
 Switch to Schalke on a route Fine and then we went to drive 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.279
 despite all reservations one should not be an electronics muffle 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.649
 and use them where they make sense and not a spoilsport is this turnaround 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:55.680
 pulled is controlled by a pendulum automatic she advertises for one 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.799
 pre-selected time interval the return journey is train from the station 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.939
 When covers are complicated they create a problem on every attachment 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.649
 all the block faces of the world can not prevent that from thrusting 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:08.889
 Contact is wrong 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.229
 and the train far into the locked block in retracts until the locomotive came signal 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.839
 stopped 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.889
 One has to build up a facility in which wiring 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.949
 You might be enough of a distinctive sign for walls trains and companies 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.139
 to make the necessary market with markings on tax cars 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.879
 next to the questions one attaches a switch 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.560
 which closes when the train has run over and thus interrupts the flow of current 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.209
 and that's how we work 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.329
 the school bell presses the turn on the locked Glock 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:52.539
 the control car reaches the switch and the train stops in front of the signal 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.269
 This modern driving culture is an asset to any model train 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.230
 Operation one can have a model just maximum speed ahead of waves and 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:05.639
 for speeding and braking a measure simulation 4 million 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.199
 the speed remains stable even inclines and gradients 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.249
 The full-bodied steady run baffles but when the rails are up 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.539
 If you are dirty, you will return to the one mechanical 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.549
 improved lure disc safely 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.830
 At the beginning, the demand that what color photos grandfathers since 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.220
 This needs to be modernized as you see the development 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.009
 move on and do the modernization card to me and make automation 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.059
 not stop at model train hobby 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.819
 With this new control system individual lozenges can be selected directly 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.710
 multiple train operation 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.710
 with well over 50 vehicles is possible 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.550
 a search is used to indicate the locomotive's code when the key is pressed 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.550
 set model fair in motion 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.430
 cheap these plants will not be land what happens when the electronics 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.789
 once it fails or plays crazy that one can think 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.830
 maybe everything starts again where we all started at 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.099
 double track in Bhopal 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.719
 Electronics are more reliable than humans 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.930
 Electronics is capable of preprogramming this system fully automatically 

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:13.689
 operate 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.559
 Electronics but we do not enjoy the hobby
