behind the base fashion now and that's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
behind the base fashion now and that's
where<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.550> move<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.059> well<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.780> then

where you can move really well and then

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.329 
where you can move really well and then
the<00:01:04.049> moment<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> step<00:01:04.739> outside<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.280> the

the moment you step outside of the
doubles<00:01:05.640> alley<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:06.119> when<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.390> becomes

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
doubles alley that's when it becomes

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
doubles alley that's when it becomes
tough<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.650> same<00:01:07.860> thing<00:01:07.890> moving

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
tough and it's the same thing moving

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.460 
tough and it's the same thing moving
forward<00:01:08.790> towards<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> tee<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.020> grass<00:01:10.260> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470

forward towards the tee the grass is
green<00:01:10.710> there<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.250> that's<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.939> becomes

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
green there and that's when it becomes

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
green there and that's when it becomes
tough<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.600> move<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.020> yeah<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.740> certain<00:01:14.010> bully

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
is actually probably tougher for a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.570 
is actually probably tougher for a
longer<00:01:16.530> period<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.400> tell
