tire and they advised that I probably

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.709 
tire and they advised that I probably
would<00:00:31.230> need<00:00:31.380> some<00:00:31.679> twist<00:00:31.980> ties<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.669> snap<00:00:33.390> ties

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
had in my garage and so you need the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.280 
had in my garage and so you need the
tire<00:00:39.750> itself<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.280> rim<00:00:41.610> these<00:00:42.480> ties<00:00:42.809> and

great tool so I recommend having this

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.310 
great tool so I recommend having this
one<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.519> those<00:01:05.729> twist<00:01:06.090> ties<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:07.140> having

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
one and those twist ties and then having

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.560 
one and those twist ties and then having
a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> time<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
a little bit of time and what you do is

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.950 
a little bit of time and what you do is
you<00:01:09.720> snap<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> tire<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.070> empty<00:01:11.760> rim<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
you snap the tire on the empty rim and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.310 
you snap the tire on the empty rim and
then<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.530> put<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> put<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> tie<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:15.320> then

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
then you put it put a tie on there then

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.649 
then you put it put a tie on there then
you<00:01:16.439> snap<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.979> another<00:01:17.280> inch<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:18.210> put<00:01:18.420> another

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you snap on another inch you put another

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
you snap on another inch you put another
tie<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.140> there<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.640> way

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
tie on there and you do it all the way

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.510 
tie on there and you do it all the way
around<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.200> gets<00:01:22.350> harder<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.860> harder<00:01:23.280> as

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
around and it gets harder and harder as

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.429 
around and it gets harder and harder as
the<00:01:23.820> tire<00:01:24.060> gets<00:01:24.330> more<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> rim

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the tire gets more and more on the rim

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.100 
the tire gets more and more on the rim
and<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.939> where<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.330> tool<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.900> just

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.850 
so anyway I hope that's helpful I made
the<00:02:14.810> video<00:02:14.930> because<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.379> noticed<00:02:15.739> there

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
the video because I noticed there

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.059 
the video because I noticed there
weren't<00:02:16.129> any<00:02:16.280> on<00:02:16.489> YouTube<00:02:16.940> once<00:02:17.720> again<00:02:18.069> these

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
weren't any on YouTube once again these

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.720 
weren't any on YouTube once again these
are<00:02:19.310> probably<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:20.209> would<00:02:21.019> say<00:02:21.290> 10<00:02:22.129> inches<00:02:22.489> long

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
are probably I would say 10 inches long

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.190 
are probably I would say 10 inches long
you<00:02:22.760> probably<00:02:23.330> don't<00:02:23.569> need<00:02:23.690> them<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:23.870> long

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
you probably don't need them that long

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.000 
you probably don't need them that long
but<00:02:24.440> 10<00:02:25.040> inches<00:02:25.370> on<00:02:25.519> these<00:02:25.730> ties<00:02:26.650> get<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> tool

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
but 10 inches on these ties get a tool

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.670 
but 10 inches on these ties get a tool
like<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:29.000> don't<00:02:29.630> think<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.989> screwdriver<00:02:30.410> is

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
like this I don't think a screwdriver is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.009 
like this I don't think a screwdriver is
going<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.890> work<00:02:31.040> nearly<00:02:31.489> as<00:02:31.640> well<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:32.300> would<00:02:32.840> get

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
going to work nearly as well I would get

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.199 
going to work nearly as well I would get
this<00:02:33.260> at<00:02:33.470> any<00:02:33.709> bike<00:02:33.950> shop<00:02:34.280> or<00:02:34.459> at<00:02:34.580> Walmart<00:02:35.060> or

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
this at any bike shop or at Walmart or

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.289 
this at any bike shop or at Walmart or
wherever<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.690> target<00:02:36.349> if<00:02:36.530> they<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:36.830> them<00:02:37.299> ok

changing these inner tubes and changing
tires<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.319> I'm<00:02:46.310> hoping<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:48.700> not<00:02:49.700> going

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.490 
tires and I'm hoping this is not going
to<00:02:49.940> happen<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.390> me<00:02:50.540> anymore<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:51.110> course<00:02:51.349> it

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.960 
won't but the ride may be a little bit
more<00:02:53.750> bumpy<00:02:54.200> but<00:02:54.769> I<00:02:54.799> really<00:02:55.130> don't<00:02:55.310> care<00:02:55.400> I'm

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
more bumpy but I really don't care I'm
