00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.180
 the last thing I wanted today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.870
 make it welded. 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.610
 here in this place as I said in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.020
 previous roller rear door window 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.740
 is cut when attached to it 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
 loads 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.090
 so that did not happen I put on 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:31.140
 Here are these welded points and then dumped 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:33.829
 between themselves means the frame and the outer 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.190
 the panel as a result 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:41.640
 the door somehow became tougher but here 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 now i will make a weld point for this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.420
 everything is ready for me 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.059
 burner he puts on built 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:03.080
 welding machine but now with some 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:05.189
 risk for imported optics 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.180
 we will make welded . 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.180
 but I still like that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.730
 so well, that's probably all, well, here it is 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.120
 turned out not very in place is welded 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.810
 . oh well now I have a little bit of it 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.810
 I will correct 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.570
 so here 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.480
 well, that's all there is nothing more to do here 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:51.260
 I will tell you better today that I am 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:54.800
 did well here today in my plans for 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.560
 It was still lifted backwards but rather 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.380
 tailgate 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.479
 today flunked all the excess holes on 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.420
 tailgate 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.229
 here you can see what is from them 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.680
 left i have them flushed out 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:20.420
 then applied epoxy primer this one 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:24.280
 here is the primer that I use here 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.280
 it means primer quick veiw 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.860
 But in order not to rust the place 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.959
 these are all that were cleaned of 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.560
 all coatings 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:41.000
 here I am covering them with oxide loud purely 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:46.010
 as a preservative here on the left here 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.650
 the same here 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.090
 the main thing that I welded brackets 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.350
 gas springs 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:59.660
 here they are and even a little cleared welded 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:02.660
 the points that is the door is almost ready 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.200
 Now to paint almost everything here 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.200
 has already 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:18.470
 several I ran ahead cleaned the bot 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:24.140
 of the castle, this is how the door closes 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:28.300
 you are nothing at all i would tell me and 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.300
 Now here we have to open 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:40.480
 so here I am scared it's not scary and all 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.120
 I'll show you again 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.910
 backed up door wanna show for 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.340
 to say that the door is amazing 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.190
 but it became much less fasten at 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.000
 closing squeak of course did not disappear because 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.959
 what is it a window but nevertheless it 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.069
 mean that your contribution bonding 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:06.160
 added and metals from how to make on 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.790
 back where 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.690
 Well, so now everything looks like 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.630
 Further in my plans is the replacement of the lock 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:22.729
 I don't know what the castle will be here but 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:25.610
 that there will be another more decent here 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.669
 something like this is today 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.669
 day
