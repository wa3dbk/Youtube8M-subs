00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
to be constructed in the first place and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330 
to be constructed in the first place and
from<00:01:09.450> those<00:01:09.689> amino<00:01:09.930> acids<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:11.130> complex

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
from those amino acids then more complex

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.420 
from those amino acids then more complex
proteins<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.390> made<00:01:12.650> you<00:01:13.650> also<00:01:13.860> need<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.220> be

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
proteins can be made you also need to be

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.969 
proteins can be made you also need to be
familiar<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.689> keywords<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
familiar with for keywords and how to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.280 
familiar with for keywords and how to
use<00:01:17.430> them<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.880> firstly<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> need<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
use them so firstly you need to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
use them so firstly you need to
understand<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> words<00:01:20.390> homozygous<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
understand the words homozygous and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.980 
understand the words homozygous and
heterozygous<00:01:23.090> now<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.360> refers<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
heterozygous now this refers to the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.070 
heterozygous now this refers to the
alleles<00:01:25.500> which<00:01:26.070> an<00:01:26.220> organism<00:01:26.580> gets<00:01:27.060> from<00:01:27.689> its

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
alleles which an organism gets from its

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.830 
alleles which an organism gets from its
mother<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.680> from<00:01:29.040> its<00:01:29.189> father<00:01:29.579> let's<00:01:30.540> focus

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
mother and from its father let's focus

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.690 
mother and from its father let's focus
on<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> example<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> foundation<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
on the example from the foundation to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.719 
on the example from the foundation to
your<00:01:32.939> video<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.420> cystic<00:01:34.079> fibrosis<00:01:34.159> if<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.610> go

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
your video of cystic fibrosis if we go

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.280 
your video of cystic fibrosis if we go
back<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.119> punnett<00:01:36.360> square<00:01:36.630> representing

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
back to the punnett square representing

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.590 
back to the punnett square representing
how<00:01:37.409> cystic<00:01:37.829> fibrosis<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.700> inherited<00:01:38.939> you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
how cystic fibrosis can be inherited you

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
how cystic fibrosis can be inherited you
can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.259> get<00:01:40.439> pairs<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.040> alleles<00:01:41.340> in

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
can see that we get pairs of alleles in

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.319 
can see that we get pairs of alleles in
all<00:01:41.939> four<00:01:42.329> possible<00:01:42.840> outcomes<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:45.030> two

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
all four possible outcomes if the two

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.289 
all four possible outcomes if the two
alleles<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.320> pair<00:01:46.649> match<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.729> say<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
alleles in a pair match then we say it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.010 
alleles in a pair match then we say it
is<00:01:48.509> homozygous<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.729> two<00:01:50.939> pairs<00:01:51.299> don't

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
is homozygous if the two pairs don't

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.429 
is homozygous if the two pairs don't
match<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.130> say<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.520> heterozygous<00:01:54.439> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
match then we say it's heterozygous so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.899 
match then we say it's heterozygous so
these<00:01:55.770> ones<00:01:56.159> are<00:01:56.960> all<00:01:57.960> homozygous<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.040> these

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
these ones are all homozygous and these

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.980 
these ones are all homozygous and these

that's<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.990> genotype<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:33.400> phenotypes<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.120> bit

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
that's the genotype the phenotypes a bit

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.510 
that's the genotype the phenotypes a bit
simpler<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.050> phenotype<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.740> just<00:02:36.010> which

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
simpler the phenotype is just which

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.490 
simpler the phenotype is just which
characteristic<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.540> expressed<00:02:38.170> which

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
characteristic is expressed which

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.560 
characteristic is expressed which
characteristic<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.850> observe<00:02:40.210> directly

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
characteristic can you observe directly

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.310 
characteristic can you observe directly
so<00:02:41.410> think<00:02:41.680> about<00:02:41.920> hair<00:02:42.250> color<00:02:42.990> dark<00:02:43.990> hair

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
so think about hair color dark hair

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.620 
so think about hair color dark hair
colors<00:02:44.680> are<00:02:44.890> dominant<00:02:45.880> usually<00:02:46.420> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
colors are dominant usually and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.400 
colors are dominant usually and
something<00:02:47.440> like<00:02:47.590> red<00:02:47.830> hair<00:02:48.100> is<00:02:48.310> recessive<00:02:49.410> so

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
something like red hair is recessive so

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.100 
something like red hair is recessive so
someone<00:02:50.920> could<00:02:51.190> have<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.640> recessive<00:02:52.300> red<00:02:52.810> hair

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
someone could have a recessive red hair

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.800 
someone could have a recessive red hair
gene<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:54.070> dominant<00:02:54.370> dark<00:02:54.970> hair<00:02:55.240> gene<00:02:55.570> and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
gene and a dominant dark hair gene and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.590 
gene and a dominant dark hair gene and
so<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.890> genotype<00:02:57.520> would<00:02:57.970> be<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.420> they've

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
so the genotype would be that they've

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.500 
so the genotype would be that they've
got<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.320> dominant<00:02:59.860> dark<00:03:00.370> hair<00:03:00.640> gene<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.150> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
got the dominant dark hair gene and the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.020 
got the dominant dark hair gene and the
recessive<00:03:01.870> red<00:03:02.440> hair<00:03:02.709> gene<00:03:03.010> but<00:03:03.880> the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
recessive red hair gene but the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.180 
recessive red hair gene but the
phenotype<00:03:04.660> what<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.140> can<00:03:05.320> see<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.950> simply

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
phenotype what you can see is simply

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.000 
phenotype what you can see is simply
that<00:03:06.459> they've<00:03:06.610> got<00:03:06.790> dark<00:03:07.150> hair<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:08.010> genotype

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
that they've got dark hair so genotype

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.800 
that they've got dark hair so genotype
is<00:03:09.340> what<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.760> genetic<00:03:09.910> information<00:03:10.300> is

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
is what the genetic information is

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.530 
is what the genetic information is
phenotype<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:11.980> what<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.459> can<00:03:12.610> actually<00:03:12.760> see<00:03:13.270> a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
phenotype is what you can actually see a

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.600 
phenotype is what you can actually see a
more<00:03:14.080> technical<00:03:14.410> way<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.680> put<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.070> is<00:03:15.250> that

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
more technical way to put that is that

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.390 
more technical way to put that is that
the<00:03:15.700> phenotype<00:03:16.209> is<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.570> observable

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
the phenotype is the observable

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.160 
the phenotype is the observable
characteristics<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.550> that<00:03:18.610> organism<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.780> you

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
characteristics of that organism and you

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.300 
characteristics of that organism and you
need<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.440> be<00:03:20.560> aware<00:03:20.800> that<00:03:20.860> it's<00:03:21.130> often

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
need to be aware that it's often

out of a pair finally for higher two you

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.410 
out of a pair finally for higher two you

need a deeper understanding of the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.600 
need a deeper understanding of the

respectively now all of these cells
start<00:03:37.660> out<00:03:38.110> as<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.410> cell<00:03:39.070> with<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> normal<00:03:40.120> number

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
start out as a cell with a normal number

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.800 
start out as a cell with a normal number
of<00:03:40.570> chromosomes<00:03:41.140> with<00:03:41.920> 46<00:03:42.700> chromosomes<00:03:43.120> 23

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.340 
of chromosomes with 46 chromosomes 23
pairs<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.760> then<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.299> cell<00:03:46.540> divides<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:47.200> a

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
pairs but then the cell divides in a

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.100 
pairs but then the cell divides in a
really<00:03:47.739> unusual<00:03:47.860> way<00:03:48.730> this<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.360> what<00:03:49.540> meiosis

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
really unusual way this is what meiosis

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.590 
really unusual way this is what meiosis
is<00:03:50.350> firstly<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.580> chromosomes<00:03:52.120> within<00:03:52.450> that

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
is firstly the chromosomes within that

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.590 
is firstly the chromosomes within that
cell<00:03:52.900> copy<00:03:53.500> themselves<00:03:53.799> and<00:03:54.489> then<00:03:55.090> similar

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
cell copy themselves and then similar

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.600 
cell copy themselves and then similar
chromosomes<00:03:56.140> pair<00:03:56.709> up<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.100> they<00:03:57.280> swap

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
chromosomes pair up and they swap

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.420 
chromosomes pair up and they swap
sections<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.330> DNA<00:03:58.769> next<00:03:59.769> those<00:03:59.950> chromosome

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
sections of DNA next those chromosome

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.490 
sections of DNA next those chromosome
pairs<00:04:00.700> divide<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.540> cell<00:04:01.750> itself<00:04:02.049> divides

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
pairs divide and the cell itself divides

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.650 
pairs divide and the cell itself divides
and<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:03.160> you're<00:04:03.310> left<00:04:03.489> with<00:04:03.670> two<00:04:03.700> cells<00:04:04.390> each

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
and so you're left with two cells each

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.390 
and so you're left with two cells each
of<00:04:05.440> which<00:04:05.620> has<00:04:06.040> 46<00:04:06.820> chromosomes<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.769> next

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
of which has 46 chromosomes the next

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.660 
of which has 46 chromosomes the next
step<00:04:09.610> is<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.060> crucial<00:04:10.450> one<00:04:10.920> because<00:04:11.920> unlike

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
step is the crucial one because unlike

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.590 
step is the crucial one because unlike
in<00:04:12.940> mitosis<00:04:13.750> in<00:04:13.989> meiosis<00:04:14.850> these<00:04:15.850> two<00:04:16.239> cells

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
in mitosis in meiosis these two cells

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.460 
in mitosis in meiosis these two cells
then<00:04:17.290> divide<00:04:17.799> again<00:04:18.430> only<00:04:18.729> this<00:04:19.450> time<00:04:19.510> they

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
then divide again only this time they

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.219 
then divide again only this time they
don't<00:04:20.739> copy<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.459> chromosomes<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:23.050> the

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
don't copy the chromosomes so the

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.920 
don't copy the chromosomes so the
chromosomes<00:04:23.800> are<00:04:24.039> divided<00:04:24.789> again<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.300> 46

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
chromosomes are divided again the 46

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.180 
chromosomes are divided again the 46
chromosomes<00:04:26.349> are<00:04:26.800> the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
chromosomes are the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.010 
chromosomes are the
divided<00:04:27.640> into<00:04:28.420> 23<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.380> 23<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.630> end<00:04:31.870> up

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
divided into 23 and 23 and so you end up

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.040 
divided into 23 and 23 and so you end up
with<00:04:32.230> 4<00:04:32.650> cells<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.490> each<00:04:34.060> one<00:04:34.420> of<00:04:34.540> those<00:04:34.690> 4

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
with 4 cells and each one of those 4

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.520 
with 4 cells and each one of those 4
cells<00:04:35.380> has<00:04:36.070> 23<00:04:37.030> chromosomes<00:04:37.540> each<00:04:37.960> one<00:04:38.380> of

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
cells has 23 chromosomes each one of

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.340 
cells has 23 chromosomes each one of
them<00:04:38.650> is<00:04:38.800> now<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.100> gamete<00:04:39.810> so<00:04:40.810> again<00:04:41.140> the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
them is now a gamete so again the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.470 
them is now a gamete so again the
genetic<00:04:41.770> information<00:04:41.920> is<00:04:42.370> copied<00:04:42.790> then<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
genetic information is copied then the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.470 
genetic information is copied then the
cell<00:04:43.690> divides<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:44.530> then<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.610> divides<00:04:46.180> again

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
cell divides and then it divides again

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.020 
cell divides and then it divides again
that's<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.530> crucial<00:04:47.980> step<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.520> you're<00:04:48.880> left

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
that's the crucial step and you're left

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.080 
that's the crucial step and you're left
with<00:04:49.150> four<00:04:49.540> gametes<00:04:50.020> each<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.830> which<00:04:51.010> has<00:04:51.250> 23

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
with four gametes each of which has 23

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.480 
with four gametes each of which has 23
