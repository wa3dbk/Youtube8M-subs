00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
interesting is the USR and l115 are very

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.660 
interesting is the USR and l115 are very
similar<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.350> two<00:00:58.530> sniper<00:00:58.800> rifles<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.460> had

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
similar to two sniper rifles that we had

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.729 
similar to two sniper rifles that we had
in<00:00:59.879> modern<00:01:00.180> warfare<00:01:00.300> 3<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.960> those<00:01:01.410> would<00:01:01.590> be

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
in modern warfare 3 and those would be

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.390 
in modern warfare 3 and those would be
the<00:01:02.039> L<00:01:02.219> 11<00:01:02.670> 8a<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.870> MSR<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.189> even

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the L 11 8a and the MSR and you can even

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
the L 11 8a and the MSR and you can even
see<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> names<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> weapons<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:06.720> similar

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
see the names of the weapons are similar

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
see the names of the weapons are similar
so<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.250> ones<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.580> Call<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> Duty

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
so it's like the ones in Call of Duty

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.820 
so it's like the ones in Call of Duty
ghosts<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.540> updated<00:01:10.080> versions<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> same

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
ghosts are updated versions of the same

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.880 
ghosts are updated versions of the same
weapon<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.119> modern<00:01:12.450> warfare<00:01:12.570> 3<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.080> MSR<00:01:13.650> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
weapon so in modern warfare 3 the MSR is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.149 
weapon so in modern warfare 3 the MSR is
like<00:01:14.159> Call<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> Duty<00:01:15.000> ghosts<00:01:15.390> USR<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.960 
to snipe and I have a very strong
opinion<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> best<00:01:37.799> sniper<00:01:38.340> rifle<00:01:38.790> in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
opinion on the best sniper rifle in

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.899 
opinion on the best sniper rifle in
modern<00:01:39.180> warfare<00:01:39.329> 3<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> MSR<00:01:41.280> so

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
modern warfare 3 and that was the MSR so

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.630 
modern warfare 3 and that was the MSR so
the<00:01:42.150> MSR<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> very<00:01:43.380> balanced<00:01:43.920> night<00:01:44.189> rifle

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the MSR was a very balanced night rifle

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.240 
the MSR was a very balanced night rifle
it<00:01:45.090> wasn't<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> most<00:01:45.600> powerful<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.439> wasn't

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it wasn't the most powerful it wasn't

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.120 
it wasn't the most powerful it wasn't
the<00:01:47.460> fastest<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.380> around<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.979> taking

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the fastest but all around just taking

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
the fastest but all around just taking
everything<00:01:50.579> into<00:01:50.850> consideration<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
everything into consideration it was a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.530 
everything into consideration it was a
happy<00:01:52.560> medium<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.220> gave<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> best<00:01:54.299> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
happy medium that gave you the best of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.429 
happy medium that gave you the best of
all<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.439> other<00:01:55.560> options<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:57.290> Call<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> Duty

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
all the other options so in Call of Duty

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.760 
all the other options so in Call of Duty
ghosts<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.030> USR<00:02:00.630> offers<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.350> exactly

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
ghosts what the USR offers is exactly

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.030 
ghosts what the USR offers is exactly
that<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.549> good<00:02:03.290> in-between<00:02:04.290> sniper<00:02:04.619> rifle

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that it's a good in-between sniper rifle

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
that it's a good in-between sniper rifle
that's<00:02:05.219> pretty<00:02:05.700> good<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.270> areas<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that's pretty good in all areas it's a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.550 
that's pretty good in all areas it's a
little<00:02:07.710> bit<00:02:07.860> weaker<00:02:08.280> than<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.819> l115<00:02:09.470> but<00:02:10.470> it

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
little bit weaker than the l115 but it

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.920 
little bit weaker than the l115 but it
also<00:02:10.709> has<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> slightly<00:02:11.400> faster<00:02:12.150> fire<00:02:12.450> rate<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
also has a slightly faster fire rate so

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.710 
also has a slightly faster fire rate so
it<00:02:13.110> really<00:02:13.470> how

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
it really how

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.450 
it really how
you<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.140> those<00:02:14.320> situations<00:02:15.040> where<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.340> a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
you in those situations where you have a

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.010 
you in those situations where you have a
lot<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.820> people<00:02:16.060> around<00:02:16.240> you<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> fire

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
lot of people around you you have a fire

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.450 
lot of people around you you have a fire
rate<00:02:17.200> that's<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.650> fast<00:02:17.860> enough<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.310> deal

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
rate that's just fast enough to deal

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.730 
rate that's just fast enough to deal
with<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.730> kind<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.000> thing<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:20.170> us<00:02:20.470> are<00:02:20.710> I
