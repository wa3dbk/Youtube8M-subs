these are actually bamboo gloves bamboo

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.889 
these are actually bamboo gloves bamboo
is<00:00:32.610> great<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.360> doesn't<00:00:33.690> hold

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
is great because it doesn't hold

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.010 
is great because it doesn't hold
moisture<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.680> dries<00:00:34.920> very<00:00:35.190> easily<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.020> does

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
moisture it dries very easily and does

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.319 
moisture it dries very easily and does
not<00:00:37.170> hold<00:00:37.440> different<00:00:38.430> types<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.790> mold<00:00:39.030> and

not hold different types of mold and
stuff<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.809> will<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.230> grow<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.500> bamboo

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
stuff like that will not grow on bamboo

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
goes like this you depend on what's

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.020 
goes like this you depend on what's
important<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:47.980> your<00:02:48.010> kit<00:02:48.310> depending<00:02:48.820> on<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
law of threes three hours that's about

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.840 
law of threes three hours that's about
how<00:02:53.019> long<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.500> go<00:02:53.680> in<00:02:54.070> very<00:02:54.310> bad<00:02:54.640> weather

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
how long you can go in very bad weather

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
how long you can go in very bad weather
conditions<00:02:55.510> before<00:02:55.720> suffering<00:02:56.200> heat<00:02:56.950> stroke

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
conditions before suffering heat stroke

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.770 
conditions before suffering heat stroke
before<00:02:58.870> suffering<00:02:59.350> bad<00:03:00.280> sunburn<00:03:00.940> before

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
before suffering bad sunburn before

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.170 
before suffering bad sunburn before
suffering<00:03:03.209> dehydration<00:03:05.250> before<00:03:06.250> suffering

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.600 

hypothermia<00:03:10.530> all<00:03:11.530> those<00:03:11.739> kind<00:03:12.130> of<00:03:12.190> things<00:03:12.340> are

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
hypothermia all those kind of things are

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.590 
hypothermia all those kind of things are
basically<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.360> three-hour<00:03:13.959> danger<00:03:14.680> mark<00:03:15.600> so

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
basically a three-hour danger mark so

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.680 
basically a three-hour danger mark so
the<00:03:17.080> most<00:03:17.440> important<00:03:18.040> part<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.120> kid<00:03:19.360> really

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
the most important part of a kid really

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.880 
the most important part of a kid really
is<00:03:20.049> shelter<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.190> warmth<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:23.440> combines

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
is shelter and warmth so that combines

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.020 
is shelter and warmth so that combines
with

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
with

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.640 
with
shelter<00:03:26.600> building<00:03:26.840> getting<00:03:27.380> out<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.590> the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
shelter building getting out of the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.210 
shelter building getting out of the
elements<00:03:28.069> and<00:03:28.660> fire<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:30.590> they<00:03:30.740> are<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:30.950> most

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
elements and fire so they are the most

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.750 
elements and fire so they are the most
important<00:03:31.819> things<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.120> have<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.510> carry<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
important things you have to carry the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.520 
important things you have to carry the
second<00:03:35.120> number<00:03:35.360> three<00:03:35.660> is<00:03:36.670> three<00:03:37.670> days<00:03:38.530> you

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
second number three is three days you

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.160 
second number three is three days you
can<00:03:39.650> go<00:03:39.830> about<00:03:40.130> three<00:03:41.000> days<00:03:41.150> without<00:03:41.480> water<00:03:44.170> so

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
can go about three days without water so

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.020 
can go about three days without water so
the<00:03:45.500> second<00:03:45.860> most<00:03:45.950> important<00:03:46.489> part<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.910> any

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
the second most important part of any

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.140 
the second most important part of any
kit<00:03:47.330> is<00:03:47.630> being<00:03:48.530> able<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.950> have<00:03:49.220> or<00:03:49.550> filter

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
kit is being able to have or filter

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.830 
kit is being able to have or filter
water<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:51.340> then<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.790> last<00:03:52.940> number<00:03:53.239> three<00:03:53.630> is

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
water and then the last number three is

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.949 
water and then the last number three is
food<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.319> can<00:03:54.470> go<00:03:54.590> three<00:03:54.890> weeks<00:03:55.069> without<00:03:55.489> food

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
food you can go three weeks without food

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.300 
food you can go three weeks without food
so<00:03:56.959> that's<00:03:57.110> actually<00:03:57.260> at<00:03:57.530> least<00:03:57.770> important

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
so that's actually at least important

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.140 
so that's actually at least important
part<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.760> kit<00:03:59.000> is<00:03:59.239> food<00:04:00.820> because<00:04:01.820> you<00:04:01.910> can

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
part of a kit is food because you can

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.440 
part of a kit is food because you can
survive<00:04:02.510> quite<00:04:02.870> some<00:04:03.080> time<00:04:03.290> without<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:04.450> so

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
survive quite some time without it so

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.620 
survive quite some time without it so
let's<00:04:05.750> continue<00:04:05.959> i<00:04:06.970> bought<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.180> little<00:04:08.450> five

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.130 
I took some back black thread and I
wrapped<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.239> all<00:04:20.359> around<00:04:20.600> here<00:04:20.840> then<00:04:21.019> I

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
wrapped it all around here then I

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.350 
wrapped it all around here then I
covered<00:04:21.350> in<00:04:21.560> some<00:04:21.739> medical<00:04:22.100> tape<00:04:22.340> so<00:04:23.060> we<00:04:23.240> have

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
covered in some medical tape so we have

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.500 
covered in some medical tape so we have
our<00:04:23.390> tiny<00:04:23.780> little<00:04:23.810> sewing<00:04:24.169> kit

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.340 

and<00:04:32.050> then<00:04:32.170> of<00:04:32.290> course<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:33.760> can<00:04:33.910> live<00:04:34.150> without

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
and then of course you can live without

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.280 
and then of course you can live without
safety<00:04:35.350> pins<00:04:36.180> these<00:04:37.180> are<00:04:37.360> small<00:04:37.660> ones<00:04:37.930> you

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
safety pins these are small ones you

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.960 
safety pins these are small ones you
probably<00:04:38.530> want<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:38.830> couple<00:04:39.130> of<00:04:39.190> big<00:04:39.370> heavy<00:04:39.550> duty

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
probably want a couple of big heavy duty

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.970 
probably want a couple of big heavy duty
ones<00:04:40.150> 24<00:04:40.980> pack<00:04:41.980> repair<00:04:42.400> stuff<00:04:42.730> like<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:42.940> and

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.520 
thing going for a long time in the wild
why<00:05:13.720> would<00:05:13.930> this<00:05:14.050> be<00:05:14.290> a<00:05:14.320> survival<00:05:14.950> tool<00:05:16.530> let's

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
why would this be a survival tool let's

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.640
