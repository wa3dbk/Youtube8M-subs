dragon<00:00:44.309> mermaid<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.090> my<00:00:45.300> opinion<00:00:45.750> anyways<00:00:46.879> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
dragon mermaid in my opinion anyways the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
dragon mermaid in my opinion anyways the
combination<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.660> I've<00:00:48.840> tested<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.559> was

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
combination that I've tested with was

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.680 
combination that I've tested with was
the<00:00:50.700> Coco<00:00:51.149> mermaid<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.050> kelp<00:00:52.320> mermaid<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
the Coco mermaid and the kelp mermaid I

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.600 
the Coco mermaid and the kelp mermaid I
haven't<00:00:54.690> been<00:00:54.899> successful<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:55.770> getting<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
haven't been successful at getting the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.950 
haven't been successful at getting the
sea<00:00:56.820> dragon<00:00:57.059> mermaid<00:00:57.539> using<00:00:57.870> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
sea dragon mermaid using this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.520 
sea dragon mermaid using this
combination<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:59.239> like<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.570> guess<00:01:00.899> assuming

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
combination but like I guess assuming

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.820 
combination but like I guess assuming
that<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> does<00:01:02.640> work<00:01:03.229> it's<00:01:04.229> probably<00:01:04.680> just

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that it does work it's probably just

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.820 
that it does work it's probably just
more<00:01:05.070> rare<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.640> me<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:05.880> always<00:01:06.060> unlucky<00:01:06.650> but<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
more rare for me or always unlucky but I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.270 
more rare for me or always unlucky but I
use<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.640> Calypso<00:01:09.090> mermaid<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.280> Coco

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
use the Calypso mermaid and the Coco

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.539 
use the Calypso mermaid and the Coco
mermaid<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:12.720> ah<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
mermaid so as you can see ah this is the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.810 
mermaid so as you can see ah this is the
mermaid<00:01:14.850> I've<00:01:15.119> used<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.470> video<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
same time you're looking for you're

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.039 
same time you're looking for you're

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
looking for 16 hours singing time so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.289 
looking for 16 hours singing time so
let's<00:01:31.170> say<00:01:31.829> something<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.340> 15<00:01:32.939> 59<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.079> 59

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
let's say something like 15 59 and 59

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
let's say something like 15 59 and 59
it'll<00:01:36.299> take<00:01:36.509> another<00:01:36.840> 16<00:01:37.470> hours<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it'll take another 16 hours for the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.870 
it'll take another 16 hours for the
mermaid<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.479> arrive<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.490> look

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
mermaid to arrive so you can really look

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.139 
mermaid to arrive so you can really look
at<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.740> arriving<00:01:43.740> image<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.759> mermaid

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
at the arriving image of the mermaid

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.999 
at the arriving image of the mermaid
because<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.720> sea<00:01:45.899> dragon<00:01:46.140> Merman<00:01:46.590> has<00:01:46.770> two

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
because the sea dragon Merman has two

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.569 
because the sea dragon Merman has two
horns<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:49.110> two<00:01:49.350> horns<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
horns so if you see two horns then you

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.580 
horns so if you see two horns then you
definitely<00:01:50.850> got<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.630> sea<00:01:51.869> dragon<00:01:52.140> mermaid
