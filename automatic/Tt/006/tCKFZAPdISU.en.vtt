then this thing should come just slide
it<00:02:20.020> straight<00:02:20.410> off<00:02:21.270> okay<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:23.440> like<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.770> now

you want to make sure that your gasket
stays<00:02:27.580> on<00:02:27.850> right<00:02:28.630> here<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.900> see<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.200> gasket

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
stays on right here you see that gasket

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.290 
stays on right here you see that gasket
we<00:02:31.270> sit<00:02:31.450> down<00:02:31.600> second<00:02:31.960> point<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.940> gas<00:02:34.090> that's

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
we sit down second point the gas that's

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.050 
we sit down second point the gas that's
going<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.600> be<00:02:34.660> right<00:02:34.840> here<00:02:35.110> sitting<00:02:35.680> on<00:02:36.060> has

going to be right here sitting on has

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.940 
going to be right here sitting on has
two<00:02:37.360> holes<00:02:37.540> with<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.900> bolts<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.530> nuts<00:02:38.740> go

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
two holes with the bolts the nuts go

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.920 
two holes with the bolts the nuts go
through<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.400> then<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.240> have<00:02:40.360> another<00:02:40.570> gasket

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
through and then you have another gasket

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.930 
through and then you have another gasket
right<00:02:41.650> here<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.430> don't<00:02:42.610> want<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.790> lose

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
these so and they're going to be a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.100 
these so and they're going to be a
little<00:02:45.040> on<00:02:45.280> depending<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.030> how<00:02:46.180> old<00:02:46.240> your<00:02:46.900> bike

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
little on depending on how old your bike

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.920 
little on depending on how old your bike
is<00:02:47.350> or<00:02:47.880> they're<00:02:48.880> going<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.090> be<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.240> little<00:02:49.570> they

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
is or they're going to be a little they

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.449 
is or they're going to be a little they
might<00:02:50.080> be<00:02:50.230> brittle<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.740> is<00:02:50.920> really<00:02:51.310> might

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
might be brittle and is really might

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.280 
might be brittle and is really might
want<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.640> try<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.820> replace<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:52.510> they<00:02:53.110> can

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
want to try to replace it but they can

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.870 
want to try to replace it but they can
break<00:02:53.500> easily<00:02:53.770> because<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.070> really<00:02:54.490> thin<00:02:54.730> it's

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
break easily because a really thin it's

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.020 
break easily because a really thin it's
just<00:02:55.060> little<00:02:55.780> rubber<00:02:55.990> things<00:02:56.640> all<00:02:57.640> right

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
just little rubber things all right

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.330 
just little rubber things all right
now<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.140> main<00:02:59.290> reason<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.740> had<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.920> take<00:03:00.160> that

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
now the main reason I had to take that

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.790 
now the main reason I had to take that
office<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:00.880> could<00:03:01.120> see<00:03:01.420> better<00:03:01.709> now<00:03:02.709> the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
office so you could see better now the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.640 
office so you could see better now the
first<00:03:03.100> thing<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.280> we're<00:03:03.459> going<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.640> do<00:03:03.820> is

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
first thing that we're going to do is

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.020 
first thing that we're going to do is
mess<00:03:05.650> with<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.950> throttle<00:03:06.190> stop<00:03:06.550> which<00:03:06.880> is

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
mess with the throttle stop which is

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.920 
mess with the throttle stop which is
right<00:03:07.239> here<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.080> let<00:03:08.709> me<00:03:08.800> try<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.690> lean<00:03:10.690> back

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
right here and let me try to lean back

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.770 
right here and let me try to lean back
here<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.320> kind<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.650> get<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.040> big<00:03:12.220> picture

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
here so you kind of get the big picture

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.170 
here so you kind of get the big picture
it's<00:03:13.780> just<00:03:14.260> uh<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:16.720> on<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.019> whole<00:03:17.350> assembly

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
it's just uh this on the whole assembly

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.020 
it's just uh this on the whole assembly
right<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.390> left<00:03:19.600> your<00:03:19.810> gas<00:03:19.989> tank<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:21.790> screw

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
right to left your gas tank to screw

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.830 
right to left your gas tank to screw
right<00:03:22.209> here<00:03:22.480> now<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.739> want<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:24.840> mine's

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
right here now you want to just mine's

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.830 
right here now you want to just mine's
already<00:03:26.080> out<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:27.489> just<00:03:27.700> take<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.150> out<00:03:28.300> until

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
already out but just take it out until

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.920 
already out but just take it out until
you<00:03:29.820> can't<00:03:30.820> see<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.120> back<00:03:31.269> but<00:03:31.510> if<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:31.690> stood

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
you can't see the back but if you stood

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.690 
you can't see the back but if you stood
up<00:03:31.989> while<00:03:32.650> doing<00:03:32.920> this<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.160> can<00:03:33.250> see<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.519> back

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
up while doing this you can see the back

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.460 
up while doing this you can see the back
of<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.239> want<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.780> take<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.019> out<00:03:35.140> until<00:03:35.380> you

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
of it you want to take it out until you

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.199 
of it you want to take it out until you
have<00:03:35.590> about<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.860> millimeter<00:03:36.489> on<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.820> back<00:03:36.970> so

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
have about a millimeter on the back so

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.210 
have about a millimeter on the back so
it<00:03:37.330> doesn't<00:03:37.600> pull<00:03:37.780> out<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.320> then<00:03:39.010> what<00:03:39.190> that

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
it doesn't pull out and then what that

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.430 
it doesn't pull out and then what that
allows<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.820> do<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.420> for<00:03:40.630> your<00:03:40.720> throttle<00:03:41.170> to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
allows you to do is for your throttle to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.960 
allows you to do is for your throttle to
go<00:03:41.590> all<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.980> way<00:03:43.290> instead<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:45.280> stopping<00:03:45.850> it

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
go all the way instead of it stopping it

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.660 
go all the way instead of it stopping it
so<00:03:46.330> that<00:03:47.170> will<00:03:47.260> help<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.739> it's<00:03:47.860> really<00:03:48.459> simple

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
so that will help and it's really simple

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.110 
so that will help and it's really simple
to<00:03:48.880> do<00:03:49.000> now<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.420> next<00:03:49.870> thing<00:03:50.049> is<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:51.120> little

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
to do now the next thing is a little

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.280 
to do now the next thing is a little
more<00:03:52.239> complicated<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:55.780> just<00:03:55.810> want<00:03:56.049> to<00:03:56.110> take

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
more complicated you just want to take

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.699 
more complicated you just want to take
this<00:03:57.030> spring<00:03:58.030> right<00:03:58.180> here<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.470> don't

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
this spring right here and you don't

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.740 
this spring right here and you don't
want<00:03:59.830> to<00:03:59.950> break<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.280> spring<00:04:00.640> I<00:04:00.910> haven't<00:04:01.540> and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
want to break the spring I haven't and

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.300 
want to break the spring I haven't and
it<00:04:01.900> doesn't<00:04:02.140> seem<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.410> be<00:04:02.530> too<00:04:02.739> flimsy<00:04:03.010> but

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
it doesn't seem to be too flimsy but

and let me zoom in so you can see a

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.370 
and let me zoom in so you can see a
little<00:04:47.440> better<00:04:48.120> this<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.330> plastic<00:04:49.900> cap<00:04:50.140> and

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
little better this is a plastic cap and

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.440 
little better this is a plastic cap and
then<00:04:51.100> right<00:04:51.250> behind<00:04:51.430> its<00:04:51.640> of<00:04:51.730> spring<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.300> then

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
then right behind its of spring and then

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.510 
then right behind its of spring and then
right<00:04:52.600> under<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.900> cap<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.320> screw<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:54.370> want

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
right under the cap is a screw you want

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.150 
right under the cap is a screw you want
to<00:04:54.580> take<00:04:54.730> this<00:04:54.850> cap<00:04:55.150> off<00:04:55.420> okay<00:04:56.410> with<00:04:56.860> pry<00:04:57.100> it

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
to take this cap off okay with pry it

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.440 
to take this cap off okay with pry it
off<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:57.810> then<00:04:58.810> turn<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.200> screw<00:04:59.470> umm<00:05:00.450> 1/2

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
off and then turn the screw umm 1/2

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.960 
off and then turn the screw umm 1/2
rotation<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.530> left<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.430> what<00:05:03.580> that<00:05:03.790> do

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
rotation to the left and what that do

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.110 
rotation to the left and what that do
does<00:05:04.540> is<00:05:04.870> um<00:05:05.280> it'll<00:05:06.280> just<00:05:06.520> your<00:05:06.640> air<00:05:06.790> fuel

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
does is um it'll just your air fuel

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.390 
does is um it'll just your air fuel
mixture<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.780> more<00:05:08.350> fuel<00:05:08.590> boyer<00:05:08.920> means<00:05:09.160> more

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
mixture and more fuel boyer means more

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.150 
mixture and more fuel boyer means more
power<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:10.720> after<00:05:11.350> you<00:05:11.440> do<00:05:11.530> that<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.920> put<00:05:12.070> the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
power so after you do that you put the

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.480 
power so after you do that you put the
cap<00:05:12.340> back<00:05:12.370> on<00:05:12.790> and<00:05:13.390> ready<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.720> go<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:14.490> haven't

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
cap back on and ready to go I haven't

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.650 
cap back on and ready to go I haven't
adjusted<00:05:15.610> it<00:05:16.030> more<00:05:16.180> than<00:05:16.330> 1/2<00:05:16.690> turn<00:05:16.960> but<00:05:17.950> um

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
adjusted it more than 1/2 turn but um

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.570 
adjusted it more than 1/2 turn but um
you<00:05:19.660> can<00:05:19.810> play<00:05:19.960> around<00:05:20.170> with<00:05:20.290> that<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.740> what

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
you can play around with that and what

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.660 
you can play around with that and what
it<00:05:21.700> does<00:05:21.850> is<00:05:22.150> when<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.050> accelerate<00:05:23.580> after<00:05:24.580> you

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
it does is when you accelerate after you

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.530 
it does is when you accelerate after you
accelerate<00:05:24.940> like<00:05:25.270> a<00:05:25.300> big<00:05:25.890> big<00:05:26.890> acceleration

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
accelerate like a big big acceleration

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.650 
accelerate like a big big acceleration
it<00:05:28.540> might<00:05:28.720> pop<00:05:28.960> a<00:05:28.990> little<00:05:29.380> your<00:05:30.340> engine<00:05:30.670> like

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
it might pop a little your engine like

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.930 
it might pop a little your engine like
the<00:05:31.780> muffler<00:05:32.170> but<00:05:32.620> that's<00:05:33.310> just<00:05:33.490> because<00:05:33.760> it's

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
the muffler but that's just because it's

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.470 
the muffler but that's just because it's
extra<00:05:34.330> fuel<00:05:34.860> but<00:05:35.860> after<00:05:36.130> you<00:05:36.190> do<00:05:36.280> that<00:05:36.520> you

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
extra fuel but after you do that you

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.070 
extra fuel but after you do that you
should<00:05:37.510> have<00:05:37.960> a<00:05:38.740> good<00:05:39.460> 5<00:05:39.790> to<00:05:39.820> 10<00:05:40.390> extra<00:05:40.900> miles

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
should have a good 5 to 10 extra miles

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.680 
should have a good 5 to 10 extra miles
an<00:05:41.290> hour<00:05:41.440> and<00:05:41.800> you'll<00:05:42.640> you'll<00:05:43.090> definitely<00:05:43.510> see

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
an hour and you'll you'll definitely see

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.990 
an hour and you'll you'll definitely see
the<00:05:43.870> horsepower<00:05:44.260> especially<00:05:44.920> this<00:05:45.730> throttle

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
the horsepower especially this throttle

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.100 
the horsepower especially this throttle
stop<00:05:46.330> because<00:05:46.720> that<00:05:46.870> just<00:05:46.960> limits<00:05:47.410> it<00:05:47.590> so<00:05:48.400> and

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
stop because that just limits it so and

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.830 
stop because that just limits it so and
if<00:05:50.110> you<00:05:50.230> don't<00:05:50.380> really<00:05:50.530> want<00:05:50.770> to<00:05:50.830> do<00:05:50.980> this<00:05:51.840> well

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
if you don't really want to do this well

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.810 
if you don't really want to do this well
for<00:05:53.500> stretch<00:05:53.800> your<00:05:53.980> spring<00:05:54.280> just<00:05:54.700> the

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
for stretch your spring just the

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.100 
for stretch your spring just the
throttle<00:05:55.150> stop<00:05:55.330> right<00:05:55.570> there<00:05:55.810> I'll<00:05:55.870> give<00:05:56.020> you

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110
