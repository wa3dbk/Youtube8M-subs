00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.950
 good today as it says in the title what 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.070
 what I bring you is a collaboration 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.289
 failed usually I do not usually do 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.879
 videos counting when I went wrong 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.709
 a collaboration that if not that 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.290
 I simply get in touch with the 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.090
 The company told them that the product 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.270
 I liked the reason why the 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.920
 product I did not like and I tell you 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.810
 if they want each video talking about it 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.119
 usually they do not usually say no 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.850
 because of course I would give them a bad 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.980
 advertising since they send me the 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.989
 product for free I would not want 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.790
 neither the bad publicity 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.020
 because I have not worked 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.600
 product 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.880
 now because I'm doing this 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.880
 video let me think long before 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.030
 do it but I think it's right that what 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.510
 I do imagine that a lot of people do not 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.730
 like 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.510
 The fact is that he wrote a company that 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.300
 It's called Stratus was a company of 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.239
 hair products and saw that maya 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.670
 it was just new month the green dye I think 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.190
 that the next day or in that same 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.500
 week we went was according to the month the dye 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.039
 green they wrote me and they told me 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.110
 they had seen my hair and they offered me 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.090
 to collaborate with them to tell them the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.320
 kind of hair I had because they have 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.049
 some products that I would like 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.390
 very much that they were not looking for a fake 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.979
 advertising that they were so sure 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.500
 of your product and how well you 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.500
 it worked that was not looking for that 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.440
 I lied in on the video saying that I 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.560
 I had liked 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.770
 it's something I do not understand because you have to 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.990
 stress the truth but good for another 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.970
 part yes I understand it because many 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.500
 channels we say that everything is super good 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.080
 because as they have given it to me so that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.670
 I keep giving away more things myself a day 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.400
 today as you can see, I do a little bit and more 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.930
 very few collaborations because when 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.610
 I do not like something I do not like and I do not like it 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.480
 I'm going to teach saying it's wonderful 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.510
 because not because my day to day I do not lie 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.200
 in my work I do not lie then because 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.220
 I was going to lie here is that I see it silly 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.480
 coincidentally all these companies with the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.950
 I've worked and I've told them not 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.110
 I liked the product I have not been returned 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.700
 or they have not sent me back 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.550
 absolutely nothing or have returned to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.800
 get in touch with me but look 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.720
 I prefer sincerity to products by 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.210
 the face for nothing to surrender to the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.060
 trash 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.480
 the case of this company 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.819
 they asked me what kind of hair I had 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.180
 I told them that I had a fat root 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.770
 some tips and that what you are looking for and 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.660
 I had my hair 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.180
 well I had a healthy hair 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.040
 and brilliant then that I the only 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.100
 good and I was also looking for a little 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.210
 volume and that the only one that I had in 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.580
 my hair is that I had to wash it 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.400
 quite often days and dya not for 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.430
 because I believe so I already commented 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.379
 at once root fat 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.200
 they told me they were going to send me a 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.170
 series of products to remove that fat 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.520
 of the root and that that in case I do not 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.530
 if they did not work for me 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.690
 I wrote to them because of course like them 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.830
 they were not seeing my hair in person 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.740
 well maybe 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.600
 do not block we go well to the first and you 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.380
 talk to them 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.080
 well 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.440
 in fact the product did not go well no 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.320
 it went well 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.570
 I promised myself that they told me that my hair 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.950
 it was not fatty that what surely 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.140
 what was happening to me is that I was 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.480
 using a series of shampoos that what 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.550
 caused my hair to get dirty 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.310
 before all life but well I do not know 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.700
 if today I'm going to try it like that and we talk and 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.290
 I answer them wrote the commercial 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.390
 who sent it to me and said hey look sorry 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.150
 I'm going to have to stop using our 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.100
 products because they have dried me very much 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.860
 from means to ends and they have left me the 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.630
 lifeless hair olbia leaves some photos for 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.630
 that you see how my hair stayed 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.470
 I did not send these pictures because 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.620
 I just wrote that comment and 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.500
 I told them that I felt a lot because I could not 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.810
 helping them do it is advertising and this 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.010
 person answered me and said ah, it is 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.690
 that I 'm seeing your photos of 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.070
 instagram and you have perfect hair 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.490
 so I do not understand what the problem is 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.979
 I do not lie 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.289
 what the answer I 'm going to 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.789
 read comments 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.830
 first of all tell you that we regret 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.780
 much the result that the result does not 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.699
 it was the one you expected, I was surprised 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.590
 that your email quite because I have 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.580
 many hairs some very similar and 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.289
 others equal to yours 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.180
 and the girls are amazed with the 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.520
 result that this has provided 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.690
 they will also continue to install you and in 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.240
 the photo that you attached 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.759
 I do not see the results result if I 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.139
 indicas france how dry and lifeless 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.690
 quite the opposite quite bright 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.009
 tips and perfect color I was 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.409
 happy watching the evolution of your 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.149
 hair in your photo gallery 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.589
 It's worth that maybe he gave us love from 

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:07.330
 as I have told you before but not 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:08.830
 I understand that a company takes my 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.779
 opinion when I'm saying that 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.379
 something has not gone well then you 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:16.119
 I said I was going to send you some pictures 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.919
 Well, the next time I'm 

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:19.899
 DuchÃ© I dried my hair because in the photo 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.279
 that she will also put the photo 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:24.939
 so you can see her the photo that she 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:27.819
 demand in that photo I have thrown myself 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.679
 kilos of moroccanoil and I subtracted the 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.289
 tips so that I did not notice that 

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:34.289
 I had the hair as you have seen it in 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.930
 the previous photos 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.529
 my hair stayed fried my hair stayed 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:44.369
 a hair without life with the full of 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:47.990
 white lace we wanted horrible 

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:51.270
 but very bad and therefore therefore the 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.619
 haircut has come because of that 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.389
 that he did not want he did not want to allow but he 

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:59.159
 allows us to have my hair like that because it's 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.729
 I think that to have pearls and 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:05.369
 better I cut it guys or not 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:07.379
 Pass a very healthy hair very nice 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:10.430
 very bright to have hair 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:13.349
 ugly then how is something not 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.909
 directly I cut it now people who 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.409
 will think that will be by the teeth that you 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:20.369
 you are casting 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:23.159
 I have had with this coloration since 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:24.749
 October and I'm super happy with her 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.889
 it is also that when applying me the 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:29.699
 coloring again 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:33.499
 my hair was once again a silky hair 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:37.199
 hair with the closed tip is 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:39.200
 with good volume with body rather 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.210
 said with body 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.600
 then I am coloring 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:48.080
 great the rest of my hair is perfect 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.210
 but the product this well I have not gone 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.500
 therefore good to me this company 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.850
 it has not gone well does not mean that 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.450
 because I have not gone well to other 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.670
 people do not do well but the 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.639
 product has not been the ideal for me 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.979
 hair 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:05.590
 and the answer that they gave me 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:07.719
 It was nice to me because it also 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.490
 wrote the person the countess returned her 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:11.710
 I said that if I wanted this to send him 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.360
 who sent him a photo so he could see 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.330
 how my hair had run out and I 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.069
 He said that there was no need 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.020
 so good this way if I 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:20.849
 you are watching you are seeing how I am 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.330
 was my hair that is not something that I 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.970
 I invented it 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.639
 so far the video because I think not 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:32.569
 I want to say more nor do I have more to say 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:34.830
 because my channel and videos to the 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:36.630
 people disconnect for 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:40.830
 to take away the problems we have 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:43.920
 over and I do not want to make a video in 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:47.430
 plan putting weeds against the company 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:49.800
 neither counting my problems because I think 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.440
 that this is not for that simply 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.330
 I wanted to give my opinion for the 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.480
 answer that this company gave me and 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:00.120
 why then 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.230
 tell you to see that they notice the 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.750
 youtubers say that everything is wonderful 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:09.110
 So far the video I hope you have 

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:11.660
 liked to eat is entertaining thing 

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.930
 and see you soon in a next 

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.930
 video
