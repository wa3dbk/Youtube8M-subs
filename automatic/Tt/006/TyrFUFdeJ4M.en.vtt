fingers<00:06:32.240> down<00:06:32.270> again<00:06:32.840> to<00:06:33.590> get<00:06:33.680> out<00:06:33.800> of<00:06:33.950> it<00:06:34.040> and

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160

there's<00:06:36.140> just<00:06:36.350> some<00:06:36.500> nuances<00:06:36.920> where<00:06:37.100> I<00:06:37.160> figure

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
there's just some nuances where I figure

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.170 
there's just some nuances where I figure
this<00:06:37.490> is<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.640> first<00:06:37.850> thing<00:06:37.940> you're<00:06:38.060> reaching

practice<00:06:40.280> a<00:06:40.340> little<00:06:40.460> bit<00:06:40.670> you<00:06:40.880> don't<00:06:41.210> say<00:06:41.360> it

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
practice a little bit you don't say it
