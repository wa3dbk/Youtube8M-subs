00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.240
 engine removal by a screwdriver 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.330
 screwdrivers there some models are not well 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 I know how in the rest for example the engine 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.279
 removed very simply necessary 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.449
 to turn 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.400
 engine from night gearbox therefore 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.689
 side and carefully remove these screws 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.340
 it does not need to unscrew it 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.380
 gearbox mount 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.239
 importance in order to these 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.670
 large photo gears in such 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.900
 position means then the engine is not 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 put further how to put it 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:53.610
 back not knowing is visible on camera or not 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:56.390
 you can see in general there is such a leak here 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 tricky latches by itself this 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:07.040
 the latch seems but here so 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.410
 Here's a point here 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.600
 which need to get special 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:22.040
 latch it can be found it can be found 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:25.150
 visual inspection of gearboxes 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:31.280
 landmark here are such holes 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.760
 in front of him in general, just looking for it 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.790
 the version is the opposite 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.729
 at about the pipe and the tweak is visible in everything 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:46.610
 100 where to go 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:53.420
 further we look for Viktor we are trying 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:57.500
 shift gears that's just not to 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.500
 coincided here now evident that the chef was 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 than their other try to move 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 installed 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.640
 there are also engines without such 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:19.080
 Well, in general, with primitive snaps 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.370
 without trial about thinking that it does not match 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.180
 walks on cool pay later 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.950
 smiled that such a system here in general 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.550
 here is an engine to put without 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.290
 improvements 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:36.200
 impossible if the engine does not approach not 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.690
 fit the type of attachment to the gearbox 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.260
 although the engine with us is about 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.800
 identical from which here in the right hand 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.760
 with wires covered him among the collector 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.980
 Nastya with brushes I do not know why the general 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.930
 this shelter as a worker was introduced 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.940
 means it is possible for this purpose 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.769
 rearrange these plastic ones 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:08.370
 attachment points in this is nothing complicated 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.110
 just an ordinary Phillips screwdriver is 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.260
 a business 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:19.330
 unscrewed swaps to another 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.650
 engine if really 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.650
 this plan are incompatible 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.590
 Are you either a thread? You're just fine. 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.329
 per day they must be compatible 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.689
 rented here this here they are making sure 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.799
 you hit 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:53.370
 holes mothers &amp; Spa you though we've got 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.370
 grease 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.580
 this is the most put 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.830
 send an hour look match no 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.830
 matched floor trays 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.220
 steering wheel 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.190
 you will not match where it goes from me
