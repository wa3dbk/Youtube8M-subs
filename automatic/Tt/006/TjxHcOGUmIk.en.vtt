thing with two other colors and start

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:57.940 
thing with two other colors and start
swapping<00:00:47.789> them<00:00:48.149> around

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.890

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
putting them together like you would a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.960 
putting them together like you would a
puzzle<00:01:04.040> until<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.370> get<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.550> solid<00:01:06.470> circle

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
puzzle until you get a solid circle

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:17.620 
puzzle until you get a solid circle
shape<00:01:08.970> thing

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.940 

after<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.470> three<00:01:19.500> layers

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
after you do that to all three layers

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.149 
after you do that to all three layers
cut<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.610> two<00:01:20.970> thin<00:01:21.570> layers<00:01:21.899> of<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.890> blue

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
cut out two thin layers of this blue

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
cut out two thin layers of this blue
color<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> place<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.159> top<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.299> bottom

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
color and place one on top of the bottom

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.880 
color and place one on top of the bottom
layer<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:30.750> stack<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.289> middle<00:01:31.530> layer<00:01:31.680> on

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
layer and then stack the middle layer on

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.670 
layer and then stack the middle layer on
top<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:33.649> then<00:01:34.649> one<00:01:34.890> more<00:01:35.100> blue<00:01:35.340> layer<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
top of that then one more blue layer and

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.590 
top of that then one more blue layer and
then<00:01:37.680> add<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> top<00:01:38.340> layer

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.180 

would<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.500> make<00:01:46.530> sure<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:47.010> the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
would I like to do to make sure all the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.060 
would I like to do to make sure all the
layers<00:01:47.400> are<00:01:47.729> even<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.900> press<00:01:49.380> down<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.920> I

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
layers are even is I press down as I

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.240 
layers are even is I press down as I
roll<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:50.520> flat<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:52.020> way<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.590> won't<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.040> all

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
roll it flat that way it won't be all

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.570 
roll it flat that way it won't be all
lumpy<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.600> step<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
lumpy when you do this step here and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.149 
lumpy when you do this step here and
what<00:01:56.580> I'm<00:01:56.700> doing<00:01:57.000> now<00:01:57.150> is<00:01:57.770> covering<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
what I'm doing now is covering it with a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.670 
what I'm doing now is covering it with a
thin<00:01:59.580> layer<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.509> blue<00:02:00.960> that's<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
thin layer of the blue that's in the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.880 
thin layer of the blue that's in the
middle<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.340> cake<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:04.350> will<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
middle of the cake this will be the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.070 
middle of the cake this will be the
outer<00:02:05.130> frosting

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.320 

and<00:02:11.290> when<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.190> get<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.670> bottom<00:02:12.820> you<00:02:13.000> can

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and when you get to the bottom you can

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.180 
and when you get to the bottom you can
use<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.570> thin<00:02:13.900> blade<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.440> help<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.770> get<00:02:14.950> rid<00:02:15.130> of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
use a thin blade to help you get rid of

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:25.270 
use a thin blade to help you get rid of
the<00:02:15.460> extra<00:02:15.760> clay

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.030 

this<00:02:26.280> step<00:02:26.610> here<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:27.120> optional<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.140> really

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
this step here is optional it's really

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.940 
this step here is optional it's really
only<00:02:29.430> if<00:02:29.549> you<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.879> a<00:02:29.909> spool<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.599> wire<00:02:30.629> oh<00:02:31.170> but

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
only if you have a spool of wire oh but

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.130 
only if you have a spool of wire oh but
I<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.549> add<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> little<00:02:33.000> extra<00:02:33.209> texture<00:02:33.780> to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
I like to add a little extra texture to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.979 
I like to add a little extra texture to
the<00:02:34.260> outside<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.860> cake<00:02:35.269> by<00:02:36.269> rolling<00:02:36.870> it

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.179 
the outside of the cake by rolling it
across<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.530> wire<00:02:37.680> here

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
across the wire here

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.300 
across the wire here
it<00:02:38.700> helps<00:02:39.000> hide<00:02:39.870> fingerprints<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.010> smudges

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
and use a dotting tool to add them to

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.180 
and use a dotting tool to add them to
the<00:03:01.139> cake<00:03:01.349> I<00:03:03.139> like<00:03:04.139> to<00:03:04.319> texture<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.859> flowers<00:03:05.159> a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
the cake I like to texture the flowers a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.720 
the cake I like to texture the flowers a
little<00:03:05.370> bit<00:03:05.639> so<00:03:06.000> that's<00:03:06.209> what<00:03:06.420> I'm<00:03:06.510> doing<00:03:06.540> here

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.059 

and<00:03:10.030> then<00:03:10.360> go<00:03:10.599> ahead<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.870> add<00:03:11.319> them<00:03:11.620> wherever

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
and then go ahead and add them wherever

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.100 
and then go ahead and add them wherever
you<00:03:12.280> want<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.879> can<00:03:13.060> put<00:03:13.239> them<00:03:13.390> everywhere<00:03:13.569> I

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
you want you can put them everywhere I

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.809 
you want you can put them everywhere I
was<00:03:14.500> kind<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.830> running<00:03:15.040> out<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.610> yellow

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
was kind of running out of the yellow

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:31.320 
was kind of running out of the yellow
color<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.989> only<00:03:17.319> put<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.650> few<00:03:17.739> on<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.220> outside

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330 

all<00:03:32.330> right<00:03:32.600> this<00:03:33.200> is<00:03:33.410> how<00:03:33.560> mine<00:03:33.920> turned<00:03:34.069> out

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
all right this is how mine turned out

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.630 
all right this is how mine turned out
and<00:03:35.350> what<00:03:36.350> I<00:03:36.410> did<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.830> I<00:03:36.980> put<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.340> in<00:03:37.490> the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
and what I did is I put it in the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.820 
and what I did is I put it in the
refrigerator<00:03:38.209> for<00:03:38.360> ten<00:03:38.810> minutes<00:03:38.990> just<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.650> the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
refrigerator for ten minutes just so the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.699 
refrigerator for ten minutes just so the
clay<00:03:40.760> would<00:03:41.060> harden<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.510> bit<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:42.050> it<00:03:42.500> wouldn't

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
clay would harden a bit and it wouldn't

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.760 
clay would harden a bit and it wouldn't
smudge<00:03:42.980> when<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.280> sliced<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:45.350> go<00:03:45.500> ahead<00:03:45.620> and

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
smudge when I sliced it so go ahead and

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.220 
smudge when I sliced it so go ahead and
use<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.310> thin<00:03:46.880> blade<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.510> cut<00:03:47.989> out<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.140> slice<00:03:50.230> you

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
use a thin blade and cut out a slice you

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.050 
use a thin blade and cut out a slice you
can<00:03:51.260> cut<00:03:51.530> out<00:03:51.560> more<00:03:52.100> than<00:03:52.310> one<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:52.700> up<00:03:52.819> to<00:03:52.940> you

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
can cut out more than one it's up to you

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.160 
can cut out more than one it's up to you
and<00:03:54.340> use<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.489> needle<00:03:55.790> tool<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.569> add<00:03:56.870> some

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
and use the needle tool to add some

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.520 
and use the needle tool to add some
texture<00:03:57.530> I<00:04:01.120> usually<00:04:02.120> do<00:04:02.239> one<00:04:02.600> color<00:04:02.840> at<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.230> time

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
texture I usually do one color at a time

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.199 
texture I usually do one color at a time
so<00:04:03.800> they<00:04:03.920> don't<00:04:03.950> smudge<00:04:04.459> together<00:04:06.940> if<00:04:07.940> you'd

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
so they don't smudge together if you'd

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.270 
so they don't smudge together if you'd
like<00:04:08.390> your<00:04:08.600> cake<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.110> be<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.290> charm<00:04:09.650> go<00:04:10.040> ahead

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
a chain coming from the center of the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.420 
a chain coming from the center of the
cake<00:04:14.660> to<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.260> slice<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:15.860> that's<00:04:16.040> why<00:04:16.220> I<00:04:16.280> have

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
cake to the slice so that's why I have

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.259 
cake to the slice so that's why I have
extra<00:04:16.880> pins<00:04:17.090> there<00:04:17.329> in<00:04:17.450> my<00:04:17.600> photo<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:19.269> that's

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
extra pins there in my photo and that's

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:20.800 
extra pins there in my photo and that's
