00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
of one-dimensional and that could be an

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and well let's just say probably not as

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
on him and say look somebody else is

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.819 
on him and say look somebody else is
gonna<00:03:23.370> have<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.549> beat<00:03:23.760> us<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.320> doesn't<00:03:25.320> who's

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
gonna have to beat us and doesn't who's

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.979 
gonna have to beat us and doesn't who's
that<00:03:25.980> somebody<00:03:26.220> else<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:27.540> not<00:03:27.690> there<00:03:27.959> right

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
that somebody else it's not there right

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.390 
that somebody else it's not there right
now<00:03:28.290> with<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.590> injury<00:03:28.859> situation<00:03:29.069> at

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
now with the injury situation at

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.979 
now with the injury situation at
quarterback<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.060> from<00:03:30.510> what<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.660> saw<00:03:30.959> last

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
quarterback and from what I saw last

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.890 
quarterback and from what I saw last
week<00:03:31.500> Wilson<00:03:32.430> doesn't<00:03:32.609> trust<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.090> guys<00:03:33.269> on

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
week Wilson doesn't trust the guys on

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.110 
week Wilson doesn't trust the guys on
the<00:03:33.989> field<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:35.130> make<00:03:35.280> place<00:03:35.549> happen<00:03:35.910> with<00:03:36.000> his

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
the field to make place happen with his

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.090 
the field to make place happen with his
arm<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.290> know<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.590> sounds<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.040> a

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
arm so you know it sounds like a

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.460 
arm so you know it sounds like a
conservative<00:03:38.700> game<00:03:38.880> plan<00:03:39.230> Indiana<00:03:40.230> can't

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
conservative game plan Indiana can't

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.319 
conservative game plan Indiana can't
stop<00:03:40.680> anything<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.430> Penn<00:03:41.639> State<00:03:41.880> might<00:03:42.150> be

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
stop anything so Penn State might be

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.940 
stop anything so Penn State might be
able<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.660> generate<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:43.019> small<00:03:43.290> offense<00:03:43.530> here<00:03:43.799> I

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
able to generate a small offense here I

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.920 
able to generate a small offense here I
think<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:45.060> know<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.480> number<00:03:45.630> on<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
think it's you know the number on the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.770 
think it's you know the number on the
game<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.609> math<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.180> about<00:03:48.600> where

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
game just on the math is about where

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.629 
game just on the math is about where
it's<00:03:48.870> supposed<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.290> be<00:03:49.350> Penn<00:03:50.010> State<00:03:50.250> roughly<00:03:50.609> a

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
it's supposed to be Penn State roughly a

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.740 
it's supposed to be Penn State roughly a
touchdown<00:03:51.000> better<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.299> can<00:03:51.420> even<00:03:51.510> make<00:03:51.690> a

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
touchdown better you can even make a

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.740 
touchdown better you can even make a
case<00:03:52.019> that's<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.650> shade<00:03:52.920> high<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.090> math<00:03:54.269> my

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
case that's a shade high on the math my

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.800 
case that's a shade high on the math my
actual<00:03:55.380> number<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.889> on<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:57.180> calculations

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
actual number just on the calculations

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.440 
actual number just on the calculations
Penn<00:03:58.290> State<00:03:58.530> five<00:03:58.850> but<00:03:59.850> I'm<00:03:59.970> willing<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.269> lay<00:04:00.420> a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
Penn State five but I'm willing to lay a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.270 
Penn State five but I'm willing to lay a
little<00:04:00.660> more<00:04:00.810> than<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.049> here<00:04:01.319> because<00:04:02.040> of

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
little more than that here because of

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.210 
little more than that here because of
the<00:04:03.150> matchup<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.680> me<00:04:04.709> is<00:04:04.829> still

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the matchup and that to me is still

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.979 
the matchup and that to me is still
where<00:04:05.700> my<00:04:05.730> bread<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.150> butter<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.569> in<00:04:06.720> college

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
where my bread and butter is in college

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.809 
where my bread and butter is in college
football<00:04:07.139> in<00:04:07.859> college<00:04:07.920> basketball<00:04:08.340> as<00:04:08.670> well

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
football in college basketball as well

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.400 
football in college basketball as well
for<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.060> matter<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.569> is<00:04:09.870> doing<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.260> actual

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
for that matter it is doing the actual

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.470 
for that matter it is doing the actual
matchups<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.280> sometimes<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.060> overrides

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
matchups and sometimes that overrides

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.550 
matchups and sometimes that overrides
the<00:04:12.630> number<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:12.989> is<00:04:13.049> one<00:04:13.319> of<00:04:13.350> those<00:04:13.500> cases

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
the number this is one of those cases

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.949 
the number this is one of those cases
well<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.579> think<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.819> matchup<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.269> so<00:04:15.450> favorable

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
well I think the matchup is so favorable

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.710 
well I think the matchup is so favorable
for<00:04:16.350> Penn<00:04:16.500> State<00:04:16.799> in<00:04:17.180> it's<00:04:18.180> not<00:04:18.419> like<00:04:18.570> you're

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
for Penn State in it's not like you're

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.870 
for Penn State in it's not like you're
laying<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.079> ton<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.650> points<00:04:19.889> it's<00:04:20.220> still<00:04:20.280> you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
laying a ton of points it's still you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.450 
laying a ton of points it's still you
know<00:04:21.000> five<00:04:21.630> six<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.140> half<00:04:22.169> well<00:04:22.530> there's

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
know five six and a half well there's

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.800 
know five six and a half well there's
there's<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:23.820> difference<00:04:24.240> but<00:04:24.390> it's<00:04:24.510> not<00:04:24.659> the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
there's a difference but it's not the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.360 
there's a difference but it's not the
worst<00:04:25.320> key<00:04:25.590> number<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:25.950> all<00:04:26.070> time

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
worst key number of all time

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.520 
worst key number of all time
you<00:04:26.729> know<00:04:26.820> if<00:04:26.910> one<00:04:27.330> through<00:04:27.479> seven<00:04:27.750> that'd<00:04:28.500> be

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
you know if one through seven that'd be

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.840 
you know if one through seven that'd be
another<00:04:28.830> story<00:04:29.040> I'm<00:04:29.190> not<00:04:29.280> laying<00:04:29.430> seven<00:04:29.760> or

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
another story I'm not laying seven or

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.550 
another story I'm not laying seven or
seven<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.240> half<00:04:30.270> here<00:04:30.660> but<00:04:31.080> six<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.500> half

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
seven and a half here but six and a half

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.200 
seven and a half here but six and a half
i<00:04:31.830> think<00:04:32.040> is<00:04:32.130> livable<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.669> I'm<00:04:32.880> gonna<00:04:33.030> go<00:04:33.150> with

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
i think is livable and I'm gonna go with

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.939 
i think is livable and I'm gonna go with
Penn<00:04:33.389> State<00:04:33.660> minus<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.080> points<00:04:34.380> here<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.770> go

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
Penn State minus the points here you go
