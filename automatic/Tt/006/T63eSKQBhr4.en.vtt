the major features are carried

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.240 
the major features are carried
throughout<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.560> line<00:00:37.740> of<00:00:37.890> both<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.130> right

and left hand retreated with other
things<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.470> we've<00:00:40.680> done<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.040> we've<00:00:41.220> gotten

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
things that we've done is we've gotten

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.660 
things that we've done is we've gotten
with<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:41.880> new<00:00:42.570> technology<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:44.040> incorporates

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
with all new technology it incorporates

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.990 
with all new technology it incorporates
two<00:00:45.000> different<00:00:45.330> components<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:47.000> support

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
two different components one is support

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.460 
two different components one is support
here<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.720> get<00:00:48.840> water<00:00:49.170> or

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
here and so if you get water or

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.590 
here and so if you get water or
condensation<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.879> punch<00:00:51.120> through<00:00:51.420> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
condensation you can punch through this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.630 
condensation you can punch through this
let<00:00:52.290> it<00:00:52.410> air<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.340> other<00:00:53.430> thing<00:00:53.610> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
let it air out the other thing that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
let it air out the other thing that
we've<00:00:53.850> got<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.720> behind<00:00:55.080> counter<00:00:55.470> Lance

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
we've got is on the behind counter Lance

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.740 
we've got is on the behind counter Lance
it's<00:00:56.280> actually<00:00:56.670> coating<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> special

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it's actually coating the special

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.950 
it's actually coating the special
protection<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.830> helps<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.390> if<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.540> compare

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
protection it helps it if you compare

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.900 
protection it helps it if you compare
this<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.440> any<00:01:01.739> other<00:01:01.830> line

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
this to any other line

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.930 
this to any other line
producing<00:01:03.660> past<00:01:04.020> the<00:01:04.710> major<00:01:05.010> difference<00:01:05.670> not

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
producing past the major difference not

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.670 
producing past the major difference not
going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.510> filled<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> blog<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
going to get that filled of the blog and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.539 
going to get that filled of the blog and
a<00:01:07.770> semi<00:01:08.400> traditional<00:01:09.030> kind<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.060 

another<00:01:12.509> thing<00:01:12.840> we've<00:01:13.020> done<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.740> line

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
another thing we've done on all the line

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.859 
another thing we've done on all the line
counter<00:01:14.460> models<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.299> change<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
counter models is that we change the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.499 
counter models is that we change the
reset<00:01:16.289> location<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.130> want<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.609> reset<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
reset location so you want to reset and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020 
reset location so you want to reset and
drop<00:01:18.719> it<00:01:18.869> back<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.170> zero<00:01:19.469> and<00:01:19.829> the<00:01:20.310> past<00:01:20.579> is<00:01:20.850> up

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
drop it back to zero and the past is up

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.169 
drop it back to zero and the past is up
on<00:01:21.179> the<00:01:21.270> top<00:01:21.329> the<00:01:21.869> proper<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:24.060> can

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
on the top the proper that is it you can

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.359 
on the top the proper that is it you can
get<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.509> green<00:01:24.659> water<00:01:25.380> into<00:01:25.829> the<00:01:25.920> real<00:01:26.100> thing

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
get the green water into the real thing

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.940 
get the green water into the real thing
off<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.149> side<00:01:27.359> it's<00:01:27.539> a<00:01:27.630> lot<00:01:27.840> harder<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.860> get

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
off to the side it's a lot harder to get

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.490 
off to the side it's a lot harder to get
material<00:01:29.850> inside<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:30.929> not<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.319> come

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
material inside there I'm not gonna come

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
material inside there I'm not gonna come
on<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.130> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> make<00:01:32.459> you'll<00:01:32.610> encounter

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
on it's kind of make you'll encounter

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.899 
on it's kind of make you'll encounter
just<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.539> a<00:01:33.929> lot<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.619> user-friendly<00:01:34.979> also

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
just be a lot more user-friendly also

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.600 
just be a lot more user-friendly also
much<00:01:36.149> more<00:01:36.420> durable<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:38.069> pulled<00:01:38.369> water

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
much more durable the pulled water

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.550 
much more durable the pulled water
wheels<00:01:38.880> feature<00:01:39.479> three<00:01:39.899> bearings<00:01:40.289> so<00:01:40.469> you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
wheels feature three bearings so you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.080 
wheels feature three bearings so you
have<00:01:40.649> two<00:01:40.860> stainless<00:01:41.189> steel<00:01:41.520> ball<00:01:41.670> bearings

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
have two stainless steel ball bearings

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.999 
have two stainless steel ball bearings
plus<00:01:42.420> roller<00:01:42.810> bearing<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> infinite<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
plus roller bearing for the infinite and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.859 
plus roller bearing for the infinite and
reverse<00:01:44.250> feature<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.239> they<00:01:45.390> also<00:01:45.539> have<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
reverse feature but they also have a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
reverse feature but they also have a
backup<00:01:46.140> system<00:01:46.349> so<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.549> fill

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
backup system so you got to fill

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.169 
backup system so you got to fill
universes<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.539> working<00:01:48.989> simultaneously
