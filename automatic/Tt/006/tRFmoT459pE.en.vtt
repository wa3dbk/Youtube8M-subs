so<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.890> don't<00:02:12.160> know<00:02:12.370> two<00:02:12.700> packs<00:02:12.970> doesn't<00:02:13.540> really

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
so I don't know two packs doesn't really

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.470 
so I don't know two packs doesn't really
seem<00:02:14.140> like<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.530> odds<00:02:14.710> are<00:02:15.010> they're<00:02:15.240> two<00:02:16.240> packs

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
seem like the odds are they're two packs

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.420 
seem like the odds are they're two packs
doesn't<00:02:16.750> really<00:02:16.870> end<00:02:17.050> up<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.260> judge<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.310> we're

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
doesn't really end up to judge so we're

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.650 
doesn't really end up to judge so we're
gonna<00:02:18.520> go<00:02:18.670> ahead<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.850> open<00:02:19.060> up<00:02:19.120> our<00:02:19.240> last<00:02:19.360> pack

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.760 
boy so I'm actually expecting it to be a
little<00:02:24.970> bit<00:02:25.360> better<00:02:25.570> than<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> gold<00:02:26.110> but

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
little bit better than the gold but

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.520 
little bit better than the gold but
nothing<00:02:27.310> close<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:28.140> diamond<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.230> course

the other MMO players are a little bit

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.150 
the other MMO players are a little bit

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
Carver we're looking for we're looking

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.650 
Carver we're looking for we're looking
for<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.510> cards<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.900> were<00:02:43.990> just<00:02:44.380> before<00:02:44.800> this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
for the cards that were just before this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.170 
for the cards that were just before this
you<00:02:46.660> know<00:02:46.750> what<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:46.900> may<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:47.470> even<00:02:47.740> be<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
you know what I may not even be in the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.520 
you know what I may not even be in the
packs<00:02:49.450> now<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:49.960> think<00:02:50.080> about<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.440> you

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
packs now that I think about it you

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.980 
packs now that I think about it you
might<00:02:50.890> have<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.850> complete<00:02:52.240> it<00:02:52.480> just<00:02:52.660> based<00:02:52.840> off

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
might have to complete it just based off

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.380 
might have to complete it just based off
of<00:02:53.050> my<00:02:53.410> knowledge<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:54.030> what<00:02:55.030> they<00:02:55.150> might<00:02:55.180> be

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
of my knowledge of what they might be

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.060 
of my knowledge of what they might be
doing<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.930> think<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.470> might<00:02:56.560> happen<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.890> play

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
doing I think you might happen to play

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.610 
doing I think you might happen to play
both<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.670> historic<00:02:58.270> Cavaliers<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
both the historic Cavaliers and the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.260 
both the historic Cavaliers and the
normal<00:03:00.100> Cavaliers<00:03:00.520> collection<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.060> get<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
normal Cavaliers collection to get the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.800 
normal Cavaliers collection to get the
LeBron<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.840> would<00:03:02.380> imagine<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:03.130> would<00:03:03.400> be<00:03:03.550> so

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
LeBron I would imagine that would be so

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.180 
LeBron I would imagine that would be so
but<00:03:04.810> uh<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:05.440> don't<00:03:05.590> know<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.830> since<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.070> have<00:03:06.160> a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
but uh I don't know it since you have a

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.070 
but uh I don't know it since you have a
chance<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.550> pull<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.880> so<00:03:07.090> we're<00:03:07.840> gonna<00:03:07.930> go

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
chance to pull it so we're gonna go

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.630 
chance to pull it so we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.260> keep<00:03:08.410> pulling<00:03:08.770> we<00:03:09.310> have<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> couple

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
ahead and keep pulling we have a couple

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.440 
ahead and keep pulling we have a couple
of<00:03:10.680> opportunities<00:03:11.680> here<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.610> pick<00:03:13.060> sell<00:03:13.270> some

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
of opportunities here to pick sell some

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.480 
of opportunities here to pick sell some
players<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:14.140> guess<00:03:14.950> we'll<00:03:15.070> go<00:03:15.130> ahead<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.340> click

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
players I guess we'll go ahead and click
