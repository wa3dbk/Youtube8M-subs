00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 the turbo veloster was spotted in tests 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.290
 here in brazil in the city of brasilia 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.330
 here a photo of the car is being 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.460
 tested here in the country, right? 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.820
 detail for the double ferrule 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.060
 exhaust in the center of the bumper 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.890
 this is a temporary escape , right? 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.840
 the manufacturing car is a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 chrome tip here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.699
 It's a lot better than this leak. 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.710
 here's the photo but what I want to talk about 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.230
 about this car here because I gave 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.420
 it took so long to bring the veloster 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.850
 turbo that Brazil is not 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.920
 it took too long, hyundai started to 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.170
 import this car a few years ago here 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.800
 to prepare the country and she started 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.160
 bringing that 1.6 the same engine used 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.879
 no hb 20 no flex do not remember nor will 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.219
 flex at the time she was wearing the veloster 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.469
 but it's a very weak engine think cars 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.960
 and too big house is too heavy for 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.510
 engine then this engine burned the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.790
 Veloster movie in Brazil is not a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.820
 very expensive car was sold in the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.430
 time for 90 thousand reais the color white 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.939
 it cost more 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.950
 five thousand reais more expensive at last was a 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.320
 absurd the price of that car and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.030
 Consumers who bought just 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.450
 taking a monkey because the car does not 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.509
 I was not very well, I did not live up to the name of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.340
 speed on tv lost was just in name and 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.990
 earned multiple nicknames 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.420
 because of his vagueness then 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 I only tried to play now 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.520
 veloster because the sales practically 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.159
 they stopped the car not exhausting 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.380
 I did not sell almost anything so what they 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.119
 discontinued a car that did not 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.869
 country and are now testing the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.540
 will start to import now already 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.360
 with 2015 conversion 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.250
 the turbo version is that the 1.6 turbo engine 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:07.800
 of direct injection of 204 horses 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.950
 is this here is the veloster turbo nÃ© he 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.890
 he is a very complete car and comes with 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.660
 headlamps with charge leds for 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.910
 directional xenon at last that already says 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.459
 the rear is also led here details 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.530
 light headlights bring this already said that the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.110
 detail hyundai by sunroof 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.209
 that come up here behind 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.660
 detail the leakage that I said it is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.120
 much more beautiful in the photo 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.870
 so it says you're still going to lose 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.300
 too expensive for this car, you're not going to leave 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.580
 and I kicked 1 100 thousand reais 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.530
 but as I did it took forever to 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.760
 bring this veloster shift here from 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.739
 Brazil 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.770
 I do not think he's going to sell either. 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.709
 wheels 18 because you have competition now 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.600
 market and with the strongest engine there 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.489
 huh 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.739
 Yeah, let's see, shall we? 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.600
 the design of the car still really pleases 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.360
 a few years after his 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.700
 your design still pleases 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.190
 then it may be that with this new version 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.340
 turbo detail here written on the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.860
 door cover may be that with 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.480
 this turbo version sales will again be 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.299
 interesting for none of them 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.209
 in fact neither me nor caoc brings this 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.930
 car for the import here is directly from the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.820
 korea here so that's not now 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.070
 I believe that by the end of the year this 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.440
 car will show up at dealerships 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.110
 from hyundai 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.750
 detail with the direct management engine 1.6 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.190
 turbo 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.380
 I do not know if he 'll come flex from Brazil. 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:50.299
 difficult will see only with gasoline same 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.680
 exchange six - speed short screen 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.170
 so we have to wait until now. 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.190
 the official launch of this car here in the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.650
 Brazil, right? 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.260
 but you can expect starting from 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.209
 100 thousand reais, that's what I had to 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.209
 speak up to the next video
