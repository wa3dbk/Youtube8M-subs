00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
thought that was amazing an average of

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.220 
thought that was amazing an average of
12.4<00:01:58.770> pounds<00:01:59.160> per<00:01:59.310> day<00:01:59.610> ACG<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.690> truth<00:02:00.960> we

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
12.4 pounds per day ACG is the truth we

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.110 
12.4 pounds per day ACG is the truth we
all<00:02:01.410> knew<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.980> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.790> don't<00:02:02.970> know<00:02:03.030> by

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
all knew this right if you don't know by

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.440 
all knew this right if you don't know by
now<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.720> now<00:02:03.930> right<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.530> know<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.890> um

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
now you know now right you know this um

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.850 
now you know now right you know this um
so<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.510> was<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.660> an<00:02:06.810> average<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.440> point

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
so it was like an average of like point

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.000 
so it was like an average of like point
60<00:02:08.310> pound<00:02:08.580> per<00:02:08.790> person<00:02:09.270> per<00:02:09.600> day<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.830> think

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
60 pound per person per day so I think

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.990 
60 pound per person per day so I think
that<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.550> uh<00:02:11.760> no<00:02:12.630> no<00:02:13.370> absolutely<00:02:14.370> phenomenal

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000
