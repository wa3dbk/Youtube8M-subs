00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
happens to be 0.618 and I started

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.630 
happens to be 0.618 and I started
relating<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.900> tooth<00:01:21.900> itself<00:01:22.250> also<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
relating it to the tooth itself also to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.179 
relating it to the tooth itself also to
the<00:01:24.000> relationship<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.900> each<00:01:25.200> tooth<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the relationship of each tooth to the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.600 
the relationship of each tooth to the
other<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> when<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.409> started<00:01:28.950> using<00:01:29.220> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
other so when I started using this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.480 
other so when I started using this
phenomenon<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.720> practice<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.680> saw<00:01:32.189> amazing
