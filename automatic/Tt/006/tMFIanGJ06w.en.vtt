on donor odds pronouncing something I've
been<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> try<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.260> what

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
you need to do to place it down in the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.729 
you need to do to place it down in the
sea<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.539> Walter<00:01:04.049> basically<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.500> place<00:01:04.710> it

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
sea or on Walter basically just place it

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.590 
sea or on Walter basically just place it
down<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:05.610> press<00:01:05.880> eight<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> pick<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.450> up

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
down and then press eight to pick it up

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
down and then press eight to pick it up
again<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.200> some<00:01:07.439> reason<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:08.040> would

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
again and for some reason it would

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.609 
again and for some reason it would
actually<00:01:08.729> change<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> sky<00:01:09.540> lift<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
actually change to a sky lift and the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.109 
actually change to a sky lift and the
math<00:01:10.770> once<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.400> awesome<00:01:11.520> glitchers

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
math once was a really awesome glitchers

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
math once was a really awesome glitchers
I'm<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.200> something<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> can

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
I'm see it's not something that you can

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.070 
I'm see it's not something that you can
now<00:01:14.580> i'ma<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.600> make<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> little

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
now i'ma get so you can make a little

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.539 
now i'ma get so you can make a little
deaf<00:01:16.229> much<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.830> make<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> little<00:01:17.130> mark<00:01:17.310> with

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
deaf much just make a little mark with

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.039 
deaf much just make a little mark with
them<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.939> then<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:18.630> friends<00:01:18.930> can
