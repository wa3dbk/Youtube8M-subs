00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.310 

Connie<00:02:10.460> questions<00:02:10.940> were<00:02:11.180> traded<00:02:11.750> look<00:02:12.110> I

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
Connie questions were traded look I

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.790 
Connie questions were traded look I
think<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.800> use<00:02:12.950> my<00:02:13.160> book<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.910> one<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.800> have

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
think I use my book on this one I have

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.780 
think I use my book on this one I have
to<00:02:15.950> trap<00:02:16.160> already<00:02:16.460> in<00:02:16.550> my<00:02:16.640> hand<00:02:18.370> maybe<00:02:19.370> silence

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
to trap already in my hand maybe silence

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:28.930 
to trap already in my hand maybe silence
is<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.410> it's<00:02:21.410> not<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.710> worst

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:43.900 

think<00:02:29.480> that's<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.780> pretty<00:02:29.960> good<00:02:30.170> draw

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.840 

some<00:02:44.910> culture<00:02:45.300> enough<00:02:46.070> is<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.220> question<00:02:47.610> like

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
some culture enough is the question like

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.570 
some culture enough is the question like
I<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:49.410> draw<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> card<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.160> draw<00:02:50.370> another

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
I have I can draw a card I draw another

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.600 
I have I can draw a card I draw another
card<00:02:51.140> do<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.170> need<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.350> proc<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.860> mad<00:02:53.160> scientist

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
card do I need to proc the mad scientist

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.580 
card do I need to proc the mad scientist
here<00:02:53.820> we<00:02:54.150> need<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.450> draw<00:02:54.630> two<00:02:54.690> cards<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.380> have

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
here we need to draw two cards and have

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.330 
here we need to draw two cards and have
no<00:02:55.770> board<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:57.170> think<00:02:58.170> what<00:02:58.530> progress<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.310> know

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
no board I think what progress you know

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.320 
no board I think what progress you know
should<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.910> enough

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.770 

we<00:03:06.870> use<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.230> point<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.710> play<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.100> freezing

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
we use the point to play the freezing

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.300 
we use the point to play the freezing
things<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:09.990> I<00:03:10.320> can<00:03:11.250> own<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.550> coin<00:03:11.820> for<00:03:12.090> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
things so I can own the coin for the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:23.260 
things so I can own the coin for the
Dalek<00:03:14.310> straÃŸe

really<00:05:38.110> hard<00:05:38.320> because<00:05:38.710> then<00:05:39.040> I<00:05:39.070> my<00:05:39.340> ball<00:05:39.610> is

gone

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:06:06.360 

although<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.560> still<00:05:48.650> has<00:05:48.890> to<00:05:48.920> do<00:05:49.190> with<00:05:49.310> my<00:05:49.490> boy

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:20.980 

actually<00:06:07.270> a<00:06:07.300> very<00:06:07.479> weird<00:06:07.840> scenario<00:06:11.190> because

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.659 

only<00:06:21.990> four<00:06:22.319> I<00:06:22.469> can't<00:06:22.709> really<00:06:22.999> dangerous<00:06:23.999> sport

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
only four I can't really dangerous sport

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:31.369 
only four I can't really dangerous sport
very<00:06:26.669> weird<00:06:28.819> way<00:06:29.819> I<00:06:30.059> cannot<00:06:30.360> have<00:06:30.689> little<00:06:31.169> I

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:31.379 
very weird way I cannot have little I

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:36.109 
very weird way I cannot have little I
guess<00:06:31.999> if<00:06:34.069> the<00:06:35.069> bomb<00:06:35.339> doesn't<00:06:35.550> kill<00:06:35.969> my

00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:36.119 
guess if the bomb doesn't kill my

00:06:36.119 --> 00:07:08.920 
guess if the bomb doesn't kill my
minions

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.930 

I<00:07:09.020> think<00:07:09.740> that<00:07:09.860> should<00:07:10.039> be<00:07:10.100> enough<00:07:10.430> it's

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
I think that should be enough it's

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.820 
I think that should be enough it's
probably<00:07:11.060> like<00:07:11.300> the<00:07:11.389> best<00:07:11.570> way<00:07:11.750> to<00:07:11.810> do<00:07:11.990> it<00:07:14.830> not

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 
probably like the best way to do it not

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.969 
probably like the best way to do it not
a<00:07:15.860> bum<00:07:16.130> can't<00:07:16.430> kill<00:07:16.669> the<00:07:16.820> guy<00:07:17.030> for<00:07:17.330> sure<00:07:20.979> lastly

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:21.979 
a bum can't kill the guy for sure lastly

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:27.460 
a bum can't kill the guy for sure lastly
