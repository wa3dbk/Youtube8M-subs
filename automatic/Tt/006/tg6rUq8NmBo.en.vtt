playing a nice hip-hop groove is really

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.180 
playing a nice hip-hop groove is really
determined<00:00:08.309> by<00:00:08.790> how<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.059> approach<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:10.040> we<00:00:11.040> got

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
determined by how we approach it we got

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.789 
determined by how we approach it we got
to<00:00:11.280> create<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.670> right<00:00:11.820> field<00:00:12.270> in<00:00:12.750> order<00:00:13.559> for

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
to create the right field in order for

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.939 
to create the right field in order for
it<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.039> move<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.549> way<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:14.820> wanted<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.800> so<00:00:16.800> we

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
it to move the way we wanted to so we

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.349 
it to move the way we wanted to so we
first<00:00:17.100> got<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.400> understand<00:00:17.789> where<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.180> came

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
first got to understand where it came

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.159 
first got to understand where it came
from<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:19.020> can<00:00:19.230> approach<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.770> right<00:00:19.830> way

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
from so we can approach it the right way

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.489 
from so we can approach it the right way
hip-hop<00:00:22.169> is<00:00:22.490> sort<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.550> an<00:00:23.669> extension<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:24.660> jazz

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499 
hip-hop is sort of an extension of jazz

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.300 
hip-hop is sort of an extension of jazz
music<00:00:25.949> which<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.089> why<00:00:27.679> the<00:00:28.679> marriage<00:00:29.130> between

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
music which is why the marriage between

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.210 
music which is why the marriage between
hip-hop<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.939> jazz<00:00:30.140> works<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.409> well<00:00:31.650> it's

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
hip-hop and jazz works so well it's

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.850 
hip-hop and jazz works so well it's
because<00:00:32.400> I<00:00:32.460> started<00:00:32.759> from<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.910> same<00:00:33.150> family

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
because I started from the same family

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.160 
because I started from the same family
so<00:00:34.860> when<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.160> go<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:36.329> play<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> lot<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.080> these

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
so when we go to play a lot of these

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.270 
so when we go to play a lot of these
hip-hop<00:00:37.680> grooves<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> drum<00:00:39.450> kit<00:00:40.100> we<00:00:41.100> can

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
hip-hop grooves on a drum kit we can

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.210 
hip-hop grooves on a drum kit we can
actually<00:00:41.670> use<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.840> jazz<00:00:43.170> swing<00:00:43.650> as<00:00:43.950> a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:56.540 

and<00:01:37.560> we're<00:01:37.680> throwing<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.070> backbeat<00:01:55.550> let

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
and we're throwing that backbeat let

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:18.050 
and we're throwing that backbeat let
that<00:01:56.759> kick<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.720> three<00:02:17.060> you're
