all<00:00:00.480> right<00:00:00.659> I've<00:00:00.780> recently<00:00:01.110> put<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.260> bunch<00:00:01.469> of

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
all right I've recently put a bunch of

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.869 
all right I've recently put a bunch of
Python<00:00:01.860> game<00:00:02.310> theory<00:00:02.639> code<00:00:03.110> up<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:04.700> github<00:00:05.700> so

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
Python game theory code up on github so

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.400 
Python game theory code up on github so
here's<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.180> quick<00:00:06.330> video<00:00:06.569> showing<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:07.049> other

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
here's a quick video showing one other

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.680 
here's a quick video showing one other
pieces<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.890> code<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.189> allows<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> study

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
pieces of code that allows you to study

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.780 
pieces of code that allows you to study
emergent<00:00:10.650> behavior<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.340> normal<00:00:11.910> phone<00:00:12.090> games

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
emergent behavior in normal phone games

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.609 
emergent behavior in normal phone games
using<00:00:14.790> an<00:00:14.969> agent-based<00:00:15.350> modeling<00:00:16.350> approach

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
using an agent-based modeling approach

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.750 
using an agent-based modeling approach
so<00:00:17.930> here's<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.020> prisoner's<00:00:19.380> dilemma<00:00:19.760> assume

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
so here's a prisoner's dilemma assume

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.910 
so here's a prisoner's dilemma assume
you're<00:00:20.880> trying<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> maximize<00:00:21.240> your<00:00:21.920> your

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
you're trying to maximize your your

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.310 
you're trying to maximize your your
utility<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.330> social<00:00:24.630> optimal<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.170> when

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
utility and the social optimal is when

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
utility and the social optimal is when
both<00:00:25.529> players<00:00:26.130> would<00:00:26.279> cooperate<00:00:26.519> they'd<00:00:27.180> get

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
both players would cooperate they'd get

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.540 
both players would cooperate they'd get
a<00:00:27.390> four<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.429> however<00:00:30.260> if<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:32.040> soon<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.520> of

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
a four and however if as soon as one of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.420 
a four and however if as soon as one of
us<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.570> I'm<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> role<00:00:34.469> player<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.010> I'm

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
us is if I'm a role player and I'm

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.580 
us is if I'm a role player and I'm
cooperating<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.899> your<00:00:37.020> interest<00:00:37.440> as<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
cooperating it's in your interest as a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.040 
cooperating it's in your interest as a
column<00:00:37.890> player<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.309> defect<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.899> in

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
column player to defect and then it's in

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.479 
column player to defect and then it's in
my<00:00:40.079> interest<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.620> defect<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.340> that's

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
my interest to defect and so that's

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.880 
my interest to defect and so that's
that's<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.850> Nash<00:00:42.000> equilibria<00:00:42.590> there<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.710> now

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that's a Nash equilibria there are now

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.400 
that's a Nash equilibria there are now
there's<00:00:44.100> lots<00:00:44.610> resources<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.750> study<00:00:46.260> those

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
there's lots resources to study those

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.049 
there's lots resources to study those
types<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> games<00:00:47.059> theoretically

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
types of games theoretically

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
types of games theoretically
analytically<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.379> want<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> show<00:00:49.710> one

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
analytically but I want to show one

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.670 
analytically but I want to show one
particular<00:00:50.250> way<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:50.520> allows<00:00:50.550> us<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.000> use

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
particular way which allows us to use

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.830 
particular way which allows us to use
your<00:00:52.680> simulation<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.629> here's<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> basic

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
your simulation so here's the basic

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.709 
your simulation so here's the basic
algorithm<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.210> there's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.270> great<00:00:57.449> book<00:00:57.660> that

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
algorithm and there's a great book that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.479 
algorithm and there's a great book that
I'll<00:00:58.020> put<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> description<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
I'll put in the description of this

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.170 
I'll put in the description of this
video<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.359> explains<00:01:00.690> explains<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
video that explains explains this and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
video that explains explains this and
you<00:01:03.180> create<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.480> agents<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.229> row<00:01:04.409> agent

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
you create your agents so row agent

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.230 
you create your agents so row agent
cotton<00:01:05.100> column<00:01:05.400> agents<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:06.060> your

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
cotton column agents so that way your

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880 
cotton column agents so that way your
games<00:01:06.689> don't<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> same<00:01:07.380> size<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
games don't have to be the same size you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
games don't have to be the same size you
can<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.250> different<00:01:09.119> strategies<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.659> your

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
can have different strategies for your

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.740 
can have different strategies for your
rows<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.110> your<00:01:10.200> columns<00:01:10.970> players<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.270> now

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
rows and your columns players and now

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.640 
rows and your columns players and now
for<00:01:13.409> every<00:01:13.619> generation<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:16.380> play<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
for every generation and you play a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.200 
for every generation and you play a
certain<00:01:18.470> amount<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.650> rounds<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.700> by<00:01:21.090> those

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
certain amount of rounds and by those

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
certain amount of rounds and by those
rounds<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.900> mean<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.380> randomly<00:01:22.830> match<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
rounds we mean that we randomly match a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
rounds we mean that we randomly match a
row<00:01:23.490> agent<00:01:23.850> against<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> column<00:01:24.450> agent<00:01:24.750> we

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
row agent against the column agent we

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.740 
row agent against the column agent we
update<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.369> utilities<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
update the the utilities and the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.120 
update the the utilities and the
utilities<00:01:28.259> are<00:01:29.030> dictated<00:01:30.030> by<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.590> strategies

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
utilities are dictated by the strategies

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740 
utilities are dictated by the strategies
that<00:01:32.159> are<00:01:32.400> corresponding<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> row<00:01:33.299> agents

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that are corresponding to the row agents

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.080 
that are corresponding to the row agents
and<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.710> column<00:01:34.950> agents<00:01:35.280> each<00:01:35.579> row<00:01:35.759> agent

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and the column agents each row agent

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
and the column agents each row agent
coming<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.540> corresponds<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> row<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.409> column

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
coming in corresponds to row and column

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280 
coming in corresponds to row and column
strategy<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.299> play<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> bit<00:01:39.689> here<00:01:39.840> around

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
strategy so you play a bit here around

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.420 
strategy so you play a bit here around
of<00:01:40.439> these<00:01:40.560> tournaments<00:01:40.829> once<00:01:41.250> those

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
of these tournaments once those

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.580 
of these tournaments once those
tournaments<00:01:41.670> are<00:01:41.850> done<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.869> remove<00:01:43.170> remove

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
tournaments are done you remove remove

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.620 
tournaments are done you remove remove
the<00:01:43.740> weak<00:01:43.890> agents<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.820> reproduce<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the weak agents and you reproduce the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.999 
the weak agents and you reproduce the
strong<00:01:45.869> agents<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.470> very<00:01:46.619> important<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
strong agents and it's very important to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.450 
strong agents and it's very important to
allow<00:01:47.130> mutation<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.530> whilst<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.979> strong

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
allow mutation so whilst the strong

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.889 
allow mutation so whilst the strong
agent<00:01:50.790> might<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:50.970> an<00:01:51.210> agent<00:01:51.509> who<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.810> our

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
agent might be an agent who in our

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.149 
agent might be an agent who in our
previous<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> game<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.890> prisoner's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
previous in the game in the prisoner's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.980 
previous in the game in the prisoner's
dilemma<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> defector<00:01:54.420> there's<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
dilemma is a defector there's a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
dilemma is a defector there's a
probability<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.979> he'll<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.310> mutate

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
probability that he'll actually mutate

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.740 
probability that he'll actually mutate
and<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.860> cooperator<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:00.570> I'll<00:02:00.630> just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and be a cooperator so now I'll just

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.749 
and be a cooperator so now I'll just
demonstrate<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.409> little<00:02:02.189> bit<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.460> code<00:02:02.640> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
demonstrate a little bit of code that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.039 
demonstrate a little bit of code that
I've<00:02:02.850> written<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.210> allows<00:02:03.509> us<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.659> play<00:02:03.899> with

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
I've written that allows us to play with

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
I've written that allows us to play with
this<00:02:04.170> okay<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.520> here's<00:02:05.700> both<00:02:05.909> from<00:02:06.090> my

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
this okay so here's both from my

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.760 
this okay so here's both from my
computer<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.780> first<00:02:07.170> things<00:02:07.320> first<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.680> an

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
computer so first things first of an

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.070 
computer so first things first of an
import<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:09.149> IBM<00:02:09.420> library<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.780> I've<00:02:09.869> created

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
import the IBM library that I've created

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.670 
import the IBM library that I've created
and<00:02:11.810> we're<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.020> build

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and we're going to build

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.819 
and we're going to build
some<00:02:14.480> some<00:02:15.480> input<00:02:15.750> parameters<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.409> number<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
some some input parameters a number of

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.819 
some some input parameters a number of
agents<00:02:17.459> we're<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.879> play<00:02:18.030> around<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.420> a

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
agents we're going to play around with a

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.069 
agents we're going to play around with a
thousand<00:02:19.829> agents<00:02:20.219> and<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.780> number<00:02:22.019> of

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
thousand agents and the number of

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.509 
thousand agents and the number of
generations<00:02:22.439> we're<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.099> going<00:02:23.219> to<00:02:23.280> simulate

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
generations we're just going to simulate

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.929 
generations we're just going to simulate
two<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:25.140> 50<00:02:25.469> generations<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.359> the<00:02:27.359> rounds<00:02:27.840> per

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
two to 50 generations and the rounds per

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:36.020 
two to 50 generations and the rounds per
generation<00:02:30.799> is<00:02:31.799> going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.459> five<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:35.040> death

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
generation is going to be five the death

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.740 
generation is going to be five the death
rate<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.769> going<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.829> be<00:02:37.889> point<00:02:38.129> 1<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.730> then<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
rate is going to be point 1 and then the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.399 
rate is going to be point 1 and then the
mutation<00:02:40.469> mutation<00:02:41.750> rate<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.019> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> be

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
mutation mutation rate is going to be

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.360 
mutation mutation rate is going to be
point<00:02:43.969> 2<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:46.079> first<00:02:46.230> things<00:02:46.470> first<00:02:46.530> let's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
point 2 so first things first let's

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.369 
point 2 so first things first let's
simulate<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.900> prisoner's<00:02:49.799> dilemma<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:51.379> we'll

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
simulate a prisoner's dilemma so we'll

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.780 
simulate a prisoner's dilemma so we'll
use<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.709> same<00:02:54.919> same<00:02:55.919> payoff<00:02:56.099> matrix<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.609> just

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
use the same same payoff matrix I just

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.319 
use the same same payoff matrix I just
described<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.409> 5<00:02:58.409> 2<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.090> column<00:03:00.090> matrix<00:03:02.329> is

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
described so 5 2 and column matrix is

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:13.670 
described so 5 2 and column matrix is
very<00:03:03.659> similar<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.230> 4<00:03:05.329> 5<00:03:06.329> +<00:03:07.459> +<00:03:08.569> 0<00:03:10.639> 2<00:03:11.639> and<00:03:12.290> then<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
very similar so 4 5 + + 0 2 and then the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.569 
very similar so 4 5 + + 0 2 and then the
we<00:03:14.129> now<00:03:14.280> create<00:03:14.579> an<00:03:14.819> instance<00:03:15.419> of<00:03:15.889> an<00:03:16.889> ABI

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
we now create an instance of an ABI

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.809 
we now create an instance of an ABI
model<00:03:18.919> it's<00:03:19.919> a<00:03:19.949> fair<00:03:20.129> bit<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.310> code<00:03:20.489> but<00:03:20.639> just

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
model it's a fair bit of code but just

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.199 
model it's a fair bit of code but just
takes<00:03:21.000> up<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.560> inputs<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.620> your<00:03:22.769> previously

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
takes up the inputs of your previously

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.030 
takes up the inputs of your previously
and<00:03:24.209> when<00:03:24.299> we<00:03:24.419> run<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:25.769> then<00:03:25.919> to

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
and when we run that and then to

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.890 
and when we run that and then to
actually<00:03:26.190> simulate<00:03:26.879> we<00:03:27.419> just<00:03:27.599> use<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
actually simulate we just use the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.879 
actually simulate we just use the
simulate<00:03:28.260> method<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:28.739> G<00:03:28.919> dot<00:03:29.129> simulate<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.680> as

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
simulate method so G dot simulate and as

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.170 
simulate method so G dot simulate and as
you<00:03:32.040> see<00:03:32.220> there<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:34.079> emergent<00:03:34.439> behaviors

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
you see there the emergent behaviors

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.140 
you see there the emergent behaviors
appearing<00:03:36.180> very<00:03:36.299> very<00:03:37.310> quickly<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.970> gain

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
appearing very very quickly so the gain

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.199 
appearing very very quickly so the gain
that<00:03:39.180> converges<00:03:39.750> very<00:03:39.870> quickly<00:03:40.699> if<00:03:41.699> I<00:03:41.849> if<00:03:42.120> I

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
that converges very quickly if I if I

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.319 
that converges very quickly if I if I
scroll<00:03:42.540> up<00:03:42.599> I<00:03:43.489> see<00:03:44.489> when<00:03:44.669> this<00:03:44.759> is<00:03:44.879> created

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329

the<00:03:56.430> agents<00:03:56.909> seem<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.269> be<00:03:57.419> all<00:03:57.659> of<00:03:58.379> the<00:03:58.500> second

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
persuasion in other words they were all

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.339 
persuasion in other words they were all
defecting<00:04:00.930> which<00:04:01.169> is<00:04:01.290> what<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:01.620> expect<00:04:03.139> if<00:04:04.139> you

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
defecting which is what we expect if you

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.399 
defecting which is what we expect if you
have<00:04:04.439> matplotlib<00:04:05.009> on<00:04:05.430> your<00:04:05.549> machine<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:07.290> can

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
have matplotlib on your machine you can

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.219 
have matplotlib on your machine you can
use<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.680> plot<00:04:07.889> equals<00:04:08.069> true<00:04:08.430> method<00:04:09.139> and<00:04:10.139> if

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.229 
use the plot equals true method and if

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.080 
use the plot equals true method and if
you<00:04:10.349> simulate<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.889> it<00:04:11.400> appears<00:04:11.729> exactly<00:04:11.849> the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
you simulate that it appears exactly the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.969 
you simulate that it appears exactly the
same<00:04:12.269> here<00:04:12.509> but<00:04:13.229> what's<00:04:13.349> actually<00:04:13.500> happening

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
same here but what's actually happening

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:20.390 
same here but what's actually happening
is<00:04:16.220> is<00:04:17.220> those<00:04:17.430> being<00:04:17.699> dynamically<00:04:19.250> plotted<00:04:20.250> I

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
is is those being dynamically plotted I

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.209 
is is those being dynamically plotted I
didn't<00:04:21.090> reset<00:04:21.299> G<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:22.590> was<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.710> mistake<00:04:22.830> I

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
didn't reset G that was a mistake I

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.740 
didn't reset G that was a mistake I
didn't<00:04:23.490> reset<00:04:23.610> G<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.180> just<00:04:24.360> started<00:04:24.659> off

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
didn't reset G so it just started off

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.879 
didn't reset G so it just started off
with<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.050> population<00:04:25.590> we<00:04:25.650> had<00:04:25.770> at<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.950> end

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
with the population we had at the end

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.249 
with the population we had at the end
but<00:04:27.280> I'll<00:04:27.639> do<00:04:27.789> another<00:04:27.939> example<00:04:28.419> now<00:04:28.810> we'll

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
but I'll do another example now we'll

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:29.990 
but I'll do another example now we'll
see<00:04:29.379> something<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.650> bit<00:04:29.770> more<00:04:29.860> interesting

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
see something a bit more interesting

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.779 
see something a bit more interesting
come<00:04:31.000> up<00:04:31.379> so<00:04:32.379> let's<00:04:32.650> let's<00:04:33.129> create<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.400> new<00:04:33.610> game

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
come up so let's let's create a new game

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:46.879 
come up so let's let's create a new game
so<00:04:34.270> row<00:04:35.099> matrix<00:04:36.840> calls<00:04:38.159> three<00:04:39.159> three<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:44.699> five

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
so row matrix calls three three to five

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.879 
so row matrix calls three three to five
zero<00:04:47.889> six<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.969> then<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.240> column<00:04:49.889> matrix

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
zero six and then the column matrix

00:04:50.889 --> 00:05:07.490 
zero six and then the column matrix
equals<00:04:54.030> 3<00:04:55.030> 2<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:57.580> 6<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.759> 3<00:05:00.900> 1<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:04.779> now<00:05:04.870> if<00:05:04.960> I

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.100 

recreate<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.620> instance<00:05:08.919> G<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:09.909> if<00:05:10.870> we<00:05:10.990> now

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
recreate the instance G and if we now

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.059 
recreate the instance G and if we now
simulate<00:05:11.580> with<00:05:12.580> plot<00:05:12.789> equals<00:05:12.909> true<00:05:13.919> we<00:05:14.919> see

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
simulate with plot equals true we see

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.700 
simulate with plot equals true we see
that<00:05:15.189> it<00:05:15.310> started<00:05:15.639> off<00:05:15.759> with<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.449> player<00:05:16.710> 1

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
that it started off with the player 1

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.050 
that it started off with the player 1
Slattery's<00:05:18.099> there's<00:05:18.400> three<00:05:18.580> rows<00:05:18.759> in<00:05:18.789> those

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060

is emerging on but it looks like we

is emerging on but it looks like we

generations to convince ourselves as to
what<00:05:37.449> is<00:05:38.139> happening<00:05:39.000> so<00:05:40.000> that's<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.270> package

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
what is happening so that's the package

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.300 
what is happening so that's the package
it's<00:05:41.020> it's<00:05:41.259> it's<00:05:41.529> quite<00:05:42.520> simple<00:05:43.210> and<00:05:44.219> it's<00:05:45.219> a

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
it's it's it's quite simple and it's a

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.909 
it's it's it's quite simple and it's a
nice<00:05:45.460> way<00:05:45.669> of<00:05:45.699> well<00:05:46.680> looking<00:05:47.680> at<00:05:47.740> what's

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
nice way of well looking at what's

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.519 
nice way of well looking at what's
happening<00:05:48.279> in<00:05:48.400> a<00:05:48.490> game<00:05:48.669> and<00:05:48.879> and<00:05:49.539> you<00:05:50.289> can<00:05:50.409> also

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:50.529 
happening in a game and and you can also

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.219 
happening in a game and and you can also
give<00:05:51.159> it<00:05:51.190> initial<00:05:51.849> strategy<00:05:52.690> distributions

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
give it initial strategy distributions

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.050 
give it initial strategy distributions
as<00:05:53.349> well<00:05:53.529> and<00:05:53.860> it'll<00:05:54.039> it'll<00:05:54.580> play<00:05:54.789> around<00:05:54.909> with

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
as well and it'll it'll play around with

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.670 
as well and it'll it'll play around with
those<00:05:55.180> so<00:05:55.839> I'll<00:05:55.900> put<00:05:56.050> links<00:05:56.199> to<00:05:56.379> all<00:05:56.589> the

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
those so I'll put links to all the

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.389 
those so I'll put links to all the
