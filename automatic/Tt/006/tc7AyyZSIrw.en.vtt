the<00:00:27.480> settings<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.980> will<00:00:29.189> probably<00:00:29.670> make<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the settings and I will probably make a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.080 
the settings and I will probably make a
video<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.810> at<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.289> later<00:00:31.320> date<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.160> for

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
now let's talk about the map so this one

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
now let's talk about the map so this one
is<00:00:36.360> called<00:00:36.630> monastery<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> small<00:00:38.610> to

medium<00:00:38.879> sized<00:00:39.540> Last<00:00:39.930> Stand<00:00:40.140> map<00:00:40.469> fit<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.430> 8<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
medium sized Last Stand map fit for 8 to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.220 
medium sized Last Stand map fit for 8 to
12<00:00:42.239> players<00:00:43.879> now<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.390> map<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.840> really

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
12 players now with this map I really

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
12 players now with this map I really
wanted<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> take<00:00:47.010> advantage<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
wanted to take advantage of the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.479 
wanted to take advantage of the
nighttime<00:00:48.510> effect<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.340> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
nighttime effect and this is a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.209 
nighttime effect and this is a
combination<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.300> juicy<00:00:52.230> color<00:00:52.559> blind<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
combination of juicy color blind and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.350 
combination of juicy color blind and
actually<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.329> skybox<00:00:55.320> dome<00:00:55.980> sort<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.670> thing

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
actually a skybox dome sort of thing

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.330 
actually a skybox dome sort of thing
that<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.629> built<00:00:57.989> using<00:00:58.260> grass<00:00:58.680> Plains<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that I built using grass Plains and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
that I built using grass Plains and
you'll<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.420> throughout<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.840> video<00:01:01.140> just

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
you'll see throughout the video just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170 
you'll see throughout the video just
what<00:01:01.620> kind<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.920> atmosphere<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.640> gives<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> map

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
what kind of atmosphere it gives the map

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.080 
what kind of atmosphere it gives the map
with<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.719> fog<00:01:04.110> rolling<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.790> cliffs

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
with the fog rolling in and the cliffs

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.149 
with the fog rolling in and the cliffs
that<00:01:06.180> surround<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.750> map<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.799> really<00:01:08.010> gives

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that surround the map it really gives

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.050 
that surround the map it really gives
you<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> artificial<00:01:09.210> nighttime<00:01:09.689> look<00:01:11.060> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you that artificial nighttime look it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.480 
you that artificial nighttime look it's
it's<00:01:12.570> kind<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> cool<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.189> rock

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
it's kind of cool because the the rock

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.550 
it's kind of cool because the the rock
cliffs<00:01:14.880> are<00:01:15.180> actually<00:01:15.630> really<00:01:15.900> close<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
cliffs are actually really close to the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.630 
cliffs are actually really close to the
skybox<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.720> dome<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.200> grass<00:01:19.560> Plains<00:01:19.860> but

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
skybox the dome of grass Plains but

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
skybox the dome of grass Plains but
since<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.299> grass<00:01:21.509> Plains<00:01:21.810> end<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.350> looking

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
since the grass Plains end up looking

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
since the grass Plains end up looking
really<00:01:22.740> dark<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.549> kind<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> fools<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.630> depth

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
really dark it kind of fools your depth

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.469 
really dark it kind of fools your depth
perception<00:01:25.610> into<00:01:26.610> thinking<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
perception into thinking that it's a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.710 
perception into thinking that it's a
much<00:01:27.810> larger<00:01:28.259> space<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.060> terms<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.420> theme

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
much larger space so in terms of theme

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.469 
much larger space so in terms of theme
this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.369> monastery<00:01:33.150> where

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
this is kind of a monastery where

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
this is kind of a monastery where
priests<00:01:34.049> would<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.619> they're<00:01:34.829> praying<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
priests would do they're praying and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.179 
priests would do they're praying and
meditation<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:37.259> they've<00:01:37.470> packed<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
meditation but they've packed up and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.219 
meditation but they've packed up and
left<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.119> left<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.840> fairly

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
left and all that's left is this fairly

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.990 
left and all that's left is this fairly
a<00:01:40.850> bare-bones<00:01:41.869> monastery<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> survivor

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
a bare-bones monastery so as a survivor

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.300 
a bare-bones monastery so as a survivor
you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.509> hold<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.170> anywhere<00:01:46.560> inside<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
you can hold out anywhere inside of the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.510 
you can hold out anywhere inside of the
fenced-in<00:01:47.939> area<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.380> interior<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:49.950> somewhat

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
fenced-in area the interior is somewhat

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.120 
fenced-in area the interior is somewhat
safer<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.600> lit<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.979> can

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
safer because it's lit up and you can

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.560 
safer because it's lit up and you can
kind<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.729> choke<00:01:53.939> points<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> get

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
kind of use the choke points to get

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.469 
kind of use the choke points to get
killed<00:01:55.009> but<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> exterior<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.790> where<00:01:57.299> you'll

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
killed but the exterior is where you'll

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.330 
killed but the exterior is where you'll
find<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.930> majority<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> better<00:01:58.920> weapons

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
find the majority of the better weapons

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.969 
find the majority of the better weapons
so<00:01:59.729> definitely<00:02:00.659> some<00:02:01.110> risk<00:02:01.350> versus<00:02:01.860> reward

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
so definitely some risk versus reward

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.149 
so definitely some risk versus reward
there

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159

approaches less predictable there's also
a<00:02:12.129> variety<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.700> jumps<00:02:13.209> up<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.780> roof<00:02:13.959> giving

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
a variety of jumps up to the roof giving

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.539 
a variety of jumps up to the roof giving
more<00:02:14.739> options<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.459> infected<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:18.430> yeah

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
more options to the infected but yeah

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.759 
more options to the infected but yeah
that's<00:02:18.730> pretty<00:02:18.970> much<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.269> as<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:20.290> watch<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
that's pretty much it as you watch the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.650 
that's pretty much it as you watch the
rest<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.310> first<00:02:21.610> person<00:02:22.000> gameplay<00:02:22.209> you

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
rest of this first person gameplay you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.869 
rest of this first person gameplay you
can<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:22.989> we're<00:02:23.170> holding<00:02:23.440> out<00:02:23.590> upstairs<00:02:23.950> and

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
can see we're holding out upstairs and

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.140 
can see we're holding out upstairs and
we<00:02:25.030> eventually<00:02:25.120> get<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.930> take<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> note<00:02:27.150> but

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
we eventually get to take a note but

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.119 
we eventually get to take a note but
that<00:02:28.690> pretty<00:02:29.049> much<00:02:29.230> wraps<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.680> up<00:02:29.769> for<00:02:29.830> this

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129
