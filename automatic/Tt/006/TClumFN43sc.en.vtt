00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.270
 and never comes again 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.770
 we made and won all sorts of games this week 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.109
 unfairly 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.440

 and there I found very often that this does not understand 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.090
 and when I got to know the pbb techniques it has noticed there is 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.390
 Possibilities to explain to people that the delay has so 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.390
