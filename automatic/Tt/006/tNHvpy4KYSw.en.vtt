00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
video where I'm going to be comparing

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.630 
video where I'm going to be comparing
the<00:00:06.690> gh3<00:00:07.320> s<00:00:07.380> built-in<00:00:08.870> microphone<00:00:09.870> and

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:10.640 
the gh3 s built-in microphone and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.299 
the gh3 s built-in microphone and
comparing<00:00:11.640> the<00:00:11.970> newly<00:00:12.480> purchased<00:00:13.309> videomic

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
comparing the newly purchased videomic

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.300 
comparing the newly purchased videomic
pro<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:15.290> just<00:00:16.290> got<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.590> today<00:00:16.680> actually<00:00:16.950> so<00:00:17.250> I'm

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
pro I just got it today actually so I'm

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.310 
pro I just got it today actually so I'm
pretty<00:00:17.460> excited<00:00:17.580> check<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.420> I've<00:00:19.020> done<00:00:19.289> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
pretty excited check it out I've done a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.740 
pretty excited check it out I've done a
lot<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.529> research<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.940> think<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
lot of research and I think this is the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.950 
lot of research and I think this is the
solution<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.650> me<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.240> anyway<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
solution for me so anyway this is the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.019 
solution for me so anyway this is the
built-in<00:00:25.380> mic<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> settings<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
built-in mic of the settings for the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.359 
built-in mic of the settings for the
built-in<00:00:27.510> mic<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.020> believe<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.830> set<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> no<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
built-in mic I believe it's set to no I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.670 
built-in mic I believe it's set to no I
don't<00:00:29.460> believe<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.240> set<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.449> 13<00:00:30.990> so

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
don't believe I know it's set to 13 so

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.680 
don't believe I know it's set to 13 so
you<00:00:32.279> should<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.489> able<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.820> pick<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.180> mind<00:00:33.510> boys

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you should be able to pick a mind boys

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.250 
you should be able to pick a mind boys
but<00:00:33.900> also<00:00:34.019> a<00:00:34.170> lot<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> ambient<00:00:34.890> room<00:00:35.550> noise<00:00:35.610> so

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
but also a lot of ambient room noise so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.280 
but also a lot of ambient room noise so
this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.379> what<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.589> sounds<00:00:37.769> like<00:00:37.979> so<00:00:39.140> we're<00:00:40.140> in

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
this is what it sounds like so we're in

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.270 
this is what it sounds like so we're in
a<00:00:40.350> little<00:00:40.559> bit<00:00:40.680> we're<00:00:40.830> going<00:00:40.949> to<00:00:41.010> switch<00:00:41.159> over

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
a little bit we're going to switch over

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.399 
a little bit we're going to switch over
to<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> videomic<00:00:42.030> pro<00:00:42.089> and<00:00:42.570> hopefully

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
to the videomic pro and hopefully

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:44.810 
to the videomic pro and hopefully
there's<00:00:43.589> a<00:00:43.680> big<00:00:43.860> difference<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.489> sound

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
there's a big difference in sound

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.869 
there's a big difference in sound
quality<00:00:45.059> alright<00:00:46.019> so<00:00:46.650> here<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.580> is<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
quality alright so here it is the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.410 
quality alright so here it is the
videomic<00:00:48.360> pro<00:00:48.739> can<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.799> tell<00:00:49.979> the<00:00:50.070> difference

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
videomic pro can you tell the difference

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.939 
videomic pro can you tell the difference
hopefully<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.809> hopefully<00:00:52.769> we<00:00:52.860> could

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
hopefully you're just hopefully we could

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
hopefully you're just hopefully we could
just<00:00:53.100> hear<00:00:53.220> my<00:00:53.400> voice<00:00:53.640> mostly<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.299> not<00:00:54.420> any

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
just hear my voice mostly and not any

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.829 
just hear my voice mostly and not any
ambient<00:00:55.080> sounds<00:00:56.360> hopefully<00:00:57.360> my<00:00:57.390> voice<00:00:57.809> should

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
ambient sounds hopefully my voice should

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.439 
ambient sounds hopefully my voice should
be<00:00:58.080> more<00:00:58.229> direct<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:59.190> more<00:00:59.610> full<00:00:59.940> more

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
be more direct a little more full more

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.320 
be more direct a little more full more
kind<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.470> kind<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> richer<00:01:02.549> sound<00:01:02.820> that's

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
kind of kind of a richer sound that's

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.729 
kind of kind of a richer sound that's
what<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.900> you<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
what I'm going for you know the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.920 
what I'm going for you know the
microphone<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.489> camera<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:06.180> probably<00:01:06.750> about

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
microphone and camera are probably about

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.870 
microphone and camera are probably about
I<00:01:07.079> don't<00:01:07.259> know<00:01:07.409> five<00:01:07.829> feet<00:01:08.070> away<00:01:08.189> from<00:01:08.369> me<00:01:08.579> so

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
I don't know five feet away from me so

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120 
I don't know five feet away from me so
pretty<00:01:09.509> close<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.740> probably<00:01:10.890> as

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
pretty close and this is probably as

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.170 
pretty close and this is probably as
close<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.490> I'll<00:01:11.609> be<00:01:11.759> when<00:01:11.939> I'm<00:01:12.030> doing

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.719 
close as I'll be when I'm doing
interviews<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.990> talking<00:01:13.399> portraits<00:01:14.399> or<00:01:14.549> stuff

like that so my settings for the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.440 
like that so my settings for the
videomic<00:01:18.659> pro<00:01:18.719> um<00:01:19.759> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.850> there's<00:01:21.210> there

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
videomic pro um you know there's there

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
videomic pro um you know there's there
aren't<00:01:21.600> many<00:01:21.719> really<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.560> i<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
aren't many really but i have it on the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.029 
aren't many really but i have it on the
+<00:01:24.149> 20<00:01:24.359> decibels<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:26.490> i<00:01:26.850> also<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.039> what's

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
+ 20 decibels and i also have the what's

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.300 
+ 20 decibels and i also have the what's
it<00:01:29.159> called<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:30.170> high-pass<00:01:31.170> filter<00:01:31.619> i<00:01:31.859> just

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it called the high-pass filter i just

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.819 
it called the high-pass filter i just
turned<00:01:32.429> that<00:01:32.609> on<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.530> basically<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
turned that on so basically all the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.859 
turned that on so basically all the
settings<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.939> then<00:01:36.420> inside

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
settings to the right and then inside

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.580 
settings to the right and then inside
the<00:01:36.929> gh3<00:01:37.859> i<00:01:38.009> went<00:01:38.609> ahead<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.590> lowered

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the gh3 i went ahead and just lowered

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.139 
the gh3 i went ahead and just lowered
the<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.979> microphone<00:01:41.939> settings<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.450> 4<00:01:43.079> so

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
the the microphone settings to 4 so

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.910 
the the microphone settings to 4 so
hopefully<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.299> makes<00:01:45.569> a<00:01:45.689> big<00:01:45.869> difference

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
hopefully that makes a big difference

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.440 
hopefully that makes a big difference
hopefully<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.039> uh<00:01:47.219> it<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.299> right

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
hopefully it's uh it was the right

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.880 
hopefully it's uh it was the right
investment<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.079> make<00:01:49.109> hopefully<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.829> worth

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
investment to make hopefully it's worth

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
investment to make hopefully it's worth
the<00:01:51.469> increased<00:01:52.469> quality<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.640> sound<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.179> worth

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the increased quality of sound is worth

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.779 
the increased quality of sound is worth
having<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.289> take<00:01:55.590> an<00:01:55.770> extra<00:01:56.159> piece<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.399> gear

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
having to take an extra piece of gear

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.029

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.319 
stuff and worry about settings while I'm
shooting<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.340> sounds<00:02:02.639> great<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.090> think

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's worth it so anyway there's a quick

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.040 
it's worth it so anyway there's a quick
