making his double a debut in this one so

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.359 
making his double a debut in this one so
this<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.220> probably<00:00:20.550> an<00:00:20.939> exciting<00:00:21.539> day<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:21.779> him

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
this is probably an exciting day for him

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.609 
this is probably an exciting day for him
well<00:00:23.369> I'm<00:00:23.400> sure<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.449> he<00:00:25.170> knows<00:00:25.350> he's

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
well I'm sure it is but he knows he's

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.560 
well I'm sure it is but he knows he's
got<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> long<00:00:26.250> road<00:00:26.670> ahead<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.090> him<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
got a long road ahead of him to the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.169 
got a long road ahead of him to the
major<00:00:27.779> leagues<00:00:28.109> he<00:00:28.830> wasn't<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.369> top<00:00:29.609> draft<00:00:30.029> pick

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
major leagues he wasn't a top draft pick

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.630 
major leagues he wasn't a top draft pick
so<00:00:30.539> he<00:00:30.750> likely<00:00:31.260> won't<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.099> fast<00:00:32.430> track

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
so he likely won't be on the fast track

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.120 
so he likely won't be on the fast track

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
normally stream but uh I figured didn't

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.420 
normally stream but uh I figured didn't
have<00:04:55.180> much<00:04:55.360> going<00:04:55.570> on<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:56.280> decided<00:04:57.280> to

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
have much going on so I decided to

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.020 
have much going on so I decided to
stream<00:04:57.940> a<00:04:57.970> little<00:04:58.210> bit<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:59.789> that'll<00:05:00.789> happen

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
stream a little bit and that'll happen
