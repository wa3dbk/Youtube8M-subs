00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.920
 at home 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.009
 yes they see forgiveness laughter is the boat is 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.230
 that I'm a fool supposedly 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.180
 recording the boxing video of this 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.310
 mother and it turns out that she was 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.140
 transmitting that is just because it came out 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.820
 an error on the screen and as well as that 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.380
 I set digits or as I re 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.400
 connecting you but and I see that I was 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.770
 transmitting I'm a stupid 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.060
 but hey you look at me in a boxing of this 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.430
 new mouse that you just bought the 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.140
 it's really nice and cheap 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.300
 now see why we are because the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.690
 truth is that this mouse I like 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.520
 very rich you bought it recently I liked it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.040
 a lot because he directs it and not mommy is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.050
 well nice is the mouse this the ice 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.670
 I use and it's about time that I 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.550
 I understand I'm going to copy the rich for fucking 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.460
 but hey this the truth guys this his 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.700
 nice good mouse and cheap cheap 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.640
 because because I know that in Merida in 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.530
 average 250 pesos could indeed have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.619
 bought in some other state but with 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.990
 the cost of shipping as the end of the day 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.760
 250 pesos then you live in another 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.380
 You can find it in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270
 mercadolibre and they will see that it weighs 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.479
 as 200 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.429
 at 180 pesos plus shipping there are no pages 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.439
 on the internet but after sending 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.299
 so if you can buy it in your 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.039
 city is basically the same as going to 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.719
 do what they have bought but good 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.610
 truth is that the against whom 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.350
 meridana on a fact page in 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.390
 mercadolibre I found it but I had 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.159
 your very useful page 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.380
 well the good one is that it is a store that 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.049
 it's called you double of two solutions and 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.850
 I went and had it once I go to 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:50.780
 present the mouse 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 is the mouse arm m-404 because as 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.240
 It's very pretty it's very sexy 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.430
 programmable buttons so that as is of 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.920
 gaming because it has other buttons for 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.140
 things you need when you do not 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.060
 have your hands separated already 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.790
 through the keyboard and you can do it here 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.830
 but good 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.010
 is of 10 different resolutions for 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.660
 that improves the accuracy says kaka in 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.340
 adjustable weights or the weight I have not 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.840
 understood very well how is the weight 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.819
 adjustable I guess the pads 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.120
 according to seas 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.350
 I do not advance so much I know but I'm 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.170
 enlightened the truth is that he learns a lot 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.510
 the cable is long and 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.820
 the point is that we are going to open we are going to 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.430
 proceed to open it the truth is that I 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.430
 he liked it very much 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:50.510
 but good that we get this and nothing else 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.510
 where they get that is already 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.480
 then he brings us a record of 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.350
 installation that is a type that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.140
 connect and at the end it works 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.490
 for something the instruction manual that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.490
 connects 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:22.930
 it is Carlos that is the cable in fact the 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.880
 cable is very sexy is like that 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.510
 relaxed is that it is a cable that lasts 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.670
 It is not any cable 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.140
 and this mother got stuck not without it seems 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.180
 work but good repeating what 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.459
 I was saying 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.840
 the truth is that it is very soft when 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.980
 you feel it seems so sacred 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.549
 like a pillow 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.230
 it's very soft the design is very sexy and 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.719
 very truth we are very sexy this is 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.189
 practically human patient as 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.370

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:53.040
 channels for when you have not you 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.860
 go fingers 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.019
 this this button I think I suppose others 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.019
 to increase the resolution I do not know 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.950
 for this the buttons 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.960

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.890

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.660
 but not about how you can see it 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.250
 everywhere they stop from the side 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.630
 front over here up front 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.210

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.390
