 fully configured ready for 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:02.659
 this one add it to your server well the 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.309
 next crankcase tells us new effects 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.690
 and new positions have been added a 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.729
 new effect that we will see 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.290
 well then also has a 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.290
 economy safeguard system 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.560
 and the essential already fully configured 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.720
 to be able to access rivard what 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.020
 means that at the end of the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.610
 starting we will get a reward 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.500
 how do we look at our balance 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.860
 putting the next command goes ramÃ³n 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.170
 email 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.510
 and there it will tell us when winning a game we 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.710
 will automatically give smoke to our 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.510
 balance is to say that if we win 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.880
 we will have the amount of money in 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.770
 four well and as we go 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.990
 winning will be adding a point for 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.840
 each victory that part can be edited 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.430
 inside the baby split folder inside 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.410
 from the server plugin folder 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.350
 attached to the link well below 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.570
 we will proceed to enter the game 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.320
 I'm going to enter first 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.810
 fuck 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.210
 as you will see we appear in the lobby as 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.550
 will know to configure the map should 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.290
 go see the video that I left on the side 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.110
 of this video there is a costadito them 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.170
 I will leave a link so that you can 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.450
 see how to set up a map and get the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.980
 maximum profit well as you will see 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.900
 that does not enter the player who 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.030
 defect I started the game with 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.770
 two players will not start from 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.050
 so I'm going to go in with the other account 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.000
 and as you will see in 15 seconds will start 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.800
 the game and then let's see 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.780
 what are the new positions and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.640
 new effects that have been added then 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.840
 the boys as you will see down here we 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.520
 says I'm not op 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.310
 so let's proceed to see if we 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.690
 deliver the items or the effects by 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.180
 example if we break a block 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.599
 to see what we can break 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.290
 because I have set some is the blog 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.269
 that has given us an enchanted peak and we 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.689
 has given a speed effect is 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.090
 configurable that has given us firm that 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.069
 would blindness be able to configure the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.230
 duration of said effects 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.719
 we also have regeneration there 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.000
 down we are also saying those of 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.219
 speed and the time of each one by 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.739
 supposed to see if he gave us some like 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:14.010
 you will see here it hurts us as it gives us more 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.019
 high and these positions that would be for 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.280
 have transport and well let's see if 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.769
 what would be the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.889
 shelter if he falls let's see what we 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.889
 gives 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.170
 and as you can see it tells us here 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.750
 below I received one from re guard 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.000
 let's check the mole at the beginning 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.720
 I had three now we will see how much I have 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.800
 as you will see I have four still has given me 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.450
 satisfactorily this would be the point 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.370
 where will appear who wins and who 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.710
 loses or those who lose would appear 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.500
 backward besides the war king who was 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.200
 one of balance I have also added for 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.030
 that gives them a diamond for those who 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.830
 they have survival server or something would be 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.360
 very useful that can be configured 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.160
 you can put whatever you want or 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.040
 that does not deliver anything simply that we 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.380
 give the balance well I hope you have 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.690
 liked this improved version of the plugin 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.360
