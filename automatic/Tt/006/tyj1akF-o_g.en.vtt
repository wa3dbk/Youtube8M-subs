from<00:00:21.590> here<00:00:23.170> we<00:00:24.170> were<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.770> quiet<00:00:25.340> advanced

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
from here we were a quiet advanced

from here we were a quiet advanced
society<00:00:27.250> would<00:00:28.250> solve<00:00:28.689> not<00:00:29.689> all<00:00:29.900> of<00:00:29.930> her

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.689 
problems but that a good many of them
people<00:00:34.760> were<00:00:35.080> kind<00:00:36.080> of<00:00:36.170> complacent<00:00:36.879> Borg<00:00:37.879> and

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
people were kind of complacent Borg and

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.799 
people were kind of complacent Borg and
we<00:00:40.699> wanted<00:00:40.970> to<00:00:41.030> make<00:00:41.239> things<00:00:41.390> interesting

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
we wanted to make things interesting

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:50.200 
we wanted to make things interesting
again<00:00:43.150> so<00:00:45.040> what<00:00:46.040> we<00:00:46.160> decided<00:00:46.309> to<00:00:46.699> do<00:00:47.710> was<00:00:49.210> to

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
again so what we decided to do was to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.410 
again so what we decided to do was to
get<00:00:50.390> together<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.670> identify<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.700> stupidest
