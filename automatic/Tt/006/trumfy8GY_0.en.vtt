00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.220 
dispose of it so how you dispose of this
there's<00:02:39.069> like<00:02:39.280> three<00:02:39.549> different<00:02:39.579> ways<00:02:40.079> if<00:02:41.079> you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
there's like three different ways if you

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.449 
there's like three different ways if you
look<00:02:41.439> it<00:02:41.560> up<00:02:41.650> they're<00:02:41.829> going<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> say<00:02:42.159> you<00:02:42.220> can

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
look it up they're going to say you can

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.940 
look it up they're going to say you can
throw<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.879> river<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.989> can<00:02:44.530> throw<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.859> in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
throw it in a river you can throw it in

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.039 
throw it in a river you can throw it in
fire<00:02:45.159> but<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:46.030> easiest<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:46.689> one<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:46.989> I

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
fire but the easiest in the one that I

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.199 
fire but the easiest in the one that I
recommend<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.889> going<00:02:48.099> to<00:02:48.159> go<00:02:48.280> down<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.849> sink

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
recommend is going to go down the sink

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.479 
recommend is going to go down the sink
so<00:02:49.840> you're<00:02:49.930> going<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.109> turn<00:02:50.349> on<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.950> water<00:02:51.159> tap

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
so you're going to turn on the water tap

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.640 
so you're going to turn on the water tap
and<00:02:51.819> you're<00:02:52.299> going<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.540> pour<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.989> down<00:02:53.260> and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
and you're going to pour it down and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.409 
and you're going to pour it down and
make<00:02:53.889> sure<00:02:53.919> that<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.430> flushes<00:02:54.700> down<00:02:55.090> and

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:55.419 
make sure that it flushes down and

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.699 
make sure that it flushes down and
through<00:02:55.720> your<00:02:55.840> pipes<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.290> out<00:02:56.379> of<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.530> house

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
through your pipes and out of the house

one<00:02:57.549> thing<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.849> can<00:02:58.060> do<00:02:58.329> because<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.959> can

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
one thing you can do because it can

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
it now if you have negative people

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.289 
it now if you have negative people
coming<00:03:47.229> in<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.500> negative<00:03:48.129> roommate<00:03:48.819> somebody

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
coming in a negative roommate somebody

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.930 
coming in a negative roommate somebody
that's<00:03:49.540> got<00:03:49.690> bad<00:03:49.959> bites<00:03:50.430> teenagers<00:03:51.430> sometimes

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
that's got bad bites teenagers sometimes

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.990 
that's got bad bites teenagers sometimes
bring<00:03:52.299> things<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.780> with<00:03:52.959> them<00:03:53.430> then<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.699> may

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
bring things in with them then you may

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.020 
bring things in with them then you may
do<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.560> more<00:03:56.560> often<00:03:56.829> but<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.370> think<00:03:57.760> when<00:03:57.939> you

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
do it more often but I think when you

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.339 
do it more often but I think when you
first<00:03:58.209> do<00:03:58.449> it<00:03:58.569> after<00:03:58.810> about<00:03:58.900> three<00:03:59.199> days

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
first do it after about three days

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.140 
first do it after about three days
you're<00:03:59.979> going<00:04:00.159> to<00:04:00.250> see<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.609> it's<00:04:00.819> lighter

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
you're going to see that it's lighter

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.629 
you're going to see that it's lighter
and<00:04:01.569> cleaner<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:02.620> fresher<00:04:02.919> in<00:04:03.250> your<00:04:03.400> house

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
and cleaner and fresher in your house

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.159 
and cleaner and fresher in your house
feeling<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.959> know<00:04:05.109> you're<00:04:05.340> lighter

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
feeling you know you're lighter

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.170 
feeling you know you're lighter
wonderful<00:04:08.169> feeling<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:08.889> anyway<00:04:09.790> that's<00:04:10.000> how

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
wonderful feeling so anyway that's how

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.909 
wonderful feeling so anyway that's how
you<00:04:10.299> do<00:04:10.509> a<00:04:10.540> house<00:04:10.810> cleansing<00:04:11.229> with<00:04:11.620> salt<00:04:11.889> and

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
you do a house cleansing with salt and

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.520 
you do a house cleansing with salt and
so<00:04:14.919> I<00:04:15.280> don't<00:04:15.639> I<00:04:15.879> don't<00:04:16.750> think<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.259> need<00:04:17.380> to

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
so I don't I don't think you need to

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.990 
so I don't I don't think you need to
throw<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:17.829> in<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:17.949> fire<00:04:18.159> I<00:04:18.220> don't<00:04:18.669> need<00:04:18.849> to

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
throw it in the fire I don't need to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.640 
throw it in the fire I don't need to
think<00:04:19.539> that<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:19.810> really<00:04:19.989> have<00:04:20.229> to<00:04:20.259> throw<00:04:20.560> it

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
think that you really have to throw it

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.100 
think that you really have to throw it
at<00:04:20.769> yourself<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.430> really<00:04:22.029> like<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.599> use<00:04:22.750> say<00:04:23.050> to

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
at yourself I really like to use say to

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.350 
at yourself I really like to use say to
my<00:04:23.440> house<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:24.099> I

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
my house and I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.360 
my house and I
learn<00:04:25.449> it<00:04:25.599> and<00:04:25.840> walk<00:04:26.289> through<00:04:26.800> every<00:04:27.099> corner

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
learn it and walk through every corner

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.850 
learn it and walk through every corner
and<00:04:27.789> so<00:04:28.659> I<00:04:28.960> think<00:04:29.229> that's<00:04:29.379> a<00:04:29.469> little<00:04:29.710> bit

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
and so I think that's a little bit

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.790 
and so I think that's a little bit
stronger<00:04:30.430> cleansing<00:04:31.330> than<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.900> salt<00:04:32.199> but

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
stronger cleansing than the salt but

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.640 
stronger cleansing than the salt but
when<00:04:33.009> you<00:04:33.280> have<00:04:33.550> something<00:04:33.879> going<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.539> such<00:04:35.439> as

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
when you have something going on such as

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.700 
when you have something going on such as
I<00:04:35.889> actually<00:04:36.219> have<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> friend<00:04:36.849> who<00:04:37.629> fire<00:04:38.169> starts

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
I actually have a friend who fire starts

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.659 
I actually have a friend who fire starts
in<00:04:38.830> our<00:04:38.979> house<00:04:39.189> floods<00:04:39.789> floods<00:04:40.389> all<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.050> time

things fly glasses break they fly right

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.040 
things fly glasses break they fly right
out<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.639> cupboard<00:04:46.000> so<00:04:46.539> she<00:04:46.599> needs

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
out of the cupboard so she needs

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.869 
out of the cupboard so she needs
stronger<00:04:47.439> protection<00:04:48.099> in<00:04:48.250> our<00:04:48.370> house<00:04:48.580> and
