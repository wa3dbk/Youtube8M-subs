really if you put chambers in the middle
have<00:01:21.909> Bell<00:01:22.119> around<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.479> right<00:01:22.600> do<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.869> really

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110

again<00:01:26.350> it's<00:01:26.500> just<00:01:26.619> an<00:01:26.680> assumption<00:01:27.010> so<00:01:27.490> I'm<00:01:27.760> not

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
again it's just an assumption so I'm not

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.020 
again it's just an assumption so I'm not
going<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.150> say<00:01:28.299> it<00:01:28.479> then<00:01:29.439> you<00:01:30.100> know<00:01:30.189> I'm<00:01:31.000> not

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
going to say it then you know I'm not

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.310 
going to say it then you know I'm not
gonna<00:01:31.210> question<00:01:31.450> bangers<00:01:31.960> choices<00:01:32.700> also

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
gonna question bangers choices also

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.770 
gonna question bangers choices also

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
average performance is not what we

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.210 
average performance is not what we
needed<00:01:39.689> Ramsey<00:01:40.689> his<00:01:40.960> shocking<00:01:41.770> form

the<00:04:05.169> last<00:04:05.410> coming<00:04:05.799> may<00:04:06.549> think<00:04:07.359> second<00:04:09.000> 2011

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109

the last coming may think second 2011
for<00:04:11.430> beginning<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.609> may<00:04:12.819> 2011<00:04:13.440> where<00:04:14.440> we

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
for beginning of may 2011 where we

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.259 
for beginning of may 2011 where we
actually<00:04:14.709> beat<00:04:15.099> manchester<00:04:15.549> united<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.060> i'm

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
actually beat manchester united and i'm

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
in a premier league match so it's been a

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.819 
in a premier league match so it's been a
long<00:04:19.510> time<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:19.900> we<00:04:20.260> can<00:04:20.410> get<00:04:20.530> over<00:04:20.709> that

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
long time and we can get over that

hurdle of beating manchester united

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.770

maybe that could be the turning point of

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.370 
maybe that could be the turning point of
the<00:04:25.870> season<00:04:26.050> feeding<00:04:26.620> manchester

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380

Manchester United and they still have

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.170 
Manchester United and they still have
that<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.800> Glade<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:37.610> glare<00:04:37.910> about

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
that that that Glade that glare about

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.690 
that that that Glade that glare about
them<00:04:38.330> like<00:04:38.720> from<00:04:38.930> Arsenal<00:04:39.410> as<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.920> squad<00:04:40.430> and

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
them like from Arsenal as a squad and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.610 
them like from Arsenal as a squad and
from<00:04:40.910> fans<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.480> we<00:04:42.020> just<00:04:42.170> don't<00:04:42.410> perform

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
from fans that we just don't perform

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.570 
from fans that we just don't perform
when<00:04:42.980> we<00:04:43.070> play<00:04:43.250> against<00:04:43.640> them<00:04:45.340> moving<00:04:46.340> forward

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
when we play against them moving forward

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.920 
when we play against them moving forward
also<00:04:47.980> we've<00:04:48.980> got<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.460> good<00:04:50.420> stretch<00:04:50.660> of<00:04:50.810> games

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
also we've got a good stretch of games

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.330 
also we've got a good stretch of games
i'm<00:04:51.170> guessing<00:04:51.530> we<00:04:51.830> got<00:04:52.070> doorman<00:04:53.000> at<00:04:53.120> home<00:04:53.330> we

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
i'm guessing we got doorman at home we

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.500 
i'm guessing we got doorman at home we
shouldn't<00:04:55.340> play<00:04:55.610> their<00:04:55.880> starters<00:04:56.120> because

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
shouldn't play their starters because

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.060 
shouldn't play their starters because
they<00:04:56.840> already<00:04:57.020> got<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.410> group<00:04:57.620> pretty<00:04:57.890> much

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
they already got the group pretty much

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.810 
they already got the group pretty much
wrapped<00:04:58.400> up<00:04:58.670> so<00:04:59.590> unless<00:05:00.590> they<00:05:01.280> want<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.610> just

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
wrapped up so unless they want to just

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.240 
wrapped up so unless they want to just
beat<00:05:02.750> Arsenal<00:05:03.170> at<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.470> Emirates<00:05:03.800> real<00:05:04.040> bad

that's<00:06:21.410> what<00:06:21.500> we're<00:06:21.620> missing<00:06:21.740> a<00:06:22.390> somebody

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
that's what we're missing a somebody

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.570 
that's what we're missing a somebody
that<00:06:23.540> can<00:06:23.720> be<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:24.440> creative<00:06:24.830> influence<00:06:25.400> in

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
that can be the creative influence in

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.920 
that can be the creative influence in
for<00:06:26.540> a<00:06:26.570> whole<00:06:26.750> 90<00:06:26.990> minutes<00:06:28.480> who<00:06:29.480> also<00:06:29.600> the<00:06:29.810> de

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
with vital you be huge to have but maybe

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.850 
with vital you be huge to have but maybe
that's<00:06:35.510> probably<00:06:36.169> the<00:06:36.320> glaring<00:06:36.590> weakness<00:06:36.830> of

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
that's probably the glaring weakness of

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.620 
that's probably the glaring weakness of
today's<00:06:37.160> match<00:06:37.370> without<00:06:37.550> for<00:06:38.030> chambers<00:06:38.450> was

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
today's match without for chambers was

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.320 
today's match without for chambers was
because<00:06:39.620> Jefferson<00:06:39.890> Montero<00:06:40.430> doesn't

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
because Jefferson Montero doesn't

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.480 
because Jefferson Montero doesn't
I<00:06:41.360> was<00:06:41.990> just<00:06:42.169> having<00:06:42.319> a<00:06:42.590> time<00:06:43.159> of<00:06:43.310> his<00:06:43.430> life

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
I was just having a time of his life

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.089 
I was just having a time of his life
going<00:06:44.270> down<00:06:44.419> that<00:06:44.569> flank<00:06:44.810> on<00:06:44.960> chambers<00:06:45.500> and

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
going down that flank on chambers and

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:47.770 
going down that flank on chambers and
really<00:06:46.610> put<00:06:46.759> on<00:06:46.849> a<00:06:46.879> highlight<00:06:47.240> reel<00:06:47.270> against

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
really put on a highlight reel against

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.089 
really put on a highlight reel against
them<00:06:48.819> but<00:06:49.819> apart<00:06:50.000> from<00:06:50.090> that<00:06:50.240> I<00:06:50.750> think<00:06:51.680> that's

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
them but apart from that I think that's

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:54.480 
them but apart from that I think that's
about<00:06:52.400> it<00:06:52.550> that<00:06:52.879> I<00:06:52.909> can<00:06:53.090> say<00:06:53.270> right<00:06:53.509> now<00:06:53.569> it's

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
about it that I can say right now it's

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.920 
about it that I can say right now it's
it's<00:06:55.490> not<00:06:55.699> a<00:06:55.729> good<00:06:55.939> day<00:06:56.150> it's<00:06:56.389> been<00:06:56.629> a<00:06:56.659> pretty

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
it's not a good day it's been a pretty

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.640 
it's not a good day it's been a pretty
poor<00:06:57.259> day<00:06:57.500> just<00:06:58.159> because<00:06:58.430> of<00:06:58.879> the<00:06:58.939> result<00:06:59.650> but

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650
