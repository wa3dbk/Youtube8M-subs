coming<00:00:38.269> to<00:00:38.420> silithus<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.170> picking<00:00:39.559> at<00:00:39.620> least

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
coming to silithus and picking at least

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.670 
coming to silithus and picking at least
silithus<00:00:40.250> guises<00:00:41.140> once<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.290> pick<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.590> up

silithus guises once you pick it up

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.620 
silithus guises once you pick it up
you'll<00:00:42.860> be<00:00:42.890> burdened<00:00:43.430> by<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.700> Sun<00:00:44.210> know<00:00:44.480> what

the crap it is and you won't be able to
mount<00:00:46.700> up<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.149> won't<00:00:47.300> be<00:00:47.390> able<00:00:47.450> to<00:00:47.600> your<00:00:47.719> speed

mount up you won't be able to your speed

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.530 
mount up you won't be able to your speed
increases<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.890> you'll<00:00:49.790> have<00:00:49.969> to<00:00:50.120> tail<00:00:50.360> your

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
increases and you'll have to tail your

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.240

ass all the way to the alliance or horde

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.440 
ass all the way to the alliance or horde
base<00:00:53.140> this<00:00:54.140> method<00:00:54.469> kind<00:00:54.680> of<00:00:54.770> sucks<00:00:55.040> if<00:00:55.450> it

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
base this method kind of sucks if it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.150 
base this method kind of sucks if it
gave<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:56.930> a<00:00:57.260> like<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.530> high<00:00:57.620> amount<00:00:58.040> of

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
gave it a like a high amount of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.459 
gave it a like a high amount of
reputation<00:00:58.820> /<00:00:58.969> handing<00:00:59.540> it<00:00:59.719> might<00:01:00.050> be<00:01:00.260> worth

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
reputation / handing it might be worth

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.860 
reputation / handing it might be worth
it<00:01:00.739> but<00:01:00.950> it<00:01:01.070> doesn't<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:01.640> get<00:01:01.789> 20<00:01:02.180> rap<00:01:02.360> /<00:01:02.600> hand

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
it but it doesn't you get 20 rap / hand

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.439 
it but it doesn't you get 20 rap / hand
in<00:01:03.050> so<00:01:03.320> you'd<00:01:03.469> be<00:01:03.680> here<00:01:03.920> all<00:01:04.160> year<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.180> doing

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
in so you'd be here all year and doing

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.260 
in so you'd be here all year and doing
this<00:01:06.130> but<00:01:07.130> I<00:01:07.190> thought<00:01:07.399> I'd<00:01:07.550> include<00:01:07.880> anyway

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
this but I thought I'd include anyway

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.999 
this but I thought I'd include anyway
just<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:08.660> case<00:01:08.720> you're<00:01:09.380> interested<00:01:09.500> you

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
just in case you're interested you

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.040 
just in case you're interested you
wondered<00:01:10.430> what<00:01:10.580> they<00:01:10.700> did<00:01:10.960> they<00:01:11.960> were

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
wondered what they did they were

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.260 
wondered what they did they were
actually<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.440> part<00:01:12.649> of<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.039> PvP<00:01:13.700> event<00:01:13.970> in<00:01:14.119> the

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
actually a part of the PvP event in the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.719 
actually a part of the PvP event in the
zone<00:01:14.479> which<00:01:14.959> isn't<00:01:15.619> done<00:01:15.860> anymore<00:01:16.100> you'd<00:01:16.550> have

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
zone which isn't done anymore you'd have

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.790 
zone which isn't done anymore you'd have
to<00:01:16.880> collect<00:01:17.149> 200<00:01:17.330> before<00:01:17.929> the<00:01:18.050> Horde<00:01:18.259> code<00:01:18.560> or

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
to collect 200 before the Horde code or

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.910 
to collect 200 before the Horde code or
vice<00:01:19.250> versa<00:01:19.580> if<00:01:19.850> you're<00:01:20.030> hard<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:20.709> you'd<00:01:21.709> win

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
vice versa if you're hard and you'd win

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.309 
vice versa if you're hard and you'd win
but<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:23.090> doesn't<00:01:23.240> happen<00:01:23.509> anymore<00:01:23.720> no<00:01:24.170> one

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
but that doesn't happen anymore no one

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.779 
but that doesn't happen anymore no one
really<00:01:24.740> gives<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:25.039> crap<00:01:25.190> which<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.700> shame

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
really gives a crap which is a shame

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.370 
really gives a crap which is a shame
there<00:01:26.149> should<00:01:26.300> be<00:01:26.390> more<00:01:26.539> stuff<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:26.990> this<00:01:27.140> I

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
there should be more stuff like this I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.490 
there should be more stuff like this I
did<00:01:27.709> enjoy<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.390> concept<00:01:29.899> of<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:30.380> it

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
did enjoy the the concept of it but it

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.630 
did enjoy the the concept of it but it
was<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.649> bit<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.039> ground<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.700> yeah<00:01:33.160> so<00:01:34.160> you

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
was a bit of a ground and yeah so you

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.570 
was a bit of a ground and yeah so you
just<00:01:34.670> pop<00:01:35.149> it<00:01:35.270> into<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.539> blue<00:01:36.369> teleport<00:01:37.369> in

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
just pop it into the blue teleport in

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.550 
just pop it into the blue teleport in
looking<00:01:38.060> device<00:01:38.660> and<00:01:38.959> it'll<00:01:39.110> take<00:01:39.289> it<00:01:39.440> off

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
looking device and it'll take it off

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.199 
looking device and it'll take it off
your<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.069> you'll<00:01:40.190> gain<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.490> rep<00:01:40.670> if<00:01:40.910> you're

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
your and you'll gain the rep if you're

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.910 
your and you'll gain the rep if you're
hard<00:01:41.450> you'd<00:01:41.660> come<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.110> base<00:01:42.380> as<00:01:42.649> you<00:01:42.770> can

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
hard you'd come to this base as you can

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
of it I'm not too sure why but since

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.979 
of it I'm not too sure why but since
Cataclysm<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.630> lot<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.900> its<00:03:41.050> gun<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.440> did<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.860> in

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
Cataclysm a lot of its gun I did it in

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.620 
Cataclysm a lot of its gun I did it in
sort<00:03:43.989> of<00:03:44.080> mid<00:03:44.580> wrath<00:03:45.580> of<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.760> lich<00:03:45.910> king<00:03:45.970> so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
sort of mid wrath of the lich king so

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.240 
sort of mid wrath of the lich king so
yeah<00:03:46.959> there's<00:03:47.170> lot<00:03:47.440> more<00:03:47.620> things<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:48.070> could

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
yeah there's lot more things you could

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
yeah there's lot more things you could
do

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
do

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.510 
do
but<00:03:49.690> they've<00:03:49.870> taken<00:03:50.260> them<00:03:50.530> away<00:03:50.590> not<00:03:51.190> too<00:03:51.340> sure

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
but they've taken them away not too sure

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.990 
but they've taken them away not too sure
why<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:52.570> is<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.810> final<00:03:53.320> base<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.000> it's

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
why this is the final base and it's

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.490 
why this is the final base and it's
quite<00:03:55.210> I<00:03:55.420> think<00:03:55.660> this<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.810> one<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.290> bigger

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
quite I think this is one of the bigger

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.000 
quite I think this is one of the bigger
ones<00:03:56.590> like<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.610> mobs<00:03:57.820> are<00:03:58.000> more<00:03:58.210> spread<00:03:58.600> out

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
ones like the mobs are more spread out

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.150 
ones like the mobs are more spread out
which<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.220> bit<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.520> a<00:04:00.610> pain<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.800> may<00:04:03.130> be

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
which is a bit of a pain so it may be

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.190 
which is a bit of a pain so it may be
worth<00:04:03.490> you<00:04:03.670> only<00:04:03.790> clearing<00:04:04.270> a<00:04:04.450> majority<00:04:05.170> of

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
worth you only clearing a majority of

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.840 
worth you only clearing a majority of
that<00:04:05.410> base<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.920> then<00:04:06.100> heading<00:04:06.400> back<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.760> the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
that base and then heading back to the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.820 
that base and then heading back to the
first<00:04:07.030> one<00:04:07.270> once<00:04:07.960> you<00:04:08.140> fly<00:04:08.320> around<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.710> few

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
first one once you fly around a few

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.290 
first one once you fly around a few
times<00:04:08.890> you'll<00:04:09.310> work<00:04:09.460> out<00:04:09.670> your<00:04:09.820> own<00:04:09.880> sort<00:04:10.270> of

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
times you'll work out your own sort of

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.350 
times you'll work out your own sort of
time<00:04:10.780> schedule<00:04:11.320> for<00:04:11.530> flying<00:04:11.770> around<00:04:12.240> now<00:04:13.240> this

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
time schedule for flying around now this

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.120 
time schedule for flying around now this
is<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.570> twilight<00:04:14.110> profit<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.590> have<00:04:14.770> only<00:04:14.920> ever

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
seen around the second base it may spawn

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.949 
seen around the second base it may spawn
at<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.220> other<00:04:18.400> bases<00:04:18.790> but<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:18.970> only<00:04:19.420> ever<00:04:19.690> see

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
at the other bases but I only ever see

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.690 
at the other bases but I only ever see
it<00:04:20.110> to<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.380> left<00:04:20.560> of<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.860> second<00:04:21.250> base<00:04:21.430> and

it to the left of the second base and

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.340 
it to the left of the second base and
it'll<00:04:22.210> kind<00:04:22.420> of<00:04:22.540> just<00:04:22.690> walk<00:04:22.900> around<00:04:23.110> the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
it'll kind of just walk around the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.830 
it'll kind of just walk around the
second<00:04:23.710> base<00:04:23.740> when<00:04:24.100> it's<00:04:24.250> there<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.780> when<00:04:25.780> you

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
second base when it's there and when you

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.990 
second base when it's there and when you
kill<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.260> you'll<00:04:26.500> get<00:04:26.650> between<00:04:26.950> six<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.700> i

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
a level 60 range from vanilla you will

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.940 
a level 60 range from vanilla you will
need<00:05:37.450> to<00:05:37.480> be<00:05:37.600> in<00:05:37.750> a<00:05:37.810> red<00:05:37.960> team<00:05:38.230> to<00:05:38.410> access<00:05:38.740> it

need to be in a red team to access it

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.640 
need to be in a red team to access it
but<00:05:39.550> it's<00:05:39.760> easy<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:40.330> horrible<00:05:40.840> for<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.440> most

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
but it's easy so horrible for the most

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.710 
but it's easy so horrible for the most
part<00:05:41.919> I'd<00:05:42.130> say<00:05:42.310> it's<00:05:42.460> also<00:05:42.640> will<00:05:43.270> depend<00:05:43.600> on

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
part I'd say it's also will depend on

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.680 
part I'd say it's also will depend on
your<00:05:43.870> class<00:05:44.760> every<00:05:45.760> mob<00:05:45.910> you<00:05:46.090> kill<00:05:46.300> gives<00:05:46.570> you

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
your class every mob you kill gives you

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.980 
your class every mob you kill gives you
10<00:05:46.930> rep<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:47.710> bosses<00:05:48.100> give<00:05:48.310> 300<00:05:49.060> and<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.630> last

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
10 rep the bosses give 300 and the last

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.840 
10 rep the bosses give 300 and the last
boss<00:05:50.260> of<00:05:50.500> thing<00:05:50.650> gives<00:05:50.890> you<00:05:51.040> six<00:05:51.310> hundred<00:05:51.669> rep

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
boss of thing gives you six hundred rep

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.850 
boss of thing gives you six hundred rep
so<00:05:52.240> it's<00:05:52.360> not<00:05:52.450> too<00:05:52.630> bad<00:05:52.810> it<00:05:53.080> may<00:05:53.590> be<00:05:53.650> worth

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
so it's not too bad it may be worth

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.070 
so it's not too bad it may be worth
getting<00:05:54.130> a<00:05:54.190> group<00:05:54.340> of<00:05:54.460> friends<00:05:54.910> clear<00:05:55.750> it<00:05:55.990> and

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
getting a group of friends clear it and

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.450 
getting a group of friends clear it and
then<00:05:56.350> go<00:05:56.590> rep<00:05:56.830> right<00:05:57.040> and<00:05:57.280> you're<00:05:57.370> wrong

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
then go rep right and you're wrong

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.219 
then go rep right and you're wrong
because<00:05:57.610> you'll<00:05:57.820> get<00:05:57.940> about<00:05:58.030> 5<00:05:58.450> K<00:05:58.780> rap<00:05:59.020> from

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
because you'll get about 5 K rap from

00:05:59.229 --> 00:05:59.980 
because you'll get about 5 K rap from
doing<00:05:59.500> this

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
doing this

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.860 
doing this
and<00:06:00.230> it<00:06:00.440> shouldn't<00:06:00.560> take<00:06:00.710> too<00:06:00.830> long<00:06:01.870> makes

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
and it shouldn't take too long makes

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.780 
and it shouldn't take too long makes
things<00:06:03.050> easier<00:06:03.500> if<00:06:03.620> you've<00:06:03.800> got<00:06:04.010> a<00:06:04.160> a<00:06:04.430> wheeze
