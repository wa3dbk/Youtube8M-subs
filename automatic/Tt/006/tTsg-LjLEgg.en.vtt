so that's impasto let me show you a few
examples<00:00:28.250> these<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.519> my<00:00:29.670> art<00:00:29.939> journal

examples these are at my art journal
here's<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:33.290> page<00:00:34.290> I'm<00:00:34.680> sure<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.160> see

here's some a page I'm sure you can see

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.250 
here's some a page I'm sure you can see
it<00:00:35.460> real<00:00:35.640> well<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.840> can<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it real well but you can see the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.010 
it real well but you can see the
brushstrokes<00:00:37.579> that's<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.090> impasto<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
brushstrokes that's not as impasto as it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.310 
brushstrokes that's not as impasto as it
gets<00:00:42.290> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.500> also<00:00:44.510> worked<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.660> pasta<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
gets this is also worked in pasta you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.180 
gets this is also worked in pasta you
can<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.820> there<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:48.000> raised<00:00:48.300> areas<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.320> paint

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can see there are raised areas of paint

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.220 
can see there are raised areas of paint
and<00:00:51.800> this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.579> best<00:00:53.760> technique<00:00:54.329> for

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and this is not the best technique for

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.279 
and this is not the best technique for
an<00:00:55.350> art<00:00:55.559> journal<00:00:55.910> because<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.180> pages<00:00:57.480> will

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
an art journal because the pages will

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.410 
an art journal because the pages will
stick<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.879> really

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
stick you can see here this is really

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.530 
stick you can see here this is really
thick<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.309> very<00:01:03.000> raised<00:01:04.790> for<00:01:05.790> example

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.520 

there's<00:01:09.540> another<00:01:09.780> page<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.180> again<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.409> can

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
there's another page and again you can

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.520 
there's another page and again you can
see<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> corn<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:15.360> nuggets<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> corn

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
see the corn the little nuggets of corn

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.600 
see the corn the little nuggets of corn
are<00:01:17.280> very<00:01:17.610> thick<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:19.259> pages<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.860> stick

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
are very thick and these pages do stick

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.270 
are very thick and these pages do stick
together<00:01:20.900> horribly<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> great

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
together horribly so it's not a great

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.359 
together horribly so it's not a great
technique<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.030> an<00:01:24.119> art<00:01:24.270> journal<00:01:24.830> it<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.159> be

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
technique for an art journal it can be

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.770 
technique for an art journal it can be
very<00:01:26.580> effective<00:01:28.250> now<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:30.420> got<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> use

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
very effective now you got to use

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.359 
very effective now you got to use
certain<00:01:31.079> types<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.409> paint<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> cannot

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
certain types of paint for it you cannot

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
certain types of paint for it you cannot
use<00:01:34.040> liquid<00:01:35.040> acrylics<00:01:35.640> why<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.960> they

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
use liquid acrylics why because they

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.719 
use liquid acrylics why because they
don't<00:01:37.290> hold<00:01:37.470> brushstroke<00:01:37.979> say<00:01:38.189> they're<00:01:38.460> self

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
don't hold brushstroke say they're self

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.940 
don't hold brushstroke say they're self
levelling<00:01:39.240> they<00:01:39.540> level<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.770> put

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
levelling they level out when you put

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.950 
levelling they level out when you put
down<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.100> brushstroke<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.850> they<00:01:42.360> they<00:01:42.720> make<00:01:42.930> a

down a brushstroke and they they make a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.389 
down a brushstroke and they they make a
very<00:01:43.049> even<00:01:43.860> flat<00:01:44.700> surface<00:01:45.950> craft<00:01:46.950> acrylics

bristle brush like this will leave

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.660 
bristle brush like this will leave
brushstrokes<00:02:30.959> these<00:02:31.959> are<00:02:32.110> just<00:02:32.200> really

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
brushstrokes these are just really

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.910 
brushstrokes these are just really
inexpensive<00:02:33.670> little<00:02:34.030> little<00:02:34.629> brushes<00:02:35.049> so<00:02:35.830> you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
inexpensive little little brushes so you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.180 
inexpensive little little brushes so you
can<00:02:36.190> see<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:37.620> these<00:02:38.620> are<00:02:38.799> actually<00:02:39.069> pretty

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
can see that these are actually pretty

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.910 
can see that these are actually pretty
worn<00:02:39.519> down<00:02:39.730> from<00:02:39.790> using<00:02:40.269> on<00:02:40.500> rough<00:02:41.500> gesso

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
already see how it's trying to level

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.930 
already see how it's trying to level
itself<00:03:04.629> so<00:03:05.590> when<00:03:06.129> I<00:03:06.160> use<00:03:06.370> my<00:03:06.400> brush<00:03:06.790> on<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:08.940> all

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
itself so when I use my brush on it all

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.900 
itself so when I use my brush on it all
those<00:03:10.239> blobs<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.989> are<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:11.319> there<00:03:11.910> will

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
those blobs that are in there will

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.309 
those blobs that are in there will
eventually<00:03:13.590> level<00:03:14.590> out<00:03:15.930> because<00:03:16.930> that's<00:03:17.169> what

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
eventually level out because that's what
