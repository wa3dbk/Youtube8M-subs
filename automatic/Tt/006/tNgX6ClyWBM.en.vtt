is<00:00:24.390> one<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:25.470> can<00:00:25.769> overwinter<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.000> just

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
is one that can overwinter but just

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.730 
is one that can overwinter but just
consider<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.439> whole<00:00:28.859> thing<00:00:29.340> grew<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.910> from

soil line-level just this summer and
it's<00:00:35.370> been<00:00:35.640> under<00:00:35.820> quite<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.750> stress<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it's been under quite a stress what I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.750 
it's been under quite a stress what I
like<00:00:38.940> about<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.520> one

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
like about it is that now this one

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.860 
like about it is that now this one
happens<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.710> yellow<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.829> orange<00:00:44.450> as<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
happens to be yellow and orange as the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.940 
happens to be yellow and orange as the
flowers<00:00:47.180> start<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.270> bloom<00:00:48.420> they're<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.530> lighter

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
flowers start to bloom they're a lighter

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.970 
flowers start to bloom they're a lighter
yellow<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.760> then<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.449> turn<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> gold<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
yellow and then they turn to a gold and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.299 
yellow and then they turn to a gold and
then<00:00:53.160> orange<00:00:54.410> there's<00:00:55.410> some<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.949> them<00:00:56.129> that

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
then orange there's some of them that

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.920 
then orange there's some of them that
are<00:00:56.660> combinations<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.989> pink<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> cream

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
are combinations of pink and cream

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.579

orange<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.590> gold<00:01:02.420> lavender<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.229> there's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
orange and gold lavender so there's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.289 
orange and gold lavender so there's
quite<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> variety<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:06.000> all<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.750> them<00:01:06.990> tend<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
quite a variety and all of them tend to

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.520 
quite a variety and all of them tend to
change<00:01:09.299> colors<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.229> newest<00:01:10.770> flowers<00:01:11.490> are

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
change colors the newest flowers are

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.620 
change colors the newest flowers are
lighter<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.310> they<00:01:14.520> deepen<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.270> color

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
lighter and then they deepen in color

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
lighter and then they deepen in color
with<00:01:15.990> age<00:01:16.460> they're<00:01:17.460> relatively<00:01:19.280> pest<00:01:20.280> free<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
with age they're relatively pest free I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.350 
with age they're relatively pest free I
mean<00:01:21.240> maintenance<00:01:21.780> free<00:01:22.729> cut<00:01:23.729> them<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.060> if

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
mean maintenance free cut them back if

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
mean maintenance free cut them back if
they're<00:01:24.570> Hardy<00:01:24.990> overwinter<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.979> cut

they're Hardy overwinter you can cut

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.280 
they're Hardy overwinter you can cut
