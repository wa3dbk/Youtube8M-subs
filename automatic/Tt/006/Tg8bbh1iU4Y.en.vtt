00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.710 
this book because I was so so pleased
with<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.890> story<00:04:03.250> when<00:04:03.670> I<00:04:03.760> was<00:04:03.940> like<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.360> third

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
with the story when I was like a third

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.900 
with the story when I was like a third
of<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.050> way<00:04:05.170> through<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:05.860> was<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.280> little<00:04:06.790> bit

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
of the way through I was a little bit

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.580 
of the way through I was a little bit
concerned<00:04:07.420> with<00:04:07.720> how<00:04:07.840> everything<00:04:08.380> was<00:04:08.500> going

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
concerned with how everything was going

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.949 
concerned with how everything was going
to<00:04:08.800> come<00:04:09.070> together<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.730> seemed<00:04:10.180> like<00:04:10.690> there

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
to come together it seemed like there

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.440 
to come together it seemed like there
was<00:04:11.140> just<00:04:11.470> too<00:04:11.800> much<00:04:12.010> stuff<00:04:12.400> going<00:04:12.430> on<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.330> I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
was just too much stuff going on and I

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.300 
was just too much stuff going on and I
wasn't<00:04:13.720> sure<00:04:13.900> how<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.380> was<00:04:14.560> all<00:04:14.830> going<00:04:15.040> to

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
wasn't sure how it was all going to

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.760 
wasn't sure how it was all going to
connect<00:04:15.910> together<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.540> make<00:04:16.720> sense<00:04:16.989> so

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
connect together and make sense so

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.240 
connect together and make sense so
imagine<00:04:18.580> my<00:04:18.730> complete<00:04:19.330> joy<00:04:19.810> when<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.380> did<00:04:20.799> you
