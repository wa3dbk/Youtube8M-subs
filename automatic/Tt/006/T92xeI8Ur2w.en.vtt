00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.920 
warfare 2 from black ops on call of duty
for<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.420> triple<00:02:53.290> with<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.409> m40<00:02:54.040> even<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.840> I

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
for a triple with the m40 even and I

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.619 
for a triple with the m40 even and I
don't<00:02:56.079> even<00:02:56.170> snap<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.650> often<00:02:56.980> but<00:02:57.599> yeah<00:02:58.599> I

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
don't even snap that often but yeah I

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.629 
don't even snap that often but yeah I
simply<00:02:59.260> cannot<00:02:59.500> wait<00:02:59.739> for<00:03:00.069> my<00:03:00.370> new<00:03:00.489> computer

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
simply cannot wait for my new computer

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.220 
simply cannot wait for my new computer
hopefully<00:03:01.269> this<00:03:01.420> time<00:03:01.599> everything<00:03:02.019> is<00:03:02.079> going

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
hopefully this time everything is going

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.289 
hopefully this time everything is going
to<00:03:02.290> go<00:03:02.379> well<00:03:02.409> and<00:03:02.829> nothing's<00:03:03.790> gonna<00:03:03.939> break

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
to go well and nothing's gonna break

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.569 
to go well and nothing's gonna break
because<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:04.989> see<00:03:05.139> I<00:03:05.170> think<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.680> UPS<00:03:06.250> kind<00:03:06.489> of

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
because you see I think that UPS kind of

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.330 
because you see I think that UPS kind of
messed<00:03:06.760> up<00:03:07.139> because<00:03:08.139> since<00:03:08.500> they<00:03:09.040> did<00:03:09.310> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
messed up because since they did a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.839 
messed up because since they did a
quality<00:03:09.879> check<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.389> that<00:03:10.959> warehouse<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:12.340> think

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
quality check in that warehouse I think

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.990 
quality check in that warehouse I think
it's<00:03:13.030> maybe<00:03:13.680> poor<00:03:14.680> handling<00:03:14.980> from<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.879> UPS

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
it's maybe poor handling from the UPS

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.960 
it's maybe poor handling from the UPS
from<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.019> UPS<00:03:17.139> store<00:03:17.379> now<00:03:18.099> I<00:03:18.370> really<00:03:18.819> don't

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
from the UPS store now I really don't

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.629 
from the UPS store now I really don't
care<00:03:19.410> whose<00:03:20.410> fault<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.859> it<00:03:20.889> I<00:03:21.129> just<00:03:21.340> want<00:03:21.519> my

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
care whose fault is it I just want my

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.970 
care whose fault is it I just want my
computer<00:03:22.030> fast<00:03:22.299> school<00:03:23.079> for<00:03:23.290> me<00:03:23.410> start<00:03:23.709> our

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
