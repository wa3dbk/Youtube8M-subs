00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.710
 Tell me guys, Bruno, just seven back. 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.900
 everything good beauty has a little time 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 people do not talk and it's hard, man. 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.150
 leave video here this good bag 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.160
 guys on today's video I need 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.140
 talk a little things with you there 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.900
 There are some justifications that I 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.029
 I need to give you guys there because the channel 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.460
 You're a mess in these last days. 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.520
 video is infrequently 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.620
 because I need to explain why 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 will carry even more in the days of June 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.450
 to leave at most one week I think neither 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.640
 comes to us both regulate the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.500
 accurate channel content as well 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.500
 explain to you there what is 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 with the race to the record 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.239
 twitter followers and already 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.980
 You know I need to start over, right? 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.690
 I got to make it clear because what 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.390
 I happened to explain it to you today. 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.940
 I also wanted to talk a little bit well 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.040
 fast and soon about the teaser 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.270
 trailer that came out of the men in the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.670
 backoffice 2 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.890
 I just want to say something here. 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.070
 to make it clear that it is obvious that I 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.570
 I'm following up and it's very obvious 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.070
 I 'm very anxious too, I'm 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.119
 very excited trailer left us 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.040
 very happy 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.110
 Good, let me explain to you that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.900
 that happened this week in the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.270
 channel started it all with me having some 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.189
 Some problems on the internet had a day 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.350
 I could not post a video that 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.759
 was giving a direct error had another 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.579
 Also, I started posting a 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.259
 video two o'clock in the normal three 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.450
 and a maximum of four hours would be 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.299
 released and the video was only released half 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.820
 night I had to re-upload a 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.649
 twice in the then it left a 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.340
 the scheme in the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.350
 channel 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.210
 I ended up forcing the bar just to 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.280
 release because the guys were curious to 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.860
 respect for the first race record 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.170
 but it was complicated to make the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.920
 internet was half steady and that was 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.350
 difficult 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.570
 adding to this is the fact that I am of 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.460
 change and I already mentioned in the last video 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.829
 I'm about to change my address here. 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.319
 and this change happens now in the next 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.310
 Tuesday then it took me one 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.420
 a little time 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.819
 There were some things that I need. 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.140
 solve and this took me a little bit 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.150
 here on the channel 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.790
 so I wanted to justify to you that it is 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.440
 on account of this besides having had some 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.959
 I have problems with the internet with this 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.270
 change so I'm still going to take 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.340
 one more day this weekend 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.410
 We're hardly going to have another video 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.090
 and posting this now on Saturday 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.400
 I'm hardly going to bring a Sunday. 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.019
 to vote in the rush to dismantle the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300
 things to make the change 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.920
 tuck her a new apartment of one 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.920
 clean these things 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.810
 so I hardly come back here then 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.400
 I should not be making a video as well. 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.489
 likely that I will only make a 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.470
 video for you guys on Monday 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.930
 I can not guarantee because the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.940
 change on Tuesday arriving in the new 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.860
 expensive address has the internet issue 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.769
 installation has already been requested but I 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.690
 I know exactly when it's going to be okay if 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.580
 already on Wednesday it's all alright 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.400
 It's already organized for me. 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.569
 continue playing the channel content or 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.450
 If I suddenly have to wait until 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.069
 500 Friday would have taken that not Wednesday 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.440
 There are zombie trailer I want. 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.200
 have active may want're doing 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.269
 things that if not I will be in panic is 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.500
 good but was that guys needed 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.709
 explain to you that I'm in a 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.480
 rather run here but it's already momentary 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.090
 we return with normal content 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.130
 stabilized on the channel I'll come back with 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.970
 world record for you too 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.829
 in that 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.019
 I have to explain to you how I 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.900
 I already said I'll have to start over 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.489
 race for the world record was not for 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.230
 cause of the change was not because I fell 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.260
 simply lacked light people were missing 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.690
 light illuminate remember the day was if not me 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.940
 It was a mistake on Wednesday or Thursday. 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.100
 I 'm not sure now but anyway I 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.269
 had just played a session leave 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.989
 a pause I was in the 99 round of already 99% 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.209
 I do not remember now but I think 98 99 is 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.400
 I left the stage to take a look at the 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.920
 twitter these things is luÃ­s pisco cara 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.840
 so she did not pay the light of 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.220
 A quick blink was time. 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.709
 enough to turn off the xbox 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.140
 Dude, I was in the day what irritates to give 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.110
 I'm suffocated, I'm stressed. 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.360
 I curse half the world but there's no way right 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.400
 I'll have to start over, it's good to see you again. 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.470
 I'll tell you the truth because with this 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.849
 situation of change and this is 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.940
 complicated I would have to play in 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.310
 run I was honestly 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.190
 considering leaving TV and video games 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.440
 here to continue coming here they brought 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.289
 laptop record something played a 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.330
 A little bit because it's complicated. 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.570
 terminate on account of the date of 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.270
 But, anyway, it happened, there was already a lack of light. 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.310
 now the next attempt and for the 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.080
 second season then I 'll be there 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.000
 organized differently I will 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.599
 try to get a nobreak to power 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.880
 avoid 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.620
 and there already voted appealed stabilized not 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.200
 I'll need to run having to solve 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.789
 other things then next time 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.659
 sure that the focus is going to be another will be 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.550
 best 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.349
 We'll come quickly and I do not know if 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.789
 I'll start posting something to 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.979
 From the beginning, I'll speak on twitter. 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.200
 I'm already doing but maybe in a 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.840
 post gameplay from time to time another one 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.789
 I'll leave it to post after the round. 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.979
 without it being more or less where I stopped and 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.760
 Then we play our race. 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.560
 beauty is good, I wanted to explain it too 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.990
 thanked the support of all of you guys 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.450
 were excellent supporting I left 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.580
 very motivated and keeps me motivated 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.650
 support you gave as I told you 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.300
 I'm going to start over and I 'm sure 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.180
 to continue to support me at least 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.250
 motivated, I'm good now let's talk about 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.789
 trailer on the good guys debut that came 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.460
 peeing sesinho there for us I 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.200
 never seen him do prates teaser say right 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.150
 we thought it would have a trailer and 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.280
 we did not have a teaser for 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.479
 trailer but left the people excited to 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.090
 people saw there a totally 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.099
 different with face of a bigger world 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.680
 even say of an open world plus one 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.750
 map and then there is that bus that 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.479
 people did not understand exactly what they want 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.250
 We're going to have a lot on the teaser, but I 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.070
 I'm going to say that you've let me think that 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.990
 This could be a cop 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.530
 I believe this bus is 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:26.190
 involved nuno survivor is the normal mode 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.080
 that we know because I never 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.199
 a lot goes a bus walking on the way 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.699
 that we usually play is may even be 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.500
 that it is present on the map of 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.490
 we start at it and open the door. 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.590
 bus door 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.479
 exploring the remainder of the map but 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.990
 I think it gave me the impression of a 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.789
 campaign maybe the cope in which you 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.590
 suddenly starts on the bus and then you 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.330
 You need to walk around the city. 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.069
 And there is a big city you need 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.490
 suddenly stop at the post instead have some 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:55.860
 ammunition I do not know about 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.330
 Suddenly and gives something I do not know 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.270
 I'm changing that they're implementing 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.940
 now implementing in forgiveness 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.410
 so I do not know, people, we'll have to 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.530
 wait, we'll have to see what's going on 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.139
 Rolling confess that I'm anxious 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.120
 fucking to see the trailer us 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:14.370
 will see now on the 26th next time 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.530
 Wednesday as I said all twisted 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.389
 to have everything right in the new gaff and 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.880
 the internet is already installed so that I can 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.319
 can not only watch a species 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.240
 of a breaking dawn there for you 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:25.830
 There's a lot of new things to try, but we're going 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.300
 see if we already recognize some 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.650
 little beauty 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.780
 Good people, I needed to bring this up. 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.880
 You wanted as I said, I speak very briefly. 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.289
 about training up because the teaser 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.300
 so he went the full trailer to 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:38.250
 We will talk better about it makes 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.960
 Of course for you, I do not know
