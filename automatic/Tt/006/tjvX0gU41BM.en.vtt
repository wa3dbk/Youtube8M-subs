00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.229 
bottom right here and then you follow
your<00:02:07.349> natural<00:02:07.530> lip<00:02:08.190> line<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.670> rest<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.090> your

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
your natural lip line the rest of your

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.780 
your natural lip line the rest of your

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
lip and you can just draw on barely the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.180 
lip and you can just draw on barely the
edge<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.450> your<00:02:12.660> natural<00:02:13.079> lip<00:02:13.319> line<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:14.069> that's

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
edge of your natural lip line so that's

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.309 
edge of your natural lip line so that's
step<00:02:14.459> one<00:02:14.700> now<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.599> want<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.870> take<00:02:16.049> it<00:02:16.170> a

step one now if you want to take it a

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.770 
step one now if you want to take it a
step<00:02:16.349> further<00:02:16.590> go<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.549> with<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:18.090> slightly

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
step further go in with a slightly

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.809 
step further go in with a slightly
darker<00:02:19.230> lip<00:02:19.650> liner<00:02:19.950> than<00:02:20.250> whatever<00:02:20.430> shade

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.930 

and<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> part<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.460> can<00:02:47.640> really

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.840 
to side till I get the shape that I want
and<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.560> take<00:02:55.800> oh<00:02:55.980> by<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.340> way<00:02:56.490> this<00:02:56.670> is

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and then you take oh by the way this is

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.820 
and then you take oh by the way this is
Worrell<00:02:57.150> by<00:02:57.480> Mac<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.110> then<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.410> take<00:02:58.590> this

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
Worrell by Mac so then you take this

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.670 
Worrell by Mac so then you take this
liner<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.460> you<00:02:59.610> blend<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.120> down<00:03:00.390> gently<00:03:00.930> into

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
liner and you blend it down gently into

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.380 
liner and you blend it down gently into
the<00:03:01.710> rest<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> lip<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:02.730> don't<00:03:02.940> fill<00:03:03.210> in

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the rest of the lip but don't fill in

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.600 
the rest of the lip but don't fill in
your<00:03:03.570> whole<00:03:03.810> lip<00:03:04.110> just<00:03:04.410> blend<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.430> little

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
your whole lip just blend it a little

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:16.850 
your whole lip just blend it a little
bit<00:03:14.209> now<00:03:15.209> we<00:03:15.270> are<00:03:15.750> going<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.200> use<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.620> same

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
bit now we are going to use the same

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.790 
bit now we are going to use the same
liner<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.400> shade<00:03:17.790> on<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.420> outside<00:03:19.020> corners

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
liner and shade on the outside corners

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:35.390 
liner and shade on the outside corners
to<00:03:20.040> create<00:03:20.190> more<00:03:20.550> dimension<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.950> we're<00:03:35.160> doing

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
to create more dimension so we're doing

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.010 
to create more dimension so we're doing
this<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.030> looks<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.570> brightest

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
this so that it looks like the brightest

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.600 
this so that it looks like the brightest
part<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.410> lip<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.770> in<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.010> center<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.550> the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
part of the lip is in the center and the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.250 
part of the lip is in the center and the
darkest<00:03:39.060> parts<00:03:39.300> on<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.540> outside<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:40.110> it's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
darkest parts on the outside so it's

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.380 
darkest parts on the outside so it's
kind<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.530> like<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.920> bit<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.280> an<00:03:41.489> ombre<00:03:41.940> lip<00:03:42.180> if

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
kind of like a bit of an ombre lip if

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.120 
kind of like a bit of an ombre lip if
you<00:03:42.660> will<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:43.170> gives<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.560> illusion<00:03:43.800> of

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
you will and that gives the illusion of

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.280 
you will and that gives the illusion of
a<00:03:44.250> larger<00:03:44.430> plumper<00:03:45.300> lip<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.750> center<00:03:46.020> then

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
a larger plumper lip in the center then
