last a week it may last a month and
you'll<00:00:17.340> find<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.180> boilers<00:00:18.570> cut<00:00:18.810> off<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
you'll find you the boilers cut off and

you'll find you the boilers cut off and
when<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.470> go<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.770> look<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.100> find<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.430> prices

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
when you go and look you find a prices

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.269 
when you go and look you find a prices
dropped<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.080> gauge<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.830> need<00:00:23.130> to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
dropped on the gauge and you need to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.310 
dropped on the gauge and you need to
refill

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
refill

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.640

now<00:00:25.320> generally<00:00:26.189> combi<00:00:27.150> boilers<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.630> want<00:00:27.930> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
now generally combi boilers do want you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.370 
now generally combi boilers do want you
know<00:00:28.800> top<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.490> every<00:00:30.060> three<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.810> six<00:00:31.050> months

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
know top it up every three to six months

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.069 
know top it up every three to six months
that's<00:00:31.560> quite<00:00:31.890> normal<00:00:32.180> but<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.630> find<00:00:33.930> this

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
that's quite normal but if you find this

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.620 
that's quite normal but if you find this
is<00:00:34.260> happening<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.680> every<00:00:35.219> week<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.480> you're

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
is happening so every week and you're

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.670 
is happening so every week and you're
doing<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.110> every<00:00:37.489> five<00:00:38.489> minutes<00:00:39.079> you<00:00:40.079> probably

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
doing it every five minutes you probably

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.639 
doing it every five minutes you probably
got<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> leak<00:00:41.190> I'm<00:00:41.460> afraid<00:00:41.820> now<00:00:42.469> there<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
got a leak I'm afraid now there is a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
got a leak I'm afraid now there is a
Cutler's<00:00:44.040> new<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> pressure<00:00:45.300> vessel

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
Cutler's new it can be a pressure vessel

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.959 
Cutler's new it can be a pressure vessel
in<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.920> boy<00:00:47.070> which<00:00:47.280> I'll<00:00:47.430> show<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.879> minute

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
in a boy which I'll show you in a minute

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.000 
in a boy which I'll show you in a minute
a<00:00:48.149> way<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> testing<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.559> first<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.890> all

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
a way of testing that but first of all

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.189 
a way of testing that but first of all
if<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.760> got<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.629> pressure<00:00:51.930> drop

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
if you have got this pressure drop

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.000 
if you have got this pressure drop
problem<00:00:53.059> most<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> times<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.530> thing<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
problem most of the times the thing to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.750 
problem most of the times the thing to
check<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.989> obviously<00:00:57.989> links<00:00:58.710> around<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
check is obviously links around the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.910 
check is obviously links around the
house<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.600> check<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> pipe<00:01:01.230> what<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.680> can

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
house just check the pipe what you can

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.670 
house just check the pipe what you can
so<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.219> first<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:02.940> go<00:01:03.210> around<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so you first of all go around and just

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.260 
so you first of all go around and just
see<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.460> anything<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:06.090> nearly

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
see if you can see anything or nearly

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.050 
see if you can see anything or nearly
the<00:01:06.390> pipe<00:01:06.720> work<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.520> usual<00:01:08.520> other<00:01:08.700> time

it's one of the main ones I come across

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.370 
it's one of the main ones I come across
all<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> time<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.280> radiator<00:01:14.670> valve<00:01:15.380> these

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
all the time is the radiator valve these

vessel up here could well be your

vessel up here could well be your

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
problem and if it is leaking and not

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.450 
problem and if it is leaking and not
holding<00:04:20.989> then<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.200> would<00:04:22.380> be<00:04:22.560> another

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.640 
reason you're losing pressure so there
is<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.620> way<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.860> doing<00:04:26.250> this

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
is a way of doing this

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.680 
is a way of doing this
checking<00:04:26.949> that<00:04:27.070> that<00:04:27.220> is<00:04:27.340> okay<00:04:27.729> he<00:04:27.940> came<00:04:28.630> very

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
checking that that is okay he came very

up<00:05:26.289> but<00:05:26.530> if<00:05:27.310> they're<00:05:27.580> leaking<00:05:27.990> believe<00:05:28.990> me

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
up but if they're leaking believe me

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.379 
up but if they're leaking believe me
that's<00:05:29.410> it<00:05:29.620> usually<00:05:30.009> it's<00:05:30.610> just<00:05:30.880> replace<00:05:31.360> it

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
that's it usually it's just replace it

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.050 
that's it usually it's just replace it
he's<00:05:32.050> not<00:05:32.229> worth<00:05:32.440> trying<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.800> mess<00:05:32.919> about<00:05:33.070> okay

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
he's not worth trying to mess about okay

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.640 
he's not worth trying to mess about okay
so<00:05:34.120> that's<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.419> two<00:05:34.570> ways<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:34.990> finding<00:05:35.320> out<00:05:35.620> if

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
so that's the two ways of finding out if

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.800 
so that's the two ways of finding out if
you<00:05:35.889> have<00:05:36.010> pressure<00:05:36.280> drops<00:05:36.610> what<00:05:37.270> to<00:05:37.570> do<00:05:37.690> about

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
you have pressure drops what to do about

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.189 
you have pressure drops what to do about
it

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
it

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.650 
it
and<00:05:38.470> usually<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.949> simplest<00:05:39.250> easy<00:05:39.550> one<00:05:39.820> is<00:05:40.360> the

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
and usually the simplest easy one is the

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.500 
and usually the simplest easy one is the
radiator<00:05:41.050> valve<00:05:41.849> problem<00:05:42.849> I've<00:05:42.970> seen<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.330> so

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
radiator valve problem I've seen it so

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.750 
radiator valve problem I've seen it so
many<00:05:43.539> times<00:05:43.750> they<00:05:44.139> do<00:05:44.289> check<00:05:44.530> it<00:05:44.680> out<00:05:44.860> and

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
many times they do check it out and

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.339 
many times they do check it out and
obviously<00:05:45.909> if<00:05:46.360> you<00:05:46.539> find<00:05:46.780> nothing<00:05:46.900> after<00:05:47.320> that

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
obviously if you find nothing after that

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.899 
obviously if you find nothing after that
and<00:05:47.770> you've<00:05:47.889> got<00:05:48.039> pipe<00:05:48.280> work<00:05:48.490> going<00:05:48.699> on<00:05:48.820> the

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
and you've got pipe work going on the

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.180 
and you've got pipe work going on the
floor<00:05:49.180> then<00:05:49.389> you<00:05:49.960> know<00:05:50.110> it's<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.530> nasty<00:05:50.979> job

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
floor then you know it's the nasty job

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.950 
floor then you know it's the nasty job
of<00:05:51.340> taking<00:05:51.580> floorboards<00:05:52.180> up<00:05:52.270> do<00:05:52.479> check<00:05:52.750> the

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
of taking floorboards up do check the

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.589 
of taking floorboards up do check the
ceilings<00:05:53.550> make<00:05:54.550> sure<00:05:54.669> you<00:05:54.820> can<00:05:54.970> see<00:05:55.150> no<00:05:55.300> damp

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
ceilings make sure you can see no damp

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.300 
ceilings make sure you can see no damp
stains<00:05:55.960> anywhere<00:05:56.199> because<00:05:56.770> that<00:05:57.010> could<00:05:57.130> be<00:05:57.280> a

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
stains anywhere because that could be a

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.610 
stains anywhere because that could be a
pipe<00:05:57.580> leak<00:05:57.820> under<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.180> floor<00:05:58.419> upstairs<00:05:58.750> and

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
pipe leak under the floor upstairs and

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.469 
pipe leak under the floor upstairs and
to<00:05:59.979> do<00:06:00.130> check<00:06:00.400> every<00:06:00.669> single<00:06:00.820> ceiling<00:06:01.330> where

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
to do check every single ceiling where

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.570 
to do check every single ceiling where
Red's<00:06:01.720> go<00:06:01.960> through<00:06:02.320> no<00:06:02.620> easy<00:06:02.949> pipes<00:06:03.280> going

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
Red's go through no easy pipes going

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.939 
Red's go through no easy pipes going
through<00:06:03.849> if<00:06:04.780> you<00:06:04.930> can't<00:06:05.169> find<00:06:05.440> a<00:06:05.560> leak<00:06:05.710> on<00:06:05.889> the

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
through if you can't find a leak on the

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.980 
through if you can't find a leak on the
radiator<00:06:06.340> valve<00:06:06.669> so<00:06:07.240> just<00:06:07.539> check<00:06:07.810> everything

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
radiator valve so just check everything

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.189 
radiator valve so just check everything
you<00:06:08.530> can<00:06:08.710> see<00:06:08.949> the<00:06:09.190> Patel<00:06:09.610> tell<00:06:09.880> signs<00:06:10.210> okay

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
you can see the Patel tell signs okay

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.870 
you can see the Patel tell signs okay
and<00:06:11.470> that's<00:06:11.830> about<00:06:11.949> it<00:06:12.250> it's<00:06:12.340> about<00:06:12.580> as<00:06:12.729> easy

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
and that's about it it's about as easy

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.379 
and that's about it it's about as easy
as<00:06:13.090> it<00:06:13.330> can<00:06:13.539> be<00:06:13.750> to<00:06:14.250> check<00:06:15.250> a<00:06:15.550> combi<00:06:16.360> boiler

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
as it can be to check a combi boiler

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.020 
as it can be to check a combi boiler
pressure<00:06:16.840> drop<00:06:17.260> okay<00:06:17.949> that's<00:06:18.159> it<00:06:18.310> from<00:06:18.460> me<00:06:18.610> all

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
pressure drop okay that's it from me all

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.250 
pressure drop okay that's it from me all
my<00:06:19.210> videos<00:06:19.510> dirt<00:06:19.750> and<00:06:19.960> 33<00:06:20.380> thanks<00:06:20.979> very<00:06:21.130> much
