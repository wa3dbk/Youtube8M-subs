00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.179
 dominique lacaze I am on the commune 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.950
 of lunac this department of the high 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.280
 on a farm in 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.800
 mixed-farming 115 hectares with 65 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.320
 sea ​​so 50 white of Aquitaine and 15 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.859
 Montbeliarde in veal production 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.340
 under the mother 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.580
 I moved in 1984 with my 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.489
 brother in Greek getting separated family 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.770
 and then then the 2000s I 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.340
 I converted after the different 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.020
 sb crises to have a flock for 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.450
 to produce beautiful oneself is a 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.020
 production that has in income that 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.579
 therefore hold all year long and that holds 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.440
 also so that's the seizures that I 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.320
 think it's very important when we 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.020
 has commitments so financial by 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.320
 compared to loans that we could 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.840
 do for the buildings for the morning 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.039
 related to the others a certain moment he 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.860
 have to have an income that hold 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.420
 do not think that the calf under the mother 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.310
 is a production totally 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.500
 binding I organized my production 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.570

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.760

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.439

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.730
 income since the is so worth on the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.950
