00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.200

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.819
 giggs on. rock'n'roll 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.879
 hello youtube with you quiet and I 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:12.490
 i'm in norway and it's awesome 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:16.090
 because I found eggs here 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.400
 Spiderman is an exclusive kind 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.619
 because we don't have it in St. Petersburg if 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.449
 you saw something similar in your city 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.910
 please write about it in Russia 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.789
 because I have no such thing 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.220
 I was delighted and bought two pieces and all 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.990
 just gonna unpack them for you 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.160
 because I myself am very interested in what 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.129
 there they publish it inside 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.020
 certain sound but something is there 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.590
 I'll show you how it looks 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.640
 it looks like this spiderman 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.890
 spiderman with lots of inscriptions 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.690
 Arabic do not know where he came from 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.070
 a certain firm for and not for and not 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.989
 week knowledge paid at least something 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.210
 marvel apparently not because 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.460
 there is no trade icon here 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.940
 marvel nothing just spiderman 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.330
 but I absolutely do not care 20 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.180
 a gram weighs one such chocolate egg 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.640
 all I will unpack it for you 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.040
 it seems that this is a lot of fun, this has 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.410
 I would not now have in Kinder 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.070
 collection of avengers I to it until 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.530
 got 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.130
 but I decided to do something different 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 spiderman for you by color 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.470
 reminds chocolate kinder 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.200
 but inside of course no dairy 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.800
 there is no interlayer 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.020
 incomprehensible container and in it 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.500
 really apparently finding 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.950
 or regiment you won't believe 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.060
 yes indeed spiderman at base 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.740
 we all always start with the base I think 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.440
 what should I do with this build 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.550
 Yes, I managed this assembly and gums 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.740
 assembly on which I handled this 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.380
 here is spiderman 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.670
 I got caught in this kinder 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.420
 What can I say a little bit 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.920
 his strange hand is not falling apart 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.500
 slightly here's hands move nothing 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.380
 moving just a little sitting 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.510
 spiderman baking pose well what can I do 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.489
 say probably not bad for such 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.230
 sudden eggs you try to such 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.580
 plain milk chocolate is not bad 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.880
 let's take a second time 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:42.430
 so what we have here is that he so you him it 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.290
 all while from the frame and we will be 2 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.940
 unfolding the wall perfectly su 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.160
 Kinder Spider Man I think that 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.989
 we need this more table and who 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.280
 agree with me put huskies because 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.410
 what I think we need more 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.100
 similar superheroes 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.020
 gif is all sorts of chips in general chips 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.010
 excuse him if you are a man to whom 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:07.350
 need more fairies in this world so this 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:11.320
 Generally on the myrtle question stuck here 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.770
 so love it so much the same 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.300
 fucking spiderman 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.760
 they are all the same but not 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.750
 wait no it's not the same 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:28.900
 spiderman is spiderman in another 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.700
 song benefits cool sweet on what 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.850
 Actually it's not bad here, see 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.440
 now it's spiderman 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.460
 a little strange but oh well 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.550
 here is spiderman 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:47.560
 stand-up serve up to quality 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:53.650
 just leaves a lot to be desired 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.930
 but I basically can not mean anything 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.810
 say bad because it is so 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.150
 cool topic is better for such people 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.030
 spiders than without it now 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.740
 let's see what is in the piece of paper which is here to 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.090
 This is attached because there is 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.620
 a piece of paper it look here maybe 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.420
 much more than just some 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.959
 Spiderman here can be key chains 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.030
 Spider-Man and Iron Fist, and new 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.489
 and by the way, I completely forgot to you 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.530
 tell that this is the same ultimatum series 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.350
 spiderman in a new cartoon 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.660
 and yes this is not what risk a marvel license 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.220
 It is not of the type I have nothing to do 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.300
 I think it's unreal to pay for it 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.340
 something here is such a collection 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.919
