00:00:00.762 --> 00:00:03.482
Today, or whenever you end watching this

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:04.931
We're talking about dirty money.

00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:07.151
Personally, when someone says dirty money

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.000
I imagine a filthy bank note

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.220
Drector: That's not what it means.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.420
I could tell you

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.128
That fecal bacteria are present on 14% of banknotes in the UK.

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:17.340
And 10% of credit cards.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.927
Probably because they're present on 26% of hands. Ewww.

00:00:20.927 --> 00:00:24.746
Maybe I could tell you that the average banknote is covered in 26,000 bacteria

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:27.981
And that a one pound coin has more germs than a toilet seat.

00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:28.480
Ughh.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.506
I could carry on and say that if you're a fan of plastic,

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:32.939
a) You're gonna love this next bit.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.620
And b) You're a bit weird.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.286
Basically, the Bank of England has announced they're introducing plastic banknotes

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.260
That'll be more environmentally friendly and more easily wipeable

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.440
In case you spill juice on them because your friend dares you to drink it while juggling

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.460
Which you totally can do! You owe me a tenner by the way Emma!

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.407
Director: Woah, let's bring it back.

00:00:46.407 --> 00:00:48.898
Plus, you can put them through the washing machine.

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:52.999
But, I'm gonna talk about that because that would be disgusting.

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:54.019
Director: And you already have.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.981
Another kind of dirty money, is the criminal kind.

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.573
I'm talking money laundering.

00:00:58.573 --> 00:01:02.200
Which despite what I literally. Just. Said. Is not putting money in the washing machine.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.020
Director: That's just confusing.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.729
It's when people who've got money from something naughty and criminal

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.245
Make it look like that money came from somewhere legal.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.780
Like, restaurant or a casino.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.486
To make things more confusing, Al Capone, actually did launder his money through a laundrette.

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:18.873
And now a lot of people think that's where the phrase comes from.

00:01:18.873 --> 00:01:20.733
Then there's counterfeit money.

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.085
Which is just fake money that's not been made at the Royal Mint.

00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:25.439
Could just be a printer in some guys basement.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.039
Well that guy and his printer are going to get into some serious trouble!

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.360
Because counterfeit money is very, very illegal,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.240
It's even a criminal offence to pass on counterfeit money, let alone make it.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.432
There's an act called the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.100
Or FAC Ac,t as I like to call it,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.550
Saying if you get passed a fake banknote, you have to hand it into the police without any compensation.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.940
Annoying right?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.565
Counterfeit money can also be a weapon of war.

00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:51.025
Not just by using the sharp edge to paper cut your way to victory!

00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:52.766
But in more devious ways!

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.100
The Nazis hatched a plan called Bernard

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.540
Well... Operation Bernhardt.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.680
To inject £134 million pounds worth of counterfeit cash into the British economy.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.760
To cause total panic in World War 2.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.260
Ouch.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.322
These day, there's far less less counterfeit money in the UK economy.

00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:07.602
But it's still around!

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:09.600
In the first six month of 2014,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.820
They took 233,000 counterfeit bank notes out of the economy.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.060
With a face value of £4.2 million pounds.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.360
Look, the point is, next time you think you've got dirty oney

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.362
Hand it into the police or you know, just wash your hands.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.860
Director: Wash your hands? That's how you're going to end this video?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.323
Luke: What? It's good advice! It's all about Money Stuff with you guys

00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:31.823
Director: Ha! You said the channel name.
