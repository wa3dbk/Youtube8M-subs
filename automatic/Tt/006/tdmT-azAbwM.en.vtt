it's a little too I use the wrong wheel
hinge<00:05:04.670> piece<00:05:04.880> there<00:05:05.170> because<00:05:06.170> I<00:05:06.290> couldn't<00:05:06.800> all

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
hinge piece there because I couldn't all

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.790 
hinge piece there because I couldn't all
I<00:05:07.280> can<00:05:07.730> only<00:05:07.820> find<00:05:07.910> one<00:05:08.540> of<00:05:09.440> these<00:05:10.690> so<00:05:11.690> I'd<00:05:12.470> use

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
I can only find one of these so I'd use

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.290 
I can only find one of these so I'd use
two<00:05:12.950> of<00:05:12.980> these<00:05:13.100> since<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:13.790> could<00:05:13.940> only<00:05:14.000> find<00:05:14.240> one

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
two of these since I could only find one

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.090 
two of these since I could only find one
of<00:05:14.420> these<00:05:14.540> and<00:05:14.900> it<00:05:14.960> would<00:05:15.080> look<00:05:15.200> better<00:05:15.440> even

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
of these and it would look better even

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.860 
of these and it would look better even
if<00:05:16.130> even<00:05:16.370> if<00:05:16.670> those<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.210> wrong<00:05:17.390> piece<00:05:17.720> it

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
if even if those the wrong piece it

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.080 
if even if those the wrong piece it
would<00:05:17.960> look<00:05:18.050> better<00:05:18.170> if<00:05:18.380> I<00:05:18.470> do<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.830> same<00:05:19.090> so

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
would look better if I do the same so

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.670 
would look better if I do the same so
