the reason why I've got three is because
coke<00:02:14.340> ovens<00:02:14.730> produce<00:02:16.010> creatine<00:02:17.010> oil<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:18.450> it's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
coke ovens produce creatine oil but it's

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.350 
coke ovens produce creatine oil but it's
not<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.470> powerful<00:02:19.800> with<00:02:20.130> such<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:20.430> bet<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
not as powerful with such we bet the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.640 
not as powerful with such we bet the
same<00:02:21.510> as<00:02:21.720> coal<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:24.350> think<00:02:25.350> see<00:02:25.440> we've<00:02:25.560> got

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
same as coal and I think see we've got

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.530 
same as coal and I think see we've got
something<00:02:25.860> going<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.220> there<00:02:26.370> now<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:29.640> think

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
something going in there now and I think

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.250 
something going in there now and I think
that's<00:02:30.660> about<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.360> creatine<00:02:33.780> oil<00:02:34.020> you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that's about it so this creatine oil you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.480 
that's about it so this creatine oil you
can<00:02:34.410> either<00:02:34.500> use<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.890> power<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.310> steam

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
can either use it the power of steam

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.710 
can either use it the power of steam
boil<00:02:35.900> or<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.800> store<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.300> if<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.510> wanna

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
boil or you can store it if you do wanna

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.740 
boil or you can store it if you do wanna
store<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.020> use<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.980> later<00:02:41.070> on<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.610> railcraft

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
store it use it later on for railcraft

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.140 
store it use it later on for railcraft
items<00:02:43.490> but<00:02:44.490> generally<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:44.820> you're<00:02:44.880> gonna<00:02:45.030> use

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
items but generally if you're gonna use

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.790 
items but generally if you're gonna use
it<00:02:45.209> for<00:02:45.300> power<00:02:45.600> source<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.080> need<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.680> produce

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
it for power source you need to produce

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.690 
it for power source you need to produce
a<00:02:47.070> lot<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:48.810> generally<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.620> use<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.070> as<00:02:50.250> a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
a lot of it I generally just use it as a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.000 
a lot of it I generally just use it as a
startup<00:02:51.630> fuel<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.530> start<00:02:52.980> my<00:02:53.250> steam<00:02:53.459> boilers

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
startup fuel to start my steam boilers

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.670 
startup fuel to start my steam boilers
it<00:02:56.010> would<00:02:56.250> take<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> lot<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:57.020> coal<00:02:58.020> coal<00:02:58.440> coke

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
it would take a lot of coal coal coke

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.920 
it would take a lot of coal coal coke
ovens<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.510> actually<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.630> one<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.810> these

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
ovens to actually have one of these

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.500 
ovens to actually have one of these
running<00:03:01.200> at<00:03:01.350> full<00:03:01.530> power<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.209> think<00:03:03.390> that's

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
running at full power and I think that's

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.830 
running at full power and I think that's
about<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:05.060> thanks<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:07.610> comment<00:03:08.610> like<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.750> you
