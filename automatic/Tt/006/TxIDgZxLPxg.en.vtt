 I present you the last born in 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.540
 this family of instruments so that one 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.280
 there is a violin so I redraw a 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:15.639
 little shape we have five horns or dosol 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:21.700
 ray the friend the friendly strings are 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:24.010
 number of twelve how submitted to the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.440
 manufacturing I also ride 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.320
 sensors three of which one under 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.160
 the treble 1 on the soundbar and 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.570
 one or for the mood the jack is located 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.579
 here there is no pre amp in 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.469
 the instrument the level of its level of 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.870
 exit is quite important often there 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.579
 do not need it 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.579
 but well so I 'll do it to you 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.960
 me 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.910
 so here's a rough overview of his 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.740
 acoustic of the instrument obviously the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.260
 simpler is to come to the workshop 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.880
