00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.769
 hello everyone today, I came across 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.920
 such an interesting knife I wanted with you 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.430
 share and tell you a little about 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:22.070
 The fact is that this knife is it 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:23.539
 homemade ie work nobody 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.220
 very famous wizard 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.150
 but no less a knife for his 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.750
 characteristics 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.300
 I would say outstanding what is the beauty 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.489
 this knife 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.680
 he is small 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.110
 he has a concave back lens downhill 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.040
 from about the middle of the blade it has 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.219
 yet such a not very 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.050
 great sharpening 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.809
 would be so mean of yourself 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.800
 a hunting knife is essentially with 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:04.939
 kinder this shkuroder it shows by 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.779
 blade-shaped sharpening cutting 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:12.289
 edges well and actually speaking 

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:13.609
 outstanding is this knife this quality 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.630
 making it 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:21.740
 guys i will tell you this is something all 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.929
 like on the perfect perfect lines 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.029
 blade 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:30.490
 beautifully made this one here pride in 

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:35.990
 bolster whatever you like call it pen 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:41.359
 of this nickname pad this is the blade handle 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.459
 the clint sits in the handle for shrinkage just 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.479
 wonderfully drenched in something 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:50.169
 processed apparently this is some kind of 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:54.799
 wax based impregnation or similar and 

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:57.259
 perfectly visible texture of the wood here is 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.749
 there is a quality of manufacturing a knife 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.829
 amazing so what am i 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:05.230
 this whole conversation 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:08.899
 the thing is , I always thought that 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.850
 option to choose between brand knife and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.390
 somehow homemade by the floors herself 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.670
 famous master everlasting in principle 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.940
 question is a struggle of opinions I have always believed that 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.000
 better buy some kind of branding knife 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.210
 overpay for it maybe it will 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.610
 more expensive here but nevertheless to buy that 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.490
 a thing that will have stable 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.459
 quality characteristics 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.920
 indicators will be such 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.920
 declared by the manufacturer or so 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.030
 that is, as a result of this purchase, we would 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:52.630
 had a knife with predictable with some 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.270
 properties here I thought that knives works 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.030
 little known masters 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.450
 shrubs is something such a logy 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.870
 incomprehensible unstable but looking at 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.020
 this knife, I still 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.670
 probably reconsider because 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.580
 that the legs are extremely liked 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:21.070
 steel 9xc declared 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.220
 such a stainless pages 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.890
 instrumental point here 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.900
 amazingly made knife in quality 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:35.150
 he is not mine but probably in my plans 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.120
 order anything like that because 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.120
 workmanship I really 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.420
 liked i was frankly 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.140
 hit so much this knife is wonderful 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.870
 Looks like it is in operation 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.430
 Naturally time will tell here because 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.209
 you can still never have shelves 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.010
 dragged 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.570
 so easy are made carts all 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.700
 although on the other hand for the skinner 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.810
 it is quite possible that this basic 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.099
 sharpening and a little fix and everything is well 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.260
 so here 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.350
 this is me emotionally and today 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.139
 video if something is wrong correct me 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.139
 please thank you all bye
