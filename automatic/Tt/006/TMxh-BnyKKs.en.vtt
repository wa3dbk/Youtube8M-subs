I<00:00:07.440> didn't<00:00:08.040> think<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> repercussions

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
I didn't think that the repercussions

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.230 
I didn't think that the repercussions
would<00:00:09.960> reach<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:11.070> proportions<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.849> they

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
would reach the proportions that they

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.669 
would reach the proportions that they
have<00:00:12.420> obviously<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.990> fact<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.320> didn't<00:00:13.530> think

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
have obviously in fact I didn't think

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.310 
have obviously in fact I didn't think
about<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.009> at<00:00:14.099> all<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.639> now<00:00:15.139> knowledge<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.230> was

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
about it at all and now knowledge it was

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.930 
about it at all and now knowledge it was
a<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.680> really<00:00:16.800> stupid<00:00:17.190> thing<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.760> do

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
a really really stupid thing to do

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.429 
a really really stupid thing to do
particularly<00:00:18.300> because<00:00:18.510> Andrew<00:00:18.840> Sachs<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.260> an

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
