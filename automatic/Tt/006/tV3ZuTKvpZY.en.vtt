hey this is Daniel for Adorama I'm here
in<00:00:08.820> my<00:00:08.910> studio<00:00:09.090> in<00:00:09.269> New<00:00:09.420> York<00:00:09.570> City<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.050> we're

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
in my studio in New York City and we're

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.240 
in my studio in New York City and we're
going<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.320> make<00:00:10.410> some<00:00:10.590> portraits<00:00:10.860> using<00:00:11.190> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
going to make some portraits using a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.520 
going to make some portraits using a
softbox<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.450> soft<00:00:12.660> boxes<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.139> something<00:00:13.410> that

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
softbox so soft boxes are something that

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.780 
softbox so soft boxes are something that
a<00:00:13.559> lot<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.769> people<00:00:13.980> own<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.460> they're<00:00:14.580> super

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
a lot of people own and they're super

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.950 
a lot of people own and they're super
versatile<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.420> I'm<00:00:15.509> going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.780> use<00:00:15.929> one

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
versatile so I'm going to just use one

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.450 
versatile so I'm going to just use one
light<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.619> all<00:00:16.740> three<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.010> these<00:00:17.100> portraits

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
light for all three of these portraits

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.590 
light for all three of these portraits
and<00:00:17.670> we're<00:00:17.760> going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.940> make<00:00:18.060> completely

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
and we're going to make completely

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.269 
and we're going to make completely
different<00:00:18.900> images<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.830> first<00:00:19.949> one<00:00:20.160> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
different images so this first one is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.650 
different images so this first one is
set<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.640> really<00:00:20.850> traditional<00:00:21.029> way<00:00:21.449> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
set up in a really traditional way I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.179 
set up in a really traditional way I
have<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> softbox<00:00:22.380> more<00:00:22.680> or<00:00:22.769> less<00:00:22.890> at<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.160> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
have the softbox more or less at like a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.550 
have the softbox more or less at like a
45<00:00:23.400> degree<00:00:23.760> angle<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.630> little<00:00:24.900> bit<00:00:25.080> more<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
45 degree angle but a little bit more to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.380 
45 degree angle but a little bit more to
the<00:00:25.650> front<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> subject<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.789> also<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the front of the subject I also have a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.450 
the front of the subject I also have a
relatively<00:00:27.900> close<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.380> wall<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.220> what<00:00:29.369> I'm

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
relatively close to the wall so what I'm

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.880 
relatively close to the wall so what I'm
getting<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.939> an<00:00:30.689> exposure<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.140> about<00:00:31.410> five<00:00:31.619> six

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
getting is an exposure of about five six

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.410 
getting is an exposure of about five six
on<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> model<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.579> at<00:00:32.820> two<00:00:33.059> eight<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> half

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
on the model and at two eight and a half

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360 
on the model and at two eight and a half
on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> background<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.230> my<00:00:34.469> white<00:00:34.890> background

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
on the background so my white background

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.160 
on the background so my white background
is<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.610> into<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> nice<00:00:36.059> gray<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.899> gives<00:00:37.020> me

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
is going into a nice gray so it gives me

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:50.880 
is going into a nice gray so it gives me
a<00:00:37.200> nice<00:00:37.410> standard<00:00:38.309> portrait<00:00:39.000> look

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.070 

okay<00:00:51.640> so<00:00:51.700> for<00:00:52.000> this<00:00:52.090> next<00:00:52.150> setup<00:00:52.570> I've<00:00:52.810> taken

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
okay so for this next setup I've taken

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.510 
okay so for this next setup I've taken
the<00:00:53.350> same<00:00:53.470> softbox<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.250> I've<00:00:54.340> put<00:00:54.490> a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
the same softbox and I've put a

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.400 
the same softbox and I've put a
40-degree<00:00:54.910> grid<00:00:55.240> on<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.390> front<00:00:55.630> of<00:00:55.720> it<00:00:55.810> this

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
40-degree grid on the front of it this

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.110 
40-degree grid on the front of it this
narrows<00:00:56.800> my<00:00:56.950> spread<00:00:57.220> really<00:00:57.460> dramatically<00:00:57.880> I

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
narrows my spread really dramatically I

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.610 
narrows my spread really dramatically I
also<00:00:58.360> move<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.750> model<00:00:58.990> further<00:00:59.260> from<00:00:59.500> the

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
also move the model further from the

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.410 
also move the model further from the
wall<00:00:59.770> this<00:01:00.310> is<00:01:00.370> gonna<00:01:00.550> stop<00:01:00.850> any<00:01:01.000> of<00:01:01.120> my<00:01:01.240> life

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
wall this is gonna stop any of my life

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.000 
wall this is gonna stop any of my life
from<00:01:01.570> hidden<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.990> white<00:01:02.320> wall<00:01:02.560> and<00:01:02.590> bringing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
from hidden the white wall and bringing

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.140 
from hidden the white wall and bringing
it<00:01:03.070> up<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.310> want<00:01:03.520> a<00:01:03.550> really<00:01:03.730> really<00:01:04.000> dark

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
first shot and I switched around to

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.920 
first shot and I switched around to
black<00:01:09.430> side<00:01:09.670> this<00:01:09.880> is<00:01:09.970> gonna<00:01:10.090> stop<00:01:10.390> any<00:01:10.630> bounce

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
black side this is gonna stop any bounce

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.930 
black side this is gonna stop any bounce
because<00:01:11.530> I've<00:01:11.710> got<00:01:11.830> a<00:01:11.860> big<00:01:12.130> white<00:01:12.280> studio<00:01:12.610> all

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
my lights gonna bounce around I want to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.170 
my lights gonna bounce around I want to
reduce<00:01:14.620> that<00:01:14.680> this<00:01:15.430> is<00:01:15.490> gonna<00:01:15.580> be<00:01:15.729> giving<00:01:16.090> me<00:01:16.150> a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
reduce that this is gonna be giving me a

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.730 
reduce that this is gonna be giving me a
lot<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.390> light<00:01:16.600> from<00:01:16.750> one<00:01:16.960> direction<00:01:17.110> giving

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
lot of light from one direction giving

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.469 
lot of light from one direction giving
me<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.830> nice<00:01:17.979> low<00:01:18.220> key<00:01:18.400> image<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.880> then<00:01:19.300> the

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
me a nice low key image and then the

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.000 
me a nice low key image and then the
model<00:01:19.690> can<00:01:19.810> really<00:01:19.990> play<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.290> up<00:01:20.380> which<00:01:20.890> she

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
model can really play it up which she

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.520 
model can really play it up which she
can<00:01:21.160> be<00:01:21.280> smiley<00:01:21.760> she<00:01:22.270> can<00:01:22.420> be<00:01:22.570> dark<00:01:22.869> it<00:01:23.320> really

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
can be smiley she can be dark it really

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.380 
can be smiley she can be dark it really
gives<00:01:23.650> a<00:01:23.710> lot<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:23.920> options<00:01:24.250> here<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:25.119> remember

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
gives a lot of options here so remember

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.670 
gives a lot of options here so remember
when<00:01:25.540> I'm<00:01:25.630> lighting<00:01:25.960> like<00:01:26.140> this<00:01:26.320> even<00:01:26.619> though

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
when I'm lighting like this even though

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.230 
when I'm lighting like this even though
I'm<00:01:26.770> in<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:26.890> big<00:01:27.070> bright<00:01:27.280> space<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.820> I<00:01:27.880> can<00:01:28.030> see

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
I'm in a big bright space and I can see

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.999 
I'm in a big bright space and I can see
all<00:01:28.509> around<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.350> lights<00:01:29.530> only<00:01:29.650> coming<00:01:29.920> from

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
all around the lights only coming from

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.109 
all around the lights only coming from
the<00:01:30.130> one<00:01:30.220> direction<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:30.700> just<00:01:30.790> have<00:01:30.910> to<00:01:31.000> make

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
the one direction so I just have to make

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.090 
the one direction so I just have to make
sure<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.360> I'm<00:01:31.509> posing<00:01:32.290> my<00:01:32.500> model<00:01:32.830> in<00:01:32.920> such<00:01:33.070> a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
sure that I'm posing my model in such a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.410 
sure that I'm posing my model in such a
way<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.280> her<00:01:33.490> face<00:01:33.670> doesn't<00:01:33.970> get<00:01:34.030> into<00:01:34.330> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
way that her face doesn't get into the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:50.789 
way that her face doesn't get into the
shadow<00:01:34.630> only<00:01:35.110> as<00:01:35.200> much<00:01:35.320> as<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.530> wanted<00:01:35.800> to

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.889 

okay<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:51.759> for<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.060> third<00:01:52.210> setup<00:01:52.600> what<00:01:52.780> I've

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
okay so for the third setup what I've

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.389 
okay so for the third setup what I've
done<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.289> I've<00:01:53.409> created<00:01:53.439> kind<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.100> hard

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
done is I've created kind of a hard

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.639 
done is I've created kind of a hard
source<00:01:54.850> with<00:01:55.179> my<00:01:55.359> softbox<00:01:55.810> by<00:01:55.960> backing<00:01:56.289> it<00:01:56.530> up

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
source with my softbox by backing it up

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.410 
source with my softbox by backing it up
backing<00:01:57.429> up<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.640> light<00:01:57.789> makes<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.179> smaller

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
backing up the light makes it smaller

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.429 
backing up the light makes it smaller
which<00:01:58.689> makes<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:58.990> harder

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
which makes it harder

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.499 
which makes it harder
I've<00:01:59.649> also<00:01:59.890> removed<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.490> grid<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.329> outer

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
I've also removed the grid and the outer

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.359 
I've also removed the grid and the outer
diffusion<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.619> I'm<00:02:02.679> creating<00:02:03.039> a<00:02:03.159> look<00:02:03.340> that

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
diffusion so I'm creating a look that

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.130 
diffusion so I'm creating a look that
you<00:02:03.579> might<00:02:03.759> get<00:02:03.909> with<00:02:04.060> like<00:02:04.240> Sun<00:02:04.539> coming<00:02:04.990> down

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
you might get with like Sun coming down

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.050 
you might get with like Sun coming down
or<00:02:05.350> at<00:02:05.439> least<00:02:05.469> has<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.799> illusion<00:02:06.219> of<00:02:06.280> some<00:02:06.520> Sun

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
or at least has the illusion of some Sun

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.490 
or at least has the illusion of some Sun
would<00:02:07.179> be<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.270> little<00:02:07.479> bit<00:02:07.569> harsher<00:02:08.229> than<00:02:08.349> this

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
would be a little bit harsher than this

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.859 
would be a little bit harsher than this
this<00:02:09.069> gives<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.429> kind<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.759> modern<00:02:10.149> kind<00:02:10.810> of

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
this gives that kind of modern kind of

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.110 
this gives that kind of modern kind of
casual<00:02:11.319> fashion<00:02:11.739> look<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.459> really<00:02:12.760> really

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
casual fashion look it's really really

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:24.309 
casual fashion look it's really really
fun<00:02:13.269> for<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.540> kind<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.780> stuff

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.380 

so<00:02:24.890> softbox<00:02:25.400> can<00:02:25.579> be<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> really<00:02:26.030> versatile

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
so softbox can be a really versatile

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.240 
so softbox can be a really versatile
light<00:02:26.569> source<00:02:26.870> you've<00:02:27.379> got<00:02:27.560> different<00:02:27.709> levels

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
light source you've got different levels

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.949 
light source you've got different levels
of<00:02:28.459> diffusion<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.269> you've<00:02:29.480> got<00:02:29.689> grids

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
of diffusion for it you've got grids

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.479 
of diffusion for it you've got grids
available<00:02:30.469> and<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.920> course<00:02:31.129> where<00:02:31.370> you're

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
available and of course where you're

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.069 
available and of course where you're
positioned<00:02:31.849> on<00:02:31.969> your<00:02:32.090> subject<00:02:32.450> makes<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.900> huge

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
positioned on your subject makes a huge
