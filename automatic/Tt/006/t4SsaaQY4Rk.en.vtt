00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.450 

basically<00:00:41.589> just<00:00:42.719> do<00:00:43.719> a<00:00:43.750> normal<00:00:43.960> cut<00:00:44.379> like<00:00:45.280> you

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
basically just do a normal cut like you

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.319 
basically just do a normal cut like you
would<00:00:45.609> any<00:00:45.760> other<00:00:45.850> plant<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:47.940> then<00:00:48.940> what<00:00:49.149> I<00:00:49.180> do

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
would any other plant and then what I do

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.029 
would any other plant and then what I do
and<00:00:49.690> what<00:00:49.870> I've<00:00:50.109> been<00:00:50.289> told<00:00:50.530> you're<00:00:50.800> supposed

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
and what I've been told you're supposed

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.509 
and what I've been told you're supposed
to<00:00:51.129> do<00:00:51.309> is<00:00:51.510> put<00:00:52.510> them<00:00:52.629> in<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:52.750> cool<00:00:52.960> dark<00:00:53.170> place

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
to do is put them in a cool dark place

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.399 
to do is put them in a cool dark place
maybe<00:00:54.519> your<00:00:54.729> garage<00:00:55.030> if<00:00:55.899> you<00:00:56.050> don't<00:00:56.229> live<00:00:56.379> in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
maybe your garage if you don't live in

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.939 
maybe your garage if you don't live in
yourself<00:00:56.979> but<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:57.969> do<00:00:58.119> what<00:00:58.269> you<00:00:58.390> can<00:00:58.420> right

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
yourself but you do what you can right

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.200 
yourself but you do what you can right
and<00:00:59.949> then<00:01:00.159> here's<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:00.399> third<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.820> little<00:01:01.059> one

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
and then here's the third a little one

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.240 
and then here's the third a little one
so<00:01:01.780> just<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.170> show<00:01:02.379> you<00:01:02.440> that<00:01:02.589> you<00:01:02.949> know<00:01:03.039> any

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
so just to show you that you know any

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.399 
so just to show you that you know any
size<00:01:03.549> though<00:01:04.000> they'll<00:01:04.330> pretty<00:01:04.570> much<00:01:04.809> all<00:01:05.049> root

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
size though they'll pretty much all root

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.880 
size though they'll pretty much all root
out<00:01:05.610> typically<00:01:07.259> will<00:01:08.259> you<00:01:08.350> let<00:01:08.500> it<00:01:08.619> callus

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
out typically will you let it callus

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.679 
out typically will you let it callus
over<00:01:09.189> though<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.520> let<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.820> cut<00:01:10.030> right<00:01:10.420> here

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
over though you let the cut right here

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.570 
over though you let the cut right here
where<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.229> pruned<00:01:11.649> it<00:01:11.799> you<00:01:11.890> let<00:01:12.039> that<00:01:12.189> callous

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
where you pruned it you let that callous

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.090 
where you pruned it you let that callous
over<00:01:12.700> harden<00:01:13.149> up<00:01:13.300> and<00:01:13.539> I<00:01:14.259> guess<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:14.500> helps<00:01:14.830> it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
over harden up and I guess that helps it

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.249 
over harden up and I guess that helps it
from<00:01:15.310> not<00:01:15.490> getting<00:01:16.479> infected<00:01:16.600> with<00:01:17.080> some<00:01:17.229> kind

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
from not getting infected with some kind

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.930 
from not getting infected with some kind
of<00:01:17.470> bacteria<00:01:18.039> you<00:01:18.220> know<00:01:18.310> any<00:01:18.460> stick<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:18.850> the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
of bacteria you know any stick in the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.080 
of bacteria you know any stick in the
soil<00:01:19.240> now<00:01:20.080> that<00:01:20.289> that<00:01:20.470> is<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.799> calloused<00:01:21.789> over

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
soil now that that is a calloused over

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.630 
soil now that that is a calloused over
we<00:01:22.330> can<00:01:22.539> simply<00:01:23.200> stick<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.130> right<00:01:24.159> in<00:01:24.429> some

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
we can simply stick it right in some

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.940 
we can simply stick it right in some
soil<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.299> I<00:01:25.899> don't<00:01:26.110> I<00:01:26.319> don't<00:01:26.380> have<00:01:26.560> any<00:01:26.770> kind

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
soil and I don't I don't have any kind

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.830 
soil and I don't I don't have any kind
of<00:01:27.069> succulent<00:01:27.580> mix<00:01:27.789> cactus<00:01:28.390> mix<00:01:28.630> or<00:01:28.720> anything

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
of succulent mix cactus mix or anything

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.529 
of succulent mix cactus mix or anything
like<00:01:28.990> that<00:01:29.700> where<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:30.729> took<00:01:31.000> these<00:01:31.149> cuttings

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
like that where I took these cuttings

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.449 
like that where I took these cuttings
from<00:01:31.780> they've<00:01:32.409> been<00:01:32.560> going<00:01:32.799> for<00:01:33.159> a<00:01:33.190> number<00:01:33.310> of

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:33.459 
from they've been going for a number of

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.080 
from they've been going for a number of
years<00:01:33.819> very<00:01:34.740> healthy<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:35.950> just<00:01:36.369> in<00:01:36.520> standard

potting<00:01:37.810> soil<00:01:38.259> so<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:39.459> got<00:01:39.880> an<00:01:40.000> old<00:01:40.179> tomato<00:01:40.509> cage

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
potting soil so I got an old tomato cage

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.609 
potting soil so I got an old tomato cage
and<00:01:42.009> I'm<00:01:42.310> just<00:01:42.490> going<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.759> simply<00:01:43.469> drop<00:01:44.469> it

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
and I'm just going to simply drop it

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.849 
and I'm just going to simply drop it
right<00:01:44.799> in<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:46.299> while<00:01:46.990> I'm<00:01:47.049> doing<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.560> can

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
right in and while I'm doing that I can

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.310 
right in and while I'm doing that I can
tell<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.549> that<00:01:49.090> these<00:01:49.600> aren't<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.140> most

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
tell you that these aren't the most

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.639 
tell you that these aren't the most
friendly<00:01:50.920> if<00:01:51.130> plants<00:01:51.609> they<00:01:52.270> have<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> white<00:01:53.170> SAP

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
friendly if plants they have a white SAP

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.219 
friendly if plants they have a white SAP
that<00:01:54.039> you<00:01:54.909> have<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.180> be<00:01:55.329> really<00:01:55.659> careful<00:01:55.869> of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
that you have to be really careful of

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.620 
that you have to be really careful of
when<00:01:56.409> you're<00:01:56.530> pruning<00:01:56.829> them<00:01:57.359> it'll<00:01:58.359> burn

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
when you're pruning them it'll burn

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.520 
when you're pruning them it'll burn
it'll<00:01:59.439> sting<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:01.030> stays<00:02:01.329> on<00:02:01.600> for<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.259> long

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
it'll sting and it stays on for a long

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.730 
it'll sting and it stays on for a long
time<00:02:02.829> on<00:02:03.100> your<00:02:03.250> skin<00:02:03.549> really<00:02:03.729> hard<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.060> get<00:02:04.179> off

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
time on your skin really hard to get off

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.950 
time on your skin really hard to get off
so<00:02:05.740> I'm<00:02:05.859> just<00:02:06.009> going<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.219> kind<00:02:06.429> of<00:02:06.570> take<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.630> few

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
so I'm just going to kind of take a few

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.240 
so I'm just going to kind of take a few
of<00:02:08.019> these<00:02:08.170> little<00:02:08.440> arms<00:02:08.859> out<00:02:09.070> of<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:10.119> cage<00:02:10.509> so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
of these little arms out of the cage so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.670 
of these little arms out of the cage so
it<00:02:12.250> has<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> little<00:02:12.609> better<00:02:12.989> grip<00:02:13.989> on<00:02:14.320> this

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
it has a little better grip on this

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.210 
it has a little better grip on this
thing

and I'm not sure if I mentioned it but

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.480 
and I'm not sure if I mentioned it but
when<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.910> leave<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.450> dark<00:02:22.020> place<00:02:22.490> to

when you leave it in a dark place to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.760 
when you leave it in a dark place to
Kalos<00:02:23.820> /<00:02:24.150> usually<00:02:24.570> takes<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.380> know<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> week

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
or so two weeks maybe but you could

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.100 
or so two weeks maybe but you could
leave<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:28.920> there<00:02:29.040> longer<00:02:29.780> these<00:02:30.780> things

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
leave it in there longer these things

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
are really Hardy so as as you saw I just

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.280 
are really Hardy so as as you saw I just
put<00:02:34.980> some<00:02:35.130> pressure<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:36.140> sunk<00:02:37.140> it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
put some pressure here and just sunk it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.220 
put some pressure here and just sunk it
right<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> dirt<00:02:39.950> now<00:02:40.950> let's<00:02:41.220> take<00:02:41.430> a

right in to the dirt now let's take a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.430 
right in to the dirt now let's take a
second<00:02:43.230> biggest<00:02:43.650> one<00:02:43.830> here<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.720> do<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> same

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
barrel waters I have and that's it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.629 
barrel waters I have and that's it
well<00:04:07.810> we're<00:04:08.019> hitting<00:04:08.319> really<00:04:08.639> high

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
well we're hitting really high

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.589 
well we're hitting really high
temperatures<00:04:10.269> right<00:04:10.569> now<00:04:10.599> 100<00:04:11.439> and<00:04:11.849> 510<00:04:12.849> so

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
temperatures right now 100 and 510 so

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.589 
temperatures right now 100 and 510 so
I'm<00:04:13.989> probably<00:04:14.139> going<00:04:14.379> to<00:04:14.439> water<00:04:14.590> these<00:04:14.829> guys

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
I'm probably going to water these guys

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.029 
I'm probably going to water these guys
probably<00:04:16.599> every<00:04:16.840> day<00:04:17.019> this<00:04:17.349> is<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.590> east<00:04:17.829> side

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
probably every day this is the east side

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.159 
probably every day this is the east side
but<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.370> is<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.489> black<00:04:18.669> pot<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.389> they<00:04:19.690> are<00:04:19.840> new

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
but it is a black pot and they are new

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.550 
but it is a black pot and they are new
and<00:04:21.570> they're<00:04:22.570> going<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.780> dry<00:04:22.930> out<00:04:22.960> quick<00:04:23.320> so

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
and they're going to dry out quick so

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.260 
and they're going to dry out quick so
we'll<00:04:24.039> see<00:04:24.220> how<00:04:24.340> they<00:04:24.490> go<00:04:24.520> we'll<00:04:24.940> check<00:04:25.150> the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
we'll see how they go we'll check the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.999 
we'll see how they go we'll check the
progress<00:04:25.479> and<00:04:26.380> they're<00:04:26.530> pretty<00:04:26.710> fairly

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
progress and they're pretty fairly

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.089 
progress and they're pretty fairly
they're<00:04:27.370> fairly<00:04:27.580> big<00:04:27.820> cuttings<00:04:28.150> too<00:04:28.419> so

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
they're fairly big cuttings too so

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.659 
they're fairly big cuttings too so
