00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello youtube friends today is a new 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.160
 video for the channel and I'm going to show you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.550
 How to make seat belts 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.330
 well we started the materials are 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.330
 a pencil 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.869
 a rule 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.900
 scissors 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.100
 but although they are going to be very hard if 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.520
 it's not going to be very hard with scissors 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.120
 but good any of the things 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.400
 things work we know it as a 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.870
 pencil 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.760
 a rule and we will make two straight lines 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.450
 short or long are not interesting but that 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.450
 lengthen better 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.460
 we will make two lines and if you want 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 they can do it longer 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.450
 simulating it if you're good here 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:14.840
 we will make a wave or a square what 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:19.090
 you want but how nice 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.090
 well then if you have it 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.939
 so like that 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.090
 for example but right now 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.090
 then we will do 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.020
 a cure like this 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.560
 best 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.050
 the heart 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 as there 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.250
 desiccation before returning excited 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.250
 two lines that's the simplest thing 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.149
 it's something like this 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.820
 so was 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.570
 and then cut them off the edge 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.570
 with scissors 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.900
 good and we would cut it well 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.079
 well so today so good and then you 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.250
 we'll make a little square around so 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:28.489
 without that without going to trim to the edge 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.840
 so with and then we will remove the 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.920
 scalpel 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.940
 we will talk 15 so that you have the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.840
 mobility d 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.840
 but how were 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.420
 well so that you have mobility 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.530
 to put the in 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.610
 and it will be like that 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.000
 well that was all friends 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.590
 as you will see it was very simple right and it is 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.400
 common 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:06.129
 so I hope I like it and its young 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.129
 on my channel thanks
