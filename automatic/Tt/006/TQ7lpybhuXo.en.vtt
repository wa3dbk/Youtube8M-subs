00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
out of the air so what's neat is that as

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.520 
out of the air so what's neat is that as
you<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.520> more<00:00:38.790> scoops<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.320> know<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you get more scoops like you know it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.400 
you get more scoops like you know it
kind<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.770> creates<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.190> combo<00:00:41.780> because<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.170> more

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
kind of creates a combo because the more

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.950 
kind of creates a combo because the more
the<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.100> scoops<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.879> land<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.480> faster

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the more scoops that you land the faster

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.830 
the more scoops that you land the faster
it<00:00:46.079> starts<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:48.320> now<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.710> never<00:00:50.010> like

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
it starts to go now I have never like

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
it starts to go now I have never like
beat<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.110> game<00:00:52.590> or<00:00:52.949> whatnot<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.300> have

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
beat the game or whatnot but I have

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.279 
beat the game or whatnot but I have
gotten<00:00:54.960> pretty<00:00:55.469> high<00:00:55.710> combos<00:00:56.840> which<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.020> fun

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
gotten pretty high combos which is fun

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.560 
gotten pretty high combos which is fun
because<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.160> starts<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.910> fast<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
because it just starts going so fast and

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.680 
because it just starts going so fast and
then<00:01:01.140> obviously<00:01:01.559> when<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.460> get<00:01:02.760> an<00:01:02.940> onion<00:01:03.359> or

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
then obviously when you get an onion or

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.330 
then obviously when you get an onion or
one<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> other<00:01:04.670> items<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:07.340> ice

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
one of the other items that is not a ice

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.359 
one of the other items that is not a ice
cream<00:01:08.729> scoop<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.299> top<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:10.100> cone<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
cream scoop on top of your cone it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.600 
cream scoop on top of your cone it
resets<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.590> your<00:01:13.590> number<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
resets your your number up there on the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.460 
resets your your number up there on the
top<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.689> starts<00:01:16.080> getting<00:01:16.350> difficult

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
top and it just starts getting difficult

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
top and it just starts getting difficult
I<00:01:17.040> mean<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.759> gets<00:01:18.000> higher<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> higher<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I mean as it gets higher and higher it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.280 
I mean as it gets higher and higher it
gets<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.619> difficult<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.930> it<00:01:21.930> just

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
gets more and more difficult and it just

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.820
