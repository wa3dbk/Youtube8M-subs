is doing it in a blender so what we're
going<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:29.670> we're<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.970> make<00:00:30.090> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
going to do we're going to make a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.240 
going to do we're going to make a
combination<00:00:31.050> Sonne<00:00:31.529> takes<00:00:31.740> four<00:00:31.980> ingredients

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
combination Sonne takes four ingredients

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.490 
combination Sonne takes four ingredients
we're<00:00:32.820> gonna<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.120> half<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.660> pair<00:00:33.899> half<00:00:34.350> an

so great for gums and teeth and also for
the<00:01:09.450> logic<00:01:09.750> Joseph<00:01:10.080> system<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:10.740> we'll

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the logic Joseph system as well so we'll

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
the logic Joseph system as well so we'll
have<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.250> carrot<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.360> some<00:01:12.540> bananas<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
have a carrot and then some bananas so

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
have a carrot and then some bananas so
the<00:01:13.110> bananas<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> bit<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> thickening

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the bananas like a bit of a thickening

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
the bananas like a bit of a thickening
agent<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.960> also<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> sweetener<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.830> it's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
agent and also to sweetener so it's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.320 
agent and also to sweetener so it's
going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> taste<00:01:17.310> nice<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.610> also<00:01:17.909> bring<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
going to taste nice and also bring it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.520 
going to taste nice and also bring it

together yeah get your lid now I'm the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
together yeah get your lid now I'm the
Vitamix<00:01:25.950> you've<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.250> variable<00:01:26.759> speeds<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
Vitamix you've got variable speeds you

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.120 
Vitamix you've got variable speeds you
can<00:01:27.330> control<00:01:28.110> how<00:01:28.259> fast<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.680> machine<00:01:28.979> is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
can control how fast the machine is

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:45.290 
can control how fast the machine is
we're<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> choose<00:01:29.820> number<00:01:29.939> seven
