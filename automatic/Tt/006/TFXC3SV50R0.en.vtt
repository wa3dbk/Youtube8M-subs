00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.260 

you<00:00:00.810> have<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:00.989> graduated<00:00:01.680> cylinder<00:00:02.060> which<00:00:03.060> is

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
you have a graduated cylinder which is

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.170 
you have a graduated cylinder which is
filled<00:00:03.629> with<00:00:03.810> water<00:00:03.990> up<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.180> 150

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
filled with water up to the 150

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.450 
filled with water up to the 150
milliliter<00:00:06.629> mark<00:00:06.720> so<00:00:07.710> there<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.309> right

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
milliliter mark so there it is right

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.000 
milliliter mark so there it is right
there<00:00:08.519> then<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.570> add<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> hunk<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.380> iron<00:00:10.710> and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
there then you add a hunk of iron and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.079 
there then you add a hunk of iron and
the<00:00:11.519> water<00:00:11.849> level<00:00:12.389> rises<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.370> 425<00:00:14.370> milliliters

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
the water level rises to 425 milliliters

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.140 
the water level rises to 425 milliliters
and<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:16.230> question<00:00:16.619> asks<00:00:17.039> what<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.640> mass

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and the question asks what is the mass

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.590 
and the question asks what is the mass
of<00:00:18.199> the<00:00:19.199> iron<00:00:19.350> okay<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.300> know<00:00:21.420> we're

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
of the iron okay so we know we're

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.390 
of the iron okay so we know we're
dealing<00:00:22.050> with<00:00:22.289> density<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.220> these<00:00:23.340> are

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
dealing with density here so these are

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.040 
dealing with density here so these are
the<00:00:23.550> three<00:00:23.910> variables<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.750> we're<00:00:24.840> playing

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the three variables that we're playing

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.370 
the three variables that we're playing
with<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.760> question<00:00:26.760> asks<00:00:27.420> us<00:00:27.570> what<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> mass

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
with the question asks us what the mass

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.720 
with the question asks us what the mass
of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> iron<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.340> know<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.490> it's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
of the iron is so we know that it's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.389 
of the iron is so we know that it's
going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.000> mass<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.630> we're<00:00:30.779> solving<00:00:31.050> for

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
going to be mass that we're solving for

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.470 
going to be mass that we're solving for
let's<00:00:32.399> talk<00:00:32.579> about<00:00:32.700> how<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.149> these<00:00:33.270> other

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
let's talk about how to get these other

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.990 
let's talk about how to get these other
two<00:00:33.899> variables<00:00:34.940> okay<00:00:35.940> we're<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.870> given<00:00:37.649> a

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
two variables okay we're not given a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.740 
two variables okay we're not given a
volume<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.960> piece<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.559> iron<00:00:40.710> all<00:00:41.309> right

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
volume for this piece of iron all right

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.010 
volume for this piece of iron all right
instead<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.680> talk<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.850> happens<00:00:45.390> with

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
instead we talk about what happens with

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.350 
instead we talk about what happens with
water<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.340> add<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.879> iron<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
water when we add the iron to a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.209 
water when we add the iron to a
graduated<00:00:48.960> cylinder<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.890> might<00:00:50.070> remember

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
graduated cylinder you might remember

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
graduated cylinder you might remember
that<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> ways<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:52.199> can

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that this is one of the ways that we can

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740 
that this is one of the ways that we can
determine<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.550> volume<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.090> something<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:54.480> put

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
determine the volume of something by put

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.049 
determine the volume of something by put
it<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.020> putting<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:55.860> water<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.340> seeing

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it in putting it into water and seeing

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.660 
it in putting it into water and seeing
how<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> water<00:00:57.840> rises<00:00:58.410> okay<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
how much the water rises okay we have to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
how much the water rises okay we have to
do<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> little<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> math<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:01.199> how

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
do a little bit of math but that's how

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.020 
do a little bit of math but that's how
we're<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> figure<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> volume<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
we're going to figure out the volume of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.509 
we're going to figure out the volume of
the<00:01:03.539> piece<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.870> iron<00:01:04.049> by<00:01:04.619> looking<00:01:05.010> at<00:01:05.100> how<00:01:05.280> much

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the piece of iron by looking at how much

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.920 
the piece of iron by looking at how much
the<00:01:05.760> water<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.360> graduated<00:01:06.900> cylinder

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the water and the graduated cylinder

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.230 
the water and the graduated cylinder
moved<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.159> that's<00:01:08.729> how<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
moved so that's how we're going to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.690 
moved so that's how we're going to
figure<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> volume<00:01:10.250> now<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.430> order<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
figure out the volume now in order to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.730 
figure out the volume now in order to
get<00:01:11.880> mass<00:01:12.060> we're<00:01:12.479> also<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> need<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.590> get

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
get mass we're also going to need to get

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.580 
get mass we're also going to need to get
density<00:01:14.600> this<00:01:15.600> tells<00:01:15.960> us<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.259> we're<00:01:16.409> dealing

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
density this tells us that we're dealing

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.649 
density this tells us that we're dealing
with<00:01:16.770> iron<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> problem<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.390> doesn't

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
with iron in the problem but it doesn't

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.570 
with iron in the problem but it doesn't
tell<00:01:18.840> us<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.140> density<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.920> iron<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.520> do

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
tell us the density of iron so what do

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030 
tell us the density of iron so what do
you<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.780> well<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.869> turns<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.860> it's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
you do well it turns out that it's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.999 
you do well it turns out that it's
really<00:01:23.520> easy<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.210> find<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.170> densities<00:01:25.740> for

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
really easy to find the densities for

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.620 
really easy to find the densities for
common<00:01:26.340> materials<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.150> get<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.390> off<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
common materials you can get it off the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
common materials you can get it off the
internet<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.829> them<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.070> books<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
internet you can get them in books and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
internet you can get them in books and
stuff<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.210> even<00:01:30.570> though<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.810> question

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
stuff so even though the question

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.649 
stuff so even though the question
doesn't<00:01:31.500> give<00:01:31.920> us<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.159> density<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:32.970> easily

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
doesn't give us a density we can easily

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.480 
doesn't give us a density we can easily
figure<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.920> that's<00:01:35.070> how<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:35.400> going

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
figure it out so that's how we're going

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.310 
figure it out so that's how we're going
to<00:01:35.549> get<00:01:35.640> these<00:01:35.820> two<00:01:36.060> variables<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.780> then

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
to get these two variables and then

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.450 
to get these two variables and then
we're<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.740> able<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.009> figure<00:01:38.220> out

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
we're going to be able to figure out

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.120 
we're going to be able to figure out
what<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> masses<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> first<00:01:40.829> thing<00:01:41.040> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
what the masses so the first thing I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.100 
what the masses so the first thing I
want<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> figure<00:01:42.780> out<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
want to do is I want to figure out the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.219 
want to do is I want to figure out the
volume<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.399> piece<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.610> iron<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.079> can

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
volume of the piece of iron and we can

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
volume of the piece of iron and we can
do<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.590> by<00:01:47.159> looking<00:01:47.399> at<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> water<00:01:48.000> levels

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
do that by looking at the water levels

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
do that by looking at the water levels
so<00:01:49.140> we're<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> take<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> final<00:01:50.220> water

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
so we're going to take the final water

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.179 
so we're going to take the final water
level<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.140> subtract<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.439> initial<00:01:52.799> water

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
level and subtract the initial water

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.560 
level and subtract the initial water
level<00:01:53.610> from<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.030> that's<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> tell

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
level from it and that's going to tell

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.740 
level from it and that's going to tell
us<00:01:54.630> how<00:01:54.990> much<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.530> went<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.479> going

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
us how much it went up and that is going

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.590 
us how much it went up and that is going
to<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:57.960> equal<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.040> volume<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.420> iron

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
to be equal to the volume of the iron

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.410 
to be equal to the volume of the iron
that<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.960> put<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.259> there<00:02:01.469> okay<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.270> volume<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that we put in there okay so volume of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.429 
that we put in there okay so volume of
the<00:02:03.540> iron<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.670> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.810> final

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the iron is going to be the final

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.300 
the iron is going to be the final
reading<00:02:07.619> which<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.300> 425<00:02:09.590> milliliters<00:02:10.590> minus

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
reading which is 425 milliliters minus

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.370 
reading which is 425 milliliters minus
the<00:02:11.459> initial<00:02:11.640> which<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.660> 100

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the initial which is 100

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.010 
the initial which is 100
it<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.620> 50<00:02:14.340> milliliters<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.030> how<00:02:15.600> much<00:02:15.840> it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
it and 50 milliliters and how much it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.230 
it and 50 milliliters and how much it
changed<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:18.890> 275<00:02:20.240> milliliters

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
changed is going to be 275 milliliters

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.600 
changed is going to be 275 milliliters
now<00:02:21.660> when<00:02:22.050> we're<00:02:22.170> talking<00:02:22.410> about<00:02:22.890> volume<00:02:23.250> and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
now when we're talking about volume and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.230 
now when we're talking about volume and
density<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:24.780> often<00:02:25.410> use<00:02:25.830> cubic<00:02:26.670> centimeters

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
density we often use cubic centimeters

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.180 
density we often use cubic centimeters
or<00:02:27.480> centimeters<00:02:28.380> cubed<00:02:28.770> instead<00:02:28.950> of

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
or centimeters cubed instead of

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.370 
or centimeters cubed instead of
milliliters<00:02:29.490> these<00:02:30.420> units<00:02:30.870> though<00:02:31.080> are

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
milliliters these units though are

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.490 
milliliters these units though are
exactly<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.430> same<00:02:32.460> quantity<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.840> all<00:02:34.140> I've

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
exactly the same quantity so all I've

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.000 
exactly the same quantity so all I've
got<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.770> do<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.130> rewrite<00:02:35.550> milliliters<00:02:36.510> as

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
got to do is just rewrite milliliters as

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.230 
got to do is just rewrite milliliters as
centimeters<00:02:38.010> cubed<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.550> there<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
centimeters cubed and there is the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.470 
centimeters cubed and there is the
volume<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> iron<00:02:40.740> okay<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.180> now<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.390> have

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
volume for the iron okay so now I have

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.560 
volume for the iron okay so now I have
the<00:02:42.720> volume<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.410> iron<00:02:43.680> 275<00:02:44.610> cubic

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the volume for the iron 275 cubic

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.610 
the volume for the iron 275 cubic
centimeters<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:46.260> I'll<00:02:46.380> need<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
centimeters and now I'll need the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.070 
centimeters and now I'll need the
density<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.160> can<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.270> look<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.630> up<00:02:48.690> online

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
density I can just look this up online

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.900 
density I can just look this up online
really<00:02:49.620> easily<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.310> find<00:02:50.550> out<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.760> it's

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
really easily and I find out that it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.440 
really easily and I find out that it's
seven<00:02:51.330> point<00:02:51.630> eight<00:02:51.860> seven<00:02:52.860> grams<00:02:53.490> per<00:02:54.300> cubic

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
seven point eight seven grams per cubic

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.780 
seven point eight seven grams per cubic
centimeter<00:02:54.710> so<00:02:55.710> now<00:02:56.040> I'm<00:02:56.160> ready<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.430> go<00:02:56.580> I've

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
centimeter so now I'm ready to go I've

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.090 
centimeter so now I'm ready to go I've
got<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.180> two<00:02:57.360> things<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.840> need<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.800> I'll

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
got the two things that I need so I'll

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.450 
got the two things that I need so I'll
start<00:02:59.520> with<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.210> volume<00:03:00.660> which<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:03.050> 275<00:03:04.460> cubic

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
start with the volume which is 275 cubic

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.690 
start with the volume which is 275 cubic
centimeters<00:03:06.110> now<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.380> like<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.190> use<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
centimeters now I like to use the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.810 
centimeters now I like to use the
density<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.320> conversion<00:03:10.950> factor<00:03:11.370> to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
density is like a conversion factor to

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.850 
density is like a conversion factor to
go<00:03:12.360> between<00:03:12.860> volume<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.400> mass<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.170> let's<00:03:16.410> look

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
go between volume and mass so let's look

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.070 
go between volume and mass so let's look
at<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.130> two<00:03:17.370> ways<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.610> we<00:03:18.030> can<00:03:18.210> write<00:03:18.540> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
at the two ways that we can write the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.380 
at the two ways that we can write the
density<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:20.460> density<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.970> iron<00:03:21.120> as<00:03:21.330> a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
density the density of iron as a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.420 
density the density of iron as a
conversion<00:03:22.080> factor<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.470> go<00:03:22.770> from<00:03:23.040> volume<00:03:23.280> to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
conversion factor to go from volume to

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.170 
conversion factor to go from volume to
mass<00:03:23.730> here<00:03:23.970> okay<00:03:25.280> density<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.370> iron<00:03:26.520> is<00:03:26.820> seven

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
mass here okay density of iron is seven

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.040 
mass here okay density of iron is seven
point<00:03:27.450> eight<00:03:27.600> seven<00:03:27.990> grams<00:03:29.540> over<00:03:30.540> cubic

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
point eight seven grams over cubic

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.510 
point eight seven grams over cubic
centimeters<00:03:31.470> which<00:03:31.650> means<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.100> can<00:03:32.220> rewrite

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
centimeters which means we can rewrite

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.320 
centimeters which means we can rewrite
this<00:03:32.700> as<00:03:32.760> over<00:03:33.420> one<00:03:33.980> centimeter<00:03:34.980> cubed<00:03:35.820> okay

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
this as over one centimeter cubed okay

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.220 
this as over one centimeter cubed okay
we<00:03:37.320> can<00:03:37.500> also<00:03:37.880> flip<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.120> fraction<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.960> we<00:03:40.080> do

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
we can also flip this fraction so we do

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.550 
we can also flip this fraction so we do
one<00:03:40.700> centimeter<00:03:41.700> cubed<00:03:42.090> divided<00:03:42.930> by<00:03:42.959> seven

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
one centimeter cubed divided by seven

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.449 
one centimeter cubed divided by seven
point<00:03:43.860> eight<00:03:44.100> seven<00:03:44.790> grams<00:03:46.190> which<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.370> these

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
point eight seven grams which of these

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.199 
point eight seven grams which of these
do<00:03:48.300> we<00:03:48.360> want<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.660> use<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:49.380> one<00:03:49.620> or<00:03:49.740> this<00:03:49.860> one

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
do we want to use this one or this one

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.790 
do we want to use this one or this one
well<00:03:51.209> we're<00:03:51.360> hoping<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.750> cancel<00:03:52.290> out<00:03:52.410> cubic

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
well we're hoping to cancel out cubic

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.580 
well we're hoping to cancel out cubic
centimeters<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.459> be<00:03:54.000> left<00:03:54.209> with<00:03:54.390> grams<00:03:54.590> so

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
centimeters and be left with grams so

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.320

that means since cubic centimeters is on
the<00:03:57.450> top<00:03:57.660> here<00:03:57.959> we're<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.709> want<00:03:58.800> to

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
the top here we're going to want to

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.710 
the top here we're going to want to
choose<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.370> version<00:03:59.790> of<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.360> density

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
choose the version of the density

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.240 
choose the version of the density
conversion<00:04:01.110> factor<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.620> gives<00:04:02.010> us

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
conversion factor that gives us

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.550 
conversion factor that gives us

centimeters cubed on the bottom here it

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.810 
centimeters cubed on the bottom here it
is<00:04:04.680> right<00:04:04.830> here<00:04:04.890> we're<00:04:05.400> going<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.580> use<00:04:05.640> this

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
is right here we're going to use this

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.790 
is right here we're going to use this
one<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.720> now<00:04:06.840> when<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:07.020> multiply<00:04:07.170> through

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
one so now when I multiply through

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.699 
one so now when I multiply through
centimeters<00:04:08.730> cubed<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.330> top<00:04:09.709> centimeters

centimeters cubed on the top centimeters

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.290 
centimeters cubed on the top centimeters
cubed<00:04:11.040> on<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.220> bottom<00:04:11.550> so<00:04:11.670> they<00:04:11.700> cancel<00:04:12.180> out

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
cubed on the bottom so they cancel out

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.800 
cubed on the bottom so they cancel out
and<00:04:12.600> I'm<00:04:12.990> left<00:04:13.200> with<00:04:13.290> grams<00:04:14.300> I'm<00:04:15.300> going<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.750> do

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
and I'm left with grams I'm going to do

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.560 
and I'm left with grams I'm going to do
275<00:04:16.590> times<00:04:17.010> seven<00:04:17.489> point<00:04:17.760> eight<00:04:17.970> seven

275 times seven point eight seven

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.440 
275 times seven point eight seven
divided<00:04:19.320> by<00:04:19.440> one<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.880> answer<00:04:21.270> is<00:04:21.390> going

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
divided by one and the answer is going

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.570 
divided by one and the answer is going
to<00:04:21.570> be<00:04:23.780> 2164<00:04:24.780> point<00:04:25.410> two<00:04:25.590> five<00:04:25.860> what<00:04:26.400> are

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
to be 2164 point two five what are

to be 2164 point two five what are
around<00:04:26.789> this<00:04:26.939> -<00:04:27.150> I've<00:04:27.689> got<00:04:27.870> three<00:04:28.139> sigfigs

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:28.439 
around this - I've got three sigfigs

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.010 
around this - I've got three sigfigs
here<00:04:28.889> three<00:04:29.400> sigfigs<00:04:29.610> here<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.539> one<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.990> a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
here three sigfigs here and the one is a

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.330 
here three sigfigs here and the one is a
counting<00:04:31.470> number<00:04:31.500> as<00:04:31.860> part<00:04:32.129> of<00:04:32.250> the

counting number as part of the
definition<00:04:32.699> here<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.750> we<00:04:33.870> don't<00:04:33.960> worry<00:04:34.199> about

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
definition here so we don't worry about

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.390 
definition here so we don't worry about
it<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:35.009> I'm<00:04:35.340> going<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.789> do<00:04:36.530> mm<00:04:37.530> rounding<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.370> to

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
it so I'm going to do mm rounding it to

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.040 
it so I'm going to do mm rounding it to
three<00:04:38.669> sigfigs<00:04:40.580> 2160<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:42.120> 60<00:04:42.569> stays<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.020> same

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
three sigfigs 2160 the 60 stays the same

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.360 
three sigfigs 2160 the 60 stays the same
because<00:04:43.289> there's<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.620> four<00:04:43.860> here<00:04:44.099> and<00:04:44.250> then<00:04:44.340> I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
because there's a four here and then I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.110 
because there's a four here and then I
replace<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.969> four<00:04:45.240> with<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> zero<00:04:46.819> 2160<00:04:47.819> what

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
replace the four with the zero 2160 what

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.670 
replace the four with the zero 2160 what
are<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.360> units<00:04:48.599> here<00:04:48.870> I<00:04:49.020> cancelled<00:04:49.620> out

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
are the units here I cancelled out

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.320 
are the units here I cancelled out
centimeters<00:04:50.129> cubed<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:51.090> I'm<00:04:51.180> left<00:04:51.360> with<00:04:51.479> grams

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
centimeters cubed so I'm left with grams

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.950 
centimeters cubed so I'm left with grams
2160<00:04:54.330> grams<00:04:54.569> is<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.900> mass<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:56.099> the<00:04:56.610> iron<00:04:56.960> just

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
2160 grams is the mass of the iron just

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.899 
2160 grams is the mass of the iron just
to<00:04:58.080> review<00:04:58.349> this<00:04:58.530> really<00:04:58.800> quickly<00:04:59.039> we<00:04:59.639> needed

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
to review this really quickly we needed

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.760 
to review this really quickly we needed
the<00:04:59.969> density<00:05:00.479> of<00:05:00.509> iron<00:05:00.750> we<00:05:01.169> got<00:05:01.349> that<00:05:01.560> from<00:05:01.680> the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
the density of iron we got that from the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.800 
the density of iron we got that from the
internet<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.370> was<00:05:02.669> easy<00:05:02.879> and<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.509> figure<00:05:03.690> out

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
internet that was easy and to figure out

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.230 
internet that was easy and to figure out
the<00:05:04.080> volume<00:05:04.440> of<00:05:04.800> this<00:05:04.860> piece<00:05:05.159> of<00:05:05.190> iron<00:05:05.490> we<00:05:06.060> had

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
the volume of this piece of iron we had

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.020 
the volume of this piece of iron we had
to<00:05:06.419> look<00:05:06.629> at<00:05:06.870> how<00:05:07.289> much<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.889> water<00:05:08.190> level<00:05:08.759> rose

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
to look at how much the water level rose

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.409 
to look at how much the water level rose
when<00:05:09.870> we<00:05:09.990> added<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.919> iron<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:11.819> graduated

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
when we added the iron to the graduated

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.089 
when we added the iron to the graduated
cylinder<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:12.990> from<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.590> we<00:05:13.740> could<00:05:13.860> figure

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
cylinder and from that we could figure

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.459 
cylinder and from that we could figure
out<00:05:14.219> the<00:05:14.610> volume<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.419> iron<00:05:15.599> then<00:05:16.169> we<00:05:16.319> use

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
out the volume of the iron then we use

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.290 
out the volume of the iron then we use
density<00:05:16.770> as<00:05:17.069> a<00:05:17.099> conversion<00:05:17.490> factor<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.029> go

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
density as a conversion factor to go

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.400 
density as a conversion factor to go
from<00:05:18.509> volume<00:05:19.159> to<00:05:20.159> mass
