with the staggered start Erin the riders
are<00:00:30.689> probably<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.500> confused<00:00:31.949> as<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
are probably just as confused as the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.920 
are probably just as confused as the
fans<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:32.640> only<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:33.149> we've<00:00:33.570> never<00:00:33.780> done

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
fans are only because we've never done

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.560 
fans are only because we've never done
this<00:00:34.200> before<00:00:34.350> either<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.579> rule<00:00:36.059> books<00:00:36.270> clear

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
this before either the rule books clear

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
this before either the rule books clear
and<00:00:36.690> exactly<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.200> we're<00:00:37.290> supposed<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.770> if

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
and exactly what we're supposed to do if

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
and exactly what we're supposed to do if
it's<00:00:38.670> less<00:00:38.940> than<00:00:39.149> three<00:00:39.390> laps<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> red<00:00:40.110> flag

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
it's less than three laps to a red flag

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.959 
it's less than three laps to a red flag
then<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.770> an<00:00:40.860> automatic<00:00:41.160> restart<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
then we do an automatic restart to the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.139 
then we do an automatic restart to the
gate<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> race<00:00:43.649> never<00:00:43.860> started<00:00:44.370> after

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
gate as if the race never started after

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.670 
gate as if the race never started after
three<00:00:45.360> laps<00:00:45.600> which<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.110> case<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.530> had

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
three laps which in this case they had

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.799 
three laps which in this case they had
gone<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.399> five<00:00:47.640> laps<00:00:47.910> before<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.390> threw<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
gone at to five laps before we threw the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.920 
gone at to five laps before we threw the
