the top it'll go in the main this is

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.460 
the top it'll go in the main this is
what<00:02:49.980> screwed<00:02:50.489> up<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.819> little<00:02:51.480> community<00:02:52.019> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
what screwed up on little community the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.440 
what screwed up on little community the
little<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:53.519> gets<00:02:53.700> bent<00:02:53.909> at<00:02:54.120> all<00:02:54.299> during

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
little it gets bent at all during

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.410 
little it gets bent at all during
practice<00:02:54.930> it'll<00:02:55.290> stay<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:56.000> or<00:02:57.000> I'll<00:02:57.120> fall<00:02:57.360> down

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
practice it'll stay up or I'll fall down

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.059 
practice it'll stay up or I'll fall down
a<00:02:57.569> little<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:58.049> will<00:02:58.200> depend<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.620> which<00:02:58.739> how<00:02:59.010> you

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
a little we will depend on which how you

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.440 
a little we will depend on which how you
do<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.430> but<00:03:01.430> for<00:03:02.430> me<00:03:02.579> this<00:03:02.760> won't<00:03:02.909> stay<00:03:03.180> up

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
do it but for me this won't stay up

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.110 
do it but for me this won't stay up
because<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.870> fit<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:05.519> one<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.849> was<00:03:06.000> using

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
because it fit the one that I was using

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
earlier was this one same model pin only

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.270 
earlier was this one same model pin only
this<00:03:11.340> one<00:03:11.519> will<00:03:11.670> go<00:03:11.700> down<00:03:12.799> when<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.890> turn<00:03:14.159> it
