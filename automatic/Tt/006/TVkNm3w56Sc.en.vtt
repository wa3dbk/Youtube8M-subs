that<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.730> basically<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> trick<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> fixing

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that is basically the trick to fixing

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.960 
that is basically the trick to fixing
this<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.530> may<00:01:04.830> not<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.339> obvious<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.939> first

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
this it may not be as obvious at first

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.870 
this it may not be as obvious at first
but<00:01:06.659> that's<00:01:07.020> how<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.409> fix<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.920> issue<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.790> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
but that's how you fix this issue so you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270 
but that's how you fix this issue so you
just<00:01:09.270> highlight<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> clip<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
just highlight the clip that has the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.190 
just highlight the clip that has the
problem<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> go<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> file<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
problem and then you go up to file and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.660 
problem and then you go up to file and
then<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.530> select<00:01:13.710> import<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
then you select import and then you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.090 
then you select import and then you

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.050 
export that because that would just be
this<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.659> in<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:54.930> point<00:01:55.259> there

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
this little in and out point there

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.990 
this little in and out point there
export<00:01:56.450> my<00:01:56.540> entire<00:01:56.840> project<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:57.759> there<00:01:58.759> we<00:01:58.880> go

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
export my entire project so there we go

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.850 
export my entire project so there we go
so<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.600> looks<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.840> little<00:01:59.930> bit<00:02:00.079> better<00:02:00.259> but

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
so that looks a little bit better but

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.010 
so that looks a little bit better but
the<00:02:01.460> point<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.820> we<00:02:02.030> can<00:02:02.180> now<00:02:02.270> export<00:02:02.750> that's

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
the point is we can now export that's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.920 
the point is we can now export that's
really<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:04.009> key<00:02:04.280> when<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.210> comes<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.509> this<00:02:05.630> and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
really the key when it comes to this and

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.169 
really the key when it comes to this and
you<00:02:06.380> know<00:02:06.439> it<00:02:06.590> was<00:02:06.680> kind<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:07.039> frustrating<00:02:07.729> when

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
you know it was kind of frustrating when

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.430 
you know it was kind of frustrating when
I<00:02:08.209> encountered<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.660> error<00:02:08.899> message<00:02:09.259> because

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
I encountered that error message because

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.170 
I encountered that error message because
it<00:02:09.679> didn't<00:02:09.950> really<00:02:10.069> tell<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.429> what<00:02:10.789> was<00:02:10.970> wrong

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
it didn't really tell you what was wrong

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.790 
it didn't really tell you what was wrong
until<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.870> did<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.260> little<00:02:12.440> deeper

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
until I did a little deeper

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.630 
until I did a little deeper
