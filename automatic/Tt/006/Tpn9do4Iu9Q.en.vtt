00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.140

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.280

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:29.240
 will be a little bit later bones first 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.029
 a game that will be noticed by many 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.010
 this is his mind the game is developed by the studio 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.890
 turtle stone well or 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.079

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.230
 they know what the name of the studio is 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.989
 now not obedient dog a little 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.540
 damn well and so on anyway 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.940
 Both the waves and the guys talk calmly 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.610
 they say we have been developing for four years 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.980
 projects and of course we play therefore 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.920
 always find the gap that can 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.160
 fill with new elements assure us 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.350
 that when the game comes out we will see the full 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.749
 picture and the game just does not seem 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.630
 monotonous and the wolf offers you to choose 

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:11.959
 side to join the ranks of the team and take 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.359
 your individual and important position or 

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:17.569
 same climb into the skin of a monster goliath 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.709
 kraken and of course other monsters that 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.399
 can be downloaded 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:21.399
 dlc 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 extended edition of the game 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.930
 on my cake gets over to the console 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.750
 the current generation project was 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.000
 Developed for 4 weeks using 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.250
 tool kit from anrial and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.530
 improved for re-release 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.200
 you as a small helicopter 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.170
 to pass a series of tests 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.299
 to find a way out of the caves the game gives 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.049
 the ability to solve is very primitive and 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.399
 but at the same time funny puzzles 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.190
 the creators also promise a certain plot 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:02.030
 which tells about the main aspects 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.380
 stories well and then you start the hunt for 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.289
 fabulous monsters 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.209
 like to compare the game with dark souls and 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.250
 in that aspect that the game 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.769
 really challenges gamers 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.799
 enemies and stronger than you but you will not 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.110
 fight one and more if you 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.260
 think carefully about the passing strategy 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.620
 improve their armor in the end game 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.200
 will reward you with new opportunities throughout 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.870
 the gameplay cycle repeats everything 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.329
 new tops in the horizon game world 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.640
 which player wants to see and this 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.730
 strictly speaking and drives us to go up 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.070
 the end of the program that supports 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.160
 independent developers to launch on 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.560
 x-box one is preparing a new game of you 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.660
 thrown into a pixel prison and 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.519
 I call the place where you should send everyone 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.739
 who does letsplay on maycraft 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.440
 In this place you will have long and 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.230
 work carefully before would make an escape 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.930
 but the game is much more thoughtful and not 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.910
 may seem at first glance to 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.829
 don't create suspicions you have to 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.170
 act based everyday 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.430
 routine but secretly from this you'll 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.530
 prepare an escape plan 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.000
 many fans of the legendary zealous are waiting 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.280
 reprints of the game 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.459
 which debut was originally held in 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.190
 the beginning of the two thousandth on nintendo 64 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.950
 now the port is for the console 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.440
 3ds and presents updated graphics 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.740
 more detailed textures and 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.910
 natural lighting 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.740
 it's a great way not only 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.080
 to please old fans 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.060
 but also present a classic game for 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.060
 potential new audience 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.209
 new fighting game is preparing for release February 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.300
 the creators claim that this is the final 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.480
 part of the game series is still this 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.520
 the most dead or alive you love but 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.680
 at the same time we will see more new 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.800
 content and much more interesting 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.260
 variations of blows new combinations and so 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.030
 further it is especially visible on 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.730
 done work in the field of design 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.480
 characters and naturally female 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.340
 characters 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.340
 what they don't like to do yubisoft 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.169
 developers of the popular game series 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.479
 strategy genre chose a new era and 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.240
 choosing an important historical figure 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.910
 more or less made it the center 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.610
 events around which blood is shed 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.800
 By the way, precisely because of the fact that 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.950
 measure allows developers to create 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.680
 huge battles miss virhovs guys 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.010
 from the creative assembly and made such a move 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.500
 but the game wo n't start with the attila rise until 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.960
 it will have to give in the course of history you 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.510
 yourself but we are promised that your approach 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.310
 will be much more gloomy than 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.310
 players are used to seeing in games 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.310
 coming mega exclusive isn't it a reason 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.719
 rejoice for playstation 4 owners 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.719
 certainly the first thing that catches your eye 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:15.789
 so this is excellent graphics which 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.139
 along with beautifully detailed 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.810
 the environment 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.159
 create a cinema effect but how about 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.680
 gameplay 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.960
 so far it is difficult to comment on something because 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.090
 gameplay base hatch traditional shooter 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.740
 third person nonetheless 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.199
 alarming the rest 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.110
 these finishing blows that reminds 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.150
 heartless rice lack of variety 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.180
 but the introduction of interaction during 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.340
 cut-scenes look good already soon we 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.930
 declare war as a demon that hid in 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.930
 the darkness of London streets 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.980
 game series based on the well-known 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.979
 resident evil games 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.520
 and the first episode will be released already quite 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.860
 soon 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.690
 Naturally, such a format affects 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.729
 the style of the narrative as a whole 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.340
 even considering the fact that the episodes will be 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.770
 go out pretty often but capcom 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.800

 against bioterrorism 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.800
 and represents the organization trs him after 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.380
 ambush heroine pulled out and she
