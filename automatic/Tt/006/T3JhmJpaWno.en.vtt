00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.790
 hi girls and guys I hope you are 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.910
 super good because today I bring you 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.460
 a smoky eyes look in purple 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.460
 and the truth is a look that has 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.490
 delighted so good I hope that 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.279
 you also like how we are going to 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.380
 put strong colors in the eyes 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.040
 let's do first before doing 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.380
 our base we are going to take an eyeliner 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.810
 in this case in purple also 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.780
 it can be a jumbo or something of that type 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:47.949
 that you have and we are going to put it in our 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.949
 no matter eyelid as it lies 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:54.670
 because we're going to blur it later as 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.710
 come there with a synthetic brush or 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.379
 we can also simply use 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.129
 our fingers equally if they want 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.560
 you can first apply a pre-base for 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.140
 that lasts even longer or if 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.920
 use in heat season as it is 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.560
 right now or something 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.600
 we are going to blur it very very well towards 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.600
 up but not reaching the eyebrows 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.900
 then the same eyeliner we're going to 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.229
 put under our lashes 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.780
 inferiors and equally we are going to 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.040
 blur a bit by helping us with a 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.040
 Synthetic broach or our fingers 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.440
 in this case I decided to do it with color 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.830
 purple because I love and help 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.350
 very much to highlight the brown eyes but 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.040
 you can use absolutely the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.040
 color they want 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.110
 then what we are going to do is put a 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 little more than that eyeliner or pre-base 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 dwelling more tacky to the eyelashes 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.509
 and we 're going to blur it a bit so that 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.170
 we were more concentrated the color close 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.170
 of the eyelashes 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.660
 and finally with the tip of our finger 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.569
 let's melt a bit more the part of 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.390
 up to our prebase that 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.270
 we apply that there are no lines now 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.410
 let's take a purple shadow I'm 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.320
 using the orchid tone of disur and 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.020
 with a brush for shade we're going to 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.530
 put very concentrated on the eyelid 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.959
 mobile and then little by little 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.400
 we are going to go up towards the part of 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.400
 up with the same brush 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.400
 The next thing we're going to do is take 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.190
 a broach to blur can add 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.500
 a little bit of shade too and good with 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.230
 we're going to help blur the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.990
 edges so that we do not have any 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.209
 line very marked in those things and that 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.510
 just see a very degraded 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.700
 nice this is a lot of patience like this 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.150
 Take your time so that they are left 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.150
 best 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.590
 and at the bottom we will do 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.260
 same with a smaller brush myself 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.740
 I'm using one as well as the pencil 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.930
 but very thin and good with that I'm going to 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.500
 apply the color and also to blur 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.500
 a little down and do not leave very 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.860
 down because it's going to look like 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.540
 they were dark circles or something weird 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.650
 then try to make it just as 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.510
 a thick line or so after if 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.760
 They use spoon to tilt their 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.820
 tabs are going to do it right now 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.720
 and if you can not do it after the 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.720
 next step 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.200
 let's take a color eyeliner 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.350
 black that is in pencil format and 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.050
 preference and we're going to put it in the 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.430
 inner part of our eye both 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.430
 lower as superior 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.270
 You can also use a liner 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:28.060
 purple if you prefer but the truth to me 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.060
 I loved how it looks with the black color 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.460
 and now we are going to apply several layers 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.460
 of mascara 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.030
 and they did not use spoon they can use 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.610
 the in china door at this time and 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.610
 then apply the mascara 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:02.220
 they can also apply lashes 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.220
 false if you want something more dramatic 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.090
 and finally we are going to take a shadow 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.189
 clarita or something like that I'm using 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.250
 a compact powder of a lighter shade 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:17.979
 before my skin and we're going to put it under 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.740
 of the arch of the eyebrow to help us 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.370
 better blur the purple color and that 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.469
 Make makeup cleaner too 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.710
 we can put a little on the lacrimal 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:32.710
 just like to tapping because of 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.319
 another way we could stay all purple 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.669
 and it would look strange and a little bad 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.740
 then you have to apply it carefully and 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.810
 since we end up with our eyes we're going to 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.529
 make our base as normally what 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:50.219
 do I use compact powder 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.219
 bronzer and blush 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.370
 and then we are going to make our eyebrows 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.890
 I make them with shade coffee but good 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.350
 they can use pencil or not 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.650
 fill them up depends on your eyebrows 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.190
 and what do you usually do after 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.410
 I 'm going to fix that with a first 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:20.120
 transparent so they stay in their 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.120
 place and do not move 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.680
 Clear 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:38.550
 and with that now, the 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:40.499
 makeup of our eyes finally 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.649
 let's move on to the lips myself 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:46.110
 I'm just going to apply a gloss that 

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:48.929
 It has a little color is lilac 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.409
 love but good you can apply 

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:55.019
 same a nude color or any those that 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:57.449
 you have a lip balm or something 

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:59.789
 of that type that is not a color 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:03.689
 scandalous and with that we would be already 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:05.789
 lists and good so look at me the 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:08.580
 I really love I hope you guys 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:12.679
 You also liked it and we'll see you in 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.679
 our next video bay 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.580
