00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
to go over how we can actually do that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.740

it's<00:00:28.500> not<00:00:28.650> all<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.890> difficult<00:00:29.420> but<00:00:30.420> before

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
it's not all that difficult but before

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.299 
it's not all that difficult but before
we<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:30.990> started<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.920> want<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> take

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
started on before you get started on

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
started on before you get started on
doing<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.680> simply<00:00:47.280> because<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.760> shows

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
doing this one simply because it shows

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.150 
doing this one simply because it shows
you<00:00:48.120> how<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> set<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> stereo<00:00:49.079> mix<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.010> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you how to set up the stereo mix so that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
you how to set up the stereo mix so that
you<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.430> record<00:00:50.579> system<00:00:51.270> sound<00:00:51.600> which<00:00:51.870> would

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you can record system sound which would

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.170 
you can record system sound which would
be<00:00:52.140> essential<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> recording<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.760> adobe

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
be essential to recording with adobe

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.619 
be essential to recording with adobe
audition<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.860> being<00:00:56.070> said<00:00:56.449> we'll<00:00:57.449> get

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
audition so that being said we'll get

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.619 
audition so that being said we'll get
started<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.590> need<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.629> once

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
started here and what we need to do once

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.810 
started here and what we need to do once
it's<00:01:00.870> set<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.980> open<00:01:02.190> adobe

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it's set up you have to open adobe

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.240 
it's set up you have to open adobe
audition<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.350> might<00:01:04.530> need<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.860> create<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
audition and you might need to create a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.870 
audition and you might need to create a
new<00:01:05.580> session<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.950> we'll<00:01:07.950> set<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> sample

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
new session and we'll set the sample

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.530 
new session and we'll set the sample
rate<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.049> 40<00:01:10.430> 144<00:01:11.430> 104<00:01:12.030> now<00:01:12.119> we'll<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.360> just

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
rate to 40 144 104 now we'll be just

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.820 
rate to 40 144 104 now we'll be just
fine<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.830> you're

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
fine and so what it is is that you're

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
fine and so what it is is that you're
going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.040> record<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.610> microphone<00:01:18.119> into

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
going to record on your microphone into

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.060 
going to record on your microphone into
one<00:01:18.659> track<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.590> you're<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
one track and then you're going to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.359 
one track and then you're going to
record<00:01:20.610> into<00:01:21.509> from<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.439> sound<00:01:22.619> mix<00:01:23.009> into<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
record into from your sound mix into the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.520 
record into from your sound mix into the
other<00:01:23.580> track<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:24.990> that'll<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
other track and so what that'll do is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.819 
other track and so what that'll do is
that<00:01:26.040> while<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.400> recording<00:01:27.710> when<00:01:28.710> you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that while you're recording when you

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.060 
that while you're recording when you
speak<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.759> microphone<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:31.049> capture<00:01:31.320> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
speak your microphone will capture that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.100 
speak your microphone will capture that
and<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.579> will<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.970> into<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> first<00:01:33.570> track<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and it will go into the first track and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.830 
and it will go into the first track and
whenever<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.369> response<00:01:35.939> into<00:01:36.299> Skype

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
whenever there is a response into Skype

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.050 
whenever there is a response into Skype
it<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:37.829> capture<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.729> into<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it will capture that and go into the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.429 
it will capture that and go into the
second<00:01:39.450> track<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.079> quite

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
second track now that could be quite

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.940 
second track now that could be quite
useful<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.549> some<00:01:42.150> scenarios<00:01:42.659> where<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.740> have

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
useful in some scenarios where you have

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.219 
useful in some scenarios where you have
to<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.159> editing<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.479> track<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.079> both

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
to do editing on on one track or both

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.289 
to do editing on on one track or both
tracks<00:01:46.649> especially<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> volume<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.119> off

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
tracks especially if the volume is off

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.940 
tracks especially if the volume is off
on<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> tracks<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.439> adjust<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
on one of the tracks you can adjust it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.580 
on one of the tracks you can adjust it
in<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.790> stereo<00:01:51.479> mixer<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.049> something<00:01:52.170> like

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
in the stereo mixer or something like

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.760 
in the stereo mixer or something like
