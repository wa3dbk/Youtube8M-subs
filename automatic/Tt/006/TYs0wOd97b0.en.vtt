00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.500
 Highlight of the make again today 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.720
 we mega delicious cheese spaetzle me early 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.029
 how easy to make the tips yourself 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.430
 yes and it fits so wonderful in the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.349
 winter time now nice longer after 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.210
 the food and if you like it 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.980
 Seeing this app then stays simple 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.500
 let me have my key here 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.670
 with them and we now give only 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.140
 sometimes more and we need 500 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.270
 gram 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.150
 this is not 5 grams of flour but we 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.890
 seven that each is very important to it 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.750
 we have behind small nodule that 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.970
 I do not want to and you probably do 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.370
 not so long next to us 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:02.239
 then bio euro and that whole six 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:05.119
 not easy to dough do not give 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.100
 separate or something else 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.040
 not here now the six eggs at it 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.619
 done because it just simply a tablespoon 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.619
 I add oil to sunflower oil 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:28.209
 and then we add salt and 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:28.209
 though about 34 teaspoons 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.960
 so now we knead it all together 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.850
 a homogeneous day and then have a look 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.060
 if we add some more water 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.040
 Compensate with is nicely sticky fourth 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.330
 taipei this is not so here dough 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.800
 as we wanted to say I have her 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 already bottled water and as it is 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.520
 now is that's still pretty 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
 creepy friable did not feel very much 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.150
 connected 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.060
 that is not the result of it 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.970
 give as first 150 60 milliliters 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
 Add water and leave it as easy 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.790
 sometimes also companies so you see 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.670
 This day is already relatively good 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.310
 but not so good he would have 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.680
 is pretty much you see that when 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.800
 So I'm going to make people up 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.500
 It is ok but it is 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.470
 not yet at this level again 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.660
 level as I would like him if 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.360
 we will not give them brad right then 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.390
 just press for it 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.160
 yes there would be not so optimal 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.140
 So for the spaetzle in did during 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.530
 not being optimal would be something 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.690
 Go cumbersome result and therefore 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.320
 Let's add something to the water 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.019
 also 50 meters mirror and 150 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.970
 milliliters of water and that's always going to happen 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.549
 under clarification and the result 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.530
 look and show you lie now 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.070
 at 200 milliliters of water in the lake 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.610
 animal preacher has become part of and 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.950
 now we push the make why so 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.080
 and I'm just thinking about the whole 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.880
 time I add water then 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.850
 I do not even think a little bit more 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.480
 too hard the problem is you too 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.459
 not so often now about 25 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.400
 milliliter admitted I will be when 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.080
 and then we will 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.140
 same again meet again we 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.470
 we also need cheese 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.690
 I take emmentalers here 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.700
 a whole block that way too many 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.959
 take only talk in half 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.780
 block and there we stay everything first 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.280
 Generous under I take the rough here 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.959
 You can of course also do a few rubbing 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.630
 have term loss have the feierei 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.400
 revive but the big one is quite good 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.200
 so the stuff is ready the glasses league 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.810
 rubbed off water boils you have 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.709
 maybe very quiet in the background 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.720
 if not bad 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.340
 water is now out of a coil 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.350
 boil down tip temperature below 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.959
 turned and now I will too 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.100
 I give my top board 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.340
 nine or 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.560
 One year we tried with the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.400
 board practical press and therefore 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.890
 say I have not had it for a long time 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.560
 which ones done and how you see yourself 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:32.580
 once over the dough and squeezed it 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:36.300
 so that the card once through and 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:42.990
 then have wonderful spaetzle here 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:45.710
 you were still abolished and also 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.710
 purely given 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.110
 then you see right after for the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.580
 come on top and so easy is noodles 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.880
 they're just gonna do it now 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.890
 met and then the wannsee 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.750
 the people will be prepared for all 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.640
 I'll show you the next one 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.860
 step so I have now in the talk 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.770
 warmed up that is something for me oil rhine 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.169
 You do not already see her hot and now 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.169
 I have the spaetzle here 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:24.510
 not all pure 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:29.480
 in portions and then someone the culprit 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.480
 to and once around 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.220
 goal is also back from the heart and you 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.220
 see here spÃ¤tzle and daniel peters 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.870
 illegal in winter always breaks on 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.090
 window border I take now here 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:52.570
 gk parsley and crumbles once 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:59.210
 small and save this once again 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:06:03.970
 the animal immediately warms up and becomes 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:09.440
 then the cheese spaetzle additionally with 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:11.980
 Their beautiful aroma can be as long as 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.980
 cause 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.130
 as long as someone from the cheese for it 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.260
 Everyone knows about it here 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.280
 that in crisis spaetzle so then you can 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.240
 optional if you like it with bacon 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.530

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.800
 I have just seared for a 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.180
 and then we're done with that 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.630
 recipe I have to wash hands often 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.360
 very urgently and then you can do it that way 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.160
 of course , then serve in the 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.440
 summer or spring with fresh 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:50.710
