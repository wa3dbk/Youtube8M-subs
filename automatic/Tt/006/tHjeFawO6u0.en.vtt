here<00:00:06.600> i<00:00:06.810> have<00:00:07.020> my<00:00:07.080> raspberry<00:00:07.830> pi<00:00:07.970> it's<00:00:08.970> just

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
here i have my raspberry pi it's just

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.950 
here i have my raspberry pi it's just
standard<00:00:09.570> browser<00:00:09.719> pi<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.410> small<00:00:11.190> case<00:00:11.429> and

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
standard browser pi a small case and

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.079 
standard browser pi a small case and
I've<00:00:12.960> got<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> switchboard<00:00:13.920> which<00:00:14.219> I've<00:00:14.429> placed

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
I've got a switchboard which I've placed

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.210 
I've got a switchboard which I've placed
on<00:00:15.269> top<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> Raspberry<00:00:15.960> Pi<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
on top of the Raspberry Pi and the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.000 
on top of the Raspberry Pi and the
switchboard<00:00:17.820> connects<00:00:18.510> directly<00:00:18.800> into<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
switchboard connects directly into the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.480 
switchboard connects directly into the
GPIO<00:00:20.730> pins<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:22.350> have<00:00:22.500> an<00:00:22.590> SD<00:00:22.740> card<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.340> here

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
GPIO pins and I have an SD card in here

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.679 
GPIO pins and I have an SD card in here
with<00:00:23.730> name<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> X<00:00:25.170> maim<00:00:26.119> and<00:00:27.119> I've<00:00:27.420> modified

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
with name on it X maim and I've modified

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.480 
with name on it X maim and I've modified
the<00:00:27.840> X<00:00:28.050> mames<00:00:28.289> horse<00:00:28.560> code<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.130> will<00:00:29.310> read

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the X mames horse code so it will read

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.540 
the X mames horse code so it will read
the<00:00:29.730> switches<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.980> use<00:00:31.980> them<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.309> they<00:00:32.520> were

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the switches and use them like they were

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.470 
the switches and use them like they were
joystick<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.200> X<00:00:34.380> maim<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.860> type<00:00:35.280> an<00:00:36.090> option

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
joystick so in X maim you type an option

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.040 
joystick so in X maim you type an option
minus<00:00:36.870> JT<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.370> number<00:00:38.760> six<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
minus JT and number six that's the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.520 
minus JT and number six that's the
Raspberry<00:00:40.379> Pi<00:00:40.850> joystick<00:00:41.850> interface<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.410> i

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
Raspberry Pi joystick interface so if i

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
Raspberry Pi joystick interface so if i
plug<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:49.340> what<00:00:50.340> i've<00:00:50.399> done<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.610> i've<00:00:50.820> used

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
plug it in what i've done is i've used

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.260 
plug it in what i've done is i've used
arch<00:00:51.420> linux<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:52.199> my<00:00:52.410> operating<00:00:53.010> system<00:00:53.270> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
arch linux as my operating system and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.760 
arch linux as my operating system and
you'll<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> boots<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:55.379> quickly<00:00:57.770> so

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you'll see it boots up very quickly so

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160 
you'll see it boots up very quickly so
hit<00:00:58.920> starting<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> boot<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.750> I've<00:01:00.870> chosen

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
hit starting to boot and I've chosen

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
hit starting to boot and I've chosen
Arch<00:01:01.410> Linux<00:01:01.500> over<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> other<00:01:02.190> distributions

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
Arch Linux over the other distributions

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.910 
Arch Linux over the other distributions
because<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> other<00:01:03.359> distributions<00:01:04.049> seem<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because the other distributions seem to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.550 
because the other distributions seem to
take<00:01:05.040> much<00:01:05.100> longer<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.700> boot<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:07.439> will

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
take much longer to boot up and it will

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.880 
take much longer to boot up and it will
auto<00:01:07.710> login<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.880> open<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.890> menu

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
auto login and it will open up menu

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.770 
auto login and it will open up menu
system<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:11.729> I've<00:01:11.909> designed<00:01:13.100> for<00:01:14.100> MAME

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
system the which I've designed for MAME

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.830 
system the which I've designed for MAME
there<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.990> straighten<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:18.270> menu<00:01:18.450> system

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
there is straighten and the menu system

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.219 
there is straighten and the menu system
also<00:01:19.020> has<00:01:19.380> her<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.850> keys<00:01:21.240> set<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.049> can

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
also has her the keys set up so I can

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.469 
also has her the keys set up so I can
move<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.680> cursor<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.250> down<00:01:23.400> using<00:01:24.210> these
