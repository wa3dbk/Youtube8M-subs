are<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.829> two<00:01:53.100> colors<00:01:53.520> mixed<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.060> they're

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
are have two colors mixed in they're

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.139 
are have two colors mixed in they're
going<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.780> change<00:01:55.520> probably<00:01:56.520> every<00:01:56.759> time<00:01:57.000> you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
going to change probably every time you

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.520 
going to change probably every time you
use<00:01:57.390> them<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.659> mean<00:01:57.899> they're<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.259> kind<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
use them I mean they're just kind of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.920 
use them I mean they're just kind of
marbleized<00:01:59.100> together<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.969> you're<00:02:00.719> probably

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
marbleized together so you're probably

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.420 
marbleized together so you're probably
going<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.320> some<00:02:01.530> color<00:02:01.740> change<00:02:02.130> there

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
going to get some color change there

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.980 
going to get some color change there
skip<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.479> Venus<00:02:03.840> okay<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.350> one's<00:02:04.560> Venus

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.790 

it's<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.569> second<00:02:29.019> blue<00:02:29.200> shade<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
it's that second blue shade in the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.850 
it's that second blue shade in the
middle<00:02:30.959> then<00:02:31.959> earth<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:35.200> bright<00:02:35.560> blue

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
middle then earth is that bright blue

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.920 
middle then earth is that bright blue
right<00:02:36.580> there<00:02:36.610> right<00:02:37.540> dry<00:02:38.819> then<00:02:39.819> right<00:02:40.540> above

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
right there right dry then right above

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.320 
right there right dry then right above
that<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.940> Neptune

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
that is Neptune

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.180 
that is Neptune
oh<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.040> think<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.430> such<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.150> pretty<00:02:46.660> blue

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
oh and I think of such a pretty blue

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.150 
oh and I think of such a pretty blue
it's<00:02:48.190> right<00:02:48.519> there<00:02:48.819> it's<00:02:49.120> not<00:02:49.810> quite<00:02:50.200> Navy<00:02:50.560> but

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
it's right there it's not quite Navy but

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.680 
it's right there it's not quite Navy but
then<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:51.549> not<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.730> bright<00:02:52.030> blue<00:02:52.269> it's<00:02:52.540> just

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
then it's not a bright blue it's just

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.620 
then it's not a bright blue it's just
very<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.769> love<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.519> very<00:02:54.730> pretty<00:02:55.120> all

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
very I love it it's very pretty all

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.850 
very I love it it's very pretty all
right<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.019> now<00:02:56.350> we're<00:02:56.530> going<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> go<00:02:56.799> to

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
right so now we're going to go to

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.949 
right so now we're going to go to
mercury<00:02:57.630> which<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.970> shade<00:03:01.330> right<00:03:01.600> there

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
mercury which is that shade right there

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.630 
mercury which is that shade right there
and<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.250> what<00:03:03.400> I'm<00:03:03.519> talking<00:03:04.030> about<00:03:04.590> with

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
and this is what I'm talking about with

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.610 
and this is what I'm talking about with
you<00:03:06.640> know<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:07.510> one's<00:03:07.810> one<00:03:08.019> of<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.200> ones<00:03:08.380> that

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
you know this one's one of the ones that

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.770 
you know this one's one of the ones that
has<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.980> marbleized<00:03:09.549> color<00:03:09.880> in<00:03:10.090> there<00:03:10.269> so<00:03:10.690> you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
has the marbleized color in there so you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.930 
has the marbleized color in there so you
can<00:03:10.900> see<00:03:11.110> on<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.230> wet<00:03:11.620> swatch<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.310> little<00:03:12.820> bit

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
can see on that wet swatch a little bit

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.000 
can see on that wet swatch a little bit
of<00:03:13.030> my<00:03:13.120> brush<00:03:13.450> went<00:03:13.750> into<00:03:14.019> that<00:03:14.140> darker<00:03:14.680> shade

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
of my brush went into that darker shade

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.250 
of my brush went into that darker shade
so<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:16.180> know<00:03:16.299> I'm<00:03:16.420> kind<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.780> getting<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:17.109> little

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
so you know I'm kind of getting a little

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.240 
so you know I'm kind of getting a little
bit<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.769> like<00:03:18.010> an<00:03:18.660> ombre<00:03:19.660> effect<00:03:20.109> with<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.590> what

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
bit of like an ombre effect with it what

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.979 
bit of like an ombre effect with it what
so<00:03:21.640> as<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.180> tell<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.630> know<00:03:22.720> it's<00:03:22.870> going

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989

get<00:03:25.000> into<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.650> then<00:03:26.650> next<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:28.620> Mars<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:30.190> this

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
get into it then next is Mars and this

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.120 
get into it then next is Mars and this
is<00:03:30.670> um<00:03:31.500> really<00:03:32.500> pretty

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.620 

that's<00:03:44.590> Mars<00:03:46.380> then<00:03:47.610> asteroid<00:03:48.610> right<00:03:49.030> there<00:03:49.360> is

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
that's Mars then asteroid right there is

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.250 
that's Mars then asteroid right there is
like<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> maroon<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.830> blue<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.640> it<00:03:52.600> mixes

you can see it wet and dry right there
it's<00:04:04.030> at<00:04:04.240> center<00:04:04.540> color<00:04:05.340> then<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.670> light<00:04:07.060> blue

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
it's at center color then the light blue

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.420 
it's at center color then the light blue
is<00:04:08.310> Uranus<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.960> that<00:04:10.960> is<00:04:12.000> right<00:04:13.000> then<00:04:14.430> and

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
is Uranus and that is right then and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.420 
is Uranus and that is right then and
moon<00:04:15.940> comes<00:04:16.540> out<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:17.200> pretty<00:04:17.680> it<00:04:17.980> has<00:04:18.040> this

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
moon comes out so pretty it has this

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.160 
moon comes out so pretty it has this
iridescent<00:04:18.790> Center<00:04:19.390> that<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:19.570> can't<00:04:19.900> tell

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
iridescent Center that you can't tell

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.840 
iridescent Center that you can't tell
from<00:04:20.620> there<00:04:21.460> it<00:04:21.550> is<00:04:21.730> that's<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.810> moon<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:24.790> you

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
from there it is that's a moon so you

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.740 
from there it is that's a moon so you
can't<00:04:25.210> tell<00:04:25.540> from<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:27.550> package<00:04:28.360> so<00:04:28.540> it's<00:04:28.660> like

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
can't tell from the package so it's like

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.170 
can't tell from the package so it's like
a<00:04:28.780> purpley<00:04:29.380> blue<00:04:29.410> color<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.220> then<00:04:30.730> that<00:04:31.000> is

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
a purpley blue color and then that is

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.410 
a purpley blue color and then that is
Eclipse<00:04:31.780> right<00:04:32.110> there
