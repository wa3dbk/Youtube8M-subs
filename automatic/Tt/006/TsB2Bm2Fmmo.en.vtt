00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Here I have an idea for key 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:09.830
 and we will be the keys with 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.360
 nail polish once that is called here 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.410
 key here at the key chain 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.670
 then you know for which door the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.380
 key the key is so if 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.330
 you now marked in blue know that is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.730
 the front door the front door key 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.170
 if it is resting now it is striking 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.020
 maybe the door for the entrance door 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:41.059
 So for those going on or so I'll be the one 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 with nail polish just a worth me 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:52.829
 believe it was only this in the field 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:58.949
 on both sides first a string 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.160
 and then let it dry and the other one 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.160
 page 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.200
 so you can remember better 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:24.850
 which key in which 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:27.700
 keyhole when the color again 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.479
 you can jump it here 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.070
 removers make out and back 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.070
 with a different color of any color 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 on 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:51.960
 that is let the blue dry and the 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:51.960
 other side once an hour approximately 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:34.269
 because we do the same again ran then 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.269
 you have and key
