00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
a fantastic mod review for you today

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.519 
a fantastic mod review for you today
what<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> items<00:00:20.640> physics<00:00:21.390> mod<00:00:21.779> so

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
what we have is the items physics mod so

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.689 
what we have is the items physics mod so
as<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.740> might've<00:00:22.920> seen<00:00:23.039> from<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> pre<00:00:23.550> log

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
as you might've seen from the pre log

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.920 
as you might've seen from the pre log
thing<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.029> no<00:00:24.210> idea<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.750> fire

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
thing I have no idea what with you fire

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.849 
thing I have no idea what with you fire
yeah<00:00:25.109> but<00:00:25.230> either<00:00:25.320> way<00:00:25.470> I'm<00:00:25.529> sure<00:00:25.710> you'll

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
yeah but either way I'm sure you'll

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.700 
yeah but either way I'm sure you'll
enjoy<00:00:26.330> it's<00:00:27.330> already<00:00:27.539> happening<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.349> we've

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
enjoy it's already happening so we've

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769 
enjoy it's already happening so we've
got<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.949> nice<00:00:29.130> little<00:00:29.160> berry<00:00:29.849> here<00:00:30.119> so

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
got this nice little berry here so

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.999 
got this nice little berry here so
basically<00:00:30.960> instead<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
basically instead of this like a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.709 
basically instead of this like a
dropping<00:00:32.489> items<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.850> normal<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.660> example

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
dropping items like normal for example

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
dropping items like normal for example
if<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> drop<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.469> disk<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.399> you're<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.579> kind

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
if you drop a disk so you're just kind

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.510 
if you drop a disk so you're just kind
of<00:00:35.820> scatters<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> floor<00:00:37.100> or<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> web<00:00:38.370> or

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
of scatters to the floor or a web or

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.190 
of scatters to the floor or a web or
anything<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> does

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
anything like that it just kind of does

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.360 
anything like that it just kind of does
a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.530> more<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.219> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
a little bit more to it if you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.830 
a little bit more to it if you
understand<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.850> how<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.030> goes<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.329> 3d<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
understand see how it goes like 3d and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840 
understand see how it goes like 3d and
hits<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> ground<00:00:43.520> blocks<00:00:44.520> are<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> best

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
hits the ground blocks are the best

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.799 
hits the ground blocks are the best
thing<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.719> how

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
thing to do that because you can see how

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.440 
thing to do that because you can see how
they<00:00:45.930> 3d<00:00:46.320> wrote<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.940> it's<00:00:47.940> actually<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.210> really

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
they 3d wrote it it's actually a really

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.569 
they 3d wrote it it's actually a really
this<00:00:48.539> cool<00:00:48.809> nice<00:00:49.079> little<00:00:49.500> update<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.430> make

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
this cool nice little update to make

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.350 
this cool nice little update to make
things<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.000> little<00:00:51.180> bit<00:00:51.270> more

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
things just a little bit more

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.450 
things just a little bit more
interesting<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> physics<00:00:52.949> dirt<00:00:53.160> stuck

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
interesting but the physics dirt stuck

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
interesting but the physics dirt stuck
there<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.300> example<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.930> were<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.050> toss

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
there so for example if we were to toss

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.500 
there so for example if we were to toss
say<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.949> piece<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.250> sand<00:00:56.489> into<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.000> water<00:00:57.210> here

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
say a piece of sand into this water here

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.930 
say a piece of sand into this water here
so<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> said<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.980> sinks<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> bottom<00:00:59.430> not

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
so it said it sinks to the bottom not

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.039 
so it said it sinks to the bottom not
going<00:01:00.120> anywhere<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.840> toss<00:01:00.989> some<00:01:01.440> wool<00:01:03.049> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
going anywhere but we toss some wool and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.329 
going anywhere but we toss some wool and
it<00:01:04.170> floats<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.530> top<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> seeds

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it floats to the top just like the seeds

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609 
it floats to the top just like the seeds
did<00:01:05.549> back<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:06.080> it's<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> really<00:01:07.350> neat<00:01:07.470> little

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
did back there it's a really neat little

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.719 
did back there it's a really neat little
thing<00:01:07.860> obviously<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> little<00:01:08.340> bit<00:01:08.490> buggy

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
thing obviously it's a little bit buggy

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.740 
thing obviously it's a little bit buggy
because<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.060> trying<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> flow<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> water

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
because it's trying to flow on the water

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.300 
because it's trying to flow on the water
and<00:01:09.840> look<00:01:09.960> real<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.010> some<00:01:11.159> other

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and look real but you can do some other

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.760 
and look real but you can do some other
stuff<00:01:11.430> too<00:01:11.880> some<00:01:12.420> other<00:01:12.540> uses<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.200> example<00:01:13.650> if

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
stuff too some other uses for example if

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
stuff too some other uses for example if
we<00:01:13.860> use<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.159> line<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.670> I'll<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.060> run<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
we use this line here I'll just run to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.719 
we use this line here I'll just run to
the<00:01:15.450> end<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.680> I've<00:01:16.979> got<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.280> blaze<00:01:17.490> X

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the end of it with I've got some blaze X

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.920 
the end of it with I've got some blaze X
here<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.060> obviously<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.540> wherever<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
here but obviously it's wherever you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.899 
here but obviously it's wherever you
want<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.110> use<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.490> kind<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.700> toss

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
want to use you can just kind of toss

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.010 
want to use you can just kind of toss
them<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.720> doing<00:01:21.840> some

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
them out as if you are like doing some

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.270 
them out as if you are like doing some
too<00:01:22.110> according<00:01:22.290> thing<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.619> piece<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> candy

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
too according thing like piece of candy

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640 
too according thing like piece of candy
piece<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.759> candy<00:01:24.030> piece<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> candy<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.020> stole

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
piece of candy piece of candy I stole

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.719 
piece of candy piece of candy I stole
her<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:25.830> Lachlan<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.460> being<00:01:26.580> perfectly

toss<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> few<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.640> top<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.020> only<00:01:34.350> stack<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
toss a few on top you can only stack to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.370 
toss a few on top you can only stack to
a<00:01:34.799> level<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.130> two<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.939> same<00:01:36.119> time<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
a level of two at the same time it's a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
a level of two at the same time it's a
neat<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.590> thing<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.280> can

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
neat little thing because then you can

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.120 
neat little thing because then you can
gonna<00:01:38.640> run<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.329> pick<00:01:39.420> them<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.130> maybe

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
gonna run and pick them up and maybe

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.380 
gonna run and pick them up and maybe
fall<00:01:41.340> onto<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.579> trap<00:01:41.790> or<00:01:42.000> anything<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
fall onto a trap or anything like that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.410 
fall onto a trap or anything like that
this<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> cool<00:01:43.700> neat<00:01:44.700> little<00:01:45.090> thing

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
this is a kind of cool neat little thing

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.359 
this is a kind of cool neat little thing
you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> haven't<00:01:46.649> tried<00:01:46.799> tools<00:01:47.130> yet

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you can do now I haven't tried tools yet

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.590 
you can do now I haven't tried tools yet
basically<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:47.939> where<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> look<00:01:48.360> basically

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
basically from where I look basically

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.120 
basically from where I look basically
over<00:01:48.990> tools<00:01:49.229> look<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> same<00:01:49.680> when<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> handle

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
over tools look the same when you handle

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.499 
over tools look the same when you handle
ever<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.579> when<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.759> touch<00:01:50.939> them<00:01:51.119> obviously

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
ever but when you touch them obviously

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.179 
ever but when you touch them obviously
that<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.720> kind<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.950> turning<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.070> bit

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
that it's kind of turning a little bit

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.020 
that it's kind of turning a little bit
3d<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.049> stack<00:01:55.189> since<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.369> being<00:01:56.670> flat

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
3d and stack since it is being flat

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.910 
3d and stack since it is being flat
they're<00:01:57.780> quite<00:01:57.960> neat<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.320> flat<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
they're quite neat and flat which is a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350 
they're quite neat and flat which is a
really<00:01:59.280> cool<00:01:59.460> thing<00:01:59.490> not<00:01:59.850> honestly<00:02:00.240> because

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
really cool thing not honestly because

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.670 
really cool thing not honestly because
obviously<00:02:00.509> work<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:00.869> texture<00:02:01.380> packs

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
obviously work with texture packs

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.929 
obviously work with texture packs
that's<00:02:01.890> why<00:02:02.009> I'm<00:02:02.100> using<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.430> fax<00:02:02.670> take<00:02:02.880> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
that's why I'm using this fax take you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
that's why I'm using this fax take you
back<00:02:03.090> today<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.079> obviously<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.590> can

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
back today this is obviously so we can

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.709 
back today this is obviously so we can
try<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.579> 0<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> works<00:02:06.000> by<00:02:06.119> Zeeland<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
try it on 0 it works by Zeeland but a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.789 
try it on 0 it works by Zeeland but a
little<00:02:06.930> 3d<00:02:07.110> edge<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
little 3d edge and I think that

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.080 
little 3d edge and I think that
technically<00:02:08.220> stacked<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.700> top<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.879> each<00:02:08.970> other

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
technically stacked on top of each other

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.510 
technically stacked on top of each other
that's<00:02:09.360> where<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.509> got<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> little<00:02:10.220> spot<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that's where I got the little spot of a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.760 
that's where I got the little spot of a
thing<00:02:12.030> no<00:02:12.480> gravity<00:02:12.930> but

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
thing no gravity but

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.550 
thing no gravity but
both<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.190> same<00:02:15.140> arrows<00:02:16.140> do<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.380> same

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
both do the same arrows do the same

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.780 
both do the same arrows do the same
level<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.100> slight<00:02:17.280> little<00:02:17.490> stacking

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
level do that slight little stacking

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.300 
level do that slight little stacking
thing<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.570> either<00:02:18.660> way<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:18.930> quite<00:02:19.310> neat

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
thing but either way it's quite neat

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.470 
thing but either way it's quite neat
more<00:02:20.460> than<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.610> think<00:02:20.760> obviously<00:02:21.060> fire<00:02:21.330> an

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
more than I think obviously fire an

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.850 
more than I think obviously fire an
arrow<00:02:21.570> works<00:02:21.960> like<00:02:22.140> an<00:02:22.230> hour<00:02:22.320> arrow<00:02:22.560> would

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
arrow works like an hour arrow would

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.280 
arrow works like an hour arrow would
otherwise<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.820> just<00:02:23.970> basically<00:02:24.120> sticks<00:02:24.630> and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
otherwise it just basically sticks and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.600 
otherwise it just basically sticks and
it's<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.280> neat<00:02:26.490> little

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
it's a really it's just a neat little

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.370 
it's a really it's just a neat little
add-on<00:02:27.000> basically<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:28.050> pretty

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
add-on basically it's just a pretty

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.410 
add-on basically it's just a pretty
fication<00:02:28.680> thing<00:02:28.980> more<00:02:29.130> than<00:02:29.220> anything

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
fication thing more than anything

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.460 
fication thing more than anything
because<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.630> just<00:02:30.720> makes<00:02:30.990> things<00:02:31.200> look<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
because it just makes things look a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.770 
because it just makes things look a
little<00:02:31.740> bit<00:02:31.950> neater<00:02:32.240> unique<00:02:33.240> uses<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
little bit neater unique uses for the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.210 
little bit neater unique uses for the
shares<00:02:34.410> or<00:02:34.470> anything<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.920> think<00:02:35.010> of

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
shares or anything like that I think of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.860 
shares or anything like that I think of
course<00:02:35.400> I'm<00:02:35.550> ready

because<00:02:50.160> my<00:02:50.340> PC<00:02:50.670> wants<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.940> be<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> real<00:02:51.390> jag

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
because my PC wants to be a real jag

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.660 
because my PC wants to be a real jag
today<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:52.770> either<00:02:52.860> way<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.340> works<00:02:53.520> as

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
today but either way it just works as

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.250 
today but either way it just works as
you<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:53.820> see<00:02:53.970> still<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.660> with<00:02:54.780> everything

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
you can see still do it with everything

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.660 
you can see still do it with everything
else<00:02:55.560> everything<00:02:56.010> lands<00:02:56.280> as<00:02:56.460> it<00:02:56.550> would

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
else everything lands as it would

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.760 
else everything lands as it would
normally<00:02:56.760> would<00:02:57.170> tends<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.230> try<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.470> separate

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
normally would tends to try and separate

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.740 
normally would tends to try and separate
itself<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.250> obviously<00:02:59.550> things<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.390> touching

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
itself so obviously things like touching

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.450 
itself so obviously things like touching
so<00:03:01.170> much<00:03:01.350> but<00:03:01.710> you<00:03:01.770> know<00:03:01.830> it's<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.190> neat

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
so much but you know it's it's a neat

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.910 
so much but you know it's it's a neat
little<00:03:02.490> way<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:03.120> doing<00:03:03.390> things<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.920> took

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
little way of doing things I took

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.260 
little way of doing things I took
nothing<00:03:05.100> supposed<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:05.610> jump<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:05.970> or<00:03:06.210> if

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
nothing supposed to jump like that or if

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.150 
nothing supposed to jump like that or if
it's<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.450> bug<00:03:06.690> honestly<00:03:07.590> but<00:03:07.800> either<00:03:07.920> way<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
it's a bug honestly but either way it

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.030 
it's a bug honestly but either way it
works<00:03:08.340> either<00:03:08.610> way<00:03:08.760> or<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:08.940> real<00:03:09.690> nicely<00:03:10.320> so

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
works either way or just real nicely so

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.470 
works either way or just real nicely so
you<00:03:11.100> need<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.430> nice<00:03:11.670> little<00:03:11.850> trail<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.150> arrows

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
you need a nice little trail of arrows

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.970 
you need a nice little trail of arrows
or<00:03:12.600> anything<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:12.960> so<00:03:13.260> it's<00:03:13.770> just<00:03:13.860> a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
or anything like that so it's just a

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.350 
or anything like that so it's just a
nice<00:03:14.130> little<00:03:14.190> way<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.550> maybe<00:03:14.790> doing<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.180> for<00:03:15.330> a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
nice little way of maybe doing it for a

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.300 
nice little way of maybe doing it for a
machinima<00:03:15.750> or<00:03:16.320> anything<00:03:16.830> like<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.070> but<00:03:17.280> I

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
machinima or anything like that but I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.190 
machinima or anything like that but I
just<00:03:17.490> like<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.670> way<00:03:17.760> they<00:03:17.910> flip<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.540> toss

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
just like the way they flip and toss

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.930 
just like the way they flip and toss
around<00:03:19.350> in<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.680> air<00:03:19.800> just<00:03:20.010> looks<00:03:20.400> amusing<00:03:20.820> to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
around in the air just looks amusing to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.880 
around in the air just looks amusing to
me<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.390> anyway<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.600> really<00:03:22.050> like<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.320> the
