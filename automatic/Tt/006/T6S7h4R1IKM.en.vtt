00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 nice that you look my name is bad 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.160
 ytsma 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.069
 Today's topic is a bit of a jab 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.670
 there when planting a better man eating 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.690
 as a vegan and more moral person 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.279
 your morally superior demand arises 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 from the comment that class under one of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.080
 my earlier videos in which someone said 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.539
 glad that you fall in love with plants as food 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.099
 let go on the chest but take a good look 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.650
 his look to me are better than all 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.450
 other people and that worked well 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.100
 irritation after that I understand I still want 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.450
 say a few things about it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.430
 and it's a bit of a search for the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.870
 good words 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.550
 look for me personally is planting 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.899
 food started with a choice for my 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.340
 own health 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.410
 you could almost say that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.200
 were or are selfish motives 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.539
 least the motives of self-love 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.550
 that is something other than selfish me 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.440
 wanted to take good care myself one 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.210
 stone and i found out that you like that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.670
 can do the best by planning pies 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.030
 of eating with it had its consequences me 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.180
 I became slimmer and the vital I tasted better 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 I did smell better in their skin 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.830
 i like outdoor sports in short i became and me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.360
 became a better version of myself in 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.720
 physical sense 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.270
 in health terms but you got one 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.500
 very him too 5 fast that i get home or them 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.140
 come to me ideal 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.820
 because i have been around all my life 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.610
 it's not okay because what 's in the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.930
 bio-industry happens and you know I know 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.880
 nobody actually thinks it's okay 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.530
 that we are also very clear about that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.990
 no one says i'm for the cinema 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.299
 that weekend for torturing here 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.400
 whether I am for animals close by 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.920
 are thousands and they 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.600
 at 10 percent of their natural 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.390
 age but we do it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.910
 well with them I now had no more but 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.470
 I also did my I just had out 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.970
 industry 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.730
 the same they opt for organic meat 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.060
 then again animals know it 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.060
 concerned 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.840
 on people that you become aware and I have 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.020
 wilders only consciously really aware after me 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.210
 if plants were eating then it is natural 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.560
 better not to participate 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.420
 And that doesn't mean your solution 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.040
 are the solution to all problems and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.560
 that it's the end of it 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.880
 of all animals led is indeed like me 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.880
 I walk down stairs through the grass 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.800
 probably also dead animals or me 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.440
 now my car drives then we go too 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.920
 fries on the window every post in short 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.870
 also by my stars still animals 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.970
 but I don't think it's real because 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.709
 say to leave socialism 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.200
 suffer so much yes that actually makes it 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.180
 also no matter what you do and why should 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.800
 you feel better at my that you know 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.690
 that there is an industry where or 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.709
 structural way 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.230
 animals suffer small peeps and up and on 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.750
 to them in a dignified manner 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.940
 end come then you can choose to be there 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.010
 whether or not to support that industry and 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.350
 then i think you are better 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.720
 morally better it sounds very unpleasant 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.790
 but still you are tired much better on my 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.940
 that you say I vote that industry 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.940
 not 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.400
 and that seems obvious 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.140
 that you do other things that we are not ok 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.150
 find out about then theft or 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.070
 murder or rape 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.550
 also say it's better you're better 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.550
 if you don't 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.570
 so here too if you are convinced 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.110
 that animals already 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.850
 unnecessary animal suffering is immoral than am 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.820
 you better if you don't 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.440
 if you have no part in it so yes 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.260
 in that sense, a planter is food or a 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.069
 vegan a better person and that also applies 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.800
 in front of 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.840
 has no consequences for the environment 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.520
 and for world poverty 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.459
 it presses global animal husbandry has one 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.920
 huge imprint on the earth 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.300
 destruction of the ocean and where 80 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.520
 percent of everything caught gas 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.170
 mixes or dies overboard again as 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.120
 supposedly by-catch with is none 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.069
 bycatch that is the way the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.530
 whole fishery is entering 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.430
 I think that is an immoral way of it 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.709
 of fishing if I fish from that industry 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.500
 know that I sponsor that I help 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.569
 if I no longer do that 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.410
 then it makes me raise and that is 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.290
 you make a moral and moral step 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.910
 a moral choice and broad so my about 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.280
 a better person not to do so 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.729
 I do indeed think you are morally 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.500
 are credible on people that you salvage 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.169
 makes choices in listening and I know too 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.240
 it does not stop with food plants 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.940
 that is also about how how how 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.419
 my clothes come on and am there 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.330
 I also still looking for that to happen in 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.490
 in had race where children have to work 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.320
 under terrible conditions that is 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.690
 also not morally okay 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.460
 everything we do has enormous moral 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.450
 implications is it is good in you then 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.919
 get rest 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.410
 that can also make you despondent of yes 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.570
 but what can I do then 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.419
 that is true but in my eyes it is not allowed 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.740
 lead to a cynicism in which said 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.520
 being it doesn't matter what does one do 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.590
 field 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.140
 it really matters and you can with you 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.370
 choices make a difference make a difference 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.050
 the animals make a difference to it 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.150
 also make a planet difference 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.110
 for example, I also find a moral 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.520
 issue 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.410
 with that I eat there as plants 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.550
 calculate how many vegetables are available 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.500
 is whether or and is needed for my food 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.360
 then I could still about him and 9 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.250
 acres that is also available for it 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.550
 every person while the average 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.130
 Dutchman with lots of meat and dairy 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.800
 fish eggs and so on that use of 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.889
 2.1 2.1 works on that is almost 3 times 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:41.590
 so much that there is because there is moon on him 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.759
 hectares of terrestrial available 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.590
 that is closing we are just not 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.810
 honestly if you are in one of the combs 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.689
 with 100 people and you 100 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.590
 pieces of tail low are the first 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.729
 twenty people who all pack three 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.879
 pieces 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.039
 then you know that the last shortage is coming 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.900
 it's not fair and in such a small one 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.240
 space you talk to each other about it 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.770
 we do on a global scale only 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.349
 don't see who's behind you 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.270
 can't eat anymore because we like them 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:11.349
 are innocent and that has everything to do 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.029
 with our animal consumption and 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:16.719
 you know you can't believe your faith 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:18.250
 but that is a matter of yes 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.750
 facts are my own and that is 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.560
 calculated that is that is clear it is 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.000
 bright 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.520
 you can calculate how much land there is 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.199
 required for the production of one kilo 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.800
 meat and 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:31.629
 and the goes quite what if you bottle and 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:36.520
 depict the Netherlands range 16100 animals 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:39.430
 in life on you are talking about quite a bit 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.639
 so yes i think it is a moral choice 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.639
 and that you are therefore also morally one 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.439
 I feel better as a person if you do 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.659
 elevated that is perhaps different 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:51.610
 No question I do not have sex at all 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.259
 I do n't feel better in that sense 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.330
 other people 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.110
 I make better choice there I am 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.039
 convinced 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.810
 when it comes to food but i feel 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:03.159
 do not forgive 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.270
 oh because I am aware of the fact 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:09.129
 that I marie 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.810
 41 had long been unaware of this and other 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.339
 So it makes choices about it 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.849
 other people would also be a judgment 

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:17.620
 about the first 41 years of your own life 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:20.830
 fits assess people think 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.569
 it's not just an appeal to people 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.750
 It's a moral choices that we really admit 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:27.789
 makes you care what you do 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:31.120
 it can not be said 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:32.770
 and it says like to cook and again me 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.089
 often approach it out of respect for it 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:38.349
 health again on the blog of 

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:39.520
 today but this aspect is also me 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.990
 hope you can do more i am too 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.550
 very curious how to shoot 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:48.070
 how you how you reacted too often 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:51.100
 in the comments below under the video 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:54.780
 or facebook or go elsewhere 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.780
 but together in my specie 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.750
 I am very curious thank you for that 

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.750
 watching and see you tomorrow
