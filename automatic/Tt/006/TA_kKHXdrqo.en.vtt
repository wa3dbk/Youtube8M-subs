00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 we will penetrate their brains 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.720
 yet in the fifteenth century maps 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 asserted the dog is devoid of 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.730
 consciousness if you him and walk on the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.950
 misses it triggers a reflex a kind 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.450
 mechanical howard that drives 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640
 barking in the 20th century 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.160
 the physiologist pavlov highlights 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.680
 in dogs the production of reflexes 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.119
 behavioral this process would be at the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.119
 basis of the training mechanisms 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.629
 dogs are actually smart 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.420
 one of the best examples of their 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.430
 intelligence and the game we have here 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.620
 two dogs playing they bite each other 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.540
 each other but in fact they do not get 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.580
 not fight them if they send in 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.920
 permanence of signals for means that 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.230
 it's a game and not an aggression they are 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.850
 bite really sweetly they exchange 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.550
 probably the information with their 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.430
 eyes they certainly gives us no 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.680
 smell of aggression or threats and 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.170
 never do they really bite the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.909
 doctor marc bykov is convinced that the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:13.750
 game and an essential food for 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:15.790
 the brain I think that research 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.960
 fascinating will be made in the future in 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.430
 irm on the brains of animals 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.500
 we need it to understand what 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.210
 brain area are active when the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.619
 dog days and I think we 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.090
 could we learn if they are the same 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.409
 in the dog and the man when we play 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.299
 his first medical images have 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.229
 proved that more dogs play more 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.229
 their brain to grow 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.780
 the game increases connections 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.780
 neurons in the procession 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.630
 the dog possesses like us a cortex 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.010
 prefrontal connected to the memory that 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:00.740
 allows to associate sensations with 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:02.090
 to spend the brain of a big dog 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.760
 is not bigger than a lemon 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:11.330
 yet it includes 90 % of our 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:13.490
 gestural behavior the game involves 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.020
 the development of code rules and 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.030
 a sign language or sound 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.070
 particular who proves for marc 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.380
 baeckeoffe the analytical capacity of the 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.090
 March dog bykov found that a dog 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.610
 who wants to play but head to the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.489
 wave there that describes an arc of circle 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.930
 and vocalized for a long time people 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.520
 used to think that 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.520
 dog vocalizations does not mean 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.380
 great thing but he had a lot of 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.030
 recent research that shows that 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.709
 the dog's subscription is very complex 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.010
 there are many types of barking and 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.840
 different individuals an animal too 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.290
 great for a dog to take small 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.290
 decisions 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.380
 after marc baeckeoffe biologists in 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.370
 evolution the answer is yes 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.430
 the dogs would indulge in a 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.680
 deep thinking when they play the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.320
 game is the ideal area to study the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.959
 committee reflection and their health 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.010
 animal is where dogs are the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.150
 more creative 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.580
 in dogs the game is totally 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.480
 unpredictable 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.610
 while the behavior 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.430
 predatory or aggressive producers is 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:30.430
 very predictable 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:32.590
 the game is extremely changeable at 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.300
 during the game the dogs adapt their 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.430
 reactions as and when in a 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.730
 spontaneous decision flow that marc 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.470
 baeckeoffe brings thought closer to 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.120
 nuances of play and the adaptation of 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.830
 reactions go very clearly in the 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:51.310
 meaning of the thesis in favor of 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:52.420
 the intelligence and the coalition they in 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.209
 see evidence in behaviors 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.650
 disarmingly simple 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:01.150
 as he points out that he is heading the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.100
 reverence the reverence it's when a 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.530
 dog a wolf or any other 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.140
 animal squats on its front legs 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.230
 the last in the air stirs the tail and to 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.690
 sometimes it's an invitation to 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.160
 to play 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.140
 this signal indicates that everything that will follow 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.430
 will be the domain of the game even if he 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.430
 implies attac behaviors 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.450
 it's like when a dog bites his 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.950
 opponent he shakes his head from side to side 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.060
 the other 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.250
 in case the game gets too 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.800
 brutal reverence takes another 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.880
 meaning more than the dog is 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.830
 serves to apologize 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.500
 be right after a little bit of time 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.190
 Too loud as to say I'm sorry 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.260
 to have bit 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.850
 that's partly why he 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.390
 says that dogs have a sense of 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.570
 justice and even morality 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.890
 dogs without discerning good from bad 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.080
 they know it's stomach ache a 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.910
 other animal that it hurts the guest to 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.550
 play and try to mate with him 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.310
 or hurt him 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:05.630
 if he does not respect the rules of the game 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.130
 the game that flatters brand baeckeoffe 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.930
 recognizes the similarities between 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.490
 men and some animals 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.879
 many say we are unique because 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.069
 we are pre-programmed to think but 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.449
 not the blue ones know well somewhere 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.639
 I think it comes from others it's 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.370
 humor yes a moment if we feel 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.169
 emotions them too if we think and also 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.560
 it's a bad biological reasoning 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.560
 to say the opposite 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.700
 the world in which all the 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.360
 animal species is complex and 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.400
 unpredictable 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.840
 animals must be able to 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.050
 react to a changing situation 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.050
 quickly 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.370
 split the type of game best suited to 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.400
 every species of the times of his mode of 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.400
 life 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.950
 for example tab games like 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.100
 the greenhouses the moose where the moose 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.350
 prepare to escape the predators 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.640
 it involves running or jumping this 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.510
 which is helpful to them to avoid being 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.510
 attacked or devoured 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.020
 in carnivores that's what we 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.700
 calls predation games where he 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.920
 practices behaviors that 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.920
 will later serve to hunt and 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.490
 some animals play alone or with 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.500
 objects in general these are species or 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.550
 individuals live alone and 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.140
 do not have the chance to have 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:39.720
 companions of June when he plays the 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.920
 animals look happy and proud they 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.920
 are always looking to play 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.970
 l ex they have nobody with whom to play 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.540
 he runs after when you have fun 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.540
 with an object 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:56.299
 if it was not nice why the 

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:58.089
 drill from the block will explain the game is 

00:06:56.299 --> 00:07:02.239
 important and it's a source of pleasure 

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:03.529
 mixed and to the code the animals have 

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:04.039
 tendency to want to do what is 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:07.329
 pleasant 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.329
 exactly like human beings
