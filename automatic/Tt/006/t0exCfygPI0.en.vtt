 identify the weapons if you can get out 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.590
 this that is the strongest great and 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.020
 here are those of the blocks of 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.060
 protection that is the cheapest how much 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.670
 is worth the protection block of quitate 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:20.310
 king in the carbon cause is worth 10 mi 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.140
 mother of 10 in 10 good 10 15 20 30 50 and 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.160
 there already 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.170
 maybe more an excellent message 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:35.980
 of 10 in 10 10 x 10 x 20 30 x 30 40 x 40 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:40.150
 and 50 with 50 and the most expensive of 100 this is 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.150
 rather in portal 5 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:50.320
 here we have is to say no parachute there 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.780
 if you donate are gay pib or premium 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.480
 can have parachutes when they die 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.200
 they lose inventory they have many 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.430
 privileges and that's how they come here is 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.070
 the parachute that tells them we 're going to 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.520
 see me wait here and nothing more is thrown 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.540
 and right click and today and the parachute and 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.540
 I go straight to the lava 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.930
 As you can see, I did not lose anything because I have the 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.820
 prize 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.150
 and well, I think that would be all that 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.580
 missing for this cause also if you go for 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.539
 get your protection block you have 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.630
 that go to diagonal war store so there by 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.669
 the moment blocks of protection still 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.340
 is in phase as alpha and will continue in 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.280
 alpha phase until until I have my 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.210
 compu returning configuring well today and it 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.620

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.370
 exploded here truth was what you say that 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.270

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.920

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.160
 here is a skull here playing us 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.160
 da moral 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:05:01.280
 look, this is where I think 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.280

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.870
 I put a block protection nobody can 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.870
 touch nobody can do anything 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.910
 that's 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.870
 over here I think I saw a block of 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.700
 protection that was covered to see 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.570
 we also have what is being 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.070
 bosses the bosses will be exposed in 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.870
 random in the world and they have a lot 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.260
 life are powerful heights more 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.350
 legendary and can be found with 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.050
 a compass that is treated to also there 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.460
 they will see in the rules no longer going to 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.470

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.930

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.430
 protection that I tell you is that 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.349

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.729
 as always 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.220
