of need for speed shift need for speed
shift<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:14.040> actually<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.030> 13th<00:00:15.750> game<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.320> the

need<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:16.890> speed<00:00:17.130> series<00:00:17.810> this<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.140> a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
need for speed series this one is a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.080 
need for speed series this one is a
little<00:00:19.470> bit<00:00:19.590> different<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.760> it's

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
little bit different because it's

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.929 
little bit different because it's
developed<00:00:21.539> by<00:00:21.660> slightly<00:00:22.050> mad<00:00:22.260> studios

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
developed by slightly mad studios

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.099 
developed by slightly mad studios
essentially<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.090> decided<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.570> instead<00:00:24.900> of

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
essentially they decided that instead of

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.529 
essentially they decided that instead of
having<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.529> publisher<00:00:26.369> they<00:00:26.939> decided<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
having one publisher they decided to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.750 
having one publisher they decided to
separate<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> development<00:00:28.830> studios<00:00:29.160> for

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
separate the development studios for

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.609 
separate the development studios for
different<00:00:30.150> games<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:30.929> case<00:00:31.170> slightly

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
different games so in this case slightly

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.170 
different games so in this case slightly
mad<00:00:31.769> studios<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.430> making<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.850> particular

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
mad studios is making this particular

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.540 
mad studios is making this particular
need<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.630> speed<00:00:34.050> game<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:35.010> reason<00:00:35.280> they<00:00:35.370> did

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
need for speed game the reason they did

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.069 
need for speed game the reason they did
this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:35.820> previous<00:00:36.540> games<00:00:36.780> had<00:00:36.960> been

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
this is because previous games had been

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.920 
this is because previous games had been
a<00:00:37.110> little<00:00:37.440> lacking<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.489> terms<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.969> how<00:00:39.780> they

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
a little lacking in terms of how they

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.740 
a little lacking in terms of how they
were<00:00:40.340> received<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.579> well<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.300> gameplay

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
were received as well as just gameplay

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.790 
were received as well as just gameplay
overall<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.649> bit

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
overall it was a little bit

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.060 
overall it was a little bit
disappointing<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.500> need<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.890> speed

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
disappointing so this is need for speed

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.639 
disappointing so this is need for speed

over 65 cars with a lot of customization

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.910 
over 65 cars with a lot of customization
choices<00:01:14.130> essentially<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:14.880> change<00:01:15.390> any

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920

attribute you want about your vehicle

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.610 
attribute you want about your vehicle
there's<00:01:20.070> also<00:01:20.250> 18<00:01:20.850> different<00:01:21.030> tracks<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.930> I

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
there's also 18 different tracks and I

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.230 
there's also 18 different tracks and I
have<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.950> say<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.340> courses<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:23.940> pretty

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
have to say the courses are pretty

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.940 
have to say the courses are pretty
accurate<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.440> they<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.770> some

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
accurate with but they have some

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.250 
accurate with but they have some
interesting<00:01:26.330> improvements<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.479> interesting

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
interesting improvements and interesting

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.920 
interesting improvements and interesting
environments<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.369> maybe<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.300> all<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
environments so maybe not all of the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.450 
environments so maybe not all of the
tracks<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.260> one<00:01:31.440> hundred<00:01:31.560> percent<00:01:31.770> accurate

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
tracks of one hundred percent accurate

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.550 
tracks of one hundred percent accurate
to<00:01:32.580> their<00:01:32.729> real-world<00:01:33.000> counterparts<00:01:33.560> but

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
to their real-world counterparts but

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.200 
to their real-world counterparts but
they've<00:01:34.710> basically<00:01:34.920> added<00:01:35.670> some<00:01:35.910> eye<00:01:36.090> candy

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
they've basically added some eye candy

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.700 
they've basically added some eye candy
improvements<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.410> make<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
improvements just to make the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.750 
improvements just to make the
environments<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.520> bit<00:01:38.610> more

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
environments a little bit more

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.060 
environments a little bit more
interesting<00:01:39.330> when<00:01:39.450> you're<00:01:39.600> driving<00:01:39.810> by<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
interesting when you're driving by so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.109 
interesting when you're driving by so
take<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.030> with<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.300> grain<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> salt<00:01:43.910> this<00:01:44.910> game

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
take that with a grain of salt this game

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.090 
take that with a grain of salt this game
is<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.450> focused<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.380> real<00:01:46.830> world

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
is really focused on a real world

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.980

you saw that I gave you guys a quote a

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.400 
you saw that I gave you guys a quote a
racing<00:01:56.880> game<00:01:56.910> built<00:01:57.330> by<00:01:57.509> racers<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.170> racers

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
racing game built by racers for racers

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.740 
racing game built by racers for racers
and<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.369> entirely<00:01:59.970> true<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.600> you're

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and that it's entirely true when you're

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.469 
and that it's entirely true when you're
playing<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> game<00:02:01.729> essentially<00:02:02.729> you're

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
playing this game essentially you're

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.600 
playing this game essentially you're
driving<00:02:04.050> as<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.530> were<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.950> car<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.550> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
driving as if you were in the car so you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.790 
driving as if you were in the car so you
have<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> dynamic<00:02:06.119> cockpit<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.410> can<00:02:07.590> see

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
have a dynamic cockpit you can see

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.669 
have a dynamic cockpit you can see
what's<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.970> glass<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:10.020> crack<00:02:10.350> onto

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
what's going on the glass can crack onto

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.199 
what's going on the glass can crack onto
your<00:02:10.950> windows<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.580> when<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.730> move<00:02:11.880> your<00:02:12.030> head

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
your windows and when you move your head

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.970 
your windows and when you move your head
around<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.570> can<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.720> Oh<00:02:12.870> My<00:02:13.230> Luck<00:02:13.500> window<00:02:13.830> is

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
around you can see Oh My Luck window is

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.970 
around you can see Oh My Luck window is
cracked<00:02:14.130> too<00:02:14.570> so<00:02:15.570> they<00:02:15.720> really<00:02:15.870> tried<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.230> make

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
cracked too so they really tried to make

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.699 
cracked too so they really tried to make
this<00:02:17.220> game<00:02:17.540> feel<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.230> were<00:02:19.410> sitting

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
this game feel as if you were sitting

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.290 
this game feel as if you were sitting
there<00:02:21.170> driving

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
there driving

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.270 
there driving
for<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.960> controlled<00:02:24.380> it's<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.650> nice<00:02:24.800> blend<00:02:25.040> of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
for the controlled it's a nice blend of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.640 
for the controlled it's a nice blend of
arcade<00:02:25.820> controls<00:02:26.330> as<00:02:26.660> well<00:02:26.690> as<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:27.080> real

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
arcade controls as well as a real

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.060 
arcade controls as well as a real
simulator<00:02:28.310> controls<00:02:28.850> so<00:02:29.660> basically<00:02:30.560> anybody

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
simulator controls so basically anybody

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.220 
simulator controls so basically anybody
can<00:02:31.490> play<00:02:31.640> newcomers<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.420> hardcore<00:02:32.840> racing

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
can play newcomers and hardcore racing

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.310 
can play newcomers and hardcore racing
simulator<00:02:33.710> buffs<00:02:34.370> alike<00:02:34.930> but<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:35.990> have<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.290> say

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
simulator buffs alike but I have to say

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.600 
simulator buffs alike but I have to say
I<00:02:36.500> thought<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:36.950> was<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.070> little<00:02:37.190> bit<00:02:37.400> too

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
I thought it was a little bit too

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.340 
I thought it was a little bit too
sensitive<00:02:38.030> particularly<00:02:38.990> when<00:02:39.080> you're<00:02:39.200> using

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
sensitive particularly when you're using

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.900 
sensitive particularly when you're using
the<00:02:39.530> best<00:02:39.860> cars<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.430> you're<00:02:40.520> going<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
the best cars and you're going the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.150 
the best cars and you're going the
fastest<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.780> feel<00:02:42.260> like<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:42.620> just<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.890> little

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
fastest I feel like it's just a little

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.920 
fastest I feel like it's just a little
bit<00:02:43.340> too<00:02:44.110> prone<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.760> oversteering<00:02:46.760> when<00:02:47.090> in

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
bit too prone to oversteering when in

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.600 
bit too prone to oversteering when in
other<00:02:48.170> games<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.650> would<00:02:48.860> not<00:02:49.010> be<00:02:49.250> over

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
other games you would not be over

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.050 
other games you would not be over
steering<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.400> user<00:02:52.940> interface

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
steering the you of the user interface

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.080 
steering the you of the user interface
is<00:02:53.720> pretty<00:02:53.780> good<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:54.440> cut<00:02:54.650> aai<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.550> really

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
is pretty good but cut aai is really

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.080 
is pretty good but cut aai is really
good<00:02:56.450> when<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.260> bump<00:02:57.560> them<00:02:57.770> for<00:02:58.550> instance<00:02:58.880> if

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
good when you bump them for instance if

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.030 
good when you bump them for instance if
you<00:02:59.180> bump<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.570> car<00:02:59.810> they'll<00:03:00.380> bump<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.800> back

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
you bump a car they'll bump you back

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.040 
you bump a car they'll bump you back
I'll<00:03:01.520> try<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.850> fight<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.270> for<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.660> for

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
I'll try to fight you for that for

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.020 
I'll try to fight you for that for
passing<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:04.010> try<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.220> pass<00:03:04.460> them<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.910> know

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
passing you try to pass them you know

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.460 
passing you try to pass them you know
they<00:03:05.060> may<00:03:05.390> try<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.600> cut<00:03:05.840> back<00:03:05.990> in<00:03:06.110> front<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.380> you

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
they may try to cut back in front of you

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.020 
they may try to cut back in front of you
or<00:03:06.650> again<00:03:06.890> bump<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.370> keep<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.730> from<00:03:07.760> doing

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
or again bump you to keep you from doing

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.610 
or again bump you to keep you from doing
that<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.540> think<00:03:09.020> that's<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.230> really<00:03:09.440> good<00:03:09.560> thing

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
that I think that's a really good thing

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.160 
that I think that's a really good thing
to<00:03:09.830> have<00:03:10.070> an<00:03:10.430> aggressive<00:03:10.790> AI<00:03:11.210> that's<00:03:11.930> not<00:03:12.050> to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
to have an aggressive AI that's not to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.410 
to have an aggressive AI that's not to
say<00:03:12.320> it's<00:03:12.350> impossible<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:13.190> win<00:03:13.520> but<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.270> just

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
say it's impossible to win but it just

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.580 
say it's impossible to win but it just
makes<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.750> game<00:03:14.900> more<00:03:15.110> challenging

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
makes the game more challenging

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.410 
makes the game more challenging
depending<00:03:15.710> no<00:03:16.340> matter<00:03:16.520> what<00:03:16.730> level<00:03:17.000> you're<00:03:17.330> at

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
depending no matter what level you're at

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.560 
depending no matter what level you're at
it'll<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:19.130> know<00:03:19.160> just<00:03:19.430> be<00:03:19.670> more<00:03:19.940> fun<00:03:20.210> for<00:03:20.240> you

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
it'll you know just be more fun for you

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.270 
it'll you know just be more fun for you
because<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.410> AI<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.740> a<00:03:21.890> little<00:03:22.160> bit

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
because the AI is a little bit

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.820 
because the AI is a little bit
challenging<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:22.970> harder<00:03:23.660> than<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.020> mindless

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
challenging and harder than the mindless

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.710 
challenging and harder than the mindless
AI<00:03:25.010> we've<00:03:25.850> seen<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.390> other<00:03:26.739> games

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
AI we've seen in other games

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.860 
AI we've seen in other games
now<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.350> way<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.560> we<00:03:30.800> handle<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:32.150> rewards

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
now the way that we handle the rewards

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.250 
now the way that we handle the rewards
for<00:03:33.080> winning<00:03:33.380> games<00:03:33.620> they<00:03:34.220> give<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:34.490> stars<00:03:34.880> as

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
for winning games they give you stars as

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.830 
for winning games they give you stars as
well<00:03:36.260> as<00:03:36.410> money<00:03:36.790> but<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.000> get<00:03:38.300> that<00:03:38.510> for<00:03:38.690> all

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
well as money but you get that for all

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.080 
well as money but you get that for all
races<00:03:39.290> not<00:03:39.500> just<00:03:39.710> in<00:03:39.800> your<00:03:39.890> career<00:03:40.310> mode<00:03:40.580> so

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
races not just in your career mode so

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.910 
races not just in your career mode so
even<00:03:41.480> if<00:03:41.570> you<00:03:41.660> just<00:03:41.690> plain<00:03:42.020> a<00:03:42.050> quick<00:03:42.380> race<00:03:42.620> you

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
even if you just plain a quick race you

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.040 
even if you just plain a quick race you
can<00:03:43.070> actually<00:03:43.190> gain<00:03:43.550> respect<00:03:44.300> experience

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
can actually gain respect experience

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.440 
can actually gain respect experience
whatever<00:03:45.290> as<00:03:45.650> well<00:03:46.160> as<00:03:46.340> cash<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:47.210> you<00:03:47.300> can

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
whatever as well as cash that you can

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.150 
whatever as well as cash that you can
then<00:03:47.600> take<00:03:47.870> directly<00:03:48.320> into<00:03:48.590> your<00:03:48.620> career<00:03:48.950> mode

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
then take directly into your career mode

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.520 
then take directly into your career mode
so<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.700> think<00:03:50.030> that's<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.480> little<00:03:50.570> bit<00:03:50.840> kind<00:03:51.380> of

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
so I think that's a little bit kind of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.770 
so I think that's a little bit kind of
weird<00:03:51.740> because<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.940> kind<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.240> impacts<00:03:53.660> your

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
weird because it kind of impacts your

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.000 
weird because it kind of impacts your
career<00:03:54.080> mode<00:03:54.200> based<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:54.620> something<00:03:54.920> that's

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
career mode based on something that's

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.430 
career mode based on something that's
irrelevant<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:56.300> your<00:03:56.420> career<00:03:56.780> mode<00:03:56.990> so<00:03:57.410> it

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
irrelevant to your career mode so it

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.780 
irrelevant to your career mode so it
just<00:03:57.740> seemed<00:03:57.860> like<00:03:57.890> those<00:03:58.160> two<00:03:58.370> things<00:03:58.550> should

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
just seemed like those two things should

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.280 
just seemed like those two things should
be<00:03:58.820> separated<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.700> again<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.690> get<00:04:02.900> those

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
be separated so you again you get those

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.070 
be separated so you again you get those
two<00:04:03.620> money<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:04.850> stars<00:04:05.270> based<00:04:05.570> on<00:04:05.810> two

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
two money and stars based on two

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.620 
two money and stars based on two
categories<00:04:06.620> precision<00:04:07.220> or<00:04:07.400> aggression<00:04:07.790> so

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
categories precision or aggression so

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.880 
categories precision or aggression so
aggression<00:04:09.020> is<00:04:09.110> if<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.350> bump<00:04:09.620> somebody

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
aggression is if you bump somebody

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.010 
aggression is if you bump somebody
precision<00:04:10.640> is<00:04:10.760> if<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:11.000> can<00:04:11.150> do<00:04:11.270> a<00:04:11.300> clean<00:04:11.690> pass

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
precision is if you can do a clean pass

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.930 
precision is if you can do a clean pass
of<00:04:12.260> somebody<00:04:12.650> that's<00:04:12.709> just<00:04:12.920> one<00:04:13.190> example<00:04:13.220> and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
of somebody that's just one example and

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.349 
of somebody that's just one example and
I<00:04:14.870> think<00:04:15.050> it<00:04:15.320> works<00:04:15.560> pretty<00:04:15.890> nicely<00:04:16.220> but<00:04:17.150> i

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
I think it works pretty nicely but i

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.420 
I think it works pretty nicely but i
think<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.260> money<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:18.709> get<00:04:18.859> from<00:04:19.070> winning

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
think the money you get from winning

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.130 
think the money you get from winning
these<00:04:19.580> different<00:04:19.970> races<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.359> sponsors<00:04:20.930> in

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
these different races and sponsors in

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.380 
these different races and sponsors in
from<00:04:21.830> winning<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.160> races<00:04:22.460> or<00:04:22.640> in<00:04:22.790> sponsorship

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
from winning the races or in sponsorship

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.980 
from winning the races or in sponsorship
deals<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.720> little<00:04:23.990> bit<00:04:24.110> too<00:04:24.320> easy<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.340> again<00:04:26.060> you

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
deals a little bit too easy so again you

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.390 
deals a little bit too easy so again you
get<00:04:27.169> a<00:04:27.200> lot<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.410> money<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:27.740> essentially<00:04:28.310> no

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
get a lot of money so essentially no

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.100 
get a lot of money so essentially no
matter<00:04:28.580> what<00:04:28.850> tier<00:04:29.240> you're<00:04:29.390> on<00:04:29.540> you<00:04:29.780> can<00:04:29.930> just

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
matter what tier you're on you can just

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.260 
matter what tier you're on you can just
buy<00:04:30.290> all<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.560> upgrades<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:31.100> want<00:04:31.340> but<00:04:32.060> at

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
buy all the upgrades you want but at

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.700 
buy all the upgrades you want but at
least<00:04:32.480> it's<00:04:32.660> not<00:04:32.720> frustrating<00:04:33.080> because<00:04:33.560> I

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
least it's not frustrating because I

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.110 
least it's not frustrating because I
played<00:04:33.950> other<00:04:34.100> games<00:04:34.220> who<00:04:34.580> are<00:04:34.669> trying<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:34.970> get

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
played other games who are trying to get

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.120 
played other games who are trying to get
you<00:04:35.600> know<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.840> money<00:04:36.050> or<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.260> reward<00:04:36.740> system

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
you know the money or the reward system

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.920 
you know the money or the reward system
was<00:04:37.310> just<00:04:37.370> too<00:04:37.640> frustrating<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.270> get<00:04:38.419> in<00:04:38.570> you

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
was just too frustrating to get in you

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.340 
was just too frustrating to get in you
never<00:04:39.350> advanced<00:04:39.860> in<00:04:39.950> me<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:41.020> speaking<00:04:42.020> of<00:04:42.110> Tears

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
never advanced in me I speaking of Tears

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.840 
never advanced in me I speaking of Tears
there<00:04:42.530> are<00:04:42.650> four<00:04:42.830> tiers<00:04:43.130> of<00:04:43.190> bars<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.669> there's

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
there are four tiers of bars and there's

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.850 
there are four tiers of bars and there's
plenty<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.270> cars<00:04:44.510> at<00:04:44.690> each<00:04:44.840> level<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.740> can

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
plenty of cars at each level so you can

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.950 
plenty of cars at each level so you can
keep<00:04:46.040> working<00:04:46.430> your<00:04:46.550> way<00:04:46.820> up<00:04:46.850> but<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:47.750> also

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
keep working your way up but I also

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.020 
keep working your way up but I also
noticed<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:48.680> considering<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.640> make<00:04:49.820> so

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
noticed that considering you make so

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.969 
noticed that considering you make so
much<00:04:50.210> money<00:04:50.390> by<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.690> time<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.110> unlock<00:04:51.470> let's

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
much money by the time you unlock let's

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.530 
much money by the time you unlock let's
say<00:04:52.100> you're<00:04:52.250> on<00:04:52.340> tier<00:04:52.580> 2<00:04:52.820> when<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:53.270> unlock

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
say you're on tier 2 when you unlock

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.230 
say you're on tier 2 when you unlock
tier<00:04:53.810> 3<00:04:54.200> it's<00:04:54.950> almost<00:04:55.250> as<00:04:55.460> if<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.729> can<00:04:55.880> just<00:04:55.910> go

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
tier 3 it's almost as if you can just go

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.120 
tier 3 it's almost as if you can just go
and<00:04:56.360> buy<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.570> most<00:04:56.840> expensive<00:04:56.990> car<00:04:57.680> from<00:04:57.890> tier

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
and buy the most expensive car from tier

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.219 
and buy the most expensive car from tier
3<00:04:58.370> just<00:04:58.610> when<00:04:58.700> you<00:04:58.790> start<00:04:58.850> assuming<00:04:59.750> you<00:05:00.140> know

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
3 just when you start assuming you know

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.700 
3 just when you start assuming you know
you<00:05:00.290> play<00:05:01.360> substantially<00:05:02.360> before<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:02.930> gain<00:05:03.350> up

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
you play substantially before to gain up

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.010 
you play substantially before to gain up
to<00:05:03.770> level<00:05:04.220> 3<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:05.240> know<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:05.390> already<00:05:05.600> have

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
to level 3 you know you already have

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.750 
to level 3 you know you already have
that<00:05:06.200> money<00:05:06.470> so<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.950> kind<00:05:07.130> of<00:05:07.190> takes<00:05:07.460> away<00:05:07.580> from

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
that money so it kind of takes away from

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.330 
that money so it kind of takes away from
car<00:05:08.360> collecting<00:05:08.900> in<00:05:09.080> buying<00:05:09.650> maybe<00:05:09.979> not<00:05:10.190> the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
car collecting in buying maybe not the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.980 
car collecting in buying maybe not the
best<00:05:10.370> car<00:05:10.910> but<00:05:11.120> then<00:05:11.240> upgrading<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:11.870> and

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
best car but then upgrading it and

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.499 
best car but then upgrading it and
customizing<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.680> to<00:05:12.830> your<00:05:12.950> own

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
customizing it to your own

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.430 
customizing it to your own
so<00:05:14.509> that's<00:05:14.660> just<00:05:14.720> something<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:15.139> keep<00:05:15.259> in<00:05:15.380> mind

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
so that's just something to keep in mind

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.590 
so that's just something to keep in mind
that's<00:05:16.310> not<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.580> say<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:16.759> can't<00:05:16.880> collect<00:05:17.270> cars

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
that's not to say you can't collect cars

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.260 
that's not to say you can't collect cars
and<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.259> know<00:05:18.380> by<00:05:18.620> as<00:05:18.949> many<00:05:19.250> as<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.610> want<00:05:19.819> but

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
and you know by as many as you want but

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.909 
and you know by as many as you want but
it<00:05:20.389> just<00:05:20.509> kind<00:05:20.750> of<00:05:20.810> takes<00:05:20.870> away<00:05:21.139> your<00:05:21.590> main

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
it just kind of takes away your main

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.469 
it just kind of takes away your main
goal<00:05:22.099> and<00:05:22.220> career<00:05:22.460> mode<00:05:22.669> is<00:05:22.819> to<00:05:22.940> get<00:05:23.060> all<00:05:23.240> the

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
goal and career mode is to get all the

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.140

way<00:05:23.569> up<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.720> tier<00:05:24.080> 4<00:05:24.520> maybe<00:05:25.520> you're<00:05:25.819> not<00:05:25.849> going

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
way up to tier 4 maybe you're not going

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.930 
way up to tier 4 maybe you're not going
to<00:05:26.210> spend<00:05:26.419> that<00:05:26.569> additional<00:05:27.349> time

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
to spend that additional time

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.129 
to spend that additional time
customizing<00:05:28.940> your<00:05:28.970> pimping<00:05:29.389> out<00:05:29.539> your<00:05:29.569> car

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
customizing your pimping out your car

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.320 
customizing your pimping out your car
but<00:05:30.979> as<00:05:31.310> opposed<00:05:31.669> to<00:05:31.759> just<00:05:31.789> buying<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.210> most

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
but as opposed to just buying the most

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.950 
but as opposed to just buying the most
expensive<00:05:32.479> or<00:05:34.419> something<00:05:35.419> like<00:05:35.539> kind<00:05:35.810> I

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
expensive or something like kind I

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.330 
expensive or something like kind I
really<00:05:36.229> like<00:05:36.440> though<00:05:36.650> was<00:05:36.860> that<00:05:36.889> certain

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
really like though was that certain

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.670 
really like though was that certain
races<00:05:37.520> you<00:05:37.849> get<00:05:38.000> invited<00:05:38.240> to<00:05:38.389> you<00:05:39.229> get<00:05:39.530> they

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
races you get invited to you get they

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.200 
races you get invited to you get they
give<00:05:39.889> you<00:05:40.009> a<00:05:40.039> part<00:05:40.400> of<00:05:40.490> use<00:05:40.729> and<00:05:40.970> that's<00:05:41.090> really

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
give you a part of use and that's really

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.180 
give you a part of use and that's really
nice<00:05:41.539> of<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.810> beginning<00:05:42.169> of<00:05:42.319> the<00:05:42.470> game<00:05:42.650> when

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
nice of the beginning of the game when

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.339 
nice of the beginning of the game when
you're<00:05:43.400> stuck<00:05:43.610> with<00:05:43.789> maybe<00:05:44.030> a<00:05:44.120> really<00:05:44.690> low<00:05:45.020> car

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
you're stuck with maybe a really low car

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.080 
you're stuck with maybe a really low car
something<00:05:45.770> that<00:05:46.039> you<00:05:46.190> didn't<00:05:46.400> even<00:05:46.490> customize

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
something that you didn't even customize

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.330 
something that you didn't even customize
yet<00:05:47.419> and<00:05:47.599> you<00:05:47.990> get<00:05:48.139> invited<00:05:48.410> to<00:05:48.590> drive<00:05:49.190> around

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.980 
yet and you get invited to drive around
in<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.610> Lamborghini<00:05:50.180> I<00:05:50.449> think<00:05:50.720> that's<00:05:50.870> a

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
in the Lamborghini I think that's a

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.570 
in the Lamborghini I think that's a
really<00:05:51.289> good<00:05:51.410> way<00:05:51.620> to<00:05:51.680> get<00:05:51.919> you<00:05:52.099> into<00:05:52.340> the

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
really good way to get you into the

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.400 
really good way to get you into the

outside of the race where you were just

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.740 
outside of the race where you were just

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
with this and I've been pretty happy

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.820 
with this and I've been pretty happy
with<00:06:13.280> this<00:06:13.460> game<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.530> remember<00:06:15.530> this<00:06:15.650> may

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
with this game and remember this may

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.230 
with this game and remember this may
take<00:06:16.009> into<00:06:16.250> account<00:06:16.460> that<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.699> didn't<00:06:17.000> load<00:06:17.120> it

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
take into account that I didn't load it

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.370 
take into account that I didn't load it
onto<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.449> hard<00:06:17.750> drive<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.080> it's<00:06:18.199> just

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
onto the hard drive and it's just

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.499 
onto the hard drive and it's just
running<00:06:18.590> off<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:18.710> disk<00:06:19.099> on<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.669> xbox<00:06:20.000> 360

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
running off the disk on the xbox 360

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.350 
running off the disk on the xbox 360
there's<00:06:21.229> a<00:06:21.409> lot<00:06:21.440> of<00:06:21.919> loading<00:06:22.550> in<00:06:22.699> this<00:06:22.880> game<00:06:23.120> I

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
there's a lot of loading in this game I

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.570 
there's a lot of loading in this game I
think<00:06:23.870> there's<00:06:24.440> a<00:06:24.500> lot<00:06:24.680> of<00:06:24.710> slow<00:06:25.099> interim

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
think there's a lot of slow interim

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.060 
think there's a lot of slow interim
action<00:06:26.060> between<00:06:26.690> races<00:06:27.259> when<00:06:27.740> you're<00:06:27.860> trying

to load a new one go to start a course
up<00:06:30.409> and<00:06:30.650> its<00:06:31.490> really<00:06:31.580> a<00:06:31.789> big<00:06:32.090> contrast<00:06:32.719> to<00:06:32.870> the

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
up and its really a big contrast to the

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.260

speedy gameplay that you really want and

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.719 
speedy gameplay that you really want and
expect<00:06:35.710> from<00:06:36.710> a<00:06:36.830> need<00:06:36.979> for<00:06:37.130> speed<00:06:37.310> shifting

expect from a need for speed shifting
the<00:06:38.419> gameplay<00:06:38.870> is<00:06:39.110> really<00:06:39.169> quick<00:06:39.919> when<00:06:40.250> you're

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370
