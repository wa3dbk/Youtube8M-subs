00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
practicing a few advanced maneuvers our

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.680 
practicing a few advanced maneuvers our
first<00:01:31.530> maneuver<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> stall<00:01:32.670> turn<00:01:33.000> which

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
first maneuver is a stall turn which

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.510 
first maneuver is a stall turn which
allows<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> pilot<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.620> quickly<00:01:35.070> turn<00:01:35.250> around

allows the pilot to quickly turn around

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.870 
allows the pilot to quickly turn around
in<00:01:35.730> a<00:01:35.820> small<00:01:36.090> space<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:38.250> execute<00:01:38.730> this

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
in a small space to execute this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
in a small space to execute this
maneuver<00:01:39.360> simply<00:01:39.990> pull<00:01:40.230> up<00:01:40.410> until<00:01:40.800> your

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
maneuver simply pull up until your

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.820 
maneuver simply pull up until your
helicopter<00:01:41.550> stalls<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:42.660> rotate<00:01:43.080> 180

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
helicopter stalls then rotate 180

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.130 
helicopter stalls then rotate 180
degrees<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.729> use<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> momentum<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
degrees and use the momentum of the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.170 
degrees and use the momentum of the
stall<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.920> swoop<00:01:47.130> down<00:01:47.160> in<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.760> opposite

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
stall to swoop down in the opposite

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:57.130 
stall to swoop down in the opposite
direction<00:01:48.800> here's<00:01:49.800> a<00:01:49.860> look<00:01:50.010> from<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:50.370> cockpit
