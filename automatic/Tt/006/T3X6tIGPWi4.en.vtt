00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.720
 1 actually 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.940
 1903 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.220
 France tower is created it was a 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.660
 event sponsored by a newspaper that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.160
 is the car and which has been 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.660
 printed on yellow paper 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 that's why we had the jersey 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.310
 yellow and if we come back even further 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.290
 the Greek cities actually sponsor 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.119
 their athlete a little bit like 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.400
 today the ski resorts 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.910
 as an athlete represents tignes val 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.700
 d'isere 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.290
 at the time it was sparta head so 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.140
 it's very old now it's true 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.400
 that modern sponsorship as it is 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.760
 know today we can say that these 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.350
 years 70-80 globally where we saw 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.470
 truly emerged sponsorship 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470
 athletic 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.090
 today to trends to first 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.710
 strategy trends 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.750
 of business is to integrate the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.280
 sponsorship in the strategy of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.320
 communication ie there is 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.540
 thirty years to sum up sponsorship 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.340
 it was the favorite of the chef 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.690
 of business like sailing one goes 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.040
 take a boat where he likes rugby 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.290
 is rugby business anyway 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.140
 changed a lot more the crisis is 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.300
 by that we do not invest anymore 1 2 3 5 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 millions without being accountable to his 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.750
 business so that's more 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.120
 professional is better integrate the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.580
 business strategy 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.680
 Then there is the naming 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.240
 actually naming it's new 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.979
 at home because we have mans who have 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.229
 given his name to mma who gave his name 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.180
 at the stage of mans now these old 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.130
 in the united states it's been thirty 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.200
 of years that it exists there 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.729
 included on university stadiums 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.500
 so the naming actually new 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.670
 with us not so new as that 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.100
 England but still globally 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.530
 relatively new in europe if we 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.910
 then summarizes the naming is interesting 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.000
 because it's a strike force 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.210
 huge since the name of the stadium is going to be 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.190
 repeated on a retransmission where he 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.840
 do not spend much in football that happens 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.030
 unfortunately we will 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.190
 to have ten twenty thirty forty times the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.760
 name of the stadium welcome to the emirates 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.620
 stadium 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.090
 it's half time the merits it's at 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.920
 to say but you know we're going to have an effect 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.110
 of extremely important repetition so 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.610
 it's something pretty punchy 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.610
 actually for for brands 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.049
 so overall this sports concept that 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.730
 is always done in three stages so it 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.540
 there is a first time we seek to 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.099
 to make known 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.099
 so that's increasing the notoriety 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.900
 of a second time brand we are looking to 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.969
 to be loved 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.349
 so here it's the values the qualities 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.359
 that we associate with the brand 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.680
 and thirdly the goal is still 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.389
 to buy 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.459
 so that's to increase sales so 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.379
 it's always this process always 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.389
 in this sense we can not be bought 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.280
 if we are not known we can not be 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.019
 bought either if we are not liked on 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.790
 can not be loved if we are not known 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.280
 so it's known to buy 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.359
 and then to a fourth value finally not 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.250
 a fourth ball to my fourth 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.959
 objective that parallels the three 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.810
 others that is the internal communication 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.849
 sponsorship is also used to ensure that 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.010
 people be happy in quotation marks goes 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.819
 work there corporate culture 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.819
 it's extremely important 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.200
 risk management and the taking of 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.510
 risk is anyway inherent 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.790
 sports sponsoring and it is inherent to 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.180
 sports so if you do not want to take 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.280
 risk we choose an event is 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.140
 partner of roland garros partner 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.189
 Olympic Games that can still nothing 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.530
 you happen now 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.030
 you do not take the risk of 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.829
 win a lot with that so if you 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.060
 want to take a little more risk or 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.239
 sponsor a team 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.819
 this manchester united sponsor la 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.859
 juventus of paris saint-germain l'om 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.159
 so we can see that was taking a 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.900
 risk that results but it's 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.340
 still not the maximum risk the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.739
 maximum risk is obviously 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.220
 the individual I am sponsor of only one 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.650
 nobody 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.260
 so this person can not be accused 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.389
 of rape like kobe bryant the basketball player 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.859
 and a few years this person can 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.310
 say bad words in a cloakroom to 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.560
 his coach this person can dope 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.409
 and that's not good so we can see 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.079
 that there is a risk on the other hand if he 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.299
 or she is particularly strong and at 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.849
 a particularly positive image 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.289
 it's also the jackpot so I compare 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.269
 it a bit on the stock market there is still 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.010
 one thing to remember is that it takes 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.940
 never make sponsorship for a year or 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.599
 two that's zero because you have to 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.300
 settle 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:31.440
 you have to create notoriety because 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.440
 that we must forget the previous
