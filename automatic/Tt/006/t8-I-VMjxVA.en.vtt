00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
attributes in each category so it just

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.890 
attributes in each category so it just
goes<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.610> show<00:03:37.819> that<00:03:38.000> he<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.150> just<00:03:38.420> incredible

does have 98 sliding and 97 stand tackle
which<00:03:59.209> can<00:03:59.840> be<00:03:59.959> overlooked<00:04:00.410> at<00:04:00.530> times<00:04:00.769> but

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
which can be overlooked at times but

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.199 
which can be overlooked at times but
that's<00:04:01.100> really<00:04:01.310> important<00:04:01.730> for<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:01.880> center

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
that's really important for a center

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.030 
that's really important for a center
defensive<00:04:02.600> mid<00:04:02.750> or<00:04:02.930> even<00:04:03.260> any<00:04:03.440> defensive

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
defensive mid or even any defensive

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.030 
defensive mid or even any defensive
player<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:05.269> only<00:04:05.660> major<00:04:05.900> con<00:04:06.319> that<00:04:06.739> I<00:04:06.769> could

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
player the only major con that I could

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.280 
player the only major con that I could
think<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.430> for<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.209> guy<00:04:08.420> was<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.109> he

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
think of for this guy was that he

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.750 
think of for this guy was that he
doesn't<00:04:09.560> have<00:04:09.620> high<00:04:09.859> to<00:04:09.920> medium<00:04:10.160> work<00:04:10.459> rates

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
doesn't have high to medium work rates

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.940 
doesn't have high to medium work rates
so<00:04:11.359> maybe<00:04:11.780> he<00:04:12.019> might<00:04:12.170> not<00:04:12.319> be<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.590> best<00:04:12.680> fit

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
so maybe he might not be the best fit

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.319 
so maybe he might not be the best fit
for<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.160> center<00:04:13.400> defensive<00:04:13.760> mid<00:04:13.910> made<00:04:14.090> play

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
for the center defensive mid made play

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.819 
for the center defensive mid made play
more<00:04:14.569> in<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.720> center<00:04:14.989> mid<00:04:15.200> position<00:04:15.380> because

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
more in the center mid position because

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.289 
more in the center mid position because
he<00:04:15.950> can<00:04:16.130> drift<00:04:16.370> forward<00:04:16.639> a<00:04:16.760> little<00:04:16.910> bit<00:04:17.090> much

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
he can drift forward a little bit much

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.330 
he can drift forward a little bit much
for<00:04:17.870> center<00:04:18.169> defensive<00:04:18.500> net<00:04:18.620> player<00:04:18.829> but

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
for center defensive net player but

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.860 
for center defensive net player but
overall<00:04:19.639> guys<00:04:19.940> I'm<00:04:20.239> gonna<00:04:20.419> give<00:04:20.570> them<00:04:20.660> a

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
nine-point eight out of 10 rating that's

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.659 
nine-point eight out of 10 rating that's
the<00:04:23.150> only<00:04:23.539> downfall<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.349> if<00:04:24.530> his<00:04:24.710> skill<00:04:25.520> moves

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
the only downfall and if his skill moves

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.100 
the only downfall and if his skill moves
a<00:04:25.760> weak<00:04:25.910> foot<00:04:26.090> were<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.240> bit<00:04:26.419> better<00:04:26.750> he<00:04:26.930> would

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
a weak foot were a bit better he would

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.060 
a weak foot were a bit better he would
get<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.349> 10<00:04:27.530> out<00:04:27.650> of<00:04:27.680> 10

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
but his value for price has to be a 10

but his value for price has to be a 10
out<00:04:30.229> of<00:04:30.260> 10<00:04:30.500> one<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.860> best<00:04:31.099> center
