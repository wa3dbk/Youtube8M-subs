00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.580
 good day to come together for the word 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.629
 Weekly review from 17 02 to death 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.309
 of his knowledge were 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.560
 we start the topics with the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.520
 seventeenth notes and that with one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.800
 bad news for everyone 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.289
 playstation players focusing on the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.210
 GT version may have been pleased 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.869
 will not come for the playstation wgt 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.970
 there was an exclusive wargaming contract with 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.520
 microsoft has completed so 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.360
 either continue to play pc or ex 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.400
 Selling Developer Diary 18 though 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.690
 unfortunately very little and that was there 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.210
 said that the historic ranks of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.240
 Commander biotee right are there 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.270
 There was a 2 doubt if this was the case 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.740
 but is probably right that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.840
 Developer Diary on 19 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.350
 again a bad bad 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.790
 news for all t 34 and lion drivers 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.290
 Unfortunately , one has to say that it is not 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.060
 improved matchmaking for this 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.360
 Both will give as you just from 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.610
 demir 612 and so on and so forth 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.409
 So here the two still come 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.820
 both in 14 battles 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.880
 So please arrange with it 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.049
 Developer Diary on 20.2 the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.700
 Graphic effects are for the old 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.979
 countries no longer added new ones 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.140
 graphic effects that is the old pensioner 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.460
 is, as it were, where we stood now 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 so far probably stay 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.179
 and apple gets it on then slowly 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.329
 the hd model changed 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:35.219
 there is a statistic from vba ticket.at 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.929
 I want to fight you in the nation 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.619
 show it and that was there she 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:44.490
 just seen by every nation there sees 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.929
 you start the USA very strong 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.030
 then back to the three, though 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.090
 then always keep otherwise good 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.069
 level between 60 and 50 which also 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.600
 case is that the usa is the best option 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:58.829
 fighting for nations is eight in the animal 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.869
 area you can see that on the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.670
 the most balanced relationship is thus 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.399
 Here are the nations as possible 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.490
 next and the final light forms in 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.649
 the case unfortunately france at the m14 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.540
 range all the way to even under 40 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.610
 percent together now says you have to 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.530
 to say that vbz is not official 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.700
 wargaming side but a statistic 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.230
 analysis tool 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.120
 but I think if there are many, of course 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.060
 let people walk then you can say 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.400
 that's at least a direction 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.050
 shows where to think about it okay 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.269
 maybe nations battled in the one 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.459
 or other area or one or 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.260
 other nation like german in 5 and 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.860
 6 area rather difficult to play 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.060
 the development team on 21 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.769
 sap has said that the perception of 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.480
 49 tanks and wrong is that this 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.209
 more often end of a team are set 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.769
 since the bed with 412 and not 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.019
 with the statistics of wargaming 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.459
 so you can say here 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.090
 is not the case but as it is 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.310
 so far was used to 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.290
 then the markus shield directly on 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.599
 customer relations europe 21 the topic 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.440
 latencies and packet loss again 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.120
 picked up 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.430
 I do not want to read it all out now 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.680
 but it's nice that wargaming to that 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.310
 theme pings and packet loss something 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.290
 said 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.670
 you can do it all over here again 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.370
 I'll read it to you 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.870
 Of course, below in the video also link 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:31.230
 that you can read the same thing in peace 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.459
 then on 22 wanted was the subject xv 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.040
 taken up again in russia 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.209
 briefly from the assumption that 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.470
 possibly applied the theme expo 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.670
 could be because of what 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.680
 has been written 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.630
 but meanwhile both has become 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.459
 exposed and crystallized 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.430
 that's just the topic 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.590
 forum with you because of this topic 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.319
 the stacks of clubs are still swinging there 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.870
 times much more massive than ours in the EU 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.359
 area and accordingly it is then 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.250
 since no longer allowed the whole to 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.859
 but continue to show course 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.349
 use 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:10.190
 then 122 2 again a hot and 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.410
 hot topic the topic bots in wot 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.700
 and there was in the past weeks 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.450
 and months always the topic times 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.519
 attacked 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.410
 How much is there then and there 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.590
 then they'll pay for it, but then they'll be funny 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.370
 and utopian was with partly to about 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.440
 130000 bots in wot 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.770
 then there is a bot developer at 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.140
 in front of the recker silence stalker reported 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.110
 and had told him something at least 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.840
 the company that has been called there is so 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.310
 has potts up to date and how 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.200
 they sold a lot and there you see 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.490
 they said he was up to date 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.820
 at the time as well written 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.870
 has 133 potts of the company were online and 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.120
 The licenses have not been sold 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.490
 in the five- to six-digit range 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.400
 So if not in the five-digit circle 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.849
 that is, under 9999 that is natural 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.510
 incredibly far from 130,000 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.580
 otherwise had two things 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.909
 further, the theme premium account 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.900
 and lawyers and what goal the bots 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.770
 So you can do that again 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.250
 here in peace also read again 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.930
 the developer diary was published on the 22nd 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.570
 the question asked what changes it 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.610
 on the armor of a class of light 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.020
 Panzer will be there because in 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.640
 the past already one or the other 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.419
 Let's say that we are there with changes 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.280
 allowed to count 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.349
 unfortunately, it was not discussed 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.360
 but it is betrayed in the patchnotes 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.880
 and that is a good transition to 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.580
 last topic to the patch 000 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.469
 there is a possible date called 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.780
 we could do that with it 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:43.500
 calculate that the test server to the patch 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.050
 000 starting from the 6 2014 will go online or 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.330
 around the 6 of course would be nice because 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.530
 It is not far away and you are allowed to 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.010
 We all believe it very much 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.320
 looking forward 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.270
 I hope it comes to me said that it 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.229
 until now only one court that I have to 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.900
 now in the next days and weeks 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.640
 then first compress 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.030
 today it was a little shorter me 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.590
 still hope that you with the 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.610
 Looking back are satisfied if so 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.010
 let me thumbs 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.430
 I would be happy to subscribe to the channel 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:14.010
 thank you very much for future reviews 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.520
 and have a good time until next time 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.520
 Hello
