00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.860
 Toulouse failed to win two 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.360
 matches since eight games and 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.500
 toulousains 11th of the ranking would like 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.590
 to win at home against 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.760
 Valenciennes 19th is sure to be relegated 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.390
 and play in league 2 season 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.580
 next 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.830
 toulouse evolves meaning not said cat very 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.529
 big and aguilar injured side 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.080
 valenciennois waris enza yamissi neri or 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.270
 still get are missing valenciennes 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.760
 would also like to finish his 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.650
 presence in league 1 on something else 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.470
 than a defeat because the northerners are 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.930
 on six consecutive matches losing 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.820
 and it starts badly for them because 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.190
 wissam ben yedder opens the scoring at the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.170
 half hour of play 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.780
 perfect center of martine bres white and 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.400
 ben eliezer who scored his 14th goal of 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.170
 the toulouse season which insist with 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.869
 a new interesting possibility 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.690
 compresses white and the penalty spot 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.769
 appointed by alexandre castro the fault 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.769
 on the Danish player 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.259
 liszt and rose prevent him from getting up 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.679
 the new goal possibilities for 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.450
 Toulouse is signed penile r of course 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.299
 just before returning to the locker room 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:32.619
 already a doubled and a 15th goal of the 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:34.299
 season for ben yedder toulouse did 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.469
 won only 2 points out of the six 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.289
 last matches but it's gone 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:42.549
 for this valencian encounter had 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:48.849
 struggling to recover from this doubled to the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:50.679
 half time it's good of 0 to return from 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.619
 cloakroom is better for the team 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.789
 of ariel jacobs with this attack 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.789
 extremely fast 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.909
 the possibility of strikes is 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.479
 interesting 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.189
 a shot on the crossbar the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.420
 new intentions of Valenciennes 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.579
 are there no success for da 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.480
 silva maybe a little bit more about 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:21.190
 the next action with arthur masuaku 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.639
 for the center and the recovery of the head 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.500
 of anthony the tallec 87th minute the 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.480
 gap reduction second goal of the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.310
 season for tallec who has long 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.630
 been injured 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.049
 there are more than two goals 1 for the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.049
 tfc 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:45.190
 but toulouse has the resource then 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.680
 that valenciennes has said equalize good 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.810
 balloon recovered by the Toulouse and 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.150
 the ideal service of lausanne did this 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.460
 than at the match for wissam ben yedder who 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.780
 gets a hat-trick in stoppage time 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.880
 92nd minute 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.860
 it's 3 goals to 1 for Toulouse 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.750
 wins the match and ben yadir who 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.790
 scored his 16th goal of the season 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.310
 He is the second-leading scorer of the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.780
 ex-aequo championship with gignac 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.030
 cavani kalou and aboubakar toulouse 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.860
