favorite<00:01:03.750> thing<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.140> site<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
favorite thing about the site is that

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.679 
favorite thing about the site is that
all<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.489> models<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> looks<00:01:06.540> are

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
all the models and all the looks are

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.910 
all the models and all the looks are
really<00:01:06.869> fashionable<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.680> they're<00:01:07.830> not

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
really fashionable but they're not

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
really fashionable but they're not
unwearable<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.240> guess<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> only<00:01:09.659> real

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
unwearable because I guess the only real

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.289 
unwearable because I guess the only real
issue<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:11.430> high<00:01:11.640> fashion<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
issue with really high fashion is that

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.789 
issue with really high fashion is that
most<00:01:12.840> people<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.229> couldn't<00:01:13.560> wear<00:01:13.650> that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
most people really couldn't wear that

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.050 
most people really couldn't wear that
every<00:01:14.040> day<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.460> most<00:01:14.700> body<00:01:14.970> types

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.960 
but it's also stretchy which is nice for
girls<00:02:27.010> if<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.160> have<00:02:27.190> like<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.430> smaller<00:02:27.700> wrist

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
girls if you have like a smaller wrist

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.790 
girls if you have like a smaller wrist
like<00:02:28.150> me<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.510> lot<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.140> bigger<00:02:29.320> bangles<00:02:29.710> or

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
like me a lot of bigger bangles or

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.960 
like me a lot of bigger bangles or
normal<00:02:30.100> size<00:02:30.220> they<00:02:30.430> know<00:02:30.550> they<00:02:30.700> tend<00:02:30.850> to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
normal size they know they tend to

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.370 
normal size they know they tend to
actually<00:02:31.120> fall<00:02:31.510> off<00:02:31.690> my<00:02:31.900> wrist<00:02:32.050> which<00:02:32.260> is

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
actually fall off my wrist which is

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.510 
actually fall off my wrist which is
another<00:02:32.560> reason<00:02:32.740> why<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:32.980> keep<00:02:33.130> them<00:02:33.310> on<00:02:33.400> my

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
another reason why I keep them on my

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.220 
another reason why I keep them on my
upper<00:02:33.760> arm<00:02:33.910> instead<00:02:34.300> but<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.020> one's

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
upper arm instead but this one's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.570 
upper arm instead but this one's
actually<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> little<00:02:35.710> bit<00:02:35.890> smaller<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.400> so

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
actually a little bit smaller and so

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.680 
actually a little bit smaller and so
that<00:02:36.700> what<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.820> can<00:02:37.030> put<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.570> take<00:02:37.660> it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
that what you can put it on and take it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.540 
that what you can put it on and take it
off<00:02:37.870> easily<00:02:38.170> but<00:02:38.470> when<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.130> your<00:02:39.160> skin
