00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.350
 so come on let's start doing 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.330
 this recipe that was a marvel 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.010
 Okay, let's start then that our 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.900
 recipe, remembering that all 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.940
 ingredients is here in the description of 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.399
 video on youtube and remembering that one of the 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.070
 ingredients of this recipe is the gil act 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.020

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.520
 I can eat a recipe and I eat it, I know 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.100
 how it works in the end is a 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.840
 Little thing is easy so let's go 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.840
 the first step in revenue is that 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.539
 put the condensed milk in the pan 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.350
 along with butter so let's go there 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.350
 put the condensed milk 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.649
 we put the butter 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.100
 here we will put our 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:22.720
 and milk there, and then we 'll do it 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.700
 call the staff here 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.310
 our quarrel with him is our intention not to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.670
 It is then the low fire and it is that you go 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.799
 Do you'll mix it over and over until 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.600
 from that point of Brigadeiro with which the 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.119
 Lipo belly landing 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.950
 The bottom of the pan is good so I'll stir 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.580
 until I get to the point where I'm going 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.320
 show you 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.689
 the staff after a few minutes in the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.820
 fire is with this texture okay will stay the 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.939
 Our Brigadier is also well 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.860
 O firm and there is now time to roll I 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.630
 I took out the pot and put it on the spot to 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.860
 not be in danger of being burned if I had 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.780
 Left here to show the breasts 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.180
 would probably burn but it is 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.670
 exactly as it was and now 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.960
 I'll wait a little bit cool 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.850
 We can coil and make our own 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.820
 milk boilers nest as screen 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.950

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.780
 It soon gives a lot in the hands so we give 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.390

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.130
