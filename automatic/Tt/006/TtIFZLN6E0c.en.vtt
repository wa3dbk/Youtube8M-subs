00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 I believe that the most exterior is a team 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.820
 with a coach who has a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.050
 really competitive philosophy is a 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.810
 a very winning coach 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.620
 and that has taught them what they do not 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.500
 have they have the virtue 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.210
 that maybe without playing a game 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.690
 splendid that they expected him to win at 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.370
 trantran and I do not think that the 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.380
 eliminatory is decided in the bernabéu 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.480
 and then with some advantage has the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.280
 Manchester because the second game are 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.200
 the work but the madrid is 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.450
 perfectly trained to draw a 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.330
 result to see there is no longer so 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.640
 great as is the liverpool and just 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.440
 renewed so I hope you stay 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.180
 for a long time there with the message 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.270
 I asked him how was the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.739
 operation now to wait for it 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.920
 recover well and as soon as possible 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.670
 with us 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.730
 there is not much that can be done he 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.989
 take well now what you have to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.100
 to consider is a rapid recovery of 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.420
 and especially a second recovery 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.799
 What is it 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.229
 good at the end is our tool 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.900
 of work and you have to take care of it is a 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.020
 advance porter and of course have a 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.020
 level 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.040
 very high to play in real madrid 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.870
 so surprise why they signed fast 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.130
 to a goalkeeper but no surprise because 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.750
 out diego not much less because it has 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.820
 and is perfectly trained to 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.490
 do it but the substitutions never 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.610
 motivating maybe they can be a touch of 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.610
 Attention 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.150
 good 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.760
 I believe there are many ways to give 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.860
 touches of attention does not surprise me 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.020
 because it is the barcelona that is the best 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.460
 team of the world at the moment the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.850
 counted in circles or for that I have 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.140
 contract in 2016 and of course I am a 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.390
 tremendously winning person I want 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.450
 win and what I'm dealing with right now is 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.030
 and match by match and win what the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.470
 Barça is a team made before is the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.820
 best team in the world I was there in 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.860
 what it means to me they shaped me like 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.180
 person and as a footballer and it's a 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.210
 magnificent club that does not escape 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.210
 no one
