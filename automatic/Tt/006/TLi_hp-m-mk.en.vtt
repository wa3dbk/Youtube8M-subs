I could get a chance to talk with you
about<00:00:15.209> the<00:00:15.509> peril<00:00:15.959> flip<00:00:16.199> versus<00:00:16.710> chaos

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
about the peril flip versus chaos

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.460 
about the peril flip versus chaos
discussion<00:00:17.609> because<00:00:17.849> as<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.420> understand<00:00:18.869> you

discussion because as I understand you
were<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.189> first<00:00:20.400> person<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.759> develop<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
were the first person to develop the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.569 
were the first person to develop the
chaos<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.960> well<00:00:22.890> tell<00:00:23.189> us<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.340> little<00:00:23.430> bit

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:23.579 
chaos and well tell us a little bit

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.999 
chaos and well tell us a little bit
about<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.000> story<00:00:24.210> what<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> chaos<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.770> in

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
about the story what the chaos is in

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.729 
about the story what the chaos is in
your<00:00:26.310> opinion<00:00:26.720> basically<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.109> chaos<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.590> was

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
your opinion basically the chaos I was

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.470 
your opinion basically the chaos I was
trying<00:00:29.040> to<00:00:29.099> think<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:29.669> time<00:00:29.879> what<00:00:30.239> was<00:00:30.329> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
trying to think at the time what was the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
trying to think at the time what was the
most<00:00:30.629> complicated<00:00:31.279> controlled<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.460> new

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
most complicated controlled in the new

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.279 
most complicated controlled in the new
variety<00:00:32.969> live<00:00:33.469> and<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.800> chaos<00:00:35.270> basically

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
variety live and the chaos basically

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.290 
variety live and the chaos basically
starts<00:00:37.289> with<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> pair<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> wedding<00:00:38.129> flip<00:00:38.460> but

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
starts with a pair of wedding flip but

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.180 
starts with a pair of wedding flip but
it's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.570> rotation<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> pure<00:00:40.620> wedding<00:00:40.920> flip

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
it's a rotation of a pure wedding flip

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
it's a rotation of a pure wedding flip
so<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> pre-wedding<00:00:43.260> flip

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
so it's it's a it's a pre-wedding flip

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.500 
so it's it's a it's a pre-wedding flip
I'm<00:00:43.829> much<00:00:44.070> more<00:00:44.280> complicated<00:00:44.850> than<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.360> pair

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
I'm much more complicated than the pair

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.700 
I'm much more complicated than the pair
wedding<00:00:45.720> flip<00:00:45.870> whereas<00:00:46.110> nowadays<00:00:46.230> most

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
wedding flip whereas nowadays most

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.130 
wedding flip whereas nowadays most
people<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.970> faster<00:00:48.660> wedding<00:00:48.900> flip

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
people they see at a faster wedding flip

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.870 
people they see at a faster wedding flip
especially<00:00:49.739> low<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.250> call<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> chaos

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
especially low they call it a chaos

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.520 
especially low they call it a chaos
right<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.810> those<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.110> quite<00:00:52.320> different

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
right and those are quite different

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.270 
right and those are quite different
things<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.720> pure<00:00:55.290> wedding<00:00:55.560> flip<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.070> where

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
things so a pure wedding flip is where

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.460 
things so a pure wedding flip is where
the<00:00:56.550> helicopter<00:00:57.149> does<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> pirouette<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
the helicopter does a pirouette and the

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.010 
the helicopter does a pirouette and the
disc<00:00:58.800> flips<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.850> direction<00:01:00.030> away<00:01:00.540> from<00:01:00.780> or

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
disc flips in one direction away from or

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.479 
disc flips in one direction away from or
towards<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.500> hub<00:01:01.620> pilot<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.010> whatever<00:01:02.220> to

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
towards the hub pilot or whatever to

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.819 
towards the hub pilot or whatever to
give<00:01:02.610> an<00:01:02.700> actually<00:01:03.000> right<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.439> chaos

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
give an actually right and and the chaos

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.160 
give an actually right and and the chaos
is<00:01:05.129> where<00:01:05.399> correct<00:01:06.240> me<00:01:06.329> if<00:01:06.420> I'm<00:01:06.540> wrong<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:07.020> as

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
is where correct me if I'm wrong but as

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.499 
is where correct me if I'm wrong but as
I<00:01:07.259> understand<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> every<00:01:08.460> flip<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.090> changes

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
I understand it every flip it changes

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.030 
I understand it every flip it changes
their<00:01:09.630> orientation<00:01:10.259> so<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.890> would

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
their orientation so that you would

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.859 
their orientation so that you would
start<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.610> away<00:01:11.939> from<00:01:12.149> yourself<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.719> then

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
start like away from yourself and then

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510 
start like away from yourself and then
it<00:01:12.960> would<00:01:13.079> go<00:01:13.170> sideways<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.280> toward

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it would go sideways and then in toward

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
it would go sideways and then in toward
yourself<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.210> sideways<00:01:15.479> basically

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
yourself and then sideways basically

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.050 
yourself and then sideways basically
yeah<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> mean<00:01:16.740> first<00:01:17.249> to<00:01:17.429> be<00:01:17.549> able<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
yeah I mean first to be able to do a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.669 
yeah I mean first to be able to do a
cache<00:01:18.359> you<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.749> to<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.959> able<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.289> it<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> do

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
cache you have to be able to do it to do

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.169 
cache you have to be able to do it to do
a<00:01:19.709> controlled<00:01:20.249> peer<00:01:20.520> letting<00:01:20.759> flip<00:01:20.999> on<00:01:21.149> a

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
a controlled peer letting flip on a

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.270 
a controlled peer letting flip on a
given<00:01:21.479> axis<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:22.079> other<00:01:22.200> words<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.859> should<00:01:22.889> see

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
given axis in other words you should see

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.919 
given axis in other words you should see
a<00:01:23.310> peer<00:01:23.579> wedding<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> disc<00:01:24.389> simply

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
a peer wedding and the disc simply

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.980 
a peer wedding and the disc simply
rotate<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.649> you<00:01:25.770> took<00:01:25.889> a<00:01:26.270> plate<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.509> rotate

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
rotate like you took a plate and rotate

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.830 
rotate like you took a plate and rotate
it<00:01:28.139> in<00:01:28.319> front<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.679> you<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> given<00:01:29.399> axis<00:01:30.359> this

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it in front of you on a given axis this

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.959 
it in front of you on a given axis this
way<00:01:31.049> you'll<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> pirouettes<00:01:32.459> while<00:01:32.789> it's

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
way you'll do the pirouettes while it's

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.090 
way you'll do the pirouettes while it's
doing<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.899> axis<00:01:34.319> without

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
doing it that on that axis without

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.769 
doing it that on that axis without
without<00:01:35.579> wobbling<00:01:36.029> around<00:01:36.359> or<00:01:36.630> doing

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:36.779 
without wobbling around or doing

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:38.929 
without wobbling around or doing
something<00:01:36.959> else<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.889> discus<00:01:38.670> turns

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
something else that that discus turns

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.669 
something else that that discus turns
then<00:01:39.569> what<00:01:39.719> you<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.929> is<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.109> take<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.499> and<00:01:40.590> you

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
then what you do is you take it and you

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.129 
then what you do is you take it and you
rotate<00:01:41.069> this<00:01:41.249> axis<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.849> it<00:01:41.969> starts<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.599> then

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
rotate this axis so it starts here then

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.169 
rotate this axis so it starts here then
it's<00:01:43.319> here<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.549> all<00:01:44.819> the<00:01:45.119> way

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
it's here then it's here all the way

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.120 
it's here then it's here all the way
around<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.539> you're<00:01:45.749> if<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.469> reset<00:01:46.859> on<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
around so you're if you reset on the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
around so you're if you reset on the
nose<00:01:47.310> every<00:01:47.579> time<00:01:47.759> its<00:01:48.060> level<00:01:48.389> the<00:01:48.719> nose<00:01:48.959> first

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
nose every time its level the nose first

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.289 
nose every time its level the nose first
comes<00:01:49.499> here<00:01:49.889> then<00:01:50.249> the<00:01:50.399> nose<00:01:50.520> comes<00:01:50.759> over<00:01:50.939> here

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
comes here then the nose comes over here

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.669 
comes here then the nose comes over here
and<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.569> nose<00:01:51.719> come<00:01:51.869> over<00:01:52.109> here<00:01:52.319> then<00:01:52.560> it

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
and the nose come over here then it

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:53.989 
and the nose come over here then it
comes<00:01:52.829> towards<00:01:53.219> you<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.639> comes<00:01:53.819> slightly

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
comes towards you then it comes slightly

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.789 
comes towards you then it comes slightly
to<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.270> side<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:54.749> it<00:01:54.840> goes<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.380> right

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
to your side then it goes to the right

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.190 
to your side then it goes to the right
then<00:01:56.069> it<00:01:56.099> goes<00:01:56.310> forward<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.539> that<00:01:57.779> it's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
then it goes forward and that that it's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.989 
then it goes forward and that that it's
a<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.709> controlled<00:01:59.099> pirouette<00:01:59.639> as<00:01:59.819> you

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
a it's a controlled pirouette as you

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.510 
a it's a controlled pirouette as you
face<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.539> basically<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.919> again<00:02:02.279> most<00:02:02.459> people

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
face it basically and again most people

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.980 
face it basically and again most people
just<00:02:02.789> kind<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.060> do<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.179> curly<00:02:03.419> flap<00:02:03.630> motion

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
just kind of do a curly flap motion

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.559 
just kind of do a curly flap motion
which<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.859> basics<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.639> a<00:02:05.909> chaos<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.479> it

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
which is the basics of a chaos but it

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.990 
which is the basics of a chaos but it
isn't<00:02:06.779> take<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.020> house<00:02:07.550> great<00:02:08.550> well<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.759> have

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
isn't take a house great well I have

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.339 
isn't take a house great well I have
enough<00:02:09.239> trouble<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.720> pirouetting<00:02:10.140> flip

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
enough trouble with the pirouetting flip

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.470 
enough trouble with the pirouetting flip
I<00:02:10.470> feel<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.830> I've<00:02:11.009> come<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.760> long<00:02:11.819> way<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.180> to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
I feel like I've come a long way just to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.720 
I feel like I've come a long way just to
get<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.860> chaos<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.400> something

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
get to there but the chaos is something

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.880 
get to there but the chaos is something
that<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:14.910> finally<00:02:15.599> feel<00:02:15.989> like<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.230> understand

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
that I finally feel like I understand

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.260 
that I finally feel like I understand
what<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.160> now<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.819> do<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> barrel

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
what it is now that I can do a barrel

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.810 
what it is now that I can do a barrel
flip<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.200> how<00:02:19.830> would<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> even<00:02:20.430> go

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
flip but it's like how would I even go

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.160 
flip but it's like how would I even go
about<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.270> do<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.600> know<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.900> any<00:02:21.990> other

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
about that do you know of any other

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.650 
about that do you know of any other
pilots<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.740> can<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> true

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
pilots that can do a true

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.730 
pilots that can do a true
and<00:02:23.960> have<00:02:24.800> who<00:02:25.580> have<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.820> seen<00:02:26.090> do<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.420> I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
and have who have you seen do that I

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.050 
and have who have you seen do that I
actually<00:02:27.740> haven't<00:02:28.040> seen<00:02:28.160> any<00:02:28.520> other<00:02:28.550> pilots

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
actually haven't seen any other pilots

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.640 
actually haven't seen any other pilots
really<00:02:29.360> out<00:02:29.510> there<00:02:29.720> doing<00:02:30.050> true<00:02:30.260> chaos

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
really out there doing true chaos

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.890 
really out there doing true chaos
consistently<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.460> at<00:02:32.000> one<00:02:32.180> time<00:02:32.450> can<00:02:32.600> do<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.840> I

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
consistently I at one time can do it I

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.660 
consistently I at one time can do it I
can't<00:02:33.110> even<00:02:33.170> do<00:02:33.320> it<00:02:33.380> today<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.370> sat<00:02:34.580> out

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
can't even do it today if I sat out

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.070 
can't even do it today if I sat out
there<00:02:34.790> today<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.030> try<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.330> do<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.690> get<00:02:35.960> a

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
there today and try to do it I get a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.500 
there today and try to do it I get a
little<00:02:36.550> fazed<00:02:37.550> Roenick<00:02:38.120> although<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:38.420> have

little fazed Roenick although you have
trouble<00:02:38.810> as<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.260> comes<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.770> can<00:02:39.950> do<00:02:40.100> about

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
trouble as it comes and I can do about

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.820 
trouble as it comes and I can do about
80%<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:41.900> as<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.140> nose<00:02:42.290> comes<00:02:42.560> straight

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
80% of it but as the nose comes straight

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.360 
80% of it but as the nose comes straight
at<00:02:43.010> me

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
at me

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.460 
at me
I<00:02:43.400> have<00:02:43.880> trouble<00:02:44.120> continuing<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.930> go<00:02:45.080> and

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
I have trouble continuing to go and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.070 
I have trouble continuing to go and
continue<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.010> have<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.250> face<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.460> my<00:02:46.760> right<00:02:47.080> a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
continue to have it face to my right a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.290 
continue to have it face to my right a
little<00:02:48.650> practice<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.190> can<00:02:49.310> do<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.520> again<00:02:49.730> but<00:02:49.970> I

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
little practice I can do it again but I

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.360 
little practice I can do it again but I
can't<00:02:50.870> even<00:02:51.050> do<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.170> on<00:02:51.350> call<00:02:51.890> someone<00:02:52.220> asked

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
can't even do it on call someone asked

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.710 
can't even do it on call someone asked
me<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.520> do<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.820> wouldn't<00:02:53.210> be<00:02:53.330> able<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.540> full

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
me to do it I wouldn't be able to a full

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.020 
me to do it I wouldn't be able to a full
one<00:02:53.870> without<00:02:54.590> practice<00:02:54.950> no<00:02:55.580> one<00:02:55.730> else<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:55.970> know

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
one without practice no one else I know

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.700 
one without practice no one else I know
of<00:02:56.300> again<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.050> part<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.380> problem<00:02:57.620> is

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
of again the part of the problem is

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.990 
of again the part of the problem is
you're<00:02:57.830> usually<00:02:58.040> Show<00:02:58.400> pilots<00:02:58.580> you're<00:02:58.940> out

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
you're usually Show pilots you're out

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.520 
you're usually Show pilots you're out
there<00:02:59.150> trying<00:02:59.240> to<00:02:59.360> impress<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.780> crowd<00:02:59.960> crowd

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
there trying to impress the crowd crowd

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.170 
there trying to impress the crowd crowd
has<00:03:00.620> no<00:03:00.740> clue<00:03:00.950> what<00:03:01.160> you're<00:03:01.250> doing<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:02.060> the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
has no clue what you're doing so the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.730 
has no clue what you're doing so the
fact<00:03:02.240> is<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.600> true<00:03:02.900> Kaos<00:03:03.260> are<00:03:03.560> just

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
fact is you a true Kaos are just

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.840 
fact is you a true Kaos are just
parroting<00:03:04.070> flip<00:03:04.280> they<00:03:04.520> don't<00:03:04.670> know<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
parroting flip they don't know the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.090 
parroting flip they don't know the
difference<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.810> usually<00:03:06.320> pays<00:03:06.500> off<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.800> no

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
difference so it usually pays off to no

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.350 
difference so it usually pays off to no
one<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.460> sit<00:03:07.610> there<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.790> really<00:03:07.970> really<00:03:08.210> learn

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
one to sit there and really really learn

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.030 
one to sit there and really really learn
it<00:03:08.570> other<00:03:09.020> than<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.410> show<00:03:09.560> off<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.890> other

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
it other than the show off to the other

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.300 
it other than the show off to the other
top<00:03:10.400> pilots<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.000> can<00:03:11.150> actually<00:03:11.270> do<00:03:11.510> this

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
top pilots that I can actually do this

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.640 
top pilots that I can actually do this
well<00:03:13.310> thank<00:03:13.520> you<00:03:13.610> for<00:03:13.760> your<00:03:13.880> time<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.650> thank

you for clarifying this because I feel

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.240 
you for clarifying this because I feel
like<00:03:17.330> it's<00:03:17.480> something<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.650> term<00:03:18.890> Kaos

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
like it's something that the term Kaos

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.770 
like it's something that the term Kaos
has<00:03:19.430> been<00:03:19.580> overused<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.210> little<00:03:20.390> bit<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.690> I'd

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
has been overused a little bit and I'd

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.270 
has been overused a little bit and I'd
like<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.080> see<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.320> come<00:03:21.470> back<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.950> maybe<00:03:22.100> even

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
like to see it come back and maybe even

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.740 
like to see it come back and maybe even
see<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.910> mean<00:03:23.210> I<00:03:23.270> don't<00:03:23.360> know<00:03:23.480> if<00:03:23.570> it'd<00:03:23.690> be

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
see I mean I don't know if it'd be

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.880 
see I mean I don't know if it'd be
possible<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:24.290> see<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.530> get<00:03:24.680> into<00:03:24.800> the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
possible to see it get into the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.040 
possible to see it get into the
competition<00:03:25.100> world<00:03:25.670> again<00:03:25.940> but<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.660> challenge

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
competition world again but to challenge

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.200 
competition world again but to challenge
pilots<00:03:27.710> with<00:03:27.890> what<00:03:28.250> is<00:03:28.400> probably<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.880> hardest

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
pilots with what is probably the hardest

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.850 
pilots with what is probably the hardest
maneuver<00:03:29.570> I've<00:03:29.660> ever<00:03:29.900> seen<00:03:30.140> would<00:03:30.350> be<00:03:30.440> awesome

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
maneuver I've ever seen would be awesome

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.950 
maneuver I've ever seen would be awesome
so<00:03:30.890> well<00:03:31.520> yeah<00:03:31.670> even<00:03:32.060> now<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.180> mean<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.450> now

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
so well yeah even now I mean the now

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.660 
so well yeah even now I mean the now
there's<00:03:33.500> other<00:03:33.650> elements<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.160> can<00:03:34.190> add<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.580> it

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
there's other elements you can add to it

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.580 
there's other elements you can add to it
you<00:03:34.760> can<00:03:34.880> also<00:03:35.030> add<00:03:35.330> chaos<00:03:35.840> reversals<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:36.500> in

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
you can also add chaos reversals so in

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
you can also add chaos reversals so in
the<00:03:36.650> middle<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:36.920> reversing<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.400> pirouette

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
the middle you reversing the pirouette

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.340 
the middle you reversing the pirouette
direction<00:03:38.000> while<00:03:38.180> you're<00:03:38.360> phasing<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:39.200> could

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
direction while you're phasing you could

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.960 
direction while you're phasing you could
even<00:03:39.470> have<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.770> where<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.010> phase<00:03:40.280> based

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
even have it where you phase based

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.760 
even have it where you phase based
partially<00:03:41.210> one<00:03:41.450> way<00:03:41.570> face<00:03:41.780> back<00:03:41.990> faced<00:03:42.380> half

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
partially one way face back faced half

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.830 
partially one way face back faced half
face<00:03:43.100> back<00:03:43.340> but<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.790> know<00:03:43.910> there's<00:03:44.510> all<00:03:44.630> kinds

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
face back but you know there's all kinds

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.270 
face back but you know there's all kinds
of<00:03:44.900> other<00:03:44.990> elements<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.560> can<00:03:45.680> add<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.070> now

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
of other elements you can add to it now

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.610 
of other elements you can add to it now
also<00:03:46.520> you<00:03:47.480> can<00:03:47.600> even<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.990> middle<00:03:48.230> flit

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
also you can even in the middle flit

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.380 
also you can even in the middle flit
have<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:49.160> roll<00:03:49.370> or<00:03:49.520> flip<00:03:49.760> so<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.060> actually

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
have a roll or flip so it actually

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.510 
have a roll or flip so it actually
changes<00:03:50.690> now<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.930> direction<00:03:51.290> in<00:03:51.710> mid<00:03:52.070> flip<00:03:52.310> in

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
changes now the direction in mid flip in

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.820 
changes now the direction in mid flip in
mid<00:03:53.030> chaos<00:03:53.330> so<00:03:53.570> there's<00:03:54.080> other<00:03:54.230> elements<00:03:54.470> on

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
mid chaos so there's other elements on

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.730 
mid chaos so there's other elements on
top<00:03:55.130> of<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.490> can<00:03:55.610> add<00:03:55.760> as<00:03:55.910> well<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:57.410> for

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
top of it you can add as well so for

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.500 
top of it you can add as well so for
competition<00:03:58.280> maneuver<00:03:58.550> you<00:03:58.820> can<00:03:58.880> get<00:03:59.150> kind<00:03:59.480> of

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
competition maneuver you can get kind of

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.720 
competition maneuver you can get kind of
ridiculous<00:03:59.930> with<00:04:00.080> it<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.920> with<00:04:01.100> with<00:04:01.459> vent

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
ridiculous with it and with with vent

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.760 
ridiculous with it and with with vent
with<00:04:01.990> experienced<00:04:02.990> judges<00:04:03.290> they'll<00:04:03.590> be<00:04:03.709> able

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
with experienced judges they'll be able

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.369 
with experienced judges they'll be able
to<00:04:03.920> tell<00:04:04.070> if<00:04:04.160> you're<00:04:04.250> doing<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.490> around

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
to tell if you're doing it around
