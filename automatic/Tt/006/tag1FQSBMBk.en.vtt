00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
weak foot so you can put it on either

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.030 
weak foot so you can put it on either
foot<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.060> feel<00:01:46.060> comfortable<00:01:46.390> taking<00:01:47.380> on<00:01:47.770> the

foot and feel comfortable taking on the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.310 
foot and feel comfortable taking on the
shot<00:01:48.340> his<00:01:48.880> finesse<00:01:49.330> shooting<00:01:49.780> was<00:01:49.930> as<00:01:50.110> you'd

I<00:02:23.560> found<00:02:23.860> his<00:02:24.040> crossing<00:02:24.580> was<00:02:25.120> fine<00:02:25.450> he<00:02:25.780> did<00:02:25.989> put

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
I found his crossing was fine he did put

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.009

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
it on webex head a couple of times but

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.220 
it on webex head a couple of times but
the<00:02:29.470> main<00:02:29.739> thing<00:02:30.159> about<00:02:30.940> his<00:02:31.180> passing<00:02:31.480> was<00:02:31.780> his

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the main thing about his passing was his

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.140 
the main thing about his passing was his
three<00:02:32.590> balls<00:02:32.799> he<00:02:33.069> could<00:02:33.280> slip<00:02:33.580> them<00:02:33.819> through

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
three balls he could slip them through

young<00:02:46.930> as<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.260> swap<00:02:47.590> those<00:02:47.799> two<00:02:48.069> around<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.840> yes

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
young as I swap those two around and yes

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.869 
young as I swap those two around and yes
he's<00:02:50.079> a<00:02:50.110> high<00:02:50.379> rated<00:02:50.739> player<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.220> his<00:02:51.310> passing

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
he's a high rated player to his passing

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.899 
he's a high rated player to his passing
his<00:02:52.030> quality<00:02:52.540> will<00:02:52.810> stand<00:02:53.140> out<00:02:53.409> but<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.680> doubt

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
his quality will stand out but I doubt

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.210 
his quality will stand out but I doubt
he'd<00:02:54.909> feel<00:02:55.510> overshadowed<00:02:56.319> in<00:02:56.590> high<00:02:56.799> rated

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
he'd feel overshadowed in high rated

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.809 
he'd feel overshadowed in high rated
teams<00:02:57.489> at<00:02:57.700> all<00:02:57.760> either<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:59.099> his<00:03:00.099> dribbling<00:03:00.579> as

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
teams at all either and his dribbling as

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.460 
teams at all either and his dribbling as
well<00:03:01.060> at<00:03:01.269> 88<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.260> was<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:03.579> so<00:03:04.269> good<00:03:04.780> indeed

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
well at 88 this was so so good indeed

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.009 
well at 88 this was so so good indeed
he's<00:03:06.040> slightly<00:03:06.430> messy<00:03:06.970> esque<00:03:07.359> in<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.870> way

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
he's slightly messy esque in the way

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.960 
he's slightly messy esque in the way
that<00:03:08.260> he<00:03:08.379> dribbles<00:03:08.799> a<00:03:08.920> very<00:03:09.129> low<00:03:09.400> center<00:03:09.940> of

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
that he dribbles a very low center of

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.319 
that he dribbles a very low center of
gravity<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.980> know<00:03:12.099> he's<00:03:12.250> not<00:03:12.459> weak<00:03:12.760> he<00:03:13.000> seems

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
gravity you know he's not weak he seems

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.500 
gravity you know he's not weak he seems
fairly<00:03:13.720> strong<00:03:14.340> 68<00:03:15.340> strength<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:16.030> game<00:03:16.269> is<00:03:16.480> a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
fairly strong 68 strength in game is a

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.410 
fairly strong 68 strength in game is a
bit<00:03:16.750> iffy<00:03:17.079> I'd<00:03:17.230> say<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:17.799> he<00:03:17.980> plays<00:03:18.310> or<00:03:18.700> seems<00:03:19.060> a

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
bit iffy I'd say but he plays or seems a

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.440 
bit iffy I'd say but he plays or seems a
good<00:03:20.049> 10<00:03:20.500> 15<00:03:20.829> stronger<00:03:21.579> than<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.910> he<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.239> not

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
good 10 15 stronger than that he is not

good 10 15 stronger than that he is not
easy<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:23.079> knock<00:03:23.950> off<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> ball<00:03:24.670> at<00:03:24.910> all<00:03:24.970> and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
easy to knock off of the ball at all and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.289 
easy to knock off of the ball at all and
that<00:03:26.440> coupled<00:03:26.739> with<00:03:26.980> his<00:03:27.099> 88<00:03:27.579> ball<00:03:27.819> control<00:03:28.209> an

89 dribbling and 86 agility in 90

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.440 
89 dribbling and 86 agility in 90
balance<00:03:32.019> means<00:03:32.739> he<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.220> super<00:03:33.790> player<00:03:34.180> on

balance means he is a super player on
the<00:03:34.599> ball<00:03:34.780> four<00:03:35.079> star<00:03:35.410> skills<00:03:35.739> as<00:03:36.099> well<00:03:36.310> they

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
the ball four star skills as well they

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.970 
the ball four star skills as well they
all<00:03:37.060> complement<00:03:37.810> each<00:03:38.079> other<00:03:38.380> really<00:03:38.500> well<00:03:38.829> I

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
all complement each other really well I

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.680 
all complement each other really well I
don't<00:03:39.160> need<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.579> go<00:03:39.700> into<00:03:39.819> too<00:03:40.000> much<00:03:40.180> detail

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
don't need to go into too much detail

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.420 
don't need to go into too much detail
you<00:03:40.720> should<00:03:41.109> know<00:03:41.290> what<00:03:41.500> i<00:03:41.530> mean<00:03:41.829> by<00:03:42.040> now<00:03:42.250> on

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
you should know what i mean by now on

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.009 
you should know what i mean by now on
i'm<00:03:42.549> talking<00:03:42.970> about<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.419> having<00:03:43.750> watched

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
i'm talking about this having watched

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.409 
i'm talking about this having watched
enough<00:03:44.799> pleura<00:03:45.099> views<00:03:45.370> in<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.609> past<00:03:45.760> but<00:03:46.359> uh

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
enough pleura views in the past but uh

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.440 
enough pleura views in the past but uh
he<00:03:47.109> is<00:03:47.260> just<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.799> class<00:03:48.190> act<00:03:48.489> on<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:49.000> ball<00:03:49.209> and

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
he is just a class act on the ball and

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.030 
he is just a class act on the ball and
these<00:03:49.660> skill<00:03:49.989> moves<00:03:50.230> just<00:03:50.440> complement<00:03:51.010> that

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
these skill moves just complement that

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.479 
these skill moves just complement that
so<00:03:51.519> nicely<00:03:51.849> but<00:03:52.450> however<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.440> do<00:03:53.500> think<00:03:53.739> he<00:03:54.340> has

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
so nicely but however I do think he has

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.720 
so nicely but however I do think he has
a<00:03:54.730> good<00:03:54.819> two<00:03:55.510> or<00:03:55.540> three<00:03:56.139> downsides<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.340> first

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
a good two or three downsides the first

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.509 
a good two or three downsides the first
of<00:03:58.000> which<00:03:58.239> is<00:03:58.599> that<00:03:59.079> he<00:03:59.500> could<00:03:59.769> go<00:04:00.010> missing

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
of which is that he could go missing

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.059 
of which is that he could go missing
completely<00:04:01.060> in<00:04:01.480> some<00:04:01.870> games<00:04:02.109> like<00:04:02.530> literally
