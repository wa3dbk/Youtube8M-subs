00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello kitty hello today i want 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.120
 make a video for you to tell you about 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.400
 a hair mask that I have for myself 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.640
 acquired and which enjoyed all 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.530
 summer and she just saved me like we 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.370
 I know everything the sun is very bad for 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.650
 our hair is not our poor dry up 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.870
 here and I know I was looking-looking in 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.369
 Internet any some masks 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:34.379
 to somehow moisten your hair 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.250
 because they are already very me 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:41.340
 dry breaking and somehow I looked through 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.130
 masks and one tried it to me 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 I liked it so much that I made it 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.579
 constantly 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.670
 and my hair just me just 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.560
 felt the difference in principle and me 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.810
 wanted to share a lot with you 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.750
 because it is really very cool 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:04.739
 mask this mask this mask consists of 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.860
 avocado i like how exactly here it is 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.530
 I do not like plants to eat 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.979
 so I decided to try this abacan 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.979
 on your hair and if you if you 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.229
 there is a problem with dry hair then this 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 mask just for you so stay 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.090
 do not switch and you will see recipes 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.979
 how I apply it and how for our mask 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.909
 we will need avocados I have it already 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.010
 brushed diced and long 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.619
 must be surely ripe now we 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.930
 with him we will make mush you can 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.540
 use a blender and and whatever 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.600
 but vakata should be so soft 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.580
 so that you can crush it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 fork or here is a pile like a 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.570
 I still need me for the mask 1 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.000
 yolk and a whole glass of olive oil and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.110
 so we rework it all carefully 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.240
 It seems the view is certainly not that much 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.200
 avocado is nothing but he is very 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.370
 well affects our hair now everything 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.410
 I shifted it suddenly 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.570
 at the plate and try constantly 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.630
 use such plastic masks 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:19.100
 devices in this case I have this knife 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:21.420
 cake knife but pour in 1 yolk and 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.990
 stir well to 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.970
 it became a homogeneous mass and I and you 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.120
 I will advise when you make masks for 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.690
 faces and for whatever use 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.020
 plastic or glass appliances 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.510
 now I poured olive oil 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.760
 Olive oil I do not regret when for 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.770
 my hair because personally my 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.430
 his hair is taught to love very well 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.069
 absorbs and the result is of course ingenious 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.640
 now i comb my hair 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.450
 separate the two halves I do so you 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.329
 can do as you used to well 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.969
 combed my hair and then I told you 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.920
 I will show two ways how to apply these two 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:10.209
 half can also be divided into 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.280
 a few halves here I take fingers 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.019
 parting and divide into two parts 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.359
 top and bottom 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:21.609
 principle the same principle as me and 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:26.560
 when I twist my hair now 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:29.560
 I take the first part of our hair and I take this 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.620
 gruel and straight so well smear on 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.079
 the whole length of my hair that is from the most 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.959
 roots and to the tips 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.250
 not a very pleasant feeling of course 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.680
 this kosice 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.699
 but itâ€™s worth it 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.669
 so in parts 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:51.480
 but today I will plaster it all 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:54.730
 Deal so immediately on all hair first 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.099
 the outer side and of course I will apply this 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.620
 same mask on the inside so that everyone 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.759
 hair soaked with me as long as this 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.879
 let's gruel 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:06.220
 and the matter is from two sides very carefully 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.370
 then wrap up such a ball 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.449
 and stabbing or either stealth or 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.659
 gum in my case and gum do 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:19.560
 second side 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.599
 102 parties I do absolutely the same 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.310
 on our gruel you can use 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:30.340
 by the way brush there gloves but i love everything 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.099
 do with my hands and therefore use only 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.409
 so don't you forget i am giving you an idea a 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:39.009
 you already break it under your own way 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.080
 it is convenient for you so put all the rest 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.389
 the remnants of which were not left plates 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.599
 just put on the places that I see 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.729
 that she does not want a little mask and put on 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.250
 her mask is washed off by the way very well 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.349
 nothing left now i need 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.139
 the package i always use the package you 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.630
 can use hats and so 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.940
 Further why I use packages because 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.650
 it is more convenient for me to packs I removed the pack I 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.320
 would have been 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:10.490
 force all because it was so dress bag 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.169
 we twist we fix it we press down 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.479
 I honestly very good packages 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.449
 I treat and in terms of masks, I always 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.360
 my package and then a big towel for 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.080
 In order to keep the heat in our our 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.320
 hair 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.350
 here and now we are leaving with such a mask 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.060
 at least 15-20 minutes if you can 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.669
 walk longer you need to walk 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.300
 longer I went literally a few 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.320
 o'clock 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.419
 then wash off with shampoo so I washed my hair 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.580
 already laid and 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:46.260
 hair is perfect not soft they smell 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:50.280
 olive oil and a little shampoo 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.320
 of course the smell of shampoo remained here but 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.270
 Overall I am very pleased with this mask I hope 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.210

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.729

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.610
 this caused this mask what comments 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.919
 you have so maybe someone already 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.990
 and I tried to help someone who is not 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.510
 so leave your comments and 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.500
