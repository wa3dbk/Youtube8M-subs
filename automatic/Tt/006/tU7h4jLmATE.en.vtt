00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.380
 I think that 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:33.640
 It's really easy, isn't it really useful for people who do n't know it? 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.430
 I think only this time 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.730

 I think it would be nice to give 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:49.310
 I do it by software combination, but it is super easy and can be done free of charge 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.079
 It 's kind of like it 's good to be free, but if you 're confused it's 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.260
 It was really easy though 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.479

 Launch software called Code Pad 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:24.430
 Since this has come up, such a screen comes out 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:29.580

 That's why-it was difficult 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.010
 Then I should do something else later 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.720
 There was a while ago when I went to Meiko 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.290

 It's mole or you set up a word to bring up the dark word in the case of I 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.420
 And after this 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.760
 Is it true that it is okay 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.159
 But it is worse 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.720
 The rest is about 16 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.450
 Follow 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.550

 Fun even if 1676 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.780
 It just below is considerably this made in this that will line 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.420
 In a place that does not need a person of hereabouts will erase all 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.250
 never 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.250

 Seed it has any such feeling 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.210
 That is my way of saying 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:31.280
 It's been a while 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.700
 If you are far away, select all 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:40.360
 From the south music 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:46.580

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.760
 Hmm 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.950
 To feel like this 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:21.630
 It is easy if we made I'm 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:26.400
 There is a little bit of it, but in the first place Aaron does not have to change its color 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:29.840
 I think that I can do this if I print as it is 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.840
 This visit with love 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.430

 It is this I a blur body sold I had been by letter 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.680
