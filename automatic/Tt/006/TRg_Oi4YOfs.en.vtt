00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.470 
probably Welling in air kilogram speak
you're<00:02:55.650> probably<00:02:55.950> 20<00:02:56.550> kilograms<00:02:57.120> ahead<00:02:57.360> of

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
you're probably 20 kilograms ahead of

50<00:02:59.700> pound<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.570> well<00:03:01.080> I'm<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.430> new

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
50 pound but well I'm in a new

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.690 
50 pound but well I'm in a new
generation<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.510> think<00:03:04.050> every<00:03:04.290> generation

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
generation so I think every generation

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.760 
generation so I think every generation
has<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.730> get<00:03:06.000> better<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.450> generation<00:03:07.380> has<00:03:07.530> been

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
has to get better a generation has been

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.280 
has to get better a generation has been
different<00:03:08.220> because<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.000> technology<00:03:09.750> of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
different because the technology of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.930 
different because the technology of
every<00:03:10.590> generation<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.430> different<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.910> just

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
every generation is different it just
