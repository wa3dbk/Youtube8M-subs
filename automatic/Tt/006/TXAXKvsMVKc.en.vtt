also see that from the back side and if

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.530

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
tinkerbell which is something I thought

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.220 
tinkerbell which is something I thought
didn't<00:04:10.590> win

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
didn't win

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.440 
didn't win
I'm<00:04:11.379> reminded<00:04:12.340> me<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.580> light<00:04:12.790> show<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.330> you

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
see every night and this is just a

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.539 
see every night and this is just a
little<00:04:16.630> matted<00:04:17.139> rub<00:04:17.590> on<00:04:17.739> tinker<00:04:18.130> bell<00:04:18.310> with

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
little matted rub on tinker bell with

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.879 
little matted rub on tinker bell with
the<00:04:18.579> picture<00:04:19.299> hanger<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:20.229> I<00:04:20.290> put<00:04:20.620> across

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
the picture hanger that I put across

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.250 
the picture hanger that I put across
this<00:04:21.130> ribbon<00:04:21.519> here<00:04:21.790> so<00:04:22.540> it's<00:04:22.990> kind<00:04:23.169> of

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
this ribbon here so it's kind of

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.990 
this ribbon here so it's kind of
interactive<00:04:23.830> kind<00:04:24.160> of<00:04:24.220> fun<00:04:24.400> but<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.729> really

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
interactive kind of fun but I really

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.210 
interactive kind of fun but I really
liked<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.360> don't<00:04:25.720> think<00:04:25.930> about<00:04:26.199> Rob<00:04:26.830> on<00:04:27.040> with

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
liked it don't think about Rob on with

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.189 
liked it don't think about Rob on with
what<00:04:27.400> she<00:04:27.550> was<00:04:27.669> flying<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.389> I<00:04:28.600> thought<00:04:29.139> that

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
what she was flying so I thought that

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.550 
what she was flying so I thought that
fitted<00:04:29.770> well<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:31.510> back<00:04:31.690> after<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.380> for

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
fitted well the back after that for

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.830 
fitted well the back after that for
frame<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:33.010> just<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.310> another<00:04:33.490> plane<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.449> the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
frame is just a another plane and the

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.480 
frame is just a another plane and the
ribbon<00:04:35.229> is<00:04:35.380> less<00:04:35.620> what<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.040> can<00:04:36.250> chuck

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
ribbon is less what you can chuck

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.990 
ribbon is less what you can chuck
picture<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.540> behind<00:04:37.870> there<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.790> this<00:04:39.790> is

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
picture in behind there and this is

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.930 
picture in behind there and this is
another<00:04:40.510> thing<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:42.160> can<00:04:42.340> see<00:04:42.490> how<00:04:42.639> it<00:04:42.790> matches

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
another thing you can see how it matches

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.080 
another thing you can see how it matches
using<00:04:43.780> this<00:04:44.110> acetate<00:04:44.800> piece<00:04:45.070> was<00:04:45.340> cut<00:04:45.370> to

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
using this acetate piece was cut to

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.409 
using this acetate piece was cut to
match<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.810> chipboard<00:04:47.380> piece<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:49.030> it's<00:04:49.180> much

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
match this chipboard piece but it's much

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.510 
match this chipboard piece but it's much
thinner<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.169> covered<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:50.710> paper<00:04:51.070> on<00:04:51.220> this

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
thinner so I covered it a paper on this

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.000 
thinner so I covered it a paper on this
backside<00:04:52.080> but<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.229> since<00:04:53.470> it's<00:04:53.620> two-sided

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
backside but it since it's two-sided

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.879 
backside but it since it's two-sided
paper<00:04:54.430> it<00:04:54.820> shows<00:04:55.630> through<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.050> plain<00:04:56.380> color<00:04:56.680> on

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
paper it shows through a plain color on

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.219 
paper it shows through a plain color on
here<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.490> added<00:04:58.030> some<00:04:58.180> more<00:04:58.510> bonds<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:59.080> then

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
here I added some more bonds and then

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.590 
here I added some more bonds and then
this<00:04:59.410> piece<00:04:59.680> is<00:04:59.919> actually<00:05:00.430> just<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.970> little

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
this piece is actually just a little

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.020 
this piece is actually just a little
open<00:05:02.320> flap<00:05:02.590> like<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.340> pinnacle<00:05:03.760> for<00:05:03.910> my
