00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
use this stuff a lot and I have

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.350 
use this stuff a lot and I have
repurchased<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> few<00:01:15.869> times<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:17.360> this

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
repurchased this a few times and this

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
repurchased this a few times and this
time<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> went<00:01:18.960> through<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.830> fast<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.820> just

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
time I went through it so fast I just

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.649 
time I went through it so fast I just
got<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:23.009> October<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.210> it's

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
got this in I think October and it's

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.330 
got this in I think October and it's
like<00:01:24.869> gone<00:01:25.259> there's<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.680> nothing<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.159> there

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
like gone there's like nothing in there

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
like gone there's like nothing in there
and<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.540> was<00:01:27.570> using

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900

and I think it's because I was using
those<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.259> sponges<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> time<00:01:29.579> even

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
piece anymore for the foundation because

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.399 
piece anymore for the foundation because

I think it soaks up so much the
foundation<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.549> that's<00:01:56.729> gotta<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.119> why<00:01:57.420> buy

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.130 
to reapply it a little bit later but um
so<00:03:42.520> it's<00:03:42.700> not<00:03:42.850> like<00:03:43.090> something<00:03:43.450> that's<00:03:43.720> going

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
so it's not like something that's going

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.710 
so it's not like something that's going
to<00:03:44.350> just<00:03:45.340> stay<00:03:45.640> there<00:03:45.850> all<00:03:45.910> day<00:03:46.180> for<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.510> so

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
to just stay there all day for you so

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.820 
to just stay there all day for you so
that's<00:03:47.020> why<00:03:47.170> I<00:03:47.200> wouldn't<00:03:47.440> recommend<00:03:47.620> going

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
that's why I wouldn't recommend going

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.130 
that's why I wouldn't recommend going
out<00:03:48.040> with<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:48.370> or<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:49.360> know<00:03:49.480> like<00:03:49.720> wearing
