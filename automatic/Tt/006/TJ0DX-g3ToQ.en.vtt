much success on the big stage but what

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.250 
much success on the big stage but what
this<00:02:02.700> means<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.270> he's<00:02:03.480> very<00:02:03.570> versatile

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
because as a practice partner people

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.220 
because as a practice partner people
would<00:02:05.970> approach<00:02:06.180> them<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.360> say<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.720> need<00:02:06.870> you

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.910 
pressure and now it looks like Puma
might<00:05:03.660> be<00:05:03.780> here<00:05:03.960> enough<00:05:04.170> to<00:05:04.290> do<00:05:04.410> is<00:05:04.560> doing<00:05:04.830> a

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
might be here enough to do is doing a

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.790 
might be here enough to do is doing a
push<00:05:05.190> at<00:05:05.460> this<00:05:06.000> vulnerable<00:05:06.540> location<00:05:07.140> along

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
push at this vulnerable location along

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.860 
push at this vulnerable location along
the<00:05:07.860> right<00:05:08.280> side<00:05:08.670> and<00:05:09.000> in<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.360> meantime<00:05:09.540> he's

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
the right side and in the meantime he's

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.140 
the right side and in the meantime he's
just<00:05:10.050> going<00:05:10.170> to<00:05:10.260> do<00:05:10.350> a<00:05:10.380> scouting<00:05:11.070> medevac<00:05:11.730> yeah

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
just going to do a scouting medevac yeah

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.490 
just going to do a scouting medevac yeah
got<00:05:12.420> a<00:05:12.450> medevac<00:05:12.840> yeah<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.080> might<00:05:13.230> want<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.440> try

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
got a medevac yeah you might want to try

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.900 
got a medevac yeah you might want to try
to<00:05:13.590> freak<00:05:13.800> him<00:05:13.860> out<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:14.010> little<00:05:14.220> bit<00:05:14.430> i<00:05:14.490> guess

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
to freak him out a little bit i guess

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.720 
to freak him out a little bit i guess
but<00:05:15.210> squirrels<00:05:15.840> ahead<00:05:16.140> of<00:05:16.230> him<00:05:16.320> once<00:05:16.530> again

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
but squirrels ahead of him once again

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.710 
but squirrels ahead of him once again
stalkers<00:05:17.730> left<00:05:17.940> in<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.120> back<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.420> the<00:05:18.480> base<00:05:18.600> so

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
stalkers left in the back of the base so

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.760 
stalkers left in the back of the base so
like<00:05:18.870> i<00:05:18.960> said<00:05:18.990> in<00:05:19.290> these<00:05:19.410> clothes<00:05:19.590> their

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
like i said in these clothes their

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.130 
like i said in these clothes their

that observer now enters the basement he

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.280 
that observer now enters the basement he
knows<00:05:23.700> exactly<00:05:23.880> what's<00:05:24.300> going<00:05:24.450> on<00:05:24.690> you<00:05:25.110> need

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290

to<00:05:25.440> have<00:05:25.590> that<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.830> back<00:05:25.980> your<00:05:26.160> mind<00:05:26.370> just

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
to have that the back your mind just

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.220 
to have that the back your mind just
regardless<00:05:27.420> because<00:05:27.570> of<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.810> position<00:05:27.930> on

the<00:05:28.320> map<00:05:28.470> and<00:05:29.340> looks<00:05:30.090> like<00:05:30.420> Puma<00:05:31.260> was<00:05:31.410> trying

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
the map and looks like Puma was trying

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.430 
the map and looks like Puma was trying
to<00:05:32.010> catch<00:05:32.190> up<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.610> squirtles<00:05:33.060> observer<00:05:33.440> trying

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
to catch up to squirtles observer trying

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.020 
to catch up to squirtles observer trying
to<00:05:34.560> see<00:05:34.680> if<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:34.800> could<00:05:34.920> scan<00:05:35.310> to<00:05:35.460> pick<00:05:35.670> it<00:05:35.820> off

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
to see if you could scan to pick it off

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.640 
to see if you could scan to pick it off
we<00:05:36.270> now<00:05:36.390> see<00:05:36.450> an<00:05:36.690> immortal<00:05:37.110> getting<00:05:37.350> produced

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
we now see an immortal getting produced

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.680 
we now see an immortal getting produced
by<00:05:38.370> Sportal<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.090> you<00:05:39.150> know<00:05:39.240> squirtle<00:05:39.570> is

by Sportal and you know squirtle is

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.680 
by Sportal and you know squirtle is
doing<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:40.590> very<00:05:40.920> very<00:05:41.220> solid<00:05:41.880> opening<00:05:42.210> style

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690

doing a very very solid opening style
getting<00:05:43.140> a<00:05:43.320> lot<00:05:43.500> of<00:05:43.530> gateways<00:05:44.130> which<00:05:44.430> will

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
getting a lot of gateways which will

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.460 
getting a lot of gateways which will
help<00:05:44.700> against<00:05:45.030> most<00:05:45.330> pushes<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.110> robo

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
help against most pushes and the robo

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.440 
help against most pushes and the robo
again<00:05:46.620> for<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.040> observer<00:05:47.400> but<00:05:47.940> always<00:05:48.150> being

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
again for the observer but always being

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.600 
again for the observer but always being

the production capacity from those four

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.760 
the production capacity from those four
gates<00:05:54.210> you<00:05:54.780> should<00:05:54.990> be<00:05:55.080> prepared<00:05:55.440> against

most<00:05:56.100> pushes<00:05:56.580> but<00:05:57.030> we<00:05:57.180> can<00:05:57.360> see<00:05:57.600> that<00:05:57.750> this<00:05:57.870> is

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
most pushes but we can see that this is

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.140 
most pushes but we can see that this is
one<00:05:58.200> of<00:05:58.230> these<00:05:58.410> scariest<00:05:59.310> early<00:05:59.700> pushes<00:06:00.030> that
