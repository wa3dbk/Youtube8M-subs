00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
resonance is already there I would even

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.570 
resonance is already there I would even
say<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.680> little<00:02:45.830> more<00:02:46.010> resonant

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
say that it's a little more resonant

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.240 
say that it's a little more resonant
than<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.819> spruce<00:02:47.209> top<00:02:47.450> counterpart
