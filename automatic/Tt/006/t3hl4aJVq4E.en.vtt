00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.549
 how about friends from youtube good afternoon 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.290
 good morning good night when you are 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.849
 watching this video good here we are in 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.190
 215 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.680
 Well, I'm going to show you 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.950
 as being a light robotic 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.510
 here it will be because it's called a career because 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.900
 we do it with materials that we have 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.410
 right here at home 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.930
 and put that from that that will help us 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.910
 marijuana institution 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.560
 what art has another name that is called 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.490
 marijuana product that has given me many 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:46.530
 advice and I also want to say hello to 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.890
 parkour vÃ©lez taught me other things 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.870
 ok let's start the materials are very 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.649
 simple is a stack so you do not have 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.179
 This battery is going to be the base 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.190
 a square stack also because it's 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.190
 attending a 9 volt battery 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.580
 without black trailer 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.540
 a laser that here in Mexico cost 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.110
 approximately 7 pesos if they have 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.570
 searched somewhere 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.240
 a little engine the engine can 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.570
 Remove some car you can only buy 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.450
 some small toy trolley with a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.450
 cross guy screwdriver 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.450
 and some scissors 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.200
 okay 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:44.510
 we went from all this we went to work 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:50.990
 only with what three ministers see 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:56.130
 and we went to work with this with what 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.170
 is the composition of this we are going to 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.520
 possibly cut them through 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.590
 cent to the cinemas 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.270
 let's work with the former engine and let's 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.120
 to cut into pieces of tape 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.120
 approximately about 25 meters 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.890
 and we 're going to stick here in this engine 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:30.300
 these are the first ones let's go to the is that 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.750
 nothing we have to pass the tape here 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.530
 down from where they are as a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.680
 never as a piece of heaven and part 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.280
 our our savior to flatten it 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.750
 of work that fits 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.430
 if they are going to solve it from here below 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.370
 so that it looks good will continue to be seen 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.040
 takeoff is 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:59.540
 now simply 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.540
 We will connect our our led light 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.209
 A) Yes 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.110
 you can see it like that and this we 're going to 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.110
 connect here 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.560
 well tight so it does not say 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.560
 out 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.110
 something like that 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.860
 well well well tight tight 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.180
 the other side 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.680
 as great since I'm going well assured of 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.019
 our being 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.879
 and now simply with the senator the 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.879
 We plan to work because it looks good 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.349
 these 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.349
 we cut another piece of tape 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.030
 There are people in the story that are going to be like 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.850
 we will put a switch 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.310
 here soon when we want to turn it on 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.310
 remove and then with the seat 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.860
 but I'm afraid we have 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.180
 I'm so sorry 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.750
 I do not have very well to worry about in 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.750
 security 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.540
 zinc mauro 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:49.740
 like this sense without good like that and for 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.430
 turn it off is always called always 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.640
 again if we lose it or it separates and 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.170
 finally we happened to paste on Monday what 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.170
 what is our small base 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:09.320
 we are a plant with different 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.260
 A) Yes 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.090
 the wires that are outside the tape 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.470
 because that's where we're going to connect 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.430
 the other stack so that it works in 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.430
 our our robotic light 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.710
 this has been a bit tedious 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.710
 but it will be worth it 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.970
 A) Yes 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:52.610
 for us from different 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.610
 of islands 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.650
 if we stick you well stuck 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.160
 third force always given because the 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.710
 vibration that is if the engine 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.180
 fly out and there will be our 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.009
 effort 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:33.039
 ok and this and turn 1 we need a 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:37.110
 assumption of putting them now we 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:37.110
 we connect our life 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.410
 and ready 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.690
 or a little friend, I think that 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.320
 the prisoners of clubs 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.590
 how is it 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:23.210
 includes that list and the battery but if 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.349
 he just went around like that 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.360
 this we are going to learn our 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:31.680
 I was surprised and it's going to give 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:35.340
 round and round good friends of this 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.830
 site please comment subscribe and 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:42.139
 well until after the session luck with 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.139
 your pharmacy minister and then see you later
