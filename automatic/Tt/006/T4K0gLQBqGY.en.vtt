00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.130
 then go on to not sanding 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.289
 deeply but only for busy giving 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 with the sander with the glass paper a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.480
 weight 360 and one thousand by positioning the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.480
 bumper on two trestles 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.940
 then pass an abrasive sponge 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.940
 wet and cleaned with air gun 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.490
 then cover the parts with the paper tape 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.200
 do not paint add the paint 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.350
 opaque to water in the spray gun 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.850
 that blend the treated part after having it 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 cleaned with the water cleaner 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.590
 let it dry and then spray in 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.830
 two hands to the two-component color 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.270
 doses indicated by the paint manufacturer 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.440
 remembering to filter it before 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.440
 insert it into the gun 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.970
 the next hand will be component 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.970
 transparent and thinner 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.950
 therefore unique to you with wadding and pasta 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.940
 increasingly fine abrasive when doing that 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.940
 circular movement 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.099
 remove the extra dough with some polish 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.810
 to beat and pour over the wadding 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.099
 leave for 5 minutes then 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.099
 take it off with a train 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.030
 polished like a flexible pad 2
