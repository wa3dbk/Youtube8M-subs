00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.220
 like the idea that you do not have no more 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.830
 what vox 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.569

 Fresh peach please more than 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.980

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.990
 exact erotic shrimp is egypt nothing

 a little touch of flavor with the garlic 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.530
 very seasoned and always the 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.530

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.680
