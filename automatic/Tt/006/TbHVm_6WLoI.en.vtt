00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.170

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.470

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.880
 this is the ticket that printed for the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.069
 tutorial is a little bit big it has 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.660
 come out a little bit the truth but 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.720
 well do not let us go that you do not see 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.910
 now let's proceed let's see the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.430
 process to do the first thing we're going 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.620
 to do is cut the ticket of the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.730
 globally you're just starting to 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.799
 cut it by the lines that you have 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.980
 marked and well right away when I 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.230
 you have to go to the next step 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 well we already have a part cut out to 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.319
 the back of the ticket now 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.319
 let's go for the front 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.550
 well, that's it, we already have two parts 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.300
 cut now just need to paste 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:04.450
 for that a simple bar glue will 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.510
 you give first on the one hand that everything is 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.980
 well well stuck everything and with the according to the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.600
 second part, you're going to also 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.040
 put all the glue so that both 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.040
 they stay stuck together 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.200
 once we have the two parts put 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.510
 with simple glues with glue 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.050
 sorry we're just going to paste one 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.050
 on the other 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.280
 be careful, you have to fit the 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:36.020
 edges so you do not miss out 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.550
 once you have everything stuck and 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.060
 finished you will be given the ticket as well 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:44.030
 there it is , you stay perfect 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.530
 and well now you choose the size 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.420
 you want this is a little big but 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.890
 well you can give it the size that 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.900
 you want so nothing here 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.180
 you have the ticket and that's how it stays 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.439
