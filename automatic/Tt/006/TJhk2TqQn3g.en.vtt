00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.080
 steam generator is designed to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.450
 steaming things from a variety of fabrics 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.000
 This model refers to the average 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.860
 price range of steam generators and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 their stated duties 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.460
 copes perfectly main 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.410
 distinctive feature of this model 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.539
 is a special technology 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.430
 optimaltemp which provides 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.800
 optimal combination of temperature and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.140
 steam supply for any kind of fabric without 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060
 risk burn a favorite thing you can safely 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.429
 I found a transition from cotton and did not wait 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.219
 until the iron cools down the casing of the steam station 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.390
 made of impact resistant plastic 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.460
 device design is almost completely 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.890
 consists of a large tank for 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 water volume 2 and 2 10 liters 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.059
 which is enough for continuous work in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.340
 for two hours or more 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.890
 a large opening for the bay facilitates 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.170
 tank filling operations 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.120
 for water is non-removable therefore the remaining 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 after work you have to drain the water 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
 suitable capacity or in the bathroom on 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.079
 the casing has a platform for 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.940
 iron fittings the iron itself is very light and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.280
 connected to the steam station flexible 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.530
 hose length 160 centimeters 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.760
 this length allows you to set itself 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.560
 station on the floor 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.630
 iron on ironing 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.909
 board at the end of the work hose 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 cleans in storage compartment 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.820
 located in the instrument housing in 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.920
 station grounds located 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 heating steam forming element 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.030
 besides the steam generator is equipped 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.619
 special descaling system 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.640
 indicator indicates the need 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.220
 clean the device 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.770
 and thanks to the removable valve process 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.540
 cleaning is quick and easy 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 it is desirable to use these functions 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.390
 regularly in order to renew 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.790
 device durability 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.710
 iron soles with steam glide coating 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.990
 equipped with multiple holes for 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.790
 steam outlet easily slides on any 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.540
 fabric and scratch resistant and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.689
 Damage to the power model j7 86 20 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.310
 makes 2400 watts which allows 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.350
 steam on the soleplate with 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.119
 pressure 5 bar of such pressure 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.680
 enough to allow steam to pass through 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.020
 several layers of fabric 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.110
 steam can be fed in continuous 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.079
 mode up to 120 grams per minute or 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.530
 180 steam boost mode 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.450
 gram 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.069
 well, that steam generator is ready for operation 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.410
 about two minutes after 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.600
 steam supply and steam boost 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.030
 similar power may cause 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.730
 that the debugged thing will be slightly wet 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.780
 so to fix the effect 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.780
 recommend letting things cool
