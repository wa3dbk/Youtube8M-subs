body using points in the ear it's
especially<00:01:54.320> effective<00:01:55.040> for<00:01:55.250> things<00:01:55.910> like

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
especially effective for things like

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.240 
especially effective for things like
pain<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:56.690> stress<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:57.500> oftentimes<00:01:57.800> think<00:01:58.160> of

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
pain and stress we oftentimes think of

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.430 
pain and stress we oftentimes think of
this<00:01:58.340> almost<00:01:58.610> as<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.940> reset<00:01:59.330> button<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.350> the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
this almost as the reset button so the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.930 
this almost as the reset button so the
last<00:02:00.590> point<00:02:00.800> we<00:02:00.920> did<00:02:01.100> there<00:02:01.340> was<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.760> lung

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
last point we did there was the lung

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.760 
last point we did there was the lung
point<00:02:02.180> which<00:02:02.480> is<00:02:02.630> really<00:02:03.080> good<00:02:03.260> for<00:02:03.440> stress

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
point which is really good for stress

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.859 
point which is really good for stress
and<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:04.850> whole<00:02:05.030> thing<00:02:05.270> really<00:02:05.420> helps<00:02:05.660> to

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
and this whole thing really helps to

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.169 
and this whole thing really helps to
readjust<00:02:06.440> in<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.010> way<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.400> sympathetic<00:02:07.970> and

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
readjust in a way the sympathetic and

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.850 
readjust in a way the sympathetic and
parasympathetic<00:02:08.600> nervous<00:02:09.170> systems<00:02:09.619> which

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
parasympathetic nervous systems which

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.949 
parasympathetic nervous systems which
can<00:02:10.070> deal<00:02:10.280> with<00:02:10.429> some<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.700> stress<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.150> is

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959

can deal with some of the stress that is
oftentimes<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.770> trigger<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.340> associated

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
oftentimes the trigger and associated

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.150 
oftentimes the trigger and associated
with<00:02:13.910> cigarette<00:02:14.750> smoking<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.860> can<00:02:16.010> leave

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
with cigarette smoking so we can leave
