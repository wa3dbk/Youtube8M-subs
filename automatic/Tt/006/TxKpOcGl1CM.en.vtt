a complete build video for you guys and
I<00:00:16.800> actually<00:00:17.039> did<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.180> deleted<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.080> on

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
I actually did but I deleted it on

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.000 
I actually did but I deleted it on
accident<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:21.090> lost<00:00:21.420> forever<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.260> what

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
accident so it's lost forever and what

accident so it's lost forever and what
can<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.490> maybe<00:00:23.820> I'll<00:00:24.029> show<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.330> how<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> do

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
can you do maybe I'll show you how to do

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.519 
can you do maybe I'll show you how to do
it<00:00:25.189> next<00:00:26.189> time<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.490> tear<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.000> down<00:00:27.439> but<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> just

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
it next time I tear it down but I just

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.169 
it next time I tear it down but I just
want<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> go<00:00:28.980> over<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> couple<00:00:29.460> things<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.849> you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
want to go over a couple things with you

want to go over a couple things with you
and<00:00:30.660> show<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> way<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.470> set<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.070> it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
flies

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.310 
flies
amazingly<00:00:34.890> from<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:36.450> I've<00:00:36.570> tested<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.290> far

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
amazingly from what I've tested so far

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.940 
amazingly from what I've tested so far
which<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.219> two<00:00:38.460> flights<00:00:39.469> first<00:00:40.469> thing<00:00:40.739> on

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
which is just two flights first thing on

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.400 
which is just two flights first thing on
the<00:00:41.070> bottom<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.730> battery<00:00:42.239> mount<00:00:42.570> I

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the bottom I have a battery mount I

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.410 
the bottom I have a battery mount I
stuck<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.430> bit<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.760> foam<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.149> keep<00:00:45.270> it

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
stuck a little bit of foam to keep it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.540 
stuck a little bit of foam to keep it
nice<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.629> gripped<00:00:46.140> right<00:00:46.440> there

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
nice and gripped right there

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.209 
nice and gripped right there
I<00:00:47.579> can<00:00:48.329> still<00:00:48.600> attach<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.170> battery<00:00:49.590> while

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
I can still attach the battery while

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.110 
I can still attach the battery while
it's<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.500> frame<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.699> see<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it's on the frame and you can see the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350 
it's on the frame and you can see the
carbon<00:00:54.539> fiber<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.329> see

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
carbon fiber in there you can see

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
carbon fiber in there you can see
actually<00:00:57.660> where<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> had<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.620> ball<00:00:59.039> drilled

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
actually where I had the ball drilled

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.329 
actually where I had the ball drilled
for<00:01:00.680> my<00:01:01.680> camera<00:01:02.609> mount<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:04.260> down<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> a-arms

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
for my camera mount and down the a-arms

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.850 
for my camera mount and down the a-arms
the<00:01:05.460> carbon<00:01:05.820> fiber<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> motor

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the carbon fiber and here with the motor

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920 
the carbon fiber and here with the motor
mounts<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.820> some<00:01:09.030> modifications

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
mounts you have to do some modifications

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
mounts you have to do some modifications
on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.799> end<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.490> cut<00:01:11.670> off<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
on the end you have to cut off the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.770 
on the end you have to cut off the
barrel<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.590> also<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.600> drill<00:01:15.600> some

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
barrel and you also have to drill some

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.460 
barrel and you also have to drill some
holes<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.540> put<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.810> screws

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
holes and so you can put your screws

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.859 
holes and so you can put your screws
through<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:19.950> motor<00:01:20.159> mount<00:01:20.330> now<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
through for your motor mount now a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.230 
through for your motor mount now a
couple<00:01:22.770> people<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.310> been<00:01:23.490> recommending<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
couple people have been recommending to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.010 
couple people have been recommending to
me<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> use<00:01:24.810> zip<00:01:25.110> ties<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.820> am<00:01:27.479> trying

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
me that I use zip ties and I am trying

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.499 
me that I use zip ties and I am trying
that<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.259> right<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.180> screw<00:01:30.479> on

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that out right now I have one screw on

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.780 
that out right now I have one screw on
there<00:01:30.840> because<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:31.770> afraid<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.579> might

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
there because I'm afraid that it might

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.140 
there because I'm afraid that it might
just<00:01:33.479> fall<00:01:33.930> off<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.170> fly<00:01:34.560> away<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.070> don't<00:01:35.850> trust

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
just fall off the fly away I don't trust

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.550 
just fall off the fly away I don't trust
if<00:01:36.420> ties<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.070> but<00:01:39.079> my<00:01:40.079> friends<00:01:40.409> say<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
if ties at all but my friends say that

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.639 
if ties at all but my friends say that
they<00:01:41.159> work<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:41.610> well<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.290> we're<00:01:43.290> gonna<00:01:43.380> try

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
they work really well so we're gonna try

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.580 
they work really well so we're gonna try
them<00:01:43.770> out<00:01:44.750> apparently<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.049> helps<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
them out apparently it helps if you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.770 
them out apparently it helps if you
crash<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.250> hard<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.570> breaks

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
crash really hard the thing that breaks

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.520 
crash really hard the thing that breaks
is<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.799> zip<00:01:50.310> tie<00:01:50.520> instead<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.720> frame<00:01:52.020> so

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
is the zip tie instead of the frame so

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
is the zip tie instead of the frame so
that's<00:01:52.740> always<00:01:53.009> good<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:54.390> way<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.689> I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that's always good the way that I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.620 
that's always good the way that I
mounted<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> put<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> zip<00:01:56.340> tie<00:01:56.689> here<00:01:59.630> this

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
mounted it is I put a zip tie here this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
mounted it is I put a zip tie here this
holds<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> lot<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.649> frame<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> little<00:02:02.159> bit

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
holds a lot on the frame a little bit

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
holds a lot on the frame a little bit
and<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.180> zip<00:02:03.420> tie<00:02:03.600> right<00:02:03.810> here<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.409> cinch

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and this zip tie right here is to cinch

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.219 
and this zip tie right here is to cinch
down<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.040> motor<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.210> mount<00:02:06.420> itself<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
down the motor in the mount itself and

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.589 
down the motor in the mount itself and
then<00:02:07.860> also<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.759> outside<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.330> do<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
then also one on the outside to do the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.660 
then also one on the outside to do the
same<00:02:09.840> thing<00:02:10.160> normally<00:02:11.160> there<00:02:11.370> would<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
same thing normally there would be a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.020 
same thing normally there would be a
lock<00:02:12.000> screw<00:02:12.390> right<00:02:12.660> there<00:02:13.220> but<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.580> zip<00:02:14.790> ties

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
lock screw right there but the zip ties

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.520 
lock screw right there but the zip ties
actually<00:02:15.450> work<00:02:15.780> better<00:02:16.220> then<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:18.379> then<00:02:19.379> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
actually work better then the then the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.470 
actually work better then the then the
actual<00:02:19.680> screws<00:02:20.250> data<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.940> screws<00:02:21.209> always

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
actual screws data and the screws always

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.290 
actual screws data and the screws always
broke<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.110> mounts<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.709> mounting<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.670> control

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
broke the mounts so mounting the control

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.910 
broke the mounts so mounting the control
board<00:02:24.569> on<00:02:24.750> there<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.050> flight<00:02:25.260> controller<00:02:25.709> you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
board on there the flight controller you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.530 
board on there the flight controller you
have<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.129> use<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> spacer<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.620> then<00:02:29.540> some

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
have to use a spacer and then some

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.990 
have to use a spacer and then some
rubber<00:02:31.110> grommets<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.250> make<00:02:32.459> sure<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.879> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
rubber grommets to make sure that you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
rubber grommets to make sure that you
have<00:02:33.150> no<00:02:33.690> vibration<00:02:34.379> in<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.620> board<00:02:34.890> I

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
have no vibration in the board I

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.820 
have no vibration in the board I
actually<00:02:35.790> took<00:02:36.239> my<00:02:36.300> LEDs<00:02:36.810> off<00:02:37.200> because<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
actually took my LEDs off because the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.339 
actually took my LEDs off because the
LEDs<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:38.580> thing<00:02:38.819> sucked<00:02:39.269> anyway<00:02:39.480> I'm

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
LEDs on this thing sucked anyway I'm

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.869 
LEDs on this thing sucked anyway I'm
just<00:02:40.530> gonna<00:02:40.620> get<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> light<00:02:41.099> strip<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.700> maybe

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
just gonna get a light strip and maybe

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.420 
just gonna get a light strip and maybe
run<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.150> through<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.540> board<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.190> see<00:02:44.190> if<00:02:44.340> I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
run it through the board and see if I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.900 
run it through the board and see if I
can<00:02:44.640> put<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.480> on<00:02:45.629> here<00:02:45.840> somehow<00:02:46.489> now<00:02:47.489> as<00:02:47.730> far

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
can put that on here somehow now as far

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.110 
can put that on here somehow now as far
as<00:02:47.970> hatching<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.599> landing<00:02:48.959> gear<00:02:49.940> again<00:02:50.940> I

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
as hatching the landing gear again I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.009 
as hatching the landing gear again I
went<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> zip<00:02:52.140> tie<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.709> one<00:02:53.010> bolt

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
went with a zip tie and one bolt

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.110 
went with a zip tie and one bolt
hopefully<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.200> zip<00:02:55.410> tie<00:02:55.650> breaks<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.580> might

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
hopefully the zip tie breaks I might

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.970 
hopefully the zip tie breaks I might
actually<00:02:57.330> change<00:02:57.840> out<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.170> bolt<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:58.620> put<00:02:58.860> in

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
actually change out the bolt and put in

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.339 
actually change out the bolt and put in
another<00:02:59.129> zip<00:02:59.760> tie<00:03:00.030> just<00:03:00.870> because<00:03:01.170> I've<00:03:01.319> been

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
another zip tie just because I've been

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.320 
another zip tie just because I've been
told<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:01.920> when<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.370> come<00:03:02.640> down<00:03:02.819> really<00:03:03.180> hard

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
told that when you come down really hard

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.070 
told that when you come down really hard
you<00:03:03.840> put<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.050> lot<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.379> force<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:06.599> area<00:03:06.659> of

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
you put a lot of force in this area of

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.009 
you put a lot of force in this area of
the<00:03:07.170> frame<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.670> can<00:03:08.909> possibly<00:03:09.209> break<00:03:09.750> it

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
the frame and it can possibly break it

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.309 
the frame and it can possibly break it
because<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.190> screw<00:03:11.580> right<00:03:12.000> here<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:13.170> I'd

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
because of the screw right here so I'd

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.960 
because of the screw right here so I'd
rather<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> zip<00:03:13.980> tie<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.220> have<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.760> zip

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
rather have a zip tie and have the zip

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.089 
rather have a zip tie and have the zip
tie<00:03:15.209> break<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.780> then<00:03:15.959> be<00:03:16.349> able<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.590> fix<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.010> in

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
tie break and then be able to fix it in

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.860 
tie break and then be able to fix it in
five<00:03:17.340> seconds<00:03:17.849> instead<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.390> breaking<00:03:18.599> my

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
five seconds instead of breaking my

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.990 
five seconds instead of breaking my
whole<00:03:19.080> frame<00:03:19.409> and<00:03:19.680> spending<00:03:20.400> another<00:03:20.640> 50

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
whole frame and spending another 50

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.750 
whole frame and spending another 50
bucks<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.390> buy<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.540> new<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:22.370> as<00:03:23.370> far<00:03:23.610> as

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
bucks to buy a new one as far as

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.649

I<00:03:49.620> know<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:50.129> frame<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.580> slightly<00:03:50.849> lighter<00:03:51.239> and

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
I know the frame is slightly lighter and

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.780 
I know the frame is slightly lighter and
you<00:03:51.750> have<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.200> cut<00:03:52.379> off<00:03:52.530> some<00:03:52.980> plastic<00:03:53.549> I

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
you have to cut off some plastic I

you have to cut off some plastic I
didn't<00:03:54.209> use<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.450> battery<00:03:54.840> tray<00:03:55.260> I'm<00:03:56.010> only

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
didn't use the battery tray I'm only

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.729 
didn't use the battery tray I'm only
using<00:03:56.610> zip<00:03:56.970> ties<00:03:57.209> instead<00:03:57.629> of<00:03:57.780> bolts

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
using zip ties instead of bolts

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.670 
using zip ties instead of bolts
we're<00:03:59.099> down<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> lot<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.819> weight<00:03:59.970> here<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.680> it

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
we're down a lot of weight here and it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.679 
we're down a lot of weight here and it
is<00:04:01.830> just<00:04:01.860> hauling<00:04:02.310> ass<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:02.970> slight<00:04:03.360> annoyance

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
is just hauling ass so slight annoyance

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
is just hauling ass so slight annoyance
that<00:04:04.049> I<00:04:04.080> had<00:04:04.470> with<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.769> frame<00:04:05.040> was<00:04:05.510> just<00:04:06.709> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
that I had with the frame was just the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.119 
that I had with the frame was just the
body

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
body

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.490 
body
I<00:04:08.310> had<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.640> trim<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.540> little<00:04:09.959> bit<00:04:10.170> so

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
I had to trim it just a little bit so

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.920 
I had to trim it just a little bit so
that<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:11.370> would<00:04:11.489> fit<00:04:11.730> on<00:04:11.909> there<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.360> now

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
that it would fit on there and now

out a way to secure that on there a
little<00:04:17.220> bit<00:04:17.459> better<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.850> I'm<00:04:17.940> sure<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.239> won't

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
little bit better and I'm sure it won't

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.499 
little bit better and I'm sure it won't
be<00:04:18.509> complicated<00:04:19.729> but<00:04:20.729> now<00:04:21.060> what<00:04:21.209> we're<00:04:21.329> trying

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
to do is find the best way to mount the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.900 
to do is find the best way to mount the
Mobius<00:04:23.850> on<00:04:24.090> there<00:04:24.389> without<00:04:25.380> jello<00:04:25.949> and<00:04:26.520> get
