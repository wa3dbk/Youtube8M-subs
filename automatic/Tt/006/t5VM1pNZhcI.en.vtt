00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.770 

so<00:00:01.260> today<00:00:01.560> got<00:00:01.979> really<00:00:02.730> tired<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.270> my<00:00:03.419> fringe

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
so today got really tired of my fringe

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.780 
so today got really tired of my fringe
and<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.230> long<00:00:04.500> it<00:00:04.710> was<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:05.190> got<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.609> scissors

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
and how long it was I got the scissors

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.810 
and how long it was I got the scissors
and<00:00:06.089> cut<00:00:06.330> it<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:07.049> I'm<00:00:07.440> just<00:00:07.470> hoping<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.250> when

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
and cut it and I'm just hoping that when

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.360 
and cut it and I'm just hoping that when
it<00:00:08.970> dries<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:10.230> gonna<00:00:10.380> be<00:00:10.620> okay

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
it dries it's gonna be okay

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.209 
it dries it's gonna be okay
I've<00:00:11.730> never<00:00:12.120> cut<00:00:12.450> my<00:00:12.599> own<00:00:12.630> hair<00:00:12.750> before<00:00:13.219> I'm

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
cutting my own hair it's a little bit

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.470 
cutting my own hair it's a little bit
harder<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.850> work<00:00:24.300> the
