 I have always liked sports in my home, they instilled sport and I believe 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.929
 which is very important for the development of all the kids 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.969
 or since I was very young I approached motoring because my dad has always 

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:25.069
 been a fan of 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:29.949
 the race cars and motorcycles and good fuel that got me into the sport 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.840
 that's why motorsport is a unique sport where you can 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.020
 mix with a machine and be one and good all the adrenaline and excitement 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.019
 that nothing else can provide you 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.810

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.890
 Advise and take you on the path of success 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.260
 why can I get there, you want to be 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.350
 It is very important that a coach 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.880
 of the valley values ​​because that way you can get to 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.440

 17 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.000
 all how it should have been done 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.350
 taught to respect others december work 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.320
 in a clean way 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.570
 is the most important because that is the only way to achieve the goals 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.650
 that one has in nmc sports 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.180
 the most important values ​​that must have 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.850
 it's patience 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.750
 xerez b must also be very persistent 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.710

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.110
 why 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.020
 If I respect others, they will not respect you either 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.390
 I think that they are 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.540
 are the most important values ​​that you should have as a pilot 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.359
 all these values ​​that are learned and must be applied in motorsport 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.730
 they are of great importance for life because good I compare motoring 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.070
 like daily life 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.490
 Sixto you play well you are doing well 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.610
 When you want good things to arrive you have to wait for them to arrive 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.870
 Good things do not despair or beats 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.649

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.299
 very similar 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.579
 what you can very similar what happens on the track what happens in daily life 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.799

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.799

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.819
 proud of myself since 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.299
 I ran against pilots who had years running on track soba side without this 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.659
 type of cars i was pleased to know that it was up to them and good 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.649
 that I have a future since 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.669

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.829

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:48.849
 time 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.659
 since as 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.349
 I had said it before we need those values ​​to be able to 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.829
 succeed in our careers and be able to do it in the right way and what 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.330

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.489
 and know that we did things well 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.959
 i achieved what we had as meters always follow their dreams that never 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.039
 give up 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.439
 there are times that 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.749
 it seems that everything is coming down and that 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:19.509
 nothing what you want is going to happen 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.349
