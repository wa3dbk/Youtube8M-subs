00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.600
 We experience life with our five senses. 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.933
 But what if everything you ever thought ... 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.066
 All that ever knew ... 

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.060
 It was just a surface 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.333
 that extends much deeper. 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.053
 [Screened world bestseller] 

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:32.889
 [Academy Award Winner Jeff Bridges] 

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:35.892
 [Meryl Streep Academy Award Winner] 

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:38.937
 [And also Brandon Tweets] 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.600
 And ... Motor! 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.866
 I began to think about how important memory is for us. 

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:47.321
 What if we could manipulate her? 

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:51.000
 [Lois Lowry is a writer, author of the original novel "The Giver"] What if we could manipulate her? 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.466
 [Lois Lowry - writer, author of the original novel "The Giver"] 

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.285
 And when a writer begins to ask such questions [Lois Lowry is a writer, author of the original novel “The Giver”] 

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:55.060
 And when a writer begins to ask such questions 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.466
 those that start with “what if” ... 

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.400
 Then the story begins to take shape. 

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.400
 -Why do we start? - Move closer. 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.200
 Nearer. 

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:16.460
 To what I do with you, it is impossible to prepare. 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.466
 If it calms you, know - 

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.933
 you are absolutely helpless. 

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.466
 If any of this “evidence” is too much for you, 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.400
 speak to me immediately. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.666
 This young man sees how hypocritical 

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:45.330
 the ruling elite of the world around him. 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.200
 And he sees in her something infinitely ominous. 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 If I am just another “receiver,” who are you then? 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.866
 In this case, it turns out that I am a “giver”.
