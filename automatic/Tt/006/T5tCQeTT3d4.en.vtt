times you'll kind of know which position

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.870 
times you'll kind of know which position
you<00:01:36.930> should<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.430> hands<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.729> down

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
magazine it does make it easier and back

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
magazine it does make it easier and back
down<00:01:47.369> doesn't<00:01:47.939> look<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.180> much<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.420> you're

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
down doesn't look like much but you're

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.210 
down doesn't look like much but you're
going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.049> wishing<00:01:49.409> you're<00:01:49.530> still<00:01:49.890> doing<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
going to be wishing you're still doing a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460 
going to be wishing you're still doing a
back<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.610> biceps<00:01:51.000> after<00:01:51.330> doing<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> few<00:01:52.380> of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
back and biceps after doing a few of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.920 
back and biceps after doing a few of
these<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.460> down<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.030> hold<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
these so up and down like this hold it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.840 
these so up and down like this hold it
slowly<00:01:55.860> down<00:01:56.100> that's<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.400> easiest<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
slowly down that's the easiest way to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.969 
slowly down that's the easiest way to
kind<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.240> used<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> exercise<00:01:58.049> then

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
kind of get used to the exercise then

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.469 
kind of get used to the exercise then
put<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.250> hand<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.270> hand

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
put your hand down like this one hand

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.940 
put your hand down like this one hand
behind<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> head<00:02:00.869> put<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.799> more

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
behind the head put a little more

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.350 
behind the head put a little more
resistance<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.850> which<00:02:03.000> makes<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.330> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
resistance this way which makes it a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.810 
resistance this way which makes it a
little<00:02:03.450> bit<00:02:03.600> tougher<00:02:04.340> coming<00:02:05.340> up<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
little bit tougher coming up like this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.330 
little bit tougher coming up like this
holding<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.600> slowly<00:02:07.259> back<00:02:07.560> down<00:02:07.799> as<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.250> come

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
holding it slowly back down as you come

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
holding it slowly back down as you come
up<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.939> want<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> make<00:02:09.239> sure<00:02:09.269> you're<00:02:09.539> bending

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
up you want to make sure you're bending

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.540 
up you want to make sure you're bending
through<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.649> waste<00:02:10.860> through<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> oblique

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
through the waste through the oblique

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.800 
through the waste through the oblique
you're<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:11.819> lifting<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.269> just<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.629> hip

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
you're not lifting up just the hip

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.940 
you're not lifting up just the hip
you're<00:02:12.930> not<00:02:13.019> keeping<00:02:13.290> everybody<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:13.800> this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you're not keeping everybody like this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.589 
you're not keeping everybody like this
you're<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.640> pull<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.030> tight<00:02:15.330> you're

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
you're going to pull it in tight you're

you're going to pull it in tight you're
going<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.780> pull<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.230> down<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.769> contract<00:02:17.610> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
going to pull this down in contract a

hand here and bring up one leg at the
same<00:02:21.239> time<00:02:21.830> slowly<00:02:22.830> back<00:02:23.220> down<00:02:23.250> breathing<00:02:23.730> out

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
same time slowly back down breathing out

on the way up holding it slowly back

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.259 
on the way up holding it slowly back
down<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.010> gets<00:02:29.250> too<00:02:29.370> easy<00:02:29.459> for<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:30.030> can't

it's not putting more any more
resistance<00:02:46.530> on<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.709> oblique<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.280> actually

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
resistance on the oblique I actually

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.610 
resistance on the oblique I actually
want<00:02:47.940> my<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.390> lift<00:02:48.569> my<00:02:48.720> legs<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:49.140> at<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.410> same

and slowly back down one of the most

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.349 
and slowly back down one of the most
