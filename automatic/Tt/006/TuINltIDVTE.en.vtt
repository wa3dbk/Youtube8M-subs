00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.130 
okay and then cut it out so this is what
it<00:02:13.880> looks<00:02:14.030> like<00:02:14.180> when<00:02:14.360> you've<00:02:14.450> cut<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.720> out<00:02:14.900> I

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
it looks like when you've cut it out I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.809 
it looks like when you've cut it out I
had<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.590> trim<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.800> bit<00:02:15.980> off<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.190> top<00:02:16.220> because<00:02:16.700> it

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
had to trim a bit off the top because it

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.220 
had to trim a bit off the top because it
is<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.060> long<00:02:17.270> for<00:02:17.480> blue<00:02:17.599> grasses<00:02:18.080> legs<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
is it long for blue grasses legs and the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.150 
is it long for blue grasses legs and the
next<00:02:21.470> thing<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.680> need<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:22.100> is<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:23.209> get<00:02:23.330> your

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
next thing you need to do is to get your

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.190 
next thing you need to do is to get your
velcro<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.630> fuzzy<00:02:26.930> soft

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
velcro this is like the fuzzy soft

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.900 
velcro this is like the fuzzy soft
velcro<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:28.130> not<00:02:28.340> quite<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:28.670> ball

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
velcro so that it's not quite as ball

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.390 
velcro so that it's not quite as ball
tackle<00:02:29.270> boot<00:02:29.920> but<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:30.980> can<00:02:31.100> use<00:02:31.250> normal

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
tackle boot but you can use normal

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.740 
tackle boot but you can use normal
velcro<00:02:31.880> it's<00:02:32.000> fine<00:02:32.319> so<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:34.670> make<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.599> rig

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
velcro it's fine so to make this is rig

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.030 
velcro it's fine so to make this is rig
is<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.959> confusing<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:37.069> make<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.459> right<00:02:38.150> boot<00:02:39.040> you

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
is it confusing to make a right boot you

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.979 
is it confusing to make a right boot you
need<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.830> have<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.040> straps<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:43.519> this<00:02:43.989> so

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
need to have the straps like this so

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.020 
need to have the straps like this so
they<00:02:45.230> soft<00:02:45.590> bit<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.310> velcro<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:46.910> this

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
they soft bit of the velcro is on this

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.360 
they soft bit of the velcro is on this
side<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.530> prickly<00:02:48.769> bit<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.190> velcro

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
side and the prickly bit of the velcro

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.920 
side and the prickly bit of the velcro
on<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:49.970> side<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> straps<00:02:50.810> are

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
on this side and the straps are

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.059 
on this side and the straps are
obviously<00:02:51.170> longer<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.680> reaches<00:02:51.980> around

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
obviously longer so it reaches around

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.800 
obviously longer so it reaches around
the<00:02:52.340> leg<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:55.190> left<00:02:55.370> boot<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:56.000> opposite<00:02:56.720> way

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
the leg so the left boot is opposite way

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.870 
the leg so the left boot is opposite way
around<00:02:56.840> softer<00:02:57.799> this<00:02:57.920> side<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.370> produced<00:02:58.730> up

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
around softer this side and produced up

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.630 
around softer this side and produced up
this<00:02:59.030> side<00:02:59.769> do<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:00.950> understand

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
this side do you understand

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.490 
this side do you understand
good<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.830> this<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.780> thicker<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.110> straps

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
good so this is the thicker the straps

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.840 
good so this is the thicker the straps
the<00:03:06.620> better<00:03:06.799> actually<00:03:07.040> because<00:03:07.340> then<00:03:07.519> the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
the better actually because then the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.539 
the better actually because then the
more<00:03:08.030> grip<00:03:08.510> they<00:03:08.690> have<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:10.010> obviously<00:03:10.280> too

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
more grip they have but obviously too

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.240 
more grip they have but obviously too
thick<00:03:10.820> they<00:03:11.090> look<00:03:11.269> weird<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:11.769> cut<00:03:12.769> out<00:03:12.950> two

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
thick they look weird so cut out two

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.300 
thick they look weird so cut out two
small<00:03:13.430> bits<00:03:13.820> of<00:03:13.940> fuzzy<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:14.540> two<00:03:15.470> long<00:03:15.980> bits

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
small bits of fuzzy and two long bits

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.890 
small bits of fuzzy and two long bits
that<00:03:16.579> are<00:03:16.730> about<00:03:17.799> four<00:03:18.799> centimeters

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
that are about four centimeters

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.789 
that are about four centimeters
doesn't<00:03:20.900> matter<00:03:21.140> as<00:03:21.380> long<00:03:21.410> as<00:03:21.530> they<00:03:21.650> reach

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
doesn't matter as long as they reach

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.349 
doesn't matter as long as they reach
around<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.040> brace<00:03:22.250> legs<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.790> secure<00:03:23.150> here

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
around the brace legs to secure here

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.030 
around the brace legs to secure here
it's<00:03:23.510> fine<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.920> cut<00:03:25.130> those<00:03:25.280> out<00:03:26.829> so<00:03:27.829> these<00:03:27.950> are

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
it's fine so cut those out so these are

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.580 
it's fine so cut those out so these are
the<00:03:28.160> straps<00:03:28.459> there<00:03:28.700> now<00:03:28.910> cut<00:03:29.180> out<00:03:29.380> this<00:03:30.380> is<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
the straps there now cut out this is the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.259 
the straps there now cut out this is the
fuzzy<00:03:30.799> bits<00:03:31.100> they<00:03:31.430> need<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.790> be<00:03:31.880> long<00:03:32.030> enough

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
fuzzy bits they need to be long enough

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.349 
fuzzy bits they need to be long enough
to<00:03:32.510> reach<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.959> edge<00:03:33.579> they're<00:03:34.579> fine<00:03:35.060> as<00:03:35.329> long

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
to reach the edge they're fine as long

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.300 
to reach the edge they're fine as long
as<00:03:35.540> they<00:03:35.690> come<00:03:35.900> sort<00:03:36.200> of<00:03:36.290> into<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.040> middle

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
as they come sort of into the middle

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.539 
as they come sort of into the middle
yeah<00:03:37.900> these<00:03:38.900> are<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.109> prickly<00:03:39.290> bits<00:03:39.590> remember

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
yeah these are the prickly bits remember

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.460 
yeah these are the prickly bits remember
when<00:03:40.700> you're<00:03:40.850> gluing<00:03:41.000> them<00:03:41.420> that<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.230> prickly

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
when you're gluing them that the prickly

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.860 
when you're gluing them that the prickly
bits<00:03:42.769> have<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.040> be<00:03:43.280> stuck<00:03:43.549> facedown

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
bits have to be stuck facedown

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.870 
bits have to be stuck facedown
and<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.739> fuzzy<00:03:45.920> bits<00:03:46.190> need<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.459> be<00:03:46.549> stuck

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
and the fuzzy bits need to be stuck

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.900 
and the fuzzy bits need to be stuck
facing<00:03:47.450> up<00:03:47.660> okay<00:03:48.560> but<00:03:49.430> then<00:03:49.549> when<00:03:49.640> they<00:03:49.760> reach

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
facing up okay but then when they reach

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.069 
facing up okay but then when they reach
around<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.750> bits<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:51.890> fuzz<00:03:52.730> ruler<00:03:53.569> delight

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
around the bits that fuzz ruler delight

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.930 
around the bits that fuzz ruler delight
work<00:03:54.260> but<00:03:54.650> yes<00:03:54.799> when<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.430> reaches<00:03:55.640> round<00:03:55.819> it

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
work but yes when it reaches round it

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.520 
work but yes when it reaches round it
