00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
got this sled at Kmart I guess pinned I

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.280 
got this sled at Kmart I guess pinned I
think<00:00:09.360> about<00:00:09.540> $32<00:00:10.320> for<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:12.049> can<00:00:13.049> kind<00:00:13.230> of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.820 
their little toboggan pretty decent sled
it<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:27.300> kind<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> Paris<00:00:28.260> sled<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> guess

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
it is kind of like a Paris sled I guess

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.370 
it is kind of like a Paris sled I guess
and<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.910> may<00:00:30.029> go<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> also<00:00:30.929> looking<00:00:31.260> at

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
and I may go to that I also looking at

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.430 
and I may go to that I also looking at
the<00:00:31.470> jet<00:00:31.679> sleds<00:00:32.510> some<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> stuff<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the jet sleds some of the stuff that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.280 
the jet sleds some of the stuff that
they<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.739> at<00:00:34.980> ski<00:00:35.520> pole<00:00:35.700> calm<00:00:36.210> some<00:00:37.110> pretty

they have at ski pole calm some pretty
interesting<00:00:37.500> stuff<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.370> anyway<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.149> real

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.950 
interesting stuff but anyway just a real
quick<00:00:39.840> look<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.260 

I<00:00:42.989> made<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:44.210> poles<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.750> 3/8<00:00:46.379> ball<00:00:46.649> thread

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
I made the poles out of 3/8 ball thread

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.880 
I made the poles out of 3/8 ball thread
actually<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.450> from<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> belt<00:00:49.140> all<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.770> way

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
actually going from the belt all the way

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.170 
actually going from the belt all the way
back<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.750> covered<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:52.680> thread<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.219> C

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
back and I covered the all thread with C

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.220 
back and I covered the all thread with C
PVC<00:00:54.629> pipe<00:00:54.899> half<00:00:55.289> inch<00:00:55.530> CPVC<00:00:55.710> pipe<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.230> made

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
PVC pipe half inch CPVC pipe and made

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950 
PVC pipe half inch CPVC pipe and made
the<00:00:58.350> connections<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the connections here so that's the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.650 
the connections here so that's the
flexibility<00:01:01.760> these<00:01:02.760> guys<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
flexibility these guys can go back and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.679 
flexibility these guys can go back and
forth<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.339> as<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.580> move<00:01:05.850> should<00:01:06.330> work<00:01:06.510> pretty

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
forth as I as I move should work pretty

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.480 
forth as I as I move should work pretty
good<00:01:07.850> wasn't<00:01:08.850> real<00:01:09.090> concerned<00:01:09.570> about

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
good wasn't real concerned about

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.260 
good wasn't real concerned about
detaching<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.850> field<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.210> know

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
detaching this in the field I know

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.149 
detaching this in the field I know
there's<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.600> lot<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.110> folks<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.680> there<00:01:13.710> that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
there's a lot of folks out there that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.070 
there's a lot of folks out there that
you<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> pins<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> slide<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you know have the pins that slide in and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
you know have the pins that slide in and
out<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.500> don't<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> big<00:01:17.790> deal<00:01:18.000> for

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
out I don't know that was a big deal for

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.820 
out I don't know that was a big deal for
me<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.479> may<00:01:18.659> become<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> big<00:01:19.229> deal<00:01:19.380> we'll<00:01:19.619> see

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
me it may become a big deal we'll see

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.399 
me it may become a big deal we'll see
when<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.070> test<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.810> probably<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> little

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
when we test it but probably do a little

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.990 
when we test it but probably do a little
modifications<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.340> what<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:23.880> I'll

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
modifications of what I have here I'll

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
modifications of what I have here I'll
probably<00:01:24.119> put<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:25.110> don't<00:01:25.680> know<00:01:25.860> I'll<00:01:25.950> probably

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
probably put I don't know I'll probably

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.700 
probably put I don't know I'll probably
put<00:01:26.310> lock<00:01:26.970> washers<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.689> point<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.350> maybe

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
put lock washers at this point and maybe

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.830 
put lock washers at this point and maybe
in<00:01:28.860> between<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:30.240> change<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.659> out

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
in between here and then change this out

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.950 
in between here and then change this out
to<00:01:31.020> an<00:01:31.110> acorn<00:01:31.530> nut<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.119> made<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.360> epoxy

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to an acorn nut and I made just epoxy

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
to an acorn nut and I made just epoxy
all<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.200> together<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:34.920> sure<00:01:35.100> we'll<00:01:35.369> see

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
all this together I'm not sure we'll see

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.960 
all this together I'm not sure we'll see
but<00:01:36.329> anyway<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:37.290> thread<00:01:38.009> again<00:01:38.250> 3/8<00:01:38.640> running

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
but anyway all thread again 3/8 running

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
but anyway all thread again 3/8 running
across<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.810> through<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.409> holes<00:01:40.860> that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
across here and through the holes that

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
across here and through the holes that
were<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> sled<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:43.320> three<00:01:43.590> locations<00:01:43.710> at

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
were in the sled in three locations at

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.429 
were in the sled in three locations at
the<00:01:44.280> top<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.700> ran<00:01:45.090> around<00:01:45.899> my<00:01:46.229> rope

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the top I just ran around my rope

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.679 
the top I just ran around my rope
through<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.579> holes<00:01:47.759> putting<00:01:48.180> back<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.600> then

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
through the holes putting back and then

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.679 
through the holes putting back and then
tied<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.619> thread<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> sled<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.240> then

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
tied the all thread to the sled and then

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.240 
tied the all thread to the sled and then
underneath<00:01:53.540> we've<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.070> we've<00:01:56.070> got<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
underneath we've got it we've got a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.399 
underneath we've got it we've got a
tight<00:01:56.549> back<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.180> all<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> loops<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
tight back and then all of the loops the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.639 
tight back and then all of the loops the
tie-down<00:01:58.770> loops<00:01:59.009> here<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:01.110> Rope<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.439> comes

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
tie-down loops here the Rope just comes

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.760 
tie-down loops here the Rope just comes
up<00:02:01.799> ran<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.850> through<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.030> loops<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.649> ran<00:02:04.649> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
up ran it through the loops and ran it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.050 
up ran it through the loops and ran it
all<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> way<00:02:05.009> around<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.399> sled

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
all the way around the sled

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.749 
all the way around the sled

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
so as I'm pulling on the sled hopefully

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880 
so as I'm pulling on the sled hopefully
I'm<00:02:08.849> pulling<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.720> points<00:02:10.709> here

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I'm pulling on all the points here

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.920 
I'm pulling on all the points here
reducing<00:02:11.430> some<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> stress

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930

folks I I snowshoe with me have to help
them<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.319> little<00:02:22.470> bit<00:02:22.620> if<00:02:22.829> I<00:02:22.920> have<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.099> pull

them out a little bit if I have to pull

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.190 
them out a little bit if I have to pull
their<00:02:23.519> sled<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.849> can<00:02:24.090> always<00:02:24.209> attach<00:02:24.689> two<00:02:24.959> sleds

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
their sled I can always attach two sleds

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.600 
their sled I can always attach two sleds
together<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.650> guess<00:02:25.890> we'll<00:02:26.069> give<00:02:26.189> that<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.370> shot

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
together I guess we'll give that a shot

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.559 
together I guess we'll give that a shot
but<00:02:27.680> not<00:02:28.680> sure<00:02:28.860> what<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:30.090> material<00:02:30.480> I'm

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
but not sure what the the material I'm

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.240 
but not sure what the the material I'm
gonna<00:02:30.689> use<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.049> tie<00:02:31.230> down<00:02:31.260> my<00:02:31.530> gear<00:02:31.799> but<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.010> just

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
gonna use to tie down my gear but I just

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.349 
gonna use to tie down my gear but I just
had<00:02:32.400> some<00:02:32.549> extra<00:02:32.819> rope<00:02:33.000> here<00:02:33.180> I'll<00:02:33.269> probably

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
had some extra rope here I'll probably

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.589 
had some extra rope here I'll probably
use<00:02:33.569> this<00:02:34.159> to<00:02:35.159> tie<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.400> down<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.000> can<00:02:36.480> use

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
use this to tie it down but can use

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.789 
use this to tie it down but can use
bungee<00:02:36.900> cords<00:02:37.170> or<00:02:37.260> whatever

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
bungee cords or whatever

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.210

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
so the sled the pulling poles come up

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.280 
so the sled the pulling poles come up
I've<00:02:41.489> got<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> piece<00:02:41.939> of<00:02:41.970> velcro<00:02:42.209> kind<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.900> Criss
