00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the incubation conditions which you know

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.540 
the incubation conditions which you know
some<00:02:26.760> species<00:02:27.090> will<00:02:27.750> hatch<00:02:28.500> easily<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.340> some

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
some species will hatch easily in some

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.860 
some species will hatch easily in some
will<00:02:29.760> not

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
will not

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.360

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
turn anyway that this is a Brynn say one

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.750 
turn anyway that this is a Brynn say one
okay<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.900> hear<00:02:40.760> me<00:02:42.050> show<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.110> here<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:44.700> is

part<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.360> same<00:02:45.600> tubing<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.290> just

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
part of the same tubing that I just

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.310 
part of the same tubing that I just
snipped<00:02:47.340> off<00:02:47.490> enough<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.570> get<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.110> go

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
snipped off enough just to get it to go

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.500 
snipped off enough just to get it to go
down<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.710> there<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> small<00:02:51.120> funnel

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
down in there and this is a small funnel

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.450 
down in there and this is a small funnel
you<00:02:51.630> see<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.960> different<00:02:52.140> funnel<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.250> what

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
you see it's a different funnel so what

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.020 
you see it's a different funnel so what
I<00:02:53.490> do<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.000> open<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> vent<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.170> way<00:02:55.320> and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
I do is I open the vent all the way and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.610 
I do is I open the vent all the way and
this<00:02:57.030> aquarium<00:02:57.360> tubing<00:02:57.750> fits<00:02:58.140> right<00:02:58.350> down

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
this aquarium tubing fits right down

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.730 
this aquarium tubing fits right down
inside<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.430> I<00:03:00.300> put<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.020> all<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> way<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
inside and I put it in all the way and

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.770 
inside and I put it in all the way and
then<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.400> able<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.700> fill<00:03:03.030> up<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.300> water<00:03:03.510> and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
then I'm able to fill up the water and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.380 
then I'm able to fill up the water and
while<00:03:04.320> attaching<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:05.310> incubators<00:03:05.910> not<00:03:06.090> turn

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
while attaching the incubators not turn

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.030 
while attaching the incubators not turn
so<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.959> water<00:03:07.140> will<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.380> run<00:03:07.740> right<00:03:07.890> into

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
so the water will just run right into

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.280 
so the water will just run right into
the<00:03:08.190> reservoirs<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.540> makes<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.900> easy<00:03:10.140> for

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
the reservoirs and it makes it easy for

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.699 
the reservoirs and it makes it easy for
you<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.730> add<00:03:11.880> water<00:03:12.240> now<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.050> do<00:03:13.230> have<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.470> hatch

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
you to add water now I do have a hatch

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.110 
you to add water now I do have a hatch
going<00:03:14.100> on<00:03:14.220> right<00:03:14.430> now<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:15.470> have<00:03:16.470> um<00:03:16.850> some<00:03:17.850> auto

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
going on right now I have um some auto

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.910 
going on right now I have um some auto

early and this is he or she so this is a
fancy<00:03:45.900> breed<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.530> chicken<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.580> tails<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.390> is

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
fancy breed of chicken the tails this is

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.760 
fancy breed of chicken the tails this is
a<00:03:48.540> non<00:03:48.810> molting<00:03:50.840> gene<00:03:51.840> genetics<00:03:52.530> line

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
a non molting gene genetics line

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.820 
a non molting gene genetics line
descended<00:03:53.730> from<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.180> auto<00:03:54.540> godori<00:03:54.959> Japanese

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
descended from the auto godori Japanese

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.670 
descended from the auto godori Japanese
or<00:03:56.820> Chinese<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.450> can't<00:03:57.720> memorize<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:58.200> know<00:03:58.500> they

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
or Chinese I can't memorize I know they

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.410 
or Chinese I can't memorize I know they
were<00:03:58.800> bred<00:03:59.430> for<00:03:59.610> Chinese<00:03:59.910> emperors<00:04:00.239> but<00:04:00.390> I

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
were bred for Chinese emperors but I

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.350 
were bred for Chinese emperors but I
think<00:04:00.600> they're<00:04:00.750> Japanese<00:04:01.610> breed

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
think they're Japanese breed

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.930 
think they're Japanese breed
anyways<00:04:04.110> this<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.070> my<00:04:05.100> little<00:04:05.400> baby<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:05.790> is

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
the first one hatched three days early

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.340 
the first one hatched three days early
so<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:08.040> had<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.760> immediately<00:04:09.000> throw<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.690> throw

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
so I had to immediately throw it throw

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.990 
so I had to immediately throw it throw
the<00:04:10.470> incubator<00:04:10.859> into<00:04:11.070> lockdown<00:04:11.280> mode<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.970> I

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
the incubator into lockdown mode and I

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.370 
the incubator into lockdown mode and I
was

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
was

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.320
