00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 yesterday specialist in survival 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.670
 that changes the veteran in 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.790
 Dose challenge special operations 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.790
 double 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.280
 Do you see this body do a couple of 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.480
 sandals with him or something 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.430
 leather sandals 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
 I am not a big fan of shoes makes several 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.640
 years I walk barefoot 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.650
 I like my feet the losses because 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.420
 several native peoples had the heavy 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.180
 by the time you live on earth it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.310
 It does pay more attention but as I am 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.769
 Southwest I know there are places 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.200
 God made where no one should walk 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.760
 barefoot does what you want I go 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.010
 I saw that other thing that people 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.640
 I had seen it, I'll be back soon. 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.070
 Good, I'm looking for a piece of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.200
 flat leather the ribs I 'm 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.760
 disturbing 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.329
 then as the knife or the boot 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.329
 ribs 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.270
 now that you got accurate leather 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.280
 find something to tie at my feet 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.020
 I 've already seen some kind of cassava and I want 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.580
 see if I can find another species that I 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.580
 I'd rather do rope 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.979
 we have another cow dies 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.960
 wow and this stinks as I went 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.940
 coming close to that cow for expired 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.310
 and it was slow I saw a cloud of flies 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.479
 and I saw wide the smell was 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.280
 unbearable 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.560
 this animal was cooked not only by 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 some two ladies in leather here 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.380
 we can use to make the shelter a 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.310
 protection against 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 and also has the horns and of course I 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.600
 I'll rip the two of you out, I think my god 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.890
 what a fucking stink 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.689
 they're loose I think I'm going 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.970
 able to use these horns as 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:58.009
 I'm going to call the code to 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:00.450
 take a look at it here today and come here 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.610
 cool 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.510
 Look, it's just very disgusting and I'm going 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.880
 need your help 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.470
 How do you need my help at NASA? 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.360
 can hold one leg and help turn 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.340
 So I see this bug is so 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.430
 cool how much the car whom I thought 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.620
 Dude you do not reason this business 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.240
 is sold and is not offended luscious of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.050
 cheese no I will not leave this body 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.510
 behind 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.980
 Look, we can use it for something. 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.540
 so if you can help me 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.690
 're kidding'm not talking 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.370
 seriously know the level of fethab and I think 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.080
 We're in. I can by Mickey. 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.460
 you throw up a liter of water to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.840
 get leather 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.510
 I do not know how we'll do 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.090
 This is going to slow us down, you want to know 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.440
 This chorus goes with me and the bridge is not going to me. 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.190
 help then does not God bless you 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.690
 you go 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.970
 I do not think it's a decision 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.820
 prudent way of survival 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.310
 If he touches this leather, it may 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.070
 catching some kind of infection or 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.900
 anything this is not a good idea 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.880
 I'll let him do what he wants and 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.470
 back to the shade and make my 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.540
 bacteria sandals feed on the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.270
 organs in the carcass of an animal and 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.070
 gases which makes the animal died the fla 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.750
 the lightest perforation of an organ in 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.610
 decomposition can cause an explosion 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.290
 of the innards of the cow 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.360
 We're on a mission. I 'm not going to fail. 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.580
 a lot of larvae coming out of this business 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.620
 I'm going to use this leather to make a 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.230
 pair of sandals to protect my feet 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.760
 if necessary to make shoelaces goal of 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.380
 chooses the most manioc leaves 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.330
 thick and met who can 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.670
 find here you can see that the fibers 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.630
 have the thickness of a wire of 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.490
 hair 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.530
 The coolest in this weaving technique 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.660
 that this sheet will withstand a 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.870
 tension of 23 kilos I join two 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.880
 technically it will handle 46 pounds 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.459
 but for some reason when you return 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.590
 they act like a micro spring and attention 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.990
 is greater than the one with which you 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.900
 started now let's see where I'm going to do 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:13.739
 the holes in this leather and what pattern 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:13.739
 I'll wear my shoelace there, my God. 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.240
 finally I took the chorus out of the cow 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.919
 My gosh, I'm going to have to fiddle with that wave. 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 close again I can not rule out a 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:35.460
 of the best parts 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.460
 I need chile, dammit. 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.570
 one thing I say never look again 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.850
 an animal with the same eyes 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.260
 today I leave my comfort zone and 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.910
 if you are in a situation of 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.710
 I think it best to do the 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.930
 same thing because this can be the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.930
 difference between life and death
