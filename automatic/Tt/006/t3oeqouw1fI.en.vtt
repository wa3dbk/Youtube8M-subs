minute but you see one run across there

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.070 
minute but you see one run across there
there's<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.460> meter<00:02:54.970> up<00:02:55.210> there<00:02:55.510> above<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.810> door

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
there's a meter up there above the door

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.140 
there's a meter up there above the door
and<00:02:56.290> then<00:02:56.680> there's<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.980> TV<00:02:57.160> telling<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.760> that

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
and then there's the TV telling you that

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.030 
and then there's the TV telling you that
it<00:02:58.330> blows<00:02:58.570> up<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.890> heads<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.490> Dickie<00:03:01.210> birds

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
it blows up the heads of Dickie birds

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.680 
it blows up the heads of Dickie birds
because<00:03:03.040> their<00:03:03.340> brains<00:03:03.850> can't<00:03:04.210> take<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:04.600> I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
because their brains can't take it and I

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.200 
because their brains can't take it and I
expand<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.380> block<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.950> skull<00:03:06.280> or<00:03:06.490> some<00:03:07.030> such

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
expand and block the skull or some such

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.130 
expand and block the skull or some such
nonsense

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.480 

that's<00:03:10.770> probably<00:03:10.890> why<00:03:11.100> those<00:03:11.250> lives<00:03:11.430> are

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
that's probably why those lives are

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.400 
that's probably why those lives are
there<00:03:11.640> birds<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.030> first<00:03:12.210> guy<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:13.470> know

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.950 

so<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.070> look<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.390> Dicky<00:03:19.390> Birds<00:03:19.660> on<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
so you look for Dicky Birds on the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.990 
so you look for Dicky Birds on the
ground<00:03:20.200> if<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.680> see<00:03:20.860> any<00:03:21.130> that's<00:03:21.670> where<00:03:21.910> you

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
ground if you see any that's where you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.520 
ground if you see any that's where you
know<00:03:22.150> there<00:03:22.300> isn't<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.510> mirror<00:03:22.720> but<00:03:23.050> after<00:03:23.380> this

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
know there isn't a mirror but after this

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.290 
know there isn't a mirror but after this
level<00:03:23.710> you<00:03:23.860> get<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.040> fucking<00:03:24.310> sensor<00:03:25.180> that

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
level you get a fucking sensor that

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.490 
level you get a fucking sensor that
tells<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.630> where<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.840> emitters<00:03:26.110> are<00:03:26.230> anyway

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
tells you where the emitters are anyway

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.280 
tells you where the emitters are anyway
so<00:03:26.560> it's<00:03:27.370> absolutely<00:03:27.730> no<00:03:27.880> point<00:03:28.120> in<00:03:28.210> that<00:03:28.330> we

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
so it's absolutely no point in that we

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.130 
so it's absolutely no point in that we
move<00:03:29.470> on<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.060> eventually<00:03:31.060> we<00:03:31.360> come<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.990> the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
move on and eventually we come to the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.930 
move on and eventually we come to the
tar<00:03:32.350> fuckers<00:03:32.740> a<00:03:32.770> two<00:03:33.010> type<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.370> tar<00:03:33.550> fucker

I always try to run to one end of this
black<00:05:07.970> stuff<00:05:08.620> that's<00:05:09.620> my<00:05:09.800> tactic<00:05:10.310> make<00:05:10.550> sure

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
black stuff that's my tactic make sure

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.860 
black stuff that's my tactic make sure
that<00:05:10.910> I'm<00:05:12.910> I've<00:05:13.910> only<00:05:14.120> got<00:05:14.300> them<00:05:14.390> coming<00:05:14.660> at<00:05:14.750> me

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
that I'm I've only got them coming at me

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.710 
that I'm I've only got them coming at me
from<00:05:14.990> one<00:05:15.230> angle<00:05:16.030> I'll<00:05:17.030> make<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.270> bit<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.510> hash

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
from one angle I'll make a bit of hash

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.400 
from one angle I'll make a bit of hash
of<00:05:17.930> that<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:19.610> is<00:05:19.640> what<00:05:19.940> I<00:05:20.000> do<00:05:20.090> tend<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:20.990> do<00:05:21.169> run

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
of that this is what I do tend to do run

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.050 
of that this is what I do tend to do run
to<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:21.620> other<00:05:21.740> end<00:05:21.980> there's<00:05:22.400> one<00:05:22.610> hiding

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
to the other end there's one hiding

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.730 
to the other end there's one hiding
behind<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.600> little<00:05:23.840> thing<00:05:24.080> of<00:05:24.230> them<00:05:24.350> the<00:05:24.530> left

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
behind the little thing of them the left

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.400 
behind the little thing of them the left
they're<00:05:25.010> like<00:05:25.310> free<00:05:25.669> deliveries<00:05:26.240> shoot<00:05:27.169> him

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
they're like free deliveries shoot him

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.659 
they're like free deliveries shoot him
and<00:05:27.560> then<00:05:27.590> get<00:05:27.800> in<00:05:27.950> his<00:05:28.070> little<00:05:28.250> corner

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
and then get in his little corner

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.460 
and then get in his little corner
because<00:05:29.540> then<00:05:29.780> they<00:05:29.870> can<00:05:30.020> only<00:05:30.050> count<00:05:30.290> you

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
because then they can only count you

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.530 
because then they can only count you
from<00:05:30.620> one<00:05:30.770> angle<00:05:31.130> and<00:05:31.340> you<00:05:31.730> can<00:05:31.910> shoot<00:05:32.270> them<00:05:32.419> as

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
from one angle and you can shoot them as

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.570 
from one angle and you can shoot them as
they<00:05:32.660> coming<00:05:32.960> up<00:05:33.080> but<00:05:33.260> obviously<00:05:33.500> I've<00:05:33.680> fucked

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
they coming up but obviously I've fucked

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.350 
they coming up but obviously I've fucked
after<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:34.970> we<00:05:35.060> get<00:05:35.150> in<00:05:35.270> there<00:05:37.120> then<00:05:38.120> you<00:05:38.210> go

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
after that we get in there then you go

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.730 
after that we get in there then you go
