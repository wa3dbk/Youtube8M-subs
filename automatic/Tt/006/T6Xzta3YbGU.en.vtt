00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.170
 blinded of the two perspectives 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.850
 they are inextricably linked by the constant return of the author 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.029
 they belong to matter as a condition to the theater of life 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:15.479
 on the tragic nisso an unrepeatable existence of the individual its dissolving into 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.479
 endless panicale 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.160
 meleam al assunte and in rebel angels 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.430
 neighbors is finally delivered that totally to history 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.840
 are these works between dreamed biting a series of painful e 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.420
 enchanted furious and placid Dionysius proud self-portraits 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.950
 little inseparable king of his kosmo fit away 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.160
 his surfing in the future had nothing to do with the future 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.520
 it is necessary to go towards the highest points of Modigliani 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.850
 to trace the thread of vitality and humanism of neighbors 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.399
 it can also be stopped 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.270
 that by ways other than the linear ones of morandi 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.610
 licini turns lead to the same tension 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.980
 all the more reductive of the descriptive data of the image and the 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.090
 composition 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.119
 how much more able to exalt 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.400
 in particular the universal 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.980
 neighbors' lyricism is classic 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.630
 its pessimism and materialistic type 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.640
 always indicates the gap between the joy of living 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.890
 the consultation service 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.669
 his imagination and reflexive type 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.319
 it is always painfully but eagerly reaching beyond the mystery of the limit 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.589
 the limit of his skies without horizon 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.939
 of his looks without goal 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.079
 of his black contours along the backgrounds the volumes of tormented as 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:23.979
 you 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.319
 which always in the last instance are his projected figures and fixed in 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.859
 everlasting as graffiti on the one-dimensional bottom of its enclosures 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.499
 enchanted 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:39.299
 or I have three works on which it is useful to focus attention as on 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.069
 as many points of reference 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.779
 to understand mobility is the only one that develops the personality of 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:45.689
 neighbors 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:46.999
 naked at the window 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.979
 in 1925 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:53.799
 whose texture and versatility in the space which at the same time is geometric and 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.799
 fantastic deja in terms of earth structure 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:00.169
 composition with black and blue lines 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.179
 in 1900 35 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.749
 whose assemblage of geometric figures lives exactly demo 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.559
 yet 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.379
 do 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.159
 amalasunta on a blue background 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.019
 of 1949 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.259
 whose rarefaction of figurative drawings almost non-Major 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.819
 on the verge of crisis nerves, the individual reality 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:30.509
 around which the full will rotate for the maturity of osvaldo licini 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.690
 the vitality and sensitivity of neighbors 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.929
 they have no equal in any of his peers 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:40.709
 for this reason, a passion in his work makes one wonder of the mo 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.179
 that the more promising young people are booked 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.849
 the more you can bust licini goes to the finish line 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.279
 p 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.269
 not the fuck 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.719
 how have you tried 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.119
 if I always seek without ever finding it 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:08.210
 a certainty where to play 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.329
 all the doors of a milan 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.909
 miracle holiness 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.419
 maybe I dreamed 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.379
 maybe spent a little too much 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.709
 with heart in hand 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.169
 with heart in his hand 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.129
 a little too beautiful of the soul 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.710
 the circle 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.729
 without ever getting tired 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.830
 or maybe they were 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.830
 to meet her. 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.569
 I finish with that fabulous painter who was Osvaldo Licini 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:37.830
 a true master 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.430
 in modern European painting 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.870
 a comprehensive documentary 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.960
 you have heard the enlightening words of brands that was the first chi of you to 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.090
 my opinion the only one to deeply understand the personality 16 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.990
 you are here now 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.479
 overheard the neighbors some of them a lot
