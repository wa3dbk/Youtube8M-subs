wheatgrass<00:00:11.910> wanna<00:00:12.480> pick<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:14.490> reason<00:00:14.940> that

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
wheatgrass wanna pick the reason that

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.210 
wheatgrass wanna pick the reason that
they<00:00:15.179> use<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> specific<00:00:16.260> kind<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.590> wheat<00:00:16.920> for

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
they use a specific kind of wheat for

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.830 
they use a specific kind of wheat for
wheatgrass<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.940> because<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.539> wheat

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
wheatgrass is because that wheat

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.960 
wheatgrass is because that wheat
produces<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> most<00:00:19.830> juiciest<00:00:20.460> blades<00:00:20.760> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
produces the most juiciest blades of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.599 
produces the most juiciest blades of
grass<00:00:21.199> it<00:00:22.199> doesn't<00:00:22.680> necessarily<00:00:23.369> mean<00:00:23.550> that

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
grass it doesn't necessarily mean that

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.000 
grass it doesn't necessarily mean that
that's<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.269> healthiest<00:00:24.779> grass<00:00:25.019> because

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
that's the healthiest grass because

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.230 
that's the healthiest grass because
there's<00:00:26.220> hundreds<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.760> different<00:00:26.880> grasses

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
there's hundreds of different grasses

there's hundreds of different grasses
some<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.779> them<00:00:27.900> aren't<00:00:28.140> very<00:00:28.560> juicy<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.939> use

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
some of them aren't very juicy I can use

spray your lawn you can literally just

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.150 
spray your lawn you can literally just
take<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.420> Glen<00:00:36.660> grass<00:00:37.320> clippings<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.010> throw

take your Glen grass clippings and throw

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.799 
take your Glen grass clippings and throw
them<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> blender<00:00:38.610> why<00:00:39.270> not

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
them in the blender why not

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.100 
them in the blender why not
hopefully<00:00:40.590> has<00:00:40.710> less<00:00:40.950> molten<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.700> mower

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.490 

okay<00:00:46.640> very<00:00:47.640> true<00:00:48.000> unless<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> Vitamix

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
okay very true unless you have a Vitamix

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.709 
okay very true unless you have a Vitamix
be<00:00:50.010> careful<00:00:50.460> how<00:00:50.610> much<00:00:50.670> grass<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.420> put<00:00:51.600> in

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
be careful how much grass you put in

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.099 
be careful how much grass you put in
your<00:00:51.870> blender<00:00:52.199> because<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.530> pretty<00:00:52.800> tough

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.389 

you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.289> put<00:01:01.469> them<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> blender<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you can put them in a blender in the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.189 
you can put them in a blender in the
Vitamix<00:01:02.789> yeah<00:01:03.329> that's<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:03.930> actually

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
Vitamix yeah that's so you can actually

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.280 
Vitamix yeah that's so you can actually
make<00:01:04.470> grass<00:01:04.799> smoothies<00:01:05.689> if<00:01:06.689> you're<00:01:07.020> eating

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
make grass smoothies if you're eating

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.060 
make grass smoothies if you're eating
grass<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:08.220> aware<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.820> grass<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.570> very<00:01:10.290> rich

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
grass be aware that grass is very rich

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.179 
grass be aware that grass is very rich
in<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.400> fiber<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:13.200> rich<00:01:13.409> yeah<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
in a fiber really rich yeah and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.460 
in a fiber really rich yeah and
generally<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.240> tend<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.869> eat<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.290> much

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
generally we tend to not eat that much

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.100 
generally we tend to not eat that much
fiber<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.040> our<00:01:17.159> diets<00:01:17.549> when<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.540> become<00:01:18.930> raw

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
fiber in our diets when we become raw

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.020 
fiber in our diets when we become raw
foodist<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.710> start<00:01:19.950> eating<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.369> fiber<00:01:20.640> but

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
foodist we start eating more fiber but

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
foodist we start eating more fiber but
if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> go<00:01:21.360> from<00:01:21.570> eating<00:01:21.900> low<00:01:22.380> fiber<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.009> high

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
if you go from eating low fiber to high

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
if you go from eating low fiber to high
fiber<00:01:23.460> right<00:01:23.729> away<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.780> cause<00:01:24.960> some

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
fiber right away back and cause some

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
fiber right away back and cause some
problems<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.490> taking<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> sponge

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
problems it's like taking a sponge

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.780 
problems it's like taking a sponge
that's<00:01:28.020> way<00:01:28.290> too<00:01:28.320> big<00:01:28.740> shoving<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.520> small

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
that's way too big shoving it in a small

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.190 
that's way too big shoving it in a small
jar<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.210> getting<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:30.810> bit<00:01:30.990> wet

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
jar and getting it a little bit wet

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.830 
jar and getting it a little bit wet
you're<00:01:31.470> not<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.850> pull<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.540> sponge

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you're not going to pull the the sponge

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
you're not going to pull the the sponge
out<00:01:33.990> right<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.290> gonna<00:01:34.409> get<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> little

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
out right you're gonna get a little

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.819 
out right you're gonna get a little
constipated<00:01:35.369> maybe<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.869> increase<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.619> fiber

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
constipated maybe so increase the fiber

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.749 
constipated maybe so increase the fiber
slowly<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:39.299> grass<00:01:39.630> specifically<00:01:40.759> our

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
slowly and with grass specifically our

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
slowly and with grass specifically our
bodies<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.479> digest<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.290> too<00:01:43.470> well<00:01:43.619> because

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
bodies don't digest it too well because

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.580 
bodies don't digest it too well because
we<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.220> seven<00:01:44.700> stomachs<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.990> unless

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
we don't have seven stomachs so unless

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
we don't have seven stomachs so unless
you're<00:01:46.829> blending<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.640> blender<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.299> would

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you're blending it in a blender I would

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.280 
you're blending it in a blender I would
just<00:01:48.990> advise<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.649> chew<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> grass

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
just advise that you chew the grass

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.749 
just advise that you chew the grass

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
drink the juices and spit out the pulp

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.630 
drink the juices and spit out the pulp
