and I think that that's part of the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.660 
and I think that that's part of the
reason<00:02:18.220> why<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:20.110> know<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.230> just<00:02:20.770> liked<00:02:21.310> the

lessons<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.460> book<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.360> lessons<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:25.990> are

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
lessons in the book the lessons that are

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.550 
lessons in the book the lessons that are
taught<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.190> soldier<00:02:27.880> expresses<00:02:28.690> in

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.740 
taught that that soldier expresses in
her<00:02:29.800> writing<00:02:30.190> are<00:02:30.370> very<00:02:30.640> very<00:02:30.970> important<00:02:31.600> I

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
her writing are very very important I

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.390

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
the book when I was a little younger it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.040 
the book when I was a little younger it
would<00:02:35.470> have<00:02:35.560> added<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:37.480> know<00:02:37.600> my<00:02:37.750> thought
