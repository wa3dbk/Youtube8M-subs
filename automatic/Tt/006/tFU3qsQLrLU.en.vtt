00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.000
 bigger 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.110

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.500
 the stadium 12 units 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.180

 I always love you 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.660
 in the first part we use these 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.660
 chords here the biggest sun 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.780
 of the colony that is practically the same only 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.239
 bigger only that we descend these two 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.239
 them here O error is greater 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.209
 the first part is thus the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.410
 thoughts, let's get it, do not 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:09.900
 implement a smile that got me 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.360
 brightness of my eyes 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.890
 taught that it is 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.890
 the first kiss 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.270
 there is present 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.790
 and today is my love, your love is me 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.470
 I'll play a rhythm once slowly and 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.470
 right after that shows you how to do it 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.719
 the explanation will be divided into three 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.329
 parts in the first part we start 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.569
 riding only bigger and plays twice to 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.569
 low 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.650
 in the second part we play two 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.909
 top 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.909
 and one down 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.880
 now joining the two parties 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.349
 to close the rhythm have a third part 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.810
 Where are we going to play down to? 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.810
 one up one up one up 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.739
 the full rhythm stays like this 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.960
 that's it, this is the rhythm that we 're going to 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.040
 use to play virtually the music 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.630
 entire 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.910
 it will only change at the very end lebron 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.310
 but the rest of the song will be played 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.310
 once in each chord like this 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:10.950
 to play the chorus we use these 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:20.060
 agreements here only higher hello column 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:20.060
 only minor combat in itself in D major 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:29.289
 looks just ask me the world take calls on the moon 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:29.289
 He will not even die 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:39.900
 and undo 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.900
 to make you happy and feel free to deny 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.539
 I love you now and I will always love you 

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:50.459
 the first chords of the chorus the people 

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:52.289
 will continue to play the same rhythm 

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:53.459
 And I just taught once in 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.379
 each chord 

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:56.849
 after that when you get in the four 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.069
 last chords of the passage 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.219
 the rhythm has a slight change looks 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.219
 only 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.169
 the change is now 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:37.350
 It's good when we get to the smaller home. 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.350
 We're going to play like this. 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.670
 one down 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.540
 then four alternating beats 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.540
 starting with one down 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:01.639
 in continuation, just play the same way 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.320
 in the chords that comes in the sequence to 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.330
 watch more videos and learn more 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.520
 music is just entering the 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.020
 doubt leave a comment here beauty 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.020
 It's good and until the next
