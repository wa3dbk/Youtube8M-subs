00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:12.180 

so<00:00:09.459> I<00:00:09.639> was<00:00:09.850> really<00:00:10.360> cramped<00:00:10.690> I<00:00:10.950> had<00:00:11.950> to<00:00:12.039> study

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
so I was really cramped I had to study

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.860 
so I was really cramped I had to study
for<00:00:12.280> a<00:00:12.400> calculus<00:00:12.730> exam

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
for a calculus exam

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.590 
for a calculus exam
didn't<00:00:14.200> necessarily<00:00:14.349> get<00:00:14.800> done<00:00:15.010> well<00:00:15.820> but

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
didn't necessarily get done well but

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.590 
didn't necessarily get done well but
let's<00:00:16.869> just<00:00:17.080> see<00:00:17.170> how<00:00:17.289> it<00:00:17.380> goes<00:00:17.470> okay<00:00:18.600> well

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
let's just see how it goes okay well

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.620 
let's just see how it goes okay well
basically<00:00:19.810> as<00:00:20.200> a<00:00:20.230> kid<00:00:20.470> I<00:00:20.680> watched<00:00:21.610> Star<00:00:22.180> Wars<00:00:22.509> a

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
basically as a kid I watched Star Wars a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.440 
basically as a kid I watched Star Wars a
lot<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:23.080> I<00:00:23.800> definitely<00:00:24.340> loved<00:00:24.910> seeing<00:00:25.330> all

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
lot and I definitely loved seeing all

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.210 
lot and I definitely loved seeing all
the<00:00:25.599> different<00:00:25.960> kinds<00:00:26.230> of<00:00:26.259> robots<00:00:26.619> there<00:00:26.890> so

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
the different kinds of robots there so

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.640 
the different kinds of robots there so
now<00:00:27.430> that<00:00:27.910> I<00:00:27.970> want<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.240> be<00:00:28.330> a<00:00:28.360> doctor<00:00:28.599> I<00:00:28.930> thought

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
now that I want to be a doctor I thought

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.319 
now that I want to be a doctor I thought
about<00:00:30.040> looking<00:00:30.220> into<00:00:30.489> robots<00:00:30.820> and<00:00:30.970> medicine

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
about looking into robots and medicine

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.670 
about looking into robots and medicine
and<00:00:31.540> you<00:00:31.660> definitely<00:00:32.259> see<00:00:32.380> them<00:00:32.529> in<00:00:32.619> the

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
and you definitely see them in the

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.260 
and you definitely see them in the
hospitals<00:00:33.070> all<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.250> time<00:00:33.399> so<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:33.850> thought

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
hospitals all the time so I thought

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.090 
hospitals all the time so I thought
that'd<00:00:34.450> be<00:00:34.480> a<00:00:34.600> good<00:00:34.780> topic<00:00:34.960> I<00:00:35.290> also<00:00:35.590> heard

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
that'd be a good topic I also heard

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.549 
that'd be a good topic I also heard
about<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.309> woman<00:00:36.579> in<00:00:36.730> New<00:00:36.850> Jersey<00:00:36.910> who<00:00:37.780> had<00:00:38.350> a

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
about a woman in New Jersey who had a

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.069 
about a woman in New Jersey who had a
kidney<00:00:39.130> transplant<00:00:39.520> operation<00:00:40.420> done<00:00:40.719> by<00:00:41.050> a

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
kidney transplant operation done by a

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.080 
kidney transplant operation done by a
robot<00:00:41.620> well<00:00:42.460> except<00:00:42.730> there<00:00:42.790> was<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:42.940> live

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
robot well except there was a live

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.810 
robot well except there was a live
surgeon<00:00:43.480> that<00:00:43.690> powered<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.380> robot<00:00:44.710> so<00:00:45.010> they

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
surgeon that powered the robot so they

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.450 
surgeon that powered the robot so they
did<00:00:46.000> it<00:00:46.089> together

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
did it together

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.650 
did it together
first<00:00:48.460> though<00:00:48.609> there<00:00:48.820> are<00:00:49.000> orderly<00:00:49.480> robots

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
first though there are orderly robots

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.380 
first though there are orderly robots
that<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:51.640> they<00:00:51.730> carry<00:00:51.910> stuff<00:00:52.149> around<00:00:52.210> the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
that will they carry stuff around the

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.139 
that will they carry stuff around the
hospital<00:00:52.780> basically<00:00:53.530> oh<00:00:54.100> here's<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:54.999> picture

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
hospital basically oh here's a picture

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.649 
hospital basically oh here's a picture
of<00:00:55.329> one<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.670> it's<00:00:58.030> kind<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.269> like<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.420> square

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
of one it's it's kind of like a square

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.819 
of one it's it's kind of like a square
r2d2<00:00:59.260> as<00:00:59.559> you<00:01:00.159> can<00:01:00.280> see<00:01:00.899> my<00:01:01.899> mark<00:01:02.289> Weigel<00:01:02.679> says

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
r2d2 as you can see my mark Weigel says

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.200 
r2d2 as you can see my mark Weigel says
these<00:01:03.399> robots<00:01:03.789> are<00:01:04.260> fast<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:05.500> efficient<00:01:06.040> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
these robots are fast and efficient and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.570 
these robots are fast and efficient and
they<00:01:07.210> save<00:01:07.510> hospitals<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.110> ton<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.350> time<00:01:08.650> so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
they save hospitals a ton of time so

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.580 
they save hospitals a ton of time so
obviously<00:01:09.940> that's<00:01:10.510> important<00:01:10.960> they<00:01:11.409> use

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
obviously that's important they use

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.990 
obviously that's important they use
invisible<00:01:12.040> light<00:01:12.250> beams<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.640> get<00:01:12.729> around

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
invisible light beams to get around

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.740 
invisible light beams to get around
these<00:01:13.810> beams<00:01:14.020> are<00:01:14.350> called<00:01:14.680> light<00:01:14.950> whiskers

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
these beams are called light whiskers

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.150 
these beams are called light whiskers
but<00:01:16.750> because<00:01:17.200> they're<00:01:17.320> invisible<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.830> actually

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
but because they're invisible I actually

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.550 
but because they're invisible I actually
can't<00:01:18.490> show<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:19.000> picture<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.390> them

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
can't show you a picture of them

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.110 
can't show you a picture of them
unfortunately<00:01:20.560> but<00:01:21.160> I'm<00:01:21.700> sure<00:01:21.910> they<00:01:22.000> look

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
unfortunately but I'm sure they look

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.240 
unfortunately but I'm sure they look
really<00:01:22.450> cool<00:01:22.600> still<00:01:22.900> I<00:01:23.350> can't<00:01:24.010> tell<00:01:24.190> you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
really cool still I can't tell you

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.620 
really cool still I can't tell you
though<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.490> robots<00:01:24.820> communicate<00:01:25.330> with<00:01:25.480> each

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
though the robots communicate with each

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.480 
though the robots communicate with each
other<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.680> they<00:01:26.800> can<00:01:26.980> actually<00:01:27.130> figure<00:01:27.370> out

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
other so they can actually figure out

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.320 
other so they can actually figure out
how<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.700> get<00:01:27.850> around<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.150> hospital

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
how to get around the hospital

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.220 
how to get around the hospital
efficiently<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.430> next<00:01:30.640> robot<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.870> remote

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
efficiently the next robot is the remote

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.220 
efficiently the next robot is the remote
presents<00:01:32.920> robots<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:33.730> they<00:01:34.630> are<00:01:34.780> different

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
presents robots and they are different

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.470 
presents robots and they are different
than<00:01:35.320> orderly<00:01:35.680> robots<00:01:35.910> they<00:01:36.910> actually<00:01:37.300> let

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
than orderly robots they actually let

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.740 
than orderly robots they actually let
doctors<00:01:37.990> see<00:01:38.380> patients<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.160> that's<00:01:40.030> when<00:01:40.630> the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
doctors see patients and that's when the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.510 
doctors see patients and that's when the
doctor<00:01:40.780> isn't<00:01:41.200> there<00:01:41.290> normally<00:01:42.100> they<00:01:42.340> can

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
doctor isn't there normally they can

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.710 
doctor isn't there normally they can
obviously<00:01:42.940> but<00:01:43.090> when<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.270> doctor<00:01:43.540> is<00:01:43.570> not

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
obviously but when the doctor is not

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.480 
obviously but when the doctor is not
there<00:01:43.870> they<00:01:44.020> can<00:01:44.140> still<00:01:44.350> communicate<00:01:45.010> the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
there they can still communicate the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.490 
there they can still communicate the
doctor<00:01:45.940> uses<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.240> camera<00:01:46.660> to<00:01:46.930> see<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.170> patient

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
doctor uses a camera to see the patient

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.140 
doctor uses a camera to see the patient
and<00:01:47.560> then<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:48.220> patient<00:01:48.520> can<00:01:48.640> see<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.880> doctor

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
and then the patient can see the doctor

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.270 
and then the patient can see the doctor
on<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.300> screen<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.840> actually<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.860> can<00:01:51.010> see

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
on the screen and actually you can see

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.930 
on the screen and actually you can see
from<00:01:52.150> these<00:01:52.330> photographs<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.680> this<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.580> a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
from these photographs that this is a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.580 
from these photographs that this is a
remote<00:01:55.510> present<00:01:55.870> or<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> lot<00:01:56.170> kind<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.440> like

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
remote present or a lot kind of like

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.860 
remote present or a lot kind of like
Skype<00:01:57.190> on<00:01:57.370> wheels<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.360> they<00:01:58.540> can<00:01:58.720> communicate

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
Skype on wheels so they can communicate

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.840

right now as well I found a magazine
article<00:02:02.560> called<00:02:02.950> hospital<00:02:03.340> management<00:02:03.610> and

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
article called hospital management and

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.770

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
it said that remote presence robots are

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.389 
it said that remote presence robots are
used<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:07.930> hundreds<00:02:08.259> of<00:02:08.289> hospitals<00:02:08.739> so

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
used in hundreds of hospitals so

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.400 
used in hundreds of hospitals so
obviously<00:02:09.940> there<00:02:10.300> is<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.479> trend<00:02:10.810> in<00:02:11.019> using

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
obviously there is a trend in using

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.150 
obviously there is a trend in using
these<00:02:11.530> machines<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.489> it's<00:02:12.760> quite<00:02:13.450> useful<00:02:14.160> my

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
these machines and it's quite useful my

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.369 
these machines and it's quite useful my
favourite<00:02:15.489> robot<00:02:15.640> though<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:17.019> da<00:02:17.140> Vinci

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379

actually<00:02:24.849> had<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.390> picture<00:02:25.719> specifically<00:02:26.290> of

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
actually had a picture specifically of

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.809 
actually had a picture specifically of
the<00:02:26.439> robot

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
the robot

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.910 
the robot
but<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> couldn't<00:02:28.420> find<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:29.049> this<00:02:29.349> morning<00:02:29.650> when

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.880 
but I couldn't find it this morning when
I<00:02:29.950> double-checked<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.690> obviously<00:02:31.690> I'm<00:02:32.680> here

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
I double-checked and obviously I'm here

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.309 
I double-checked and obviously I'm here
now<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.310> didn't<00:02:33.700> have<00:02:33.760> time<00:02:33.909> but<00:02:34.540> it's

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
now and didn't have time but it's

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.380 
now and didn't have time but it's
definitely<00:02:35.709> cool<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.129> robot<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:36.940> got<00:02:37.120> a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
definitely cool the robot and it's got a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.630 
definitely cool the robot and it's got a
lot<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.720> arms<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.709> kind<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.250> looks<00:02:39.430> like<00:02:39.489> an

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
lot of arms and it kind of looks like an

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.440 
lot of arms and it kind of looks like an
octopus<00:02:40.379> like<00:02:41.379> dr.<00:02:41.709> octopus<00:02:42.069> almost<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:42.819> it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
octopus like dr. octopus almost and it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.339 
octopus like dr. octopus almost and it
basically<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.400> surgery<00:02:45.909> machine

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
basically is the surgery machine

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.119 
basically is the surgery machine
according<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.440> an<00:02:47.530> article<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.860> read<00:02:47.980> the

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
according to an article I read the

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.770 
according to an article I read the
doctor<00:02:48.430> moves<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> arms<00:02:49.090> from<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.420> terminal

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
doctor moves the arms from the terminal

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.680 
doctor moves the arms from the terminal
using<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:50.319> kind<00:02:50.769> of<00:02:50.920> controller<00:02:51.909> and<00:02:52.180> he

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
using a kind of controller and he

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.289 
using a kind of controller and he
actually<00:02:52.810> uses<00:02:53.230> like<00:02:53.440> 3d<00:02:54.010> imaging<00:02:54.489> as<00:02:54.610> well<00:02:54.670> so

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
actually uses like 3d imaging as well so

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.410 
actually uses like 3d imaging as well so
it's<00:02:55.450> sort<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.780> like<00:02:55.840> playing<00:02:56.670> xbox<00:02:57.670> or<00:02:58.060> Halo

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
it's sort of like playing xbox or Halo

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.710 
it's sort of like playing xbox or Halo
on<00:02:58.799> 3d<00:02:59.799> TV<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.579> it's<00:03:00.700> probably<00:03:01.000> fun<00:03:01.269> but<00:03:01.599> the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
on 3d TV so it's probably fun but the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.420 
on 3d TV so it's probably fun but the
doctor<00:03:01.989> himself<00:03:02.079> doesn't<00:03:02.470> ever<00:03:02.799> touch<00:03:03.220> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
doctor himself doesn't ever touch the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.550 
doctor himself doesn't ever touch the
patient<00:03:03.760> only<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.780> robot<00:03:05.079> touches<00:03:05.470> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
patient only the robot touches the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.089 
patient only the robot touches the
patient<00:03:05.890> in<00:03:06.700> conclusion<00:03:07.180> that's<00:03:08.140> my<00:03:08.290> speech<00:03:08.470> I

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
patient in conclusion that's my speech I

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.030 
patient in conclusion that's my speech I
hope<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.180> see<00:03:10.780> why<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:11.260> find<00:03:11.620> robots<00:03:11.920> so

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
hope you see why I find robots so

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.990 
hope you see why I find robots so
interesting

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
interesting

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.059 
interesting
they're<00:03:13.510> definitely<00:03:13.810> changing<00:03:14.530> medicine<00:03:14.739> and

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
they're definitely changing medicine and

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.520 
they're definitely changing medicine and
I'm<00:03:15.730> sure<00:03:16.090> they<00:03:16.269> will<00:03:16.450> all<00:03:16.659> the<00:03:16.930> way<00:03:17.019> into<00:03:17.440> the

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
I'm sure they will all the way into the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.979 
I'm sure they will all the way into the
