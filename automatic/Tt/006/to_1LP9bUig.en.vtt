so you can make torches signs and
ladders<00:00:15.379> float<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.619> midair<00:00:17.090> just<00:00:18.090> by<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.480> to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
ladders float in midair just by going to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.230 
ladders float in midair just by going to
inflate<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.680> version<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.100> Minecraft<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.210> I

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
inflate a version of Minecraft so I

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.630 
inflate a version of Minecraft so I
figured<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.810> out<00:00:22.050> because<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.250> making<00:00:23.550> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
figured this out because I was making a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.910 
figured this out because I was making a
world<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.210> involved<00:00:24.689> or<00:00:25.500> there<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
world but involved or there was like a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.689 
world but involved or there was like a
parkour<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:28.010> what<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.039> did<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.550> was

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
parkour so I'm what I did was I was

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.440 
parkour so I'm what I did was I was
doing<00:00:29.939> them<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.689> cooler<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.560> ladders<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.450> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
doing them are cooler with ladders and I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.020 
doing them are cooler with ladders and I
put<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.590> court<00:00:34.980> which<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.880> this

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
put it on court which is what this

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.930 
put it on court which is what this
buckles<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.600> here<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.370> downloaded

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
buckles are here and then I downloaded

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.319 
buckles are here and then I downloaded
up<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.329> find<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.250> that<00:00:41.250> made<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> an

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
up to find and that made it go to an

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.060 
up to find and that made it go to an
earlier<00:00:42.660> version<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:43.620> only<00:00:43.770> way<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
earlier version that was only way that I

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
earlier version that was only way that I
could<00:00:44.190> make<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.340> work<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.760> by<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.360> an

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
could make it work with by going to an

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.630 
could make it work with by going to an
earlier<00:00:45.690> version<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> did<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.480> I

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
earlier version so I did that and I

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.610 
earlier version so I did that and I
opened<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> world<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.140> court<00:00:52.469> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
opened up the world and all the court is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220 
opened up the world and all the court is
gone<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.699> lags<00:00:53.969> are<00:00:54.180> still<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
gone but the lags are still there so you

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
gone but the lags are still there so you
know<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> tested<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.489> some<00:00:56.640> stuff

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
know I tested it out with some stuff

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.319 
know I tested it out with some stuff
like<00:00:57.570> signs<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.500> coaches<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.059> works<00:01:00.239> for

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like signs and coaches and it works for

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.229 
like signs and coaches and it works for
plenty<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.379> gonna<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.879> something<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> show

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
plenty so I'm gonna do something to show

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.530 
plenty so I'm gonna do something to show
you<00:01:03.300> that's<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:05.280> go<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.880> I'm<00:01:06.090> you're<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.390> the

you that's you go so I'm you're in the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.039 
you that's you go so I'm you're in the
quick<00:01:06.750> open<00:01:07.080> six<00:01:07.729> on<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> printer

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
quick open six on it the printer

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
quick open six on it the printer
pull<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.790> Alaska

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
pull up so I'm going to go in Alaska

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.050 
pull up so I'm going to go in Alaska
might<00:01:12.600> take<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> while<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.990> load<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.850> well<00:01:14.850> once

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
might take a while to load up well once

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.899 
might take a while to load up well once
it<00:01:15.180> does<00:01:15.360> you'll<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> course<00:01:17.729> will

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it does you'll see that the course will

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.780 
it does you'll see that the course will
be<00:01:18.000> gone<00:01:18.380> but<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> items<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.430> still<00:01:20.700> be

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
be gone but the items will still be

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.219 
be gone but the items will still be
there<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.479> I'll<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.750> floating<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> um<00:01:24.229> it

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
there and I'll be floating so um it

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.270 
there and I'll be floating so um it
probably<00:01:25.680> works<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.040> other<00:01:26.250> things<00:01:26.520> like

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
probably works with other things like

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.160 
probably works with other things like
paintings<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.610> stuff<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.079> can

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
paintings and stuff like that or you can

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.410 
paintings and stuff like that or you can
just<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.470> float<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.909> um<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
just have it float in there but um I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
just have it float in there but um I
have<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.409> tested<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.979> yet

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
have not tested that yet

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.399 
have not tested that yet
so<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:37.159> might<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.670> future<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:40.020> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
so I might do that in future but or you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.840 
so I might do that in future but or you
guys<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:40.950> look<00:01:41.100> down<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.579> figure<00:01:41.790> out

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
guys can just look down and figure out

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.899 
guys can just look down and figure out
the<00:01:42.060> words<00:01:42.210> alright<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:44.220> I'm<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the words alright so now I'm going to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.510 
the words alright so now I'm going to
see<00:01:45.500> if<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.829> worked

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
see if it worked

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.690 
see if it worked
and<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.030> try<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> first<00:01:48.540> time<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.700> blowing

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and I try the first time and go blowing

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.520 
and I try the first time and go blowing
in<00:01:50.939> every<00:01:51.119> angle<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:52.170> tried<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.439> couple

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
in every angle I just tried a couple

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.639 
in every angle I just tried a couple
times<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.040> wasn't<00:01:53.310> working<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.470> it's<00:01:55.470> working

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
times it wasn't working so it's working

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.719 
times it wasn't working so it's working
that<00:01:55.890> okay<00:01:56.159> awesome

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
that okay awesome

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.149 
that okay awesome
so<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.350> flowing<00:01:58.829> blocks

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
so as you can see we have flowing blocks

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.819 
so as you can see we have flowing blocks
there<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.670> no<00:01:59.909> ports<00:02:00.329> behind<00:02:00.630> them<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
there is no ports behind them and you

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.929 
there is no ports behind them and you
can<00:02:02.040> actually<00:02:02.310> walk<00:02:02.700> through<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.630> signs<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
can actually walk through the signs and

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.600 
can actually walk through the signs and
torches<00:02:06.560> but<00:02:07.560> then<00:02:07.829> if<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.190> try<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> walk

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
torches but then if you try to walk

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.180 
torches but then if you try to walk
through<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.660> ladder<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.259> actually<00:02:10.950> still

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
through the ladder it actually still

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.750 
through the ladder it actually still
works

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
works

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.220 
works
as<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.879> letter<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.780> actually<00:02:12.870> climb

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
as a letter and you can actually climb

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.830 
as a letter and you can actually climb
it<00:02:13.409> and<00:02:14.129> then<00:02:14.280> go<00:02:14.400> over<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.689> when<00:02:15.810> you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it and then go over it so then when you

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.229 
it and then go over it so then when you
end<00:02:16.049> up<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.349> back<00:02:16.530> side<00:02:16.879> you<00:02:17.879> actually

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
end up on the back side you actually

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.869 
end up on the back side you actually
can't<00:02:18.569> see<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:19.079> ladders<00:02:19.379> nor<00:02:20.220> walk<00:02:20.549> through

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
can't see the ladders nor walk through

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.699 
can't see the ladders nor walk through
them<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.019> actually<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> really<00:02:22.560> good

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
them so this is actually a really good

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.860 
them so this is actually a really good
way<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.950> make<00:02:23.159> kind<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.819> an<00:02:23.909> invisible<00:02:24.180> wall<00:02:24.629> is

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
way to make kind of an invisible wall is

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.309 
way to make kind of an invisible wall is
if<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:25.709> set<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.129> a<00:02:26.220> big<00:02:26.480> line<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.750> ladders

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
if you just set up a big line of ladders

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.149 
if you just set up a big line of ladders
and<00:02:28.709> then<00:02:29.549> just<00:02:30.209> do<00:02:30.329> this<00:02:30.480> trick<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.159> got

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
and then just do this trick you got

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.750 
and then just do this trick you got
invisible<00:02:33.090> wall<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> pretty<00:02:35.610> good

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
invisible wall so this is a pretty good

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.679 
invisible wall so this is a pretty good
way<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:37.159> like<00:02:40.819> wait<00:02:41.819> this<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> good<00:02:42.569> way

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
way to have like wait this is a good way

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.530 
way to have like wait this is a good way
to<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:43.049> like<00:02:43.349> welding<00:02:44.310> torches<00:02:44.909> in<00:02:45.390> your

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
to have like welding torches in your

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.809 
to have like welding torches in your
house<00:02:45.690> if<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.109> don't<00:02:46.140> have<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.980> block

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
house if you don't have just a block

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.839 
house if you don't have just a block
that's<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.299> your<00:02:48.450> way<00:02:48.659> then<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.829> can<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:50.280> put

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
that's in your way then you can like put

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.899 
that's in your way then you can like put
a<00:02:50.879> torch<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.629> it'll<00:02:51.840> still<00:02:52.019> be<00:02:52.109> a<00:02:52.139> light<00:02:52.409> source

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
a torch so it'll still be a light source

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.220 
a torch so it'll still be a light source
but<00:02:53.909> there<00:02:54.090> won't<00:02:54.239> be<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.389> block<00:02:54.690> that's<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.109> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
but there won't be a block that's in the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.640 
but there won't be a block that's in the
way<00:02:55.409> you<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:55.799> walk<00:02:56.040> right<00:02:56.250> into<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.819> so<00:02:57.650> yeah

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
way you just walk right into it so yeah

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.770 
way you just walk right into it so yeah
and<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.370> can<00:02:59.489> just<00:02:59.639> have<00:02:59.790> ladders<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
and you can just have ladders in the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.619 
and you can just have ladders in the
middle<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.109> your<00:03:01.400> absolute<00:03:02.400> or<00:03:03.180> science

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
middle of your absolute or science

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.030 
middle of your absolute or science
whatever<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.079> want<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.349> with<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.769> a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
after actually finish in a video and I

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.160 
after actually finish in a video and I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
said man so um I made floating roller

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.550 
said man so um I made floating roller
coaster<00:03:47.820> now<00:03:48.820> this<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.210> the<00:03:49.330> same<00:03:49.600> concept<00:03:50.110> as

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
coaster now this is the same concept as

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.980 
coaster now this is the same concept as
the<00:03:51.420> wooden<00:03:52.420> blocks

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
the wooden blocks

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.860 
the wooden blocks
you<00:03:53.350> just<00:03:53.530> place<00:03:53.710> it<00:03:53.740> on<00:03:53.980> top<00:03:54.310> instead<00:03:55.300> of<00:03:55.390> on

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
you just place it on top instead of on

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.560 
you just place it on top instead of on
the<00:03:55.930> side<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.940> only<00:03:57.970> reason<00:03:58.360> I'm<00:03:58.420> using

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
the side and the only reason I'm using

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.330 
the side and the only reason I'm using
the<00:03:58.750> stairs<00:03:58.990> as<00:03:59.110> protectors<00:03:59.560> redstone<00:04:00.070> and

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
the stairs as protectors redstone and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.240 
the stairs as protectors redstone and
I'm<00:04:00.730> pretty<00:04:01.030> sure<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:02.410> redstone<00:04:03.010> would

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
I'm pretty sure that the redstone would

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.390 
I'm pretty sure that the redstone would
actually<00:04:03.610> disappear<00:04:04.560> or<00:04:05.560> like<00:04:05.830> breaker

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
actually disappear or like breaker

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.080 
actually disappear or like breaker
whatever<00:04:07.120> once<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:08.730> equipment<00:04:09.730> question

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
whatever once you equipment question

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.300 
whatever once you equipment question
because<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.140> becomes<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.560> neat<00:04:11.740> blog<00:04:12.010> and

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
because that becomes a neat blog and

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.710 
because that becomes a neat blog and
they're<00:04:12.550> made<00:04:12.760> quick<00:04:13.210> so<00:04:14.140> um<00:04:15.270> let's<00:04:16.270> just<00:04:16.390> test

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
they're made quick so um let's just test

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.050 
they're made quick so um let's just test
this<00:04:16.840> out<00:04:17.020> I<00:04:17.489> think<00:04:18.489> I'm<00:04:18.640> going<00:04:18.790> to<00:04:18.880> do<00:04:18.940> it

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
this out I think I'm going to do it
