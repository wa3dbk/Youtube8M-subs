00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:42.490 

heavy<00:01:35.270> stuff<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:40.840> basically<00:01:41.840> everything<00:01:42.350> in

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.150 

I<00:02:10.750> regard<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.930> drop<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.410> drum<00:02:12.620> song<00:02:12.890> being

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
I regard to drop the drum song being

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.920 
I regard to drop the drum song being
alive<00:02:13.940> as<00:02:14.180> I'm<00:02:14.360> Indrani<00:02:16.390> that's<00:02:17.390> actually<00:02:17.660> the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
alive as I'm Indrani that's actually the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.410 
alive as I'm Indrani that's actually the
main<00:02:18.080> reason<00:02:18.280> why<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:19.430> chose<00:02:19.580> books<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.270> do

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
main reason why we chose books to do

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.500 
main reason why we chose books to do
cost<00:02:21.110> after<00:02:21.820> room<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:24.410> gives<00:02:25.510> lots

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
cost after room and this gives lots

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.570 
cost after room and this gives lots
atmosphere<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.560> gums<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:29.290> may<00:02:30.290> make<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
atmosphere to the gums and may make the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.310 
atmosphere to the gums and may make the
sound<00:02:31.820> bigger<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.080> wider<00:02:35.620> instead<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.650> using

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
sound bigger and wider instead of using

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.250 
sound bigger and wider instead of using
rivers<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.790> plugins<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:41.090> Pro<00:02:41.420> Tools<00:02:41.450> you
