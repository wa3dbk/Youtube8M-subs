00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.340
 with the miguelito on this occasion 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.460
 I bring the video where you will learn how 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.230
 multiply your minecraft minerals 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.030
 because I told you with the mineral I 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:19.930
 I mean gold to iron and still 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:23.340
 and he is diamonds good this serves the 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.910
 Android as apple devices 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.430
 unit with a theme 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.610
 I have then a world where there is a 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.610
 multiple duplicate our channels 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.699
 this world I did it with a being that 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.680
 I knew where I found the 29 and lover 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.820
 day 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.520
 semicolon multiply of the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.880
 diamonds 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:57.460
 from the minimum term to nine for 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.460
 can make a diamond block 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.300
 we go to the table 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.060
 we make our block 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.159
 and throughout our block what we have 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.579
 what to do next is to place it 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.659
 it's the colorado all the two that happy 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.179
 from minecraft 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.049
 we do not have to completely close the 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.049
 multitask 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.290
 and then we can open 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.580
 and that's as easy as duplicates 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.580
 our diamond 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.460
 You can not turn on 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.530
 diamonds 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.530
 so that we have 18 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.840
 and 318 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.410
 I think the most that can be done for 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.600
 duplicate are up to seven blocks do not 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.120
 I have very understood because the cinema 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.990
 before I had another world and in the other 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.080
 doubles this advance but it's like what 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.750
 more than is installed 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.390
 but in time 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.590
 control participates 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.030
 I can see what we have left 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.030
 and people circulated 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.750
 because that moment 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.940
 and the speed the conversions in 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.290
 blocks 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.290
 I have seven blocks 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.750
 and the taxis place 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.460
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.460
 and again we have to leave 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.500
 this sound completely 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.370
 the three streams 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.530
 and stickers of the world 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.380
 and salvation doubled three of them 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.990
 that I understand with everything of yes thus 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.290
 multiple use if they duplicate everything if a 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.680
 Sometimes it's just a matter of being 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.680
 doing it 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.210
 although with this one with those three is fine 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.950
 because in these worlds of minecraft that 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.220
 they tell you it 's very difficult to find these 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.430
 minerals if they want to do so be the 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.520
 I can allow the exclusion or leave 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.530
 a video with the three best series in 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.820
 ready to man craft because they want to 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.440
 find diamond literally down from 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.220
 the others 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.880
 so with nothing else to do is 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.880
 heart like customer share the 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.880
 goodbye
