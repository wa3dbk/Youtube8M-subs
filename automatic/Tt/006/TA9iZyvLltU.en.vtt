the<00:00:31.330> easiest<00:00:31.870> possible<00:00:32.110> version<00:00:32.770> you<00:00:32.890> can<00:00:33.040> do

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
the easiest possible version you can do

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.910 
the easiest possible version you can do
it's<00:00:34.240> next<00:00:34.600> step<00:00:34.780> up<00:00:34.990> in<00:00:35.440> your<00:00:35.680> learning

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
it's next step up in your learning

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.400 
it's next step up in your learning
process<00:00:36.850> because<00:00:37.300> even<00:00:37.870> though<00:00:37.960> it's<00:00:38.080> simple

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
process because even though it's simple

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.990 
process because even though it's simple
Forge<00:00:38.710> you're<00:00:38.950> moving<00:00:39.220> up<00:00:39.310> and<00:00:39.460> down<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.820> neck

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
Forge you're moving up and down the neck

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.370 
Forge you're moving up and down the neck
so<00:00:40.330> it<00:00:40.480> gets<00:00:40.720> you<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:40.900> little<00:00:41.140> bit<00:00:41.230> more

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
so it gets you a little bit more

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.700 
so it gets you a little bit more
confused<00:00:41.890> maybe<00:00:42.760> more<00:00:42.970> frustrated<00:00:43.750> but<00:00:44.410> that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
confused maybe more frustrated but that

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.940 
confused maybe more frustrated but that
whole<00:00:44.890> song<00:00:45.190> was<00:00:45.220> done<00:00:45.640> with<00:00:45.820> two<00:00:46.030> ports<00:00:46.950> that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
d-shaped suspended now as we move this

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.540 
d-shaped suspended now as we move this
this<00:02:11.510> obviously<00:02:11.750> it's<00:02:12.140> not<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.590> all<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.459> way

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:33.070 
it's a d-shaped the first chord is going
to<00:02:26.330> be<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.540> D<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:28.270> your<00:02:29.530> 1<00:02:30.530> 2<00:02:30.770> 3<00:02:30.800> 4<00:02:31.190> 5<00:02:31.819> 6<00:02:31.850> 7th<00:02:32.690> fret

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
to be a D on your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7th fret

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.050 
to be a D on your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7th fret
so<00:02:33.410> these<00:02:33.620> two<00:02:33.860> fingers<00:02:34.100> go<00:02:34.370> on<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.580> 7th<00:02:34.940> fret

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
so these two fingers go on the 7th fret

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.449 
so these two fingers go on the 7th fret
and<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.989> third<00:02:36.410> finger<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.860> D<00:02:36.980> goes<00:02:37.220> there

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
and the third finger the D goes there

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.690 
and the third finger the D goes there
but<00:02:37.640> you're<00:02:37.760> going<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:37.970> start<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.269> suspension

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
but you're going to start in suspension

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.790 
but you're going to start in suspension
and<00:02:40.700> live<00:02:41.030> you're<00:02:41.510> suspended<00:02:41.720> your<00:02:42.530> little

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
and live you're suspended your little

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.319 
and live you're suspended your little
finger<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.700> make<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:43.910> regular<00:02:44.180> d<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:46.250> here<00:02:46.459> that

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.899 

okay<00:02:51.329> once<00:02:51.540> we've<00:02:51.719> done<00:02:51.870> one<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.079> those<00:02:52.909> we

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
okay once we've done one of those we

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.300 
okay once we've done one of those we
move<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:54.390> with<00:02:55.200> an<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.250> fifth<00:02:56.489> fret<00:02:58.310> and

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
move up with an a to the fifth fret and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.729 
move up with an a to the fifth fret and
then<00:02:59.370> we<00:03:00.180> add<00:03:00.359> a<00:03:00.390> suspension<00:03:03.079> we<00:03:04.079> do<00:03:04.530> that

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
then we add a suspension we do that

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:12.010 
then we add a suspension we do that
three<00:03:05.010> times

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.600 

I

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.830 

after<00:03:16.610> we<00:03:16.670> do<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:17.000> we<00:03:17.150> move<00:03:17.360> all<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.720> way

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
after we do that we move all the way

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.020 
after we do that we move all the way
down<00:03:18.050> to<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.290> eighth<00:03:18.590> fret<00:03:19.990> and<00:03:20.990> we<00:03:21.380> hit<00:03:21.950> an<00:03:22.070> a

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.070 

and<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.330> two<00:03:26.750> suspensions<00:03:27.200> like<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:29.080> and

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
and a and two suspensions like that and

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.580 
and a and two suspensions like that and
go<00:03:30.260> back<00:03:30.470> up<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.830> five<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:35.360> then<00:03:35.900> this<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.410> gets

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
go back up to five and then this is gets

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.140 
go back up to five and then this is gets
a<00:03:36.650> little<00:03:36.800> different<00:03:37.220> we<00:03:37.310> go<00:03:37.490> up<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.850> here<00:03:38.060> and

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
a little different we go up to here and

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.870 
a little different we go up to here and
start<00:03:38.450> in<00:03:38.690> suspension<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:43.340> move<00:03:43.610> it<00:03:43.760> in

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
start in suspension and move it in

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.440 
start in suspension and move it in
suspension<00:03:44.540> back<00:03:44.720> down

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.570 

slingo<00:03:49.200> from<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> kids<00:03:49.890> up<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.340> third

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
slingo from the kids up to the third

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.670 
slingo from the kids up to the third
from<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.000> third<00:03:51.270> back<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.780> pit<00:03:52.020> in

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
from the third back to the pit in

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:09.240 
from the third back to the pit in
suspension<00:03:53.430> during<00:03:53.730> motion

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.430 

that's<00:04:10.250> it
