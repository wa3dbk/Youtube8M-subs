00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.939
 I will explain a moment because you need to 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.890
 need some kind of foreword the thing is 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.690
 that Sergei Simak was interviewed by radio 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.490
 zenith and generally quite tough 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.740
 spoke valery gas and he said 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.630
 the question was such you remember gas cancer 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.789
 he was simulators simulators like 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.369
 trend cisco agree that I have 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.990
 this is a bait question he answered of course i 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.400
 saw him play of course I know that he 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.320
 was a simulator nevertheless he was 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.029
 look great striker 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.919
 statistics and performance here need 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.660
 pay tribute to him but despite the fact that 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.629
 he was a simulator he was in my opinion 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.550
 still and lazy well awesome saying 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.030
 for for simok and Sergei yet 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.640
 always correct here is straight words 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:48.289
 he hears his words at the zenith site 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.789
 on the zenith site so yes here it is 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.699
 saying about the coach 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.410
 gas his sergey said about his gas 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.339
 as a coach I disagree look at 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.059
 his track record 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:02.690
 See he achieved . and this is only one 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:05.180
 moment but we were playing gas yes yes he 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.189
 so many more about tele telec there as 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.200
 winger before breaking into sometime in 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.439
 passionately beaten there naturally 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.119
 somewhere played along was it 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.159
 with zeros u can't we will i don't know 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.829
 how did u come off but he generally with him a 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.079
 one city and protection and so can not 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.329
 say now the next one is like 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.149
 man called me predicted sorry 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.369
 I want to tell you to discuss Simatta 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.710
 do not have to honestly say 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.920
 Sims here he has the right to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.740
 tell your opinion man by them and we 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.200
 Now expressed their opinion about man 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.110
 and discuss everything here dunk do not want it 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.530
 a person deserving of me personally I am not 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:53.149
 telling everyone not later 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:56.180
 From the phone as for the sims, which means 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.310
 you just say about this great delivery 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.100
 He doesn’t really know it for me either 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.270
 there are people 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.650
 honestly cats well and to the battle battle 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.710
 bodily on the other hand I hate 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.490
 for many reasons yes and ikks gas and how 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.890
 once a list of these people is covered well this 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.680
 a big topic I explained it here 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.500
 I’ll briefly talk about 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:35.720
 With regard to the present case the main thing now 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:39.050
 why you here I respect but there are reasons 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.570
 purely personal personal opponent 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.060
 personally from personal order and there are reasons 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.210
 the cause of which is not yet the time 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.160
 says well let's say and we were not married 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:55.010
 will say says you'll often ask me 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.810
 . let's enjoy my end because 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.770
 as for as for 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.050
 Simok and he heard because what we 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.120
 he didn’t play with him right there he couldn’t 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.310
 see in training everything he heard and we 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.300
 could quite tell what is not 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.880
 loved to run and cooper 's dough here 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:20.330
 tied the cheese and tied you 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:22.489
 bought rams there it's a pit kids then with what 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.330
 not only did he do that 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.520
 medallions give a rumor such 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.650
 and then there is a hundred percent risk 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.340
 large conflict did not get there 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.160
 them there their graters so that's why he 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.620
 wrong put it crown the sky 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.480
 just afraid of these big loads 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.610
 and how and how a footballer thought it all 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.080
 wrong and spoke out and not afraid 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.810
 but when I became a coach 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.209
 he became just like that 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.970
 in short so briefly speaking 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.300
 yes anything here is a football player of their gas 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.340
 on them it would be a football player and a gas trainer 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.520
 he would never play in life 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.010
 climb that's all and that's why 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.580
 when he became when he became coach 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.709
 he began to drive as when he was driven 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.590
 he resented and now it came to 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:23.200
 dasima k and he said wrong 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:32.139
 put it to understand the person he is 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:35.830
 speaks from himself was bright bright it 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.530
 most importantly he could beat a lot could 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.570
 call and i will say that answered in gas 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.430
 visibility magician breathed gas such 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.510
 says his opinions interest me in 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.850
 the first place is not interesting opinion 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.010
 close people who worry about me 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.050
 when I played Seryozh still on foot under the table 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.940
 Went I do not understand with what hangover 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.100
 decided to tell nevertheless each 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.100
 a person has the right to issue such 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.640
 add 1 more month but even added 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.830
 known the same opinions of the players showed 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.160
 Ignashevich gave his time to interview who 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.100
