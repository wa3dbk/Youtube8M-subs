at some of the different tools that we

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.450 
at some of the different tools that we
have<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.519> work<00:00:11.700> with<00:00:12.590> in<00:00:13.590> our<00:00:13.710> studio<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.280> most

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
have to work with in our studio the most

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.939 
have to work with in our studio the most
common<00:00:14.759> thing<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:14.969> use<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:16.049> studio<00:00:16.529> flash

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
common thing to use is the studio flash

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.340 
common thing to use is the studio flash
or<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.520> strobe<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.600> will<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:18.930> getting<00:00:19.050> into

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
or the strobe we will be getting into

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.019 
or the strobe we will be getting into
that<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.279> first<00:00:20.490> we're<00:00:20.760> going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.970> start

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that but at first we're going to start

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.509 
that but at first we're going to start
with<00:00:21.300> tungsten<00:00:22.020> light<00:00:22.470> not<00:00:23.070> very<00:00:23.279> practical

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
with tungsten light not very practical

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.890 
with tungsten light not very practical
and<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.090> really<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> lot<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.570> people<00:00:24.810> are

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and not really a lot of people are

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.330 
and not really a lot of people are
lighting<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.410> tungsten<00:00:25.680> these<00:00:26.039> days

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
lighting with tungsten these days

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.390 
lighting with tungsten these days
because<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.789> certain<00:00:27.420> drawbacks<00:00:28.070> mainly<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
because of certain drawbacks mainly the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.429 
because of certain drawbacks mainly the
heat<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.510> comes<00:00:30.599> off<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.109> not<00:00:31.230> quite

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
heat that comes off and it's not quite

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770 
heat that comes off and it's not quite
as<00:00:31.590> bright<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> studio<00:00:32.550> strobe<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.660> we're

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
as bright as a studio strobe but we're

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.940 
as bright as a studio strobe but we're
going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> start<00:00:34.230> off<00:00:34.350> with<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.649> tungsten

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
going to start off with the tungsten

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.340 
going to start off with the tungsten
light<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.149> let<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.930> see

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
light because it's going to let you see

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
light because it's going to let you see
the<00:00:37.980> changes<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> light<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.329> move<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the changes in the light as we move it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
the changes in the light as we move it
around<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.020> models<00:00:40.379> face<00:00:40.440> move<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.040> closer<00:00:41.340> use

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
around the models face move a closer use

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.250 
around the models face move a closer use
reflectors<00:00:42.600> you'll<00:00:42.719> actually<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:43.020> able<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
reflectors you'll actually be able to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
reflectors you'll actually be able to
see<00:00:43.500> those<00:00:43.680> after<00:00:44.460> you've<00:00:44.610> mastered<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
see those after you've mastered and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.790 
see those after you've mastered and
completely<00:00:45.570> understand<00:00:46.200> what's<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.500> on

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
completely understand what's going on

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.650 
completely understand what's going on
with<00:00:46.980> tungsten<00:00:47.250> light<00:00:47.670> then<00:00:48.239> we're<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
with tungsten light then we're going to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.060 
with tungsten light then we're going to
go<00:00:48.719> into<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.110> studio<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.530> we're<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
go into the studio and we're going to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.150 
go into the studio and we're going to
use<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.430> studio<00:00:50.640> strobe<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:52.379> strobe<00:00:52.710> has<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
use the studio strobe the strobe has a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
use the studio strobe the strobe has a
modeling<00:00:53.730> light<00:00:53.940> which<00:00:54.210> lets<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:55.020> some

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
modeling light which lets you have some

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.020 
modeling light which lets you have some
sort<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.680> an<00:00:55.800> idea<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.550> you're<00:00:56.699> getting

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
sort of an idea of what you're getting

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.549 
sort of an idea of what you're getting
when<00:00:57.120> you're<00:00:57.300> lighting<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.660> subject<00:00:58.140> but

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
when you're lighting your subject but

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.790 
when you're lighting your subject but
it's<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.699> really<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.210> easy<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.870> when<00:01:01.680> you're

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it's not really as easy as when you're

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.590 
it's not really as easy as when you're
using<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.160> tungsten<00:01:02.430> light<00:01:02.879> therefore<00:01:03.480> you've

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
using a tungsten light therefore you've

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.060 
using a tungsten light therefore you've
got<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> understand<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.589> strobe<00:01:04.860> like

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
got to understand your strobe like

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.380 
got to understand your strobe like
you've<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> understand<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> move

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you've got to understand when you move

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
you've got to understand when you move
it<00:01:06.540> around<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:07.110> model<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.560> place<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.890> in

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it around your model and place it in

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
it around your model and place it in
different<00:01:08.250> places<00:01:08.430> exactly<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.570> you're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
different places exactly what you're

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.330 
different places exactly what you're
going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.710> we're<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
going to get so we're going to get to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.190 
going to get so we're going to get to
all<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.460> we're<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> cover<00:01:12.510> umbrellas

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
all that we're going to cover umbrellas

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.620 
all that we're going to cover umbrellas
we're<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> cover<00:01:14.040> reflectors<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.060> lot<00:01:15.509> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
we're going to cover reflectors a lot of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
we're going to cover reflectors a lot of
this<00:01:15.720> stuff<00:01:15.780> gets<00:01:16.200> very<00:01:16.409> expensive<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.580> can

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
this stuff gets very expensive you can

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
this stuff gets very expensive you can
go<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> camera<00:01:19.110> stores<00:01:19.350> you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
go to a lot of the camera stores you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.840 
go to a lot of the camera stores you
could<00:01:19.619> drop<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.950> off<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> lot<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.430> money<00:01:20.460> very
