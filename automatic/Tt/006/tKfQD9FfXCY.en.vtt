negative<00:00:36.360> 30<00:00:36.690> millimeter<00:00:37.230> offset<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.010> they

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
negative 30 millimeter offset so they

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.799 
negative 30 millimeter offset so they
just<00:00:38.309> barely<00:00:38.730> stick<00:00:39.090> out<00:00:39.210> from<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> fender

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
flares but if they weren't on there

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.340 
flares but if they weren't on there
they'd<00:00:41.370> stick<00:00:41.640> out<00:00:41.730> more<00:00:42.079> then<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.230> the

they'd stick out more then on the
running<00:00:43.620> boards<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.219> took<00:00:44.730> them<00:00:44.879> off<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.420> then

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
running boards I took them off and then

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
running boards I took them off and then
coated<00:00:46.770> them<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.340> truck<00:00:48.030> bed<00:00:48.270> liner<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.690> give

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
coated them in truck bed liner to give

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.889 
coated them in truck bed liner to give
him<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:49.079> grip<00:00:49.350> very<00:00:49.700> nice<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.030> advise<00:00:51.570> doing

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
him more grip very nice I advise doing

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
that and the exhaust that came with the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.060 
that and the exhaust that came with the
TRD<00:00:56.190> dual<00:00:56.730> exhaust<00:00:57.149> system<00:00:57.620> which<00:00:58.620> sounded

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
TRD dual exhaust system which sounded

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.250 
TRD dual exhaust system which sounded
nice<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.640> wasn't<00:01:00.120> enough<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.570> me<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
nice but that wasn't enough for me so I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.619 
nice but that wasn't enough for me so I
put<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> flowmaster<00:01:02.460> 40<00:01:02.789> series<00:01:03.030> chamber<00:01:03.510> on

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
put a flowmaster 40 series chamber on

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.649 
put a flowmaster 40 series chamber on
there<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:08.360> that's<00:01:09.360> pretty<00:01:09.479> much

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
there I like it but that's pretty much

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.969 
there I like it but that's pretty much
it<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> outside<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:12.450> inside<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:16.590> yeah

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
speakers they're supposed to have a lot

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.590 
speakers they're supposed to have a lot
of<00:01:54.840> bass<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.740> speakers<00:01:56.329> but<00:01:57.329> that

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
of bass for just speakers but that

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.980 
of bass for just speakers but that
wasn't<00:01:57.899> enough<00:01:58.020> bass<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.560> me<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.479> after<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.780> had

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
wasn't enough bass for me so after I had

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.830 
wasn't enough bass for me so after I had
to<00:02:01.110> get<00:02:01.229> another<00:02:01.500> amplifier<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.810> then<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
to get another amplifier for that then I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.210 
to get another amplifier for that then I
had<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.740> go<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.630> another<00:02:06.630> amplifier<00:02:07.160> this<00:02:08.160> is

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
had to go get another amplifier this is

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.960 
had to go get another amplifier this is
a<00:02:08.340> 2600<00:02:09.209> watt<00:02:10.129> something

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
a 2600 watt something

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.550 
a 2600 watt something
and<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.270> other<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.660> his<00:02:12.900> under<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.320> one

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and the other one of his under that one

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.740 
and the other one of his under that one
it's<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.100> many<00:02:14.310> something<00:02:14.850> that's<00:02:15.120> also

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it's just so many something that's also

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.890 
it's just so many something that's also
I<00:02:15.780> think<00:02:16.130> 2600<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.120> because<00:02:18.660> that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
I think 2600 but then because that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.370 
I think 2600 but then because that
wasn't<00:02:19.230> enough<00:02:19.470> base<00:02:19.710> for<00:02:20.070> me<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:24.200> added<00:02:25.200> in

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
wasn't enough base for me I added in

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.820 
wasn't enough base for me I added in
subwoofers<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.540> two<00:02:27.540> kicker<00:02:28.200> 8<00:02:28.620> inch

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
subwoofers a two kicker 8 inch

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.800 
subwoofers a two kicker 8 inch
subwoofers<00:02:29.310> they're<00:02:29.820> shallow<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.510> they're

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
subwoofers they're shallow but they're
