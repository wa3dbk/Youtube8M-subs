enemies and Cabala nice is that right
yeah<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:40.230> think<00:02:40.440> there<00:02:40.530> might<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.650> been<00:02:40.740> a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
yeah and I think there might have been a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.770 
yeah and I think there might have been a
fallen<00:02:41.370> or<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.670> throw<00:02:41.910> little<00:02:42.270> too<00:02:42.420> yeah<00:02:42.630> and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
fallen or to throw little too yeah and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.699 
fallen or to throw little too yeah and
they<00:02:42.840> were<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.080> like<00:02:43.260> fighting<00:02:43.530> amongst

they were just like fighting amongst

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.650 
they were just like fighting amongst
themselves<00:02:43.770> fighting<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.520> us<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:45.450> kind<00:02:45.630> of

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
themselves fighting with us that kind of

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.440 
themselves fighting with us that kind of
stuff<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.250> was<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.700> short<00:02:47.880> mission<00:02:48.120> there

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450

was only one dachshund a darkness zone

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.540 
was only one dachshund a darkness zone
and<00:02:53.000> yeah<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.390> was<00:02:54.660> pretty<00:02:55.020> damn<00:02:55.470> cool<00:02:55.800> yeah<00:02:56.250> I

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
and yeah it was pretty damn cool yeah I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.250 
and yeah it was pretty damn cool yeah I
really<00:02:56.940> liked<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.390> enemy<00:02:57.690> animations

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
really liked the enemy animations

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.199 
really liked the enemy animations
actually<00:02:58.680> they<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.489> this<00:02:59.850> is<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
actually they this this is in the

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.400 
actually they this this is in the
trailer<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:00.600> we<00:03:00.690> got<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.900> see<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.080> firsthand

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
trailer but we got to see it firsthand

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.560 
trailer but we got to see it firsthand
they<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.100> weird<00:03:02.430> shaky<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.209> judder

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
they have this weird shaky like judder

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.670 
they have this weird shaky like judder
yeah<00:03:03.959> because<00:03:04.290> they're<00:03:04.440> kind<00:03:04.650> of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
yeah because they're kind of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.590 
yeah because they're kind of
interdimensional<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.700> they<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.390> are

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
interdimensional so they really are

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.970 
interdimensional so they really are
caught<00:03:06.810> between<00:03:06.959> two<00:03:07.320> worlds<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.650> think<00:03:07.830> that's

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
caught between two worlds I think that's

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.410 
caught between two worlds I think that's
really<00:03:08.130> where<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.430> story<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.239> so

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
really where the story is going and so

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.180 
really where the story is going and so
when<00:03:09.720> you're<00:03:09.840> fighting<00:03:10.020> these<00:03:10.230> taken<00:03:10.530> it's

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
when you're fighting these taken it's

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.770 
when you're fighting these taken it's
kind<00:03:11.489> of<00:03:11.640> like<00:03:11.700> you're<00:03:11.970> fighting<00:03:12.209> these<00:03:12.450> these

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
kind of like you're fighting these these

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.420 
kind of like you're fighting these these
creatures<00:03:13.050> who<00:03:13.350> aren't<00:03:13.680> really<00:03:13.920> there<00:03:14.130> but

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
creatures who aren't really there but

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.310 
creatures who aren't really there but
also<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:15.239> know<00:03:15.330> behave<00:03:15.660> weight<00:03:15.959> differently

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
also you know behave weight differently

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.380 
also you know behave weight differently
than<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.680> expect<00:03:17.100> them<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.400> absolutely<00:03:18.180> and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
than you expect them to absolutely and

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.240 
than you expect them to absolutely and
the<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.810> final<00:03:19.110> shot<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.650> mission<00:03:20.040> once

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
the the final shot of the mission once

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.310 
the the final shot of the mission once
