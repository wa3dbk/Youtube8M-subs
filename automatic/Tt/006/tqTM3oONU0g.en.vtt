00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello all your best friend 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.240
 kool herc I first of all I want 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.460
 send a greeting to him to fought his 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.530
 little brother and esteban juniors and simón 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.230
 that are guys that walk around supporting me 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.420
 in this good this time I bring you 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.310
 the simon and marceline theory since 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.560
 Many have questioned me about age 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.660
 and the meeting of this couple but for 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.850
 that I'll have to start from scratch to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.640
 that they understand my theory a bit, so 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.200
 let's start 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.450
 warning this video may contain 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.840
 a theory that you do not like so see 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.600
 the video at your own risk 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.250
 Simon Pétrikov is an adventurous man 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.200
 antiquarian this man it is possible that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180
 has been the one who found the exhibition 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.760
 since you see him in a newspaper with the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.280
 book in hand and back his girlfriend betty in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.200
 the videos of holy secrets is where 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 clearly tells us where he bought the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.700
 corona verbatim says after 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.100
 buy this crown to a worker of 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.140
 a port in northern scandinavia what 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.050
 that right now is made up of Norway 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.239
 Sweden and Denmark north of Europe and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.980
 where the Vikings once reigned or 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.350
 Maybe the crown is from 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.630
 Nordic powers following in the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.610
 video evidence of holy secret in the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.380
 second take you can deduce that you have 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.540
 spent time for him to do that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.330
 recording can still reason and have a 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.250
 little coherence and paying attention to the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.229
 background you can see it's all 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.420
 quiet until it starts to snow and 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.300
 cover the city ​​of snow little by little 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.130
 in the third shot you can see that 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.049
 the snow got worse and it became 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.580
 storm and like it can be appreciated 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.800
 that it took time for what 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.200
 I would record again and here I do something 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.330
 curious because if you notice Simon has 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.490
 wearing the crown and still remember who is 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.530
 when they give us to understand that having 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.540
 put the crown the madness invades you 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.640
 while in the next and last 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.350
 takes looks more crazy and still with the crown 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.900
 He is asking for someone to help him 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.000
 and here I want to make an emphasis since I do not 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.280
 you can recover your health, that is, from 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.500
 flat already lost all sanity and that no longer 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.740
 it may be he simon pétrikov that before 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.660
 it was because I made that good emphasis what 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.670
 I'm doing because I'm taking this snowfall 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.070
 as the animators and many of you 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.830
 they want that is before the war of the 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.660
 mushrooms since many of you 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.700
 have questioned by saying that it was 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.800
 after the war on my video line 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.560
 of adventure time time but this 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.700
 I will explain it at the end of the video 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.800
 following with the story we can 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.810
 find that in the end episode the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.970
 human they give us to understand that final 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.640
 ask for your wish come back to the present 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.620
 that is not a day back and forth but 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.260
 on the same day that the lix cheated on us 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.270
 to go with prism has already understood this 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.190
 Marcelin finally tells him that a thousand years ago 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.030
 that Simon saved humanity from the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.830
 bomb 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.900
 this data combined with the age of 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.550
 marcheline that is one thousand three years we 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.540
 they mean that when the bomb explodes 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.670
 marcelín is three years old and simon 47 if 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.770
 they did not understand me well see my line of 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.750
 time that I will leave them on screen for 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.360
 that understand how I got this data 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.670
 now many question me telling me 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.680
 that simon and marceline are known before 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.050
 War and mushrooms 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.930
 I say it was between 3 to 4 years after 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.060
 the war where I get this because they 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.690
 left and right now with this fragment as 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.690
 we analyze 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.820
 let's see instantly I can see that there is no 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.770
 people that there are no explosions nor 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.500
 shots but if there is fire in the 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.540
 buildings this just means that the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.210
 bomb has already done its job and the war has 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.220
 finished now the next scene is 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.620
 go get to Simon and when you get to the place 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.720
 where the cry of a girl sounded 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.030
 surprises like marcelina when she sees 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.190
 this simon to gain your confidence goes 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.380
 for a bear and he gives it here for the 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.570
 simon's expression gives me to understand that 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.700
 He did not know and that he was surprised a 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.440
 girl has survived and then here 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.110
 I want to point out that they have the same 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.330
 aspect in the episode simon and marcy or 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.580
 be that the moment you found it is not 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.920
 separates a lot from the episode where they give us 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.310
 see that marcelino is 7 and simon has 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.620
 47 I have already explained the above in my 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.840
 ich video theories leave a doubt 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.940
 that is how marcellin knew the story 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.280
 of simon if there was not I knew him and he was very 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.320
 young since for what counts 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.480
 Simon died instantly that crushed him 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.880
 the bomb could not tell anyone and 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.610
 much less in the 400 years that 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.530
 froze the earth and many of you me 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.009
 they give the comment that they knew each other 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.740
 since 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.319
 before the bomb fell good as it already 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.650
 I gave the data I explain as day 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.960
 watch 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.210
 simon found marcelín with the appearance 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.399
 of a girl who is older or who took it 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.439
 time to find marcelino three or 

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:56.240
 four years after the bomb did not the 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.520
 found before long, much less 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.589
 time to drop the bomb and to remember 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.839
 that when the marcelín bomb fell, it had a 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.460
 three years old was still an infant 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.800
 I doubt he wants to go with another 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.869
 person who is not your mom and much less 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.449
 want to take care of a corpse and a crown 

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:13.370
 that's why I do not understand how he could 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.919
 know that story if the data neither 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.080
 they even point out that they knew me 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.449
 only explanation that I do is that the 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.099
 least in the alternate dimension really 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.529
 they met before the bomb by 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.659
 Here situation can create 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:29.059
 any theory since there is no data that 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.430
 limit nothing now in the videos of all 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:33.529
 in secret it shows that everything points that the 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.719
 snowfall was before the bomb but for 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.789
 that time Simon was already lost by 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.889
 the crown was already crazy and is not capable 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.689
 to remember something and much less of 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.209
 remove the crown since in both 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.670
 last recordings he is seen with her not 

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:48.830
 I explain why in Simon and Marxist 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.110
 coherent and even affectionate with more the in 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.270
 that is, he does not block, he can not return his 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.910
 health but if there is coherence four 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.040
 years after the explosion that's why 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.110
 that in my timeline I chose to say 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.850
 that is an error of the animators and that 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.590
 the video is located after the 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.230
 pump and if they see images 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.240
 when Simon finds Marcelino he looks 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.850
 a snow-free environment and war 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.220
 Perfectly develops or is that 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.230
 it does not happen or it has already happened but it has 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.480
 enough time for the snow 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.460
 it melts although this image that is of 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.920
 the explosion can be appreciated a little 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.350
 of snow here gives me to think that it was 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.570
 there simon to prevent the explosion but 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.460
 something happened that could not stop it or 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.220
 kelly if the ice king had a great 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.500
 battle is still a mystery all this 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.140
 because Simon does not talk about the 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.240
 war and marceline in their videos good 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.310
 as I already had to watch these videos according to 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.890
 they develop before the war but 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.870
 seriously for me it does not fit anything good is 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.300
 all for the moment I hope you have 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.520
 liked and I would like all those 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.680
 that they tell me that Simon and Marceline 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.750
 they knew before the bomb they will pass me 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.120
 a video or the data that you buy it 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.980
 since I can be wrong I good and 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.110
 remember to like my page 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.000
 of facebook if they like my 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.280
 jobs I will leave the link in 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.950
 good description well now I do 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.540
 dismissal from studies here that his friend 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.540
 kool herc me until next time
