00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello everyone my name is vova today 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.620
 review on madison quest network game 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.740
 It begins with the fact that Andrei Nifedov 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.880
 gives us a silver youtube button and 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.059
 which we have to give first 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.029
 it is natural for us to spike 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.890
 This Madison goes to the club 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.400
 letplayshchikov and before entering meets 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.900
 me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.779
 I find myself his young fans and 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.519
 I ask you to take a picture with your idol he 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.920
 ca n't refuse because it finds out 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.399
 that I threw him 50 thousand rubles 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.399
 webmoney 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.530
 after that we gum goes to inspect all 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.270
 the remaining locations and stumbles upon 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.010
 the girl who says that for a hundred 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 show ass naturally I climb 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.950
 own wallet and find there 50 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.590
 rubles 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.809
 try no happiness we can not this 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.980
 do because she still wants 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.579
 weave well expensive now besides i 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.899
 I wanted to note that this game is very cool 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.060
 distinguished by his poetic 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.750
 form on quite a lot of text here and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.880
 quite a lot of it is written by itself 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.080
 I know I tried to write myself 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 I'm not very successful in addition and in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.860
 the game has a location dedicated to advertising 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.820
 here you can advertise your 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.380
 channel for example besides all this you 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.020

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.780

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.210

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.640

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.900
 I will say I took them one item and matsal them 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.060

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.980
 but then I started getting used now 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.909
 I understand the logic Madison can pass 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.489
 pretty easy 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.010

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.750
 I will tell you something like a phone 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.730

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.060

 this one gives you 8 talk porn now 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.590
 we gum says that simka mts 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.709
 it bothers him naturally 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.569
 after watching this 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.519
 inserts you drop this simka with which 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.120
 you should be and do something if you 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.040
 Want to sew a haze here as well 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.230
 there are such moments in the game 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.150
 which is clearly an example immediately guessed 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.010
 type there put a bag cut and 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.120
 put a bag and set it on fire to light 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.639
 bonfire and moments about which I would be long 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.169
 I thought if I did not but Madison 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.470
 For example, what with Simka should be thrown into 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.310
 the fire 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.230
 who could guess but this is the first 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.780
 box example comrades order to 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.919
 leave the snake lemon and then another 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.699
 since I would never have guessed 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:45.290
 knew madison and now wanted a little 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:47.690
