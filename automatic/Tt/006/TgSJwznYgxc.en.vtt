first one unfortunately my main highway
I<00:00:25.650> found<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.250> frame<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:27.029> today<00:00:27.420> with<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
I found a frame in there today with a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.490 
I found a frame in there today with a
couple<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.220> Queens<00:00:29.550> ELLs<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.630> thought

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
couple of Queens ELLs on it so I thought

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.650 
couple of Queens ELLs on it so I thought
I'd<00:00:31.679> make<00:00:31.710> use<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> opportunity<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:32.940> I've

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
I'd make use of the opportunity and I've

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.569 
I'd make use of the opportunity and I've
taken<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.350> frame<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.829> put<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.399> new

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
taken that frame and put it in this new

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.530 
taken that frame and put it in this new
box<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:39.140> hopefully<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:41.149> this<00:00:42.149> new<00:00:42.300> box

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
box here so hopefully this this new box

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.319 
box here so hopefully this this new box
will<00:00:42.629> establish<00:00:43.020> pretty<00:00:43.440> quickly

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.299 

there<00:00:51.929> was<00:00:52.050> still<00:00:52.260> plenty<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.679> bees<00:00:52.859> coming

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
there was still plenty of bees coming

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.569 
there was still plenty of bees coming
out<00:00:53.429> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.609> wall<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.940> morning<00:00:53.999> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:57.289> assume

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
out of the wall this morning so I assume

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.950 
out of the wall this morning so I assume
there<00:00:59.579> should<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.909> enough<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.420> build<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.809> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
there should be enough to build up this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:38.860 
there should be enough to build up this
box<00:01:01.229> and<00:01:01.379> keep<00:01:01.589> it<00:01:01.739> strong

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870
