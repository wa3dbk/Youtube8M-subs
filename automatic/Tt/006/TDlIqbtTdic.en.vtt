00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.419 

so<00:00:00.960> I<00:00:00.989> cut<00:00:01.319> off<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.439> motor<00:00:01.740> mount<00:00:01.949> and<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.129> slid

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so I cut off the motor mount and I slid

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.120 
so I cut off the motor mount and I slid
it<00:00:02.550> back<00:00:02.580> I<00:00:03.319> have<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.350> weld<00:00:04.650> it<00:00:04.799> up

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
it back I have to weld it up

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.730 
it back I have to weld it up
I<00:00:05.160> used<00:00:05.759> my<00:00:06.000> angle<00:00:06.480> grinder<00:00:06.560> four<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.710> half

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
I used my angle grinder four and a half

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.370 
I used my angle grinder four and a half
inch<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.970> what<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.269> six<00:00:09.540> inch<00:00:09.750> metal<00:00:09.990> cut<00:00:10.230> off

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
inch but what the six inch metal cut off

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.980 
inch but what the six inch metal cut off
will<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:12.170> cut<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.259> off<00:00:13.410> like<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.750> have<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.870> all

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
will I cut it off like so I have it all

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.189 
will I cut it off like so I have it all
tacked<00:00:16.260> up<00:00:16.470> ready<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.279> weld<00:00:17.900> here's<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.960> little

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
tacked up ready to weld here's a little

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.420 
tacked up ready to weld here's a little
close-up<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:20.119> one<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.240> attacks<00:00:22.010> just<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.189> quick

close-up of one of attacks just a quick

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.929 
close-up of one of attacks just a quick
burst<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.090> then<00:00:24.180> all<00:00:25.460> right<00:00:26.460> now<00:00:26.580> I'm<00:00:26.699> TIG

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
burst and then all right now I'm TIG

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.600 
burst and then all right now I'm TIG
welding<00:00:28.670> motor<00:00:29.670> mount<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.510> frame<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:32.340> cup

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
welding motor mount to the frame the cup

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.459 
welding motor mount to the frame the cup
and<00:00:32.820> tungsten<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> right<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
and tungsten is on the right and that

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.709 
and tungsten is on the right and that
ain't<00:00:34.649> filler<00:00:35.130> rod<00:00:35.430> that's<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.059> thing<00:00:36.570> on

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
ain't filler rod that's that thing on

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.830 
ain't filler rod that's that thing on
the<00:00:36.840> left<00:00:38.450> one<00:00:39.450> thing<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.690> forgot<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.350> was

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
the left one thing I forgot to do was

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.180 
the left one thing I forgot to do was
remove<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.989> paint<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> other<00:00:43.620> side<00:00:43.890> so

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
remove the paint on the other side so

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.410 
remove the paint on the other side so
that's<00:00:44.280> where<00:00:44.489> you're<00:00:44.579> seeing<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:45.030> smoke

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
that's where you're seeing some smoke

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.619 
that's where you're seeing some smoke
and<00:00:45.719> actually<00:00:46.140> got<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.500> bad<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.270> it<00:00:48.270> created

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and actually got so bad that it created

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.010 
and actually got so bad that it created
a<00:00:48.719> little<00:00:48.840> porosity<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.210> crackling<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a little porosity and that crackling and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.770 
a little porosity and that crackling and
sparking<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.649> seeis<00:00:53.239> oxidation<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.360> pitting

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
sparking you seeis oxidation and pitting

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.939 
sparking you seeis oxidation and pitting
happening<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.539> well<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.899> good<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.590> it

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
happening so well it's so good but it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.970 
happening so well it's so good but it
doesn't<00:00:59.250> look<00:00:59.370> too<00:00:59.550> pretty<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.829> I'm<00:01:01.829> gonna

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
doesn't look too pretty but I'm gonna

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
doesn't look too pretty but I'm gonna
have<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.609> another<00:01:02.760> pass<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.420> turn<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
have to do another pass on it turn the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.490 
have to do another pass on it turn the
dress<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.820> yeah<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:06.659> too<00:01:06.869> happy<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
dress so yeah not too happy about that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
dress so yeah not too happy about that
but<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.180> gonna<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
but what can you do so I'm gonna do it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
but what can you do so I'm gonna do it
another<00:01:12.780> pass<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.380> cranked<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> amps

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
another pass but I cranked up the amps

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.870 
another pass but I cranked up the amps
all<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> way<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:16.680> adding<00:01:16.950> filler<00:01:17.310> metal<00:01:17.640> very

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
all the way I'm adding filler metal very

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.370 
all the way I'm adding filler metal very
fast<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.390> burning<00:01:21.780> away<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
fast so it's burning away a lot of the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.170 
fast so it's burning away a lot of the
oxidation<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.810> it's<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:24.990> allowing<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
oxidation and it's not allowing it to

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.219 
oxidation and it's not allowing it to
fit<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.360> easily<00:01:29.390> it's<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.600> faster<00:01:30.780> than<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
fit as easily it's a lot faster than the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.690 
fit as easily it's a lot faster than the
first<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.590> all<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.579> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
first of all so there you have it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.640 
first of all so there you have it
finished<00:01:33.470> with<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> motor<00:01:34.799> mount<00:01:36.439> now<00:01:37.439> comes

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
finished with the motor mount now comes

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
finished with the motor mount now comes
jack<00:01:37.979> shaft<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> left<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.600> original

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
jack shaft on the left is the original

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.410 
jack shaft on the left is the original
height<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:41.130> adding<00:01:42.000> an<00:01:42.240> inch

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
height on the right I'm adding an inch

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.200 
height on the right I'm adding an inch
and<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> half<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> driven<00:01:44.759> unit<00:01:45.119> of

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and a half to it so the driven unit of

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
and a half to it so the driven unit of
the<00:01:45.299> torque<00:01:45.540> converter<00:01:45.659> will<00:01:46.170> clear<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the torque converter will clear the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.139 
the torque converter will clear the
frame<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.820> there<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:49.430> much<00:01:50.430> better<00:01:50.670> welds

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
frame so there it is much better welds

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.359 
frame so there it is much better welds
and<00:01:51.990> there's<00:01:52.170> some<00:01:52.320> bar<00:01:52.500> stock<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> bottom

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and there's some bar stock on the bottom

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219 
and there's some bar stock on the bottom
that<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.670> added<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> show<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that I added so I'm going to show you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.569 
that I added so I'm going to show you
kind<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.920> how<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.659> added<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> bar<00:01:57.930> stock<00:01:58.579> just

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
kind of how I added the bar stock just

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.149 
kind of how I added the bar stock just
got<00:01:59.820> metal<00:02:00.060> cut-off<00:02:00.780> saw<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.329> measured<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
got metal cut-off saw and measured the

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.570 
got metal cut-off saw and measured the
distance<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.670> cut<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.689> through<00:02:06.719> it

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
distance and just cut right through it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.190 
distance and just cut right through it
keep<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.729> nice<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.030> slow<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.050> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
keep it nice and slow so I don't have to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.640 
keep it nice and slow so I don't have to
replace<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> blade<00:02:11.629> beveling<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.959> bar<00:02:13.349> stock

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
replace the blade beveling the bar stock

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:22.100 
replace the blade beveling the bar stock
for<00:02:14.550> welding<00:02:17.900> now<00:02:18.900> I'm<00:02:19.050> tacking<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.620> on

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:31.350 

close<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.319> finished<00:02:23.650> axe<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:27.120> welding<00:02:28.120> again

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.470

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
running out of cylinder rod right there

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.420 
running out of cylinder rod right there
but<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:36.709> time<00:02:36.950> around

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
but this time around

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.259 
but this time around
no<00:02:38.269> pitting<00:02:38.900> looks<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.590> lot<00:02:39.769> better<00:02:43.060> doing<00:02:44.060> some

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
no pitting looks a lot better doing some

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.330 
no pitting looks a lot better doing some

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
more welding same thing welding embark

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.319 
more welding same thing welding embark
on<00:02:46.790> at<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.060> bottom<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.510> jack<00:02:47.750> shaft<00:02:49.329> since

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
on at the bottom of the jack shaft since

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.110 
on at the bottom of the jack shaft since
I<00:02:50.450> cleaned<00:02:50.720> up<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.930> welds<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.790> metal

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
I cleaned up the welds and the metal

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.890 
I cleaned up the welds and the metal
before<00:02:53.629> I<00:02:54.019> started<00:02:54.560> welding<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:56.450> get<00:02:56.599> a<00:02:56.629> lot

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
before I started welding you get a lot

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.050 
before I started welding you get a lot
better

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
better

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.509 
better
bead<00:02:59.599> get<00:03:00.319> a<00:03:00.349> lot<00:03:00.530> better<00:03:00.650> penetration<00:03:01.220> you

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
bead get a lot better penetration you

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.770 
bead get a lot better penetration you
don't<00:03:01.700> get<00:03:01.849> hardly<00:03:02.840> any<00:03:03.079> smoke<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:05.569> you'll

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
don't get hardly any smoke and you'll

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.350 
don't get hardly any smoke and you'll
have<00:03:06.079> that<00:03:06.230> porosity<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:06.980> metal

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.510 

you<00:03:14.140> know<00:03:14.230> what<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.620> doesn't<00:03:14.860> matter<00:03:15.130> cuz<00:03:15.400> I'm

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
you know what it doesn't matter cuz I'm

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.010 
you know what it doesn't matter cuz I'm
grinding<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.030> off<00:03:16.150> doesn't<00:03:16.630> matter<00:03:16.750> how<00:03:16.840> good

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
grinding it off doesn't matter how good

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.450 
grinding it off doesn't matter how good
it<00:03:17.140> looks<00:03:17.320> as<00:03:17.770> long<00:03:17.950> as<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.160> get<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> right

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
it looks as long as you get the right

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.610 
it looks as long as you get the right
penetration<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.700> now<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.300> drilled<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.320> pilot

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
penetration so now I drilled a pilot

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.690 
penetration so now I drilled a pilot
hole<00:03:23.770> in<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.370> jack<00:03:24.580> shaft<00:03:24.870> mounting<00:03:25.870> plate

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
hole in the jack shaft mounting plate

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.720 
hole in the jack shaft mounting plate
and<00:03:27.700> I'm<00:03:27.850> drilling<00:03:29.460> 5/16<00:03:30.460> inch<00:03:30.730> hole<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.330> so

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
and I'm drilling 5/16 inch hole in it so

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.880 
and I'm drilling 5/16 inch hole in it so
I<00:03:33.730> can<00:03:33.970> mount<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.270> to<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.480> motor<00:03:35.320> mounts<00:03:37.890> so

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
I can mount it to the motor mounts so

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.210 
I can mount it to the motor mounts so
there's<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.220> finished<00:03:39.550> jack<00:03:39.820> shaft<00:03:40.980> add<00:03:41.980> an

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
there's the finished jack shaft add an

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.030 
there's the finished jack shaft add an
inch<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.640> half<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:46.950> drill<00:03:47.950> the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
inch and a half to it and drill the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.370 
inch and a half to it and drill the
holes<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.570> bottom<00:03:49.570> for<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.020> mounting

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
holes in the bottom for the mounting

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.310 
holes in the bottom for the mounting
plate<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:50.950> I'm<00:03:51.130> pretty<00:03:51.280> happy<00:03:51.520> with<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:55.320> and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
plate so I'm pretty happy with it and

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.040 
plate so I'm pretty happy with it and
there's<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.890> motor<00:03:57.040> now<00:03:57.280> it's<00:03:57.820> cleared<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
there's the motor now it's cleared the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.340 
there's the motor now it's cleared the
seat<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:02.160> there<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.640> jack<00:04:04.000> shaft

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
seat and there is the jack shaft

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.460 
seat and there is the jack shaft
mounting<00:04:05.350> plate<00:04:05.590> on<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.280> motor<00:04:06.730> mount<00:04:07.470> and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
mounting plate on the motor mount and

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.040 
mounting plate on the motor mount and
the<00:04:08.920> driven<00:04:09.250> unit<00:04:09.520> now<00:04:10.239> clears<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.840> frame

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
the driven unit now clears the frame

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.550 
the driven unit now clears the frame
which<00:04:11.590> I'm<00:04:11.830> really<00:04:12.340> happy<00:04:12.520> about<00:04:13.560> next

which I'm really happy about next
project<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.160> this<00:04:15.310> axle<00:04:15.850> not<00:04:16.510> too<00:04:16.690> excited

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
project is this axle not too excited

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.130 
project is this axle not too excited
about<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:17.260> but<00:04:17.820> got<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.940> motor<00:04:19.150> all<00:04:19.540> set<00:04:19.959> up

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
about that but got the motor all set up

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.549 
about that but got the motor all set up
it's<00:04:21.010> good<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.430> go
