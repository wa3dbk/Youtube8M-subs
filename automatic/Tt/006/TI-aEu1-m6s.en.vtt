00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:06.350
 it was then I put a little time you think that with whom we did 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.010
 what I wanted to talk about him 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.259
 shopping I was a Nazi 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.869
 and because I say I left too much what he told me and like every time 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.769
 cornet and gilles cement the place of life a little weaker 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.449
 to do this much cheaper I use products rushed the 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.890
 movement 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.739
 inevitably it's not going easy 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.329
 and I actually have a problem I'm thankful enough 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.520
 regularly 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.000
 and for 100 th in fact I found quite tired 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.520
 in general we will 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.520
 here it is 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.980
 barack obama enjoys a state of grace 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.980
 % and against 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.630
 I do not know if you've already proven it 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.390
 mdp belga 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.390
 with the smer said here it's the 80s 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.630
 and actually I drew by what I was worth in a small town 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.110
 and then at once, store with more or less success the difference 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.170
 khaled banat super granny for example was very strong 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.150
 so I went home country that is celebrating 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.650
 I realize that it's a group of activists that I'm a 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.180
 burn 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.010
 gold 90 and 2000 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.010
 lines already and in fact in very good condition 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.810
 and so so the overcrowded legs had aimed he hopes 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.810
 so enriched I myself am not at all 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.430
 compared to my style so I have not bought 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.140
 so suddenly something that is relatively sober so the black and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.509
 White 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.110
 in Alsace 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.710
 and for the moment I find great owl by some sides of 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.140
 peasant families 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.930
 and in fact what happened here no 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.870
 is that in fact those are rarely brought to new it means that by 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.380
 example 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.220
 here is the level of the heel actually 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.700
 we did not have any pop art I think the company to vitaliser 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.430
 four fights often at a higher level at 5 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.149
 in the dogma am amused I think the people who follow them on the led 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.649
 to put in the trash 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.669
 people have recovered that 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:18.259
 finally they also recovered his clientele are rebuilt 1 apam 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.879
 I still hear a little more value 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.840
 by refusing exactly the type of the 5% and the week 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.119
 by making the straight line 600 meters 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.079
 it's just amazing 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.669
 so basically actually an excerpt from the album 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.339
 they are not at all this defeat of his 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.159
 and they all have industrial good 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.960
 revived where he had not recovered from a long burst is theirs 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.049
 european all know of the coup 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.749
 so that costs 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.459
 6 euros 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.089
 including 6% adidas shoes 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.509
 Well, that's what I'm sorry for anyway 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.350
 already a beautiful and young 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.620
 to end the certainty of what I can say against maria sharapova 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.159
 was not deceived 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.159
 popa mont-blanc if you are in asia in india and thailand 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.039
 ameur 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:12.499
 look at his shoe and bottle shops it's shouting 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.959
 the hallucinating models 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.279
 it is a choice just arrived at the spurs 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.319
 here are two hulls of the smallest 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.249
 crush neither first association 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.729
 and weeding and shoes 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.589
 she struggled 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:30.879
 corbett 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:31.840
 struggling 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.439
 plastic and rubber 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.689
 the past have gone back and I'm still playing on the other side of 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.089
 Pyrenees in two seasons 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:44.609
 but it's super expensive if I remember that it is the skin of the buttocks 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:50.039
 when it's raining it's the part of your life your support 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.869
 just find it in a shop 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.729
 never done anything 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.819
 so it's completely plastic if you want in one 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.659
 so all that means it's even worse 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.699
 when I passed the same mold 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.209
 and it's a black boy 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.809
 it's a bit difficult the 6 cylinder v 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:18.959
 and in thailand 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.109
 and here is the list of titles is far behind 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.349
 they are all kinds 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.939
 I like it is modern at the same time if the gogos he said 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.210
 I paid that to 189 and like us because kissing a euro 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.449
 here are people just here it was just a super good plan 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.800
 so here's the shoe 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.509
 so it is funded by the channel so I have my place and I do not mark 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.120
 what i did in malaysia 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.020
 I bought a 3ds discovered if it was an obvious France 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.300
 it's with Japanese models so it was great 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.370
 meyer 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.670
 emmanuel karim a way to find cheap shoes that not 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.759
 not necessarily in department stores 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.550
 methods and utilities of the EU 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.289
 find good deals 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.309

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:15.819
 various researchers because macbooks in thailand and people to buy 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.319
 some examples 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.139
 so 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.919
 more as you liked it if you go to Asia that you will think to read 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:28.039
