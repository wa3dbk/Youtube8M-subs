00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
this is going to be more forgiving than

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.290

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.300 
to break in the de-stress level we
talked<00:02:53.410> about<00:02:53.620> these<00:02:53.740> stitches<00:02:54.190> that

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
talked about these stitches that

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.860 
talked about these stitches that
incorporate<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.090> Kevlar<00:02:55.450> that's<00:02:55.630> going<00:02:55.780> to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
incorporate the Kevlar that's going to

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.660 
incorporate the Kevlar that's going to
be<00:02:55.960> baked<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.290> other<00:02:56.590> dianese<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.430> gene

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
be baked in other dianese a gene

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.220 
be baked in other dianese a gene
functions<00:02:58.210> so<00:02:58.360> riding<00:02:58.630> genes<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.080> your

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
functions so riding genes you have your

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.290 
functions so riding genes you have your
basic<00:02:59.530> belt<00:02:59.710> loops<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.220> have<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.580> button<00:03:01.180> at

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
basic belt loops you have a button at

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.420 
basic belt loops you have a button at
the<00:03:01.390> front<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.750> button<00:03:02.050> fly<00:03:02.260> design<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.950> if<00:03:03.280> we

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
the front a button fly design and if we

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.680 
the front a button fly design and if we
look<00:03:03.610> at<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.760> way<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.970> pockets<00:03:04.390> are<00:03:04.510> laid<00:03:04.660> out

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
look at the way the pockets are laid out

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.450 
look at the way the pockets are laid out
again<00:03:05.110> it's<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.320> four<00:03:05.560> pocket<00:03:05.950> design<00:03:06.220> not<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
again it's a four pocket design not a

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.340 
again it's a four pocket design not a
five<00:03:06.700> pocket<00:03:06.940> design<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.540> then<00:03:07.900> those<00:03:08.050> rivets

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
five pocket design and then those rivets

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.050 
five pocket design and then those rivets
they're<00:03:09.040> not<00:03:09.220> going<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.580> big<00:03:09.880> bump

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
they're not going to have that big bump

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.040 
they're not going to have that big bump
that's<00:03:10.270> going<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.480> scratch<00:03:10.660> your<00:03:10.810> tank

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
that's going to scratch your tank

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.910 
that's going to scratch your tank
they're<00:03:11.200> actually<00:03:11.470> flattened<00:03:11.800> out<00:03:11.860> and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
they're actually flattened out and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.710 
they're actually flattened out and
embossed<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.490> Dainese<00:03:12.910> logo<00:03:13.210> so<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.660> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
embossed of the Dainese logo so it's the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.240 
embossed of the Dainese logo so it's the
details<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.440> fact<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.800> it's<00:03:14.920> not<00:03:15.040> going

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
details and the fact that it's not going

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.010 
details and the fact that it's not going
to<00:03:15.310> scratch<00:03:15.550> up<00:03:15.730> your<00:03:15.820> bike<00:03:16.300> now<00:03:16.660> turn<00:03:16.900> the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
to scratch up your bike now turn the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.390 
to scratch up your bike now turn the
face<00:03:17.140> away<00:03:17.410> from<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.650> they're<00:03:17.770> HPV<00:03:18.130> I<00:03:18.190> want<00:03:18.340> to

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
show the cuff here at the bottom as you

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.390 
show the cuff here at the bottom as you
work<00:03:20.170> your<00:03:20.290> way<00:03:20.350> down<00:03:20.410> remember<00:03:20.830> six<00:03:21.100> inches

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
work your way down remember six inches

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.280 
work your way down remember six inches
of<00:03:21.550> reflectivities<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.690> if<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:22.960> roll<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.230> up

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
of reflectivities that if you roll it up

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.090 
of reflectivities that if you roll it up
like<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.530> it's<00:03:23.710> going<00:03:23.800> to<00:03:23.860> give<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.040> a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
like that it's going to give you a

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.040 
like that it's going to give you a
better<00:03:24.250> chance<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.670> be<00:03:24.880> seen<00:03:25.150> at<00:03:25.420> night<00:03:25.450> but

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
better chance to be seen at night but

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.570 
better chance to be seen at night but
again<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.440> do<00:03:26.560> have<00:03:26.740> six<00:03:26.980> inches<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.490> so

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
again you do have six inches of it so

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.070 
again you do have six inches of it so
you<00:03:27.670> can<00:03:27.700> hem<00:03:27.970> if<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.270> need<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.840> if<00:03:28.990> we

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
you can hem if you need to and if we

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.240 
you can hem if you need to and if we
look<00:03:29.200> at<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.350> rest<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.740> side<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.100> gene

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
look at the rest of the side of the gene

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.430 
look at the rest of the side of the gene
remember<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.880> can<00:03:31.030> add<00:03:31.300> knee<00:03:31.690> armor<00:03:32.020> or<00:03:32.200> you

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
remember you can add knee armor or you

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.650 
remember you can add knee armor or you
can<00:03:32.560> add<00:03:32.680> hip<00:03:32.950> armor<00:03:33.220> after<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.700> fact<00:03:33.970> but

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
can add hip armor after the fact but

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.300 
can add hip armor after the fact but
it's<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.200> pocket<00:03:35.650> that's<00:03:35.800> going<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.010> be<00:03:36.100> built

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
it's a pocket that's going to be built

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.680 
it's a pocket that's going to be built
in<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.520> doesn't<00:03:36.760> come<00:03:36.880> stock<00:03:37.150> with<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.450> the

in it doesn't come stock with that the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.330 
in it doesn't come stock with that the
nice<00:03:37.870> part<00:03:38.110> is<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.290> Kevlar<00:03:38.650> comes<00:03:38.860> all<00:03:39.130> the

going to have the synthetic leather that

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.650 
going to have the synthetic leather that
works<00:03:48.610> its<00:03:48.790> way<00:03:48.880> through<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.210> middle<00:03:49.450> again
