00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.200
 chilling military robots 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.860
 just like it happened in a well-known 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.719
 the film determiners murderers 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.630
 military robot construction company 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.630
 boston dynamic also appears this 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.150
 company in the famous series fringe no 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.730
 it only really exists but just like 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.070
 that in fringe is also dedicated to 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.260
 ultra high technology 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.140
 concretely performing all kinds of 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.970
 robotic machines for military and 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.750
 well chilling by the way 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.750
 pet man 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.030
 for the military it is of sum 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.949
 importance to have tools that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.929
 allow to prove what would happen to 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.699
 any of your soldiers in the middle 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:53.000
 of a war or before a certain type of 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.719
 harmful chemical agents for this reason 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.089
 the boston dynamics company sounds like 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.369
 built to give for the agency of 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.250
 development of top secret projects 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.860
 from USA a robot called pet man that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.100
 among other things you can 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.680
 1 move with all the degrees of 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.880
 freedom of the human body identical to a 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.360
 real human being 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.430
 2 raise the temperature of your body 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.050
 when you exercise it like you would a 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.380
 flesh and blood person 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.420
 3 even transpires with the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.970
 amount of liquid and salts that would have 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.630
 the true human sweat 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.480
 4 jump and dodge objects from their environment 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.170
 with great ease even better than your 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.710
 human counterpart 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.220
 5 can make their own decisions in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.790
 any unknown scenario 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.790
 7 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.930
 you imagine trying to escape from a 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.460
 machine like this 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.860
 impossible if you walk on foot or even in 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.960
 bicycle since it cheers like they have 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.270
 given to call can move to the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.820
 chilling speed of almost 30 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.599
 miles per hour these are something like 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.849
 50 kilometers per hour and of course it 's a lot 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.550
 for a machine that walks on four 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.900
 legs not like that for a vehicle with wheels 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.569
 for example 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.269
 it's amazing to see how he's stumbling 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.990
 when it reaches its maximum speed but 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.800
 recovers on the fly without falling 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.800
 Assembly 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.080
 this robot already operative and for sale is 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.840
 sand flight as the title of this 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.430
 post possesses the capacity of nothing else nor 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.890
 nothing less than performing incredible 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.980
 jumps in height 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.840
 and this without destabilizing thanks to 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.330
 your turns internal high flakes 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.459
 precision what allows the image 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.590
 that is transmitting during the jump 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.160
 with his high resolution camera he does not 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.500
 see moved that's all for today I hope 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.740
 that serves them and if so, please 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.350
 comment and share this video post a 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.350
