00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229 
of five stars I think so one of the

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.499 
of five stars I think so one of the
strong<00:06:36.860> leaders<00:06:37.190> for<00:06:37.370> the<00:06:37.460> set<00:06:37.669> I<00:06:37.880> like<00:06:38.360> that

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:38.509

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
got them doughy I think that's that was

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.570 
got them doughy I think that's that was
a<00:06:41.320> common<00:06:41.650> characteristic<00:06:41.830> of<00:06:42.220> a<00:06:42.310> lot<00:06:42.460> of<00:06:42.520> the

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
a common characteristic of a lot of the

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.830
