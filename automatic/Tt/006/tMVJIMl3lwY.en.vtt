00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:16.390
 Hello everyone, today I will tell you how 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:20.050
 suspensions on the speaker 75 gdn old suspension 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.360
 we bought rot of course kidnapped 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.400
 At first, I did not sell, but when 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.690
 installation they began to tear here 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.699
 see failure this is the system we 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.470
 decided to order new we ordered 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.420
 newcomers bring a little expensive but the choice 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.780
 was not great but two new suspensions 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.480
 They booked the week we were told at 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.870
 verified ordering man now we will 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.610
 disassemble the suspension you yourself speaker 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.579
 we buy a syringe as it should be 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:59.200
 stupid we pass the tailbone so to remove 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:03.070
 I don't know this cap on him 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:17.520
 will come quickly will not go away any hope 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 what goes away quickly starts wanting to walk 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:28.030
 once impregnated and more because 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:33.760
 tear may not regret acetone all 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.990
 then order again and cycle the package when 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.140
 assembly fold 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.810
 glue or crystal or transparent gel 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.910
 moment to let the yellow spots take them not 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:53.710
 left at assembly for the future already 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:57.370
 spoke break compact changed 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.130
 continue to take or paper to do an x-ray 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.920
 found and inserted into the coil so that's what 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.900
 when removing the suspension because we own 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.820
 Basket the penny that in Talas 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.119
 assembly we still had a gap 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.020
 that there was no couch sis to her now 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.410
 we all went perfectly perfectly moles from 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.180
 Now we will remove the suspension and we will 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.430
 stick a new gimbal now we are again 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.130
 suspend the video continue on 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.170
 after installing the suspension and so on 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.070
 here to get or clear the speaker 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.430
 removed the suspension 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.340
 perfect all washed with tonic all here 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:43.270
 our own new suspension now we are neat 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:46.120
 impose looks inspection look at 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.980
 everything is all right here in our ideal 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.019
 came up now we glue everything 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.970
 neatly glue category gel 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.980
 transparent glue and pressing everything on it 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.930
 probably everything will be finished for a while 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.550
 let's go 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.800
 since we already see the end result 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.620
 pendants glued us all neatly 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.150
 now still cap seal everything goes 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:17.200
 well the coil doesn't touch it like that 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.040
 here and so you had to look at here is a 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.750
 time suspension of mistakes when we sold that 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.010
 us nasty 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.870
 listening like these speakers from us 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.850
