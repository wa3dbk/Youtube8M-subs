00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
to let it let a chord ring out

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.020

feel a lot of pedals you know it's like

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.490 
feel a lot of pedals you know it's like
right<00:02:51.239> there<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.569> where<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:51.840> good<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.319> one

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
right there is where it's good this one

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.789 
right there is where it's good this one
it's<00:02:53.040> really<00:02:53.250> all<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.400> way<00:02:54.379> when<00:02:55.379> you<00:02:55.470> dial<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
it's really all the way when you dial it

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.319 
it's really all the way when you dial it
back<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.280> basically<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.879> your<00:02:57.030> clean

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
back and it basically is just your clean

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.240 
back and it basically is just your clean
tone<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:57.930> feels<00:02:58.650> like<00:02:58.709> it's<00:02:58.920> sort<00:02:59.190> of

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
tone so it feels like it's sort of

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.970 
tone so it feels like it's sort of
bringing<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:01.079> dirt<00:03:01.349> -<00:03:01.560> I'm<00:03:01.709> not<00:03:01.859> too

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
bringing in the the dirt - I'm not too

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.979 
bringing in the the dirt - I'm not too
sure<00:03:02.190> how<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:02.730> he<00:03:02.790> does<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.269> but<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.480> love<00:03:03.840> it

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
sure how how he does that but I love it

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.490 
sure how how he does that but I love it
and<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.129> a<00:03:05.159> bass<00:03:05.430> response<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:06.120> not<00:03:06.269> um

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
and this is a bass response it's not um

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.490 
and this is a bass response it's not um
it's<00:03:07.500> it's<00:03:07.829> subtle<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:08.700> not<00:03:08.909> like<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.060> huge

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
it's it's subtle it's not like a huge

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.619 
it's it's subtle it's not like a huge
boost<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.890> would<00:03:11.040> say<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:11.730> kind<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.420> how

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
boost I would say it's just kind of how

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.710 
boost I would say it's just kind of how
it<00:03:12.659> treats<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.290> signal<00:03:14.359> where<00:03:15.359> there<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.540> kind

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
it treats the signal where there it kind

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.599 
it treats the signal where there it kind
of<00:03:15.750> cuts<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.140> boost<00:03:16.349> cuts<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.890> bass<00:03:17.069> or<00:03:17.280> adds

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
of cuts the boost cuts the bass or adds

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.080 
of cuts the boost cuts the bass or adds
a<00:03:17.760> little<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.569> really<00:03:18.930> nice<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.700> yeah<00:03:20.910> I'm

picky<00:03:49.129> parcel

00:03:59.959 --> 00:03:59.969 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.399 

so<00:04:00.969> that's<00:04:01.450> what<00:04:01.599> I<00:04:01.629> was<00:04:01.719> using<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.989> for<00:04:02.200> and

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
so that's what I was using a for and

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:13.039 
so that's what I was using a for and
then<00:04:02.500> had<00:04:02.680> these<00:04:02.920> you<00:04:03.069> know<00:04:03.189> the<00:04:03.280> diamonds

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:43.110 

the<00:04:14.049> earlier<00:04:14.349> man<00:04:14.530> had<00:04:14.709> this<00:04:14.799> gain<00:04:15.040> up

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.890 

all<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.210> way<00:04:44.300> up<00:04:48.129> that's<00:04:49.129> tele<00:04:49.699> on<00:04:50.479> the<00:04:50.569> bridge

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
all the way up that's tele on the bridge

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.820 
all the way up that's tele on the bridge
pickup<00:04:51.139> that's<00:04:51.499> just<00:04:51.740> Spanky<00:04:52.249> I<00:04:52.490> mean<00:04:53.830> it's

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
pickup that's just Spanky I mean it's

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.439 
pickup that's just Spanky I mean it's
like<00:04:54.949> oh<00:04:55.099> let's<00:04:55.249> get<00:04:55.400> this<00:04:55.580> high<00:04:55.789> end<00:04:56.059> you<00:04:56.300> know

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
like oh let's get this high end you know

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.519 
like oh let's get this high end you know
it<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:58.669> just<00:04:58.819> adds<00:04:59.029> really<00:04:59.689> great<00:04:59.960> like<00:05:00.319> low

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:00.529 
it it just adds really great like low

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.820 
it it just adds really great like low
mids<00:05:00.800> but<00:05:00.919> it's<00:05:01.099> not<00:05:01.279> super<00:05:01.669> muddy<00:05:02.479> I<00:05:03.469> feel

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
mids but it's not super muddy I feel

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.110 
mids but it's not super muddy I feel
like<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:03.979> lot<00:05:04.129> of<00:05:04.159> overdrive<00:05:04.610> that's<00:05:04.939> where

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
like a lot of overdrive that's where

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.540 
like a lot of overdrive that's where
that's<00:05:05.629> really<00:05:06.020> where<00:05:06.199> I<00:05:06.559> could<00:05:07.189> overdrive

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
that's really where I could overdrive

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.549 
that's really where I could overdrive
shines<00:05:07.879> like<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.419> know<00:05:09.050> that<00:05:09.259> people<00:05:09.439> love

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
like right in the middle and this has

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.420 
like right in the middle and this has
really<00:05:16.279> just<00:05:16.969> a<00:05:17.089> lot<00:05:17.240> of<00:05:17.330> expanse<00:05:17.749> to<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.169> um

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
and then it's got a game boost which is

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.409 
and then it's got a game boost which is
super<00:05:20.900> fun<00:05:21.080> so<00:05:21.349> for<00:05:21.560> solos<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.870> I<00:05:24.310> initially

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
super fun so for solos and I initially

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.640 
super fun so for solos and I initially
actually<00:05:26.419> sent<00:05:26.779> him<00:05:26.870> an<00:05:26.930> email<00:05:27.020> saying<00:05:27.379> hey<00:05:27.469> is

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
actually sent him an email saying hey is

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.110 
actually sent him an email saying hey is
there<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.830> way<00:05:27.949> to<00:05:27.979> change<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.520> volume<00:05:28.759> on<00:05:29.089> it

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
there a way to change the volume on it

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.360 
there a way to change the volume on it
because<00:05:29.680> when<00:05:30.680> I<00:05:30.740> was<00:05:30.860> messing<00:05:31.159> around<00:05:31.189> with

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
because when I was messing around with

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.070 
because when I was messing around with
it<00:05:31.460> by<00:05:31.610> itself<00:05:31.969> I<00:05:32.180> felt<00:05:32.389> like<00:05:32.509> the<00:05:32.659> boost<00:05:32.870> was

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
it by itself I felt like the boost was

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.869 
it by itself I felt like the boost was
too<00:05:33.289> hot<00:05:33.529> I<00:05:33.969> wanted<00:05:34.969> it<00:05:35.060> to<00:05:35.120> be<00:05:35.210> quieter<00:05:35.659> and

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
too hot I wanted it to be quieter and

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.179 
too hot I wanted it to be quieter and
then<00:05:38.199> even<00:05:39.199> before<00:05:39.289> he<00:05:39.529> emailed<00:05:39.770> me<00:05:39.830> back<00:05:39.979> I

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:40.189 
then even before he emailed me back I

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:41.499 
then even before he emailed me back I
played<00:05:40.370> a<00:05:40.399> show<00:05:40.610> with<00:05:40.759> it<00:05:40.879> and<00:05:40.969> realized<00:05:41.300> it's

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
played a show with it and realized it's

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.929 
played a show with it and realized it's
just<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:41.960> perfect<00:05:42.379> like<00:05:42.589> lead<00:05:43.520> you<00:05:43.729> just

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
wanted to take it up a notch and it's a

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.879 
wanted to take it up a notch and it's a
clean<00:05:45.979> boost<00:05:46.899> just<00:05:47.899> add<00:05:48.110> it<00:05:48.229> on<00:05:48.319> top<00:05:48.560> of<00:05:48.589> it

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
clean boost just add it on top of it

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
when I'm just to give it more volume and

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.079 
when I'm just to give it more volume and
man<00:05:51.319> its<00:05:51.560> source<00:05:52.129> so<00:05:52.460> here<00:05:52.610> I'll<00:05:52.729> play<00:05:52.879> that
