00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
right in between the a flag and the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.709 
right in between the a flag and the
corner<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> building<00:00:39.090> almost<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.570> that

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
corner of the building almost on that

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.840 
corner of the building almost on that
little<00:00:39.870> track<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.800> you're<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
little track there and you're going to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.180 
little track there and you're going to
go<00:00:42.059> straight<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.750> your<00:00:42.870> kombat<00:00:43.200> x<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.800> see

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.139 
go straight up with your kombat x to see
and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:44.460> you're<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> pull<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149

and then you're going to pull just a
little<00:00:45.390> left<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.530> straight

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
little left because if you go straight

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040 
little left because if you go straight
towards<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.610> it'll<00:00:48.239> actually<00:00:48.420> hit<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> roof

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050

as you're going to see here in the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.799 
as you're going to see here in the
replay<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.000> want<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> pull<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
replay so you want to pull it just a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.990 
replay so you want to pull it just a
little<00:00:51.840> left<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.530> that'll<00:00:53.370> take<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.760> not

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
little left and that'll take out not

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.610 
little left and that'll take out not
just<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> guy<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.449> fly<00:00:54.719> anybody<00:00:55.140> could<00:00:55.500> be

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
just the guy to fly anybody could be

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.490 
just the guy to fly anybody could be
possibly<00:00:56.100> running<00:00:56.760> through<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.930> first

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
possibly running through that that first

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.830 
possibly running through that that first
blood<00:00:58.770> area<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.579> here's<00:00:59.910> reverse<00:01:00.300> over<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
blood area so here's reverse over to a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.990 
blood area so here's reverse over to a
and<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.219> you're<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> go

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and on this one you're not going to go

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
and on this one you're not going to go
in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.960> between<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
in the right in between like you to the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.200 
in the right in between like you to the
last<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.189> you're<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.939> few

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
last one you're going to go up a few

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.460 
last one you're going to go up a few
feet<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.200> basically<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.619> clears<00:01:08.549> this

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
feet so it basically just clears this

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.810 
feet so it basically just clears this
this<00:01:10.470> building<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.340> front<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> and

it's going to be straight up towards a
you<00:01:13.470> don't<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.040> left<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> right<00:01:14.430> just

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you don't have to go left to right just

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
you don't have to go left to right just
straight<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.650> that's<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
there you can look right up here in this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.039 
there you can look right up here in this
little<00:01:40.770> V<00:01:41.329> now<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.899> go

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
little V now you don't want to just go

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.510 
little V now you don't want to just go
straight<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> mini-map

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
straight up you can see on the mini-map

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.179 
straight up you can see on the mini-map
the<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.540> dotted<00:01:45.869> line<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:46.950> where

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the little dotted line and that's where

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.649 
the little dotted line and that's where
the<00:01:47.250> balcony<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:47.939> hangs<00:01:48.210> over<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the balcony actually hangs over and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.639 
the balcony actually hangs over and
that's<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> go

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
that's what you're going to want to go

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.700 
that's what you're going to want to go
straight<00:01:50.040> up<00:01:50.810> now<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.990> does<00:01:52.200> work<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.530> both

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
straight up now this does work on both

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.810 
straight up now this does work on both
sides<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.220> thought<00:01:53.340> we'd<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:53.579> ahead<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
sides so we thought we'd go ahead and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.010 
sides so we thought we'd go ahead and
show<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.060> both<00:01:54.240> sides<00:01:54.509> again<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
show it on both sides again in the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.520 
show it on both sides again in the
middle<00:01:55.140> behind<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.890> Center<00:01:57.290> center<00:01:58.290> area

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
middle behind that Center center area

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.459 
middle behind that Center center area
right<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.219> then<00:01:59.549> again<00:02:00.320> right<00:02:01.320> with<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
right there and then again right with a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.550 
right there and then again right with a
visa<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:01.979> line<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.409> dotted<00:02:04.409> line

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
visa at line it up with the dotted line

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920 
visa at line it up with the dotted line
where<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.009> overhang<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> couple<00:02:06.659> nice

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
where the overhang is so a couple nice

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.229 
where the overhang is so a couple nice
little<00:02:07.160> simtek<00:02:08.160> spots<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.580> also<00:02:08.879> works<00:02:09.030> with

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
little simtek spots that also works with

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.729 
little simtek spots that also works with
the<00:02:09.420> frag<00:02:09.750> grenades<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.319> case<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.649> were

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the frag grenades this case you were

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.210

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
the other side this map is like a mirror

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.750 
the other side this map is like a mirror
image<00:03:02.440> on<00:03:02.740> both<00:03:02.920> sides<00:03:03.190> anc<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:05.160> again<00:03:06.160> here

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760
