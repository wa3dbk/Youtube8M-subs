00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.570

the<00:02:25.230> reality<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.860> was<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.190> spent<00:02:26.430> quite

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
the reality of it was that I spent quite

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.040 
the reality of it was that I spent quite
a<00:02:26.640> lot<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.790> time<00:02:27.030> crush<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.540> inside<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.990> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
a lot of time crush the inside of the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.890 
a lot of time crush the inside of the
street<00:02:28.320> as<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.040> truck<00:02:29.220> dragged<00:02:29.430> by<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
street as the truck dragged by and the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.500 
street as the truck dragged by and the
people<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.739> trucks<00:02:31.980> pelted<00:02:32.790> us<00:02:32.910> brutally

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
people on the trucks pelted us brutally

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.600 
people on the trucks pelted us brutally
with<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.959> tomatoes<00:02:34.440> that's<00:02:35.130> not<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.400> say<00:02:35.520> it

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
with the tomatoes that's not to say it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:50.410 
with the tomatoes that's not to say it
wasn't<00:02:35.760> fun<00:02:36.120> because<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.630> really<00:02:37.110> really<00:02:37.260> was

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.880 

after<00:02:51.420> an<00:02:51.510> hour<00:02:51.659> a<00:02:51.930> second<00:02:52.319> shot<00:02:52.560> was<00:02:52.680> fired

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
after an hour a second shot was fired

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.070 
after an hour a second shot was fired
from<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.220> cannon<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:54.120> signal<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> end<00:02:54.569> of<00:02:54.930> the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
from the cannon to signal the end of the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.470 
from the cannon to signal the end of the
fight<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.640> order<00:02:56.640> was<00:02:56.760> restored

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
fight and order was restored

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:14.190 
fight and order was restored
sort<00:02:58.319> of

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.400 

I<00:03:14.319> definitely<00:03:15.129> do<00:03:15.520> it<00:03:15.550> again<00:03:15.810> but<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.170> next

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
I definitely do it again but the next

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.600 
I definitely do it again but the next
time<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.590> do<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.770> I'd<00:03:17.860> probably<00:03:17.890> do<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> couple<00:03:18.550> of

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
time I do it I'd probably do a couple of

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.970 
time I do it I'd probably do a couple of
things<00:03:18.730> differently<00:03:19.269> number<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.080> I<00:03:20.319> wouldn't

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
things differently number one I wouldn't

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.130 
things differently number one I wouldn't
take<00:03:21.160> my<00:03:21.280> phone<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:21.670> with<00:03:21.790> me<00:03:21.970> stupidly<00:03:22.840> if<00:03:23.050> I

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
take my phone in with me stupidly if I

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.800 
take my phone in with me stupidly if I
took<00:03:23.200> my<00:03:23.379> phone<00:03:23.650> with<00:03:23.890> me<00:03:24.099> to<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.550> fight<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:25.060> put

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
took my phone with me to the fight I put

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.420 
took my phone with me to the fight I put
it<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:25.959> quite<00:03:26.260> deep<00:03:26.470> pocket<00:03:26.860> so<00:03:26.980> if<00:03:27.099> a<00:03:27.160> fall<00:03:27.340> it

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
it in quite deep pocket so if a fall it

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.870 
it in quite deep pocket so if a fall it
would<00:03:27.489> be<00:03:27.640> okay<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:29.410> somewhere<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:30.190> the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
would be okay but somewhere in the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.460 
would be okay but somewhere in the
middle<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.239> crowd<00:03:31.540> while<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.110> pushing

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
middle of the crowd while the pushing

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.070 
middle of the crowd while the pushing
and<00:03:32.500> shoving<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:33.099> lost<00:03:33.910> my<00:03:34.090> phone<00:03:34.300> to<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.870> sea

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
and shoving I lost my phone to the sea

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.559 
and shoving I lost my phone to the sea
of<00:03:35.349> salsa<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.400> probably<00:03:37.209> won't<00:03:37.360> be<00:03:37.540> doing

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
of salsa so I probably won't be doing

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.830 
of salsa so I probably won't be doing
that<00:03:37.810> again<00:03:38.019> in<00:03:38.380> future<00:03:38.530> too<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:40.330> won't<00:03:40.690> be

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
that again in future too I won't be

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.630 
that again in future too I won't be
bothering<00:03:41.140> with<00:03:41.230> goggles<00:03:41.500> again<00:03:41.950> they're

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
bothering with goggles again they're

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.030 
bothering with goggles again they're
actually<00:03:42.940> pretty<00:03:43.239> much<00:03:43.360> pointless<00:03:43.870> one<00:03:44.799> side

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
actually pretty much pointless one side

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.289 
actually pretty much pointless one side
of<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.220> goggles<00:03:45.370> was<00:03:45.730> covered<00:03:46.030> in<00:03:46.090> tomato

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
of the goggles was covered in tomato

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.050 
of the goggles was covered in tomato
pulp<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.349> other<00:03:47.530> side<00:03:47.739> steamed<00:03:48.190> up<00:03:48.370> so

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
pulp the other side steamed up so

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.640 
pulp the other side steamed up so
actually<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.540> couldn't<00:03:49.870> see<00:03:50.080> anything<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:50.440> I

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
actually I couldn't see anything so I

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.199 
actually I couldn't see anything so I
was<00:03:50.739> kind<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.010> like<00:03:51.130> flying<00:03:51.430> blind

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
was kind of like flying blind

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.660 
was kind of like flying blind
running<00:03:53.019> around<00:03:53.110> bumping<00:03:53.590> into<00:03:53.890> people<00:03:53.980> last

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
running around bumping into people last

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.280 
running around bumping into people last
time<00:03:54.880> in<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.420> end<00:03:55.510> I<00:03:55.720> took<00:03:55.750> off<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.140> goggles

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
time in the end I took off the goggles

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.539 
time in the end I took off the goggles
and<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.769> think<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.040> just<00:03:57.069> threw<00:03:57.280> them<00:03:57.459> away

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
and I think I just threw them away

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.460 
and I think I just threw them away
somewhere<00:03:57.970> Tomatina<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:58.930> something<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.380> I'd

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
somewhere Tomatina is something that I'd

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.589 
somewhere Tomatina is something that I'd
wanted<00:03:59.829> to<00:03:59.890> do<00:04:00.069> for<00:04:00.310> years<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.730> I'm<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.390> glad

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
that I finally did it

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.589 
that I finally did it
