I<00:05:48.760> thought<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.210> segments<00:05:49.630> were<00:05:49.720> good<00:05:49.870> but<00:05:50.080> the

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
I thought the segments were good but the

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.530 
I thought the segments were good but the
studio<00:05:50.560> stuff<00:05:50.860> well<00:05:51.190> seemed<00:05:51.910> a<00:05:52.000> little<00:05:52.120> forced

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
studio stuff well seemed a little forced

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.810

and<00:05:52.690> awkward<00:05:52.780> but<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:54.040> hosts<00:05:54.280> still<00:05:54.490> have<00:05:54.700> to

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
and awkward but the hosts still have to

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.520 
and awkward but the hosts still have to
feel<00:05:55.000> each<00:05:55.120> other<00:05:55.300> out<00:05:55.390> and<00:05:55.750> find<00:05:56.380> their

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
feel each other out and find their

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.900 
feel each other out and find their
comfort<00:05:56.890> zones<00:05:57.070> again<00:05:57.280> remember<00:05:57.580> that<00:05:57.730> I
