format<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.090> hard<00:03:47.570> drive<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.080> reinstall<00:03:49.209> but

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
format the hard drive and reinstall but

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.970 
format the hard drive and reinstall but
Microsoft<00:03:50.750> does<00:03:50.959> say<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.410> that<00:03:51.620> will<00:03:51.830> be

Microsoft does say that that will be

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.570 
Microsoft does say that that will be
possible<00:03:52.959> but<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.019> think<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.830> reason<00:03:55.010> why<00:03:55.340> they

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
possible but I think the reason why they

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.699 
possible but I think the reason why they
want<00:03:55.820> you<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.120> upgrade<00:03:56.500> from<00:03:58.150> your<00:03:59.150> existing

update process it takes about an hour to
an<00:05:37.900> hour<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.200> a<00:05:38.350> half<00:05:38.530> depending<00:05:38.800> on<00:05:39.160> machines

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
an hour and a half depending on machines

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.190 
an hour and a half depending on machines
and<00:05:39.820> depending<00:05:40.150> on<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.330> operating<00:05:40.600> system

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
and depending on the operating system

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.580 
and depending on the operating system
and<00:05:43.680> so<00:05:44.680> all<00:05:44.919> that<00:05:45.130> upgrade<00:05:45.820> process<00:05:46.590> will

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
and so all that upgrade process will

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.800 
and so all that upgrade process will
work<00:05:47.890> and<00:05:48.640> then<00:05:49.180> you'll<00:05:49.390> have<00:05:49.570> the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
work and then you'll have the

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.590 
work and then you'll have the
possibility<00:05:50.290> to<00:05:50.560> create<00:05:50.860> a<00:05:51.010> bootable<00:05:51.600> thumb

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
possibility to create a bootable thumb

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
possibility to create a bootable thumb
drive<00:05:52.900> in<00:05:53.230> some<00:05:54.130> way<00:05:54.850> it's<00:05:55.780> not<00:05:55.960> very<00:05:56.140> clear<00:05:56.500> if

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
drive in some way it's not very clear if

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.280 
drive in some way it's not very clear if
microsoft<00:05:57.220> intends<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:58.180> let<00:05:58.750> us<00:05:58.870> download

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
microsoft intends to let us download

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.409 
microsoft intends to let us download
maybe<00:05:59.919> an<00:06:00.100> image<00:06:00.520> file<00:06:00.760> or<00:06:00.970> something<00:06:01.120> like

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
maybe an image file or something like

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.360 
maybe an image file or something like
that<00:06:01.480> they<00:06:02.230> haven't<00:06:02.560> been<00:06:02.740> talking<00:06:03.250> about

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
that they haven't been talking about

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.960 
that they haven't been talking about
that<00:06:03.669> and<00:06:03.970> i<00:06:04.380> would<00:06:05.380> think<00:06:05.919> that<00:06:06.070> maybe<00:06:06.700> it's

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
that and i would think that maybe it's

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.240 
that and i would think that maybe it's
not<00:06:07.150> in<00:06:07.210> the<00:06:07.450> plans<00:06:07.750> to<00:06:08.080> do<00:06:08.290> so<00:06:08.590> but<00:06:08.770> rather<00:06:09.100> to

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
not in the plans to do so but rather to

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.120 
not in the plans to do so but rather to
just<00:06:09.669> upgrading<00:06:10.150> machines<00:06:10.510> and<00:06:10.720> then<00:06:11.080> have<00:06:11.650> a

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
just upgrading machines and then have a

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.500 
just upgrading machines and then have a
way<00:06:13.030> to<00:06:13.140> create<00:06:14.140> a<00:06:14.260> bootable<00:06:14.910> time<00:06:15.910> drive<00:06:16.210> to

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
way to create a bootable time drive to

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.850 
way to create a bootable time drive to
do<00:06:17.200> clean<00:06:17.440> installs<00:06:17.890> but<00:06:18.250> not<00:06:18.520> really<00:06:18.760> a

technically an image file that you

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.950 
technically an image file that you
