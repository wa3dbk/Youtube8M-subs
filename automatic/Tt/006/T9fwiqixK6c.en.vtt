00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that is very entertaining to the reader

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.660 
that is very entertaining to the reader
and<00:00:39.870> met<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.140> reader<00:00:40.500> wants<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.160> back<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and met the reader wants to go back and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.420 
and met the reader wants to go back and
read<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> again<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.410> make<00:00:43.620> sure<00:00:43.649> first<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.280> all

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
read it again so make sure first of all

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.119 
read it again so make sure first of all
that<00:00:44.489> your<00:00:45.180> incidents<00:00:45.719> follow<00:00:46.410> each<00:00:46.649> other<00:00:46.829> in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that your incidents follow each other in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.810 
that your incidents follow each other in
a<00:00:47.280> trigger<00:00:47.910> heap<00:00:48.420> fashion<00:00:49.550> what<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> mean<00:00:50.760> by

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
a trigger heap fashion what I mean by

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.619 
a trigger heap fashion what I mean by
trigger<00:00:51.149> heap<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.710> hold<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.219> gun<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.850> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
trigger heap is if I hold a gun and I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.840 
trigger heap is if I hold a gun and I
shoot<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.930> gun<00:00:55.460> someone's<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.670> fall

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
shoot the gun someone's going to fall

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.349 
shoot the gun someone's going to fall
over<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.480> heap<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> an<00:00:59.010> action<00:00:59.430> creates<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
over in a heap so an action creates a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.709 
over in a heap so an action creates a
reaction<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:01.829> someone<00:01:02.730> falls<00:01:02.969> over<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.510> heap

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
reaction if someone falls over in a heap

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.700 
reaction if someone falls over in a heap
that<00:01:04.559> becomes<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> trigger<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.000> next

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
that becomes the trigger for the next

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.100 
that becomes the trigger for the next
action<00:01:07.710> which<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.880> someone<00:01:09.570> comes<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> pick

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
action which is someone comes to pick

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.380 
action which is someone comes to pick
that<00:01:10.380> person<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.189> carry<00:01:11.700> them<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that person up and carry them to the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.340 
that person up and carry them to the
hospital<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.770> hope<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.840> triggers

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
hospital we hope so you have triggers

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.740 
hospital we hope so you have triggers
leading<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.220> heaps<00:01:17.490> leading<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> new<00:01:18.360> triggers

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
leading to heaps leading to new triggers

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.410 
leading to heaps leading to new triggers
and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.860> plot<00:01:20.159> has<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> sort<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.150> fall

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and then your plot has to sort of fall

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
and then your plot has to sort of fall
on<00:01:21.780> itself<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.799> fashion<00:01:23.299> ok<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
on itself in that fashion ok so do that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.530 
on itself in that fashion ok so do that
and<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:27.000> able<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.330> keep<00:01:27.479> your

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and you will be able to keep your

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.539 
and you will be able to keep your
audience<00:01:27.840> hooked<00:01:28.350> which<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.009> second<00:01:29.369> point

audience hooked which is my second point

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.330 
audience hooked which is my second point
about<00:01:29.820> making<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.210> good<00:01:30.390> plot<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:31.740> want<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.130> end

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
about making a good plot you want to end

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.969 
about making a good plot you want to end

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
or no deal and the end of who's smarter

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.330 
or no deal and the end of who's smarter
than<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> 5th<00:01:45.180> grader<00:01:45.470> right<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> see

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
than a 5th grader right we want to see

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.120 
than a 5th grader right we want to see
the<00:01:47.520> next<00:01:47.970> question<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the next question and so you have to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.240 
the next question and so you have to
keep<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:51.119> plot<00:01:51.479> moving<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.470> fashion<00:01:52.770> so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
keep your plot moving in that fashion so

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.590 
keep your plot moving in that fashion so
if<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.939> very<00:01:54.149> basic

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
if you think of in that very basic

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.469 
if you think of in that very basic
simple<00:01:54.810> game<00:01:55.200> show<00:01:55.470> kind<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.860> way<00:01:56.329> that's<00:01:57.329> what

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
simple game show kind of way that's what

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.219 
simple game show kind of way that's what
i<00:01:57.509> mean<00:01:57.689> by<00:01:57.869> hooking<00:01:59.240> finally<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.689> good<00:02:00.930> plot

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
i mean by hooking finally in a good plot

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.350 
i mean by hooking finally in a good plot
you're<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.040> tie<00:02:02.250> together<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you're going to tie together all of the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.530 
you're going to tie together all of the

the climax is going to be a result of
everything<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.989> you've<00:02:10.140> laid<00:02:10.349> down<00:02:10.500> before

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
everything that you've laid down before

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.730 
everything that you've laid down before
a<00:02:11.209> good<00:02:12.209> way<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> figure<00:02:12.959> out<00:02:13.140> how

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
a good way to figure out how

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470 
a good way to figure out how
to<00:02:13.830> make<00:02:14.040> your<00:02:14.190> incidents<00:02:14.700> add<00:02:14.850> up<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.240> this

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
to make your incidents add up like this

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.380 
to make your incidents add up like this
is<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.230> actually<00:02:16.380> take<00:02:17.160> your<00:02:17.490> ending<00:02:17.910> if<00:02:18.090> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
is to actually take your ending if you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.520 
is to actually take your ending if you
especially<00:02:18.660> if<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.020> think<00:02:19.200> your<00:02:19.290> ending

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
especially if you think your ending

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.130 
especially if you think your ending
isn't<00:02:19.650> working<00:02:20.100> take<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:21.180> ending<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.840> then

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
isn't working take your ending and then

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
isn't working take your ending and then
work<00:02:22.470> your<00:02:22.740> way<00:02:22.920> back<00:02:23.400> through<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.240> story<00:02:24.540> in

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
work your way back through the story in

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.520 
work your way back through the story in
a<00:02:25.470> descending<00:02:25.950> order<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.540> take<00:02:27.810> your<00:02:27.990> variant

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
a descending order so take your variant

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.880 
a descending order so take your variant
final<00:02:28.830> action<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.400> see<00:02:29.850> how<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.320> incidents

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
final action and see how the incidents

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.820 
final action and see how the incidents
that<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.430> wrote<00:02:32.640> before<00:02:32.790> are<00:02:33.360> leading<00:02:34.110> up<00:02:34.440> to

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
that you wrote before are leading up to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.850 
that you wrote before are leading up to
that<00:02:34.860> end<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.360> for<00:02:36.570> example<00:02:36.660> by<00:02:37.140> looking<00:02:37.710> at

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
that end so for example by looking at

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.300 
that end so for example by looking at
the<00:02:38.640> play<00:02:38.880> or<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.270> story<00:02:39.660> backwards<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:41.160> can

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
the play or the story backwards you can

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.140 
the play or the story backwards you can
see<00:02:41.490> what<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.850> needed<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.450> propel<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.050> forwards

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
see what is needed to propel it forwards

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.670 
see what is needed to propel it forwards
so<00:02:45.150> give<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.570> try<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.260> if<00:02:46.650> that

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
so give that a try and see if that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.830 
so give that a try and see if that
doesn't<00:02:47.100> work<00:02:47.130> for<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.940> hopefully<00:02:48.570> you

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
doesn't work for you and hopefully you

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.460 
doesn't work for you and hopefully you
can<00:02:49.170> make<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.620> very<00:02:49.950> good<00:02:50.010> plot
