to<00:03:05.440> chemistry<00:03:05.920> we're<00:03:06.220> actually<00:03:06.370> going<00:03:06.610> to

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
to chemistry we're actually going to

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.949 
to chemistry we're actually going to
improve<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.120> chemistry<00:03:07.480> now<00:03:07.630> because<00:03:07.840> we're

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
improve that chemistry now because we're

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.360 
improve that chemistry now because we're
going<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.140> go<00:03:08.200> ahead<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.350> apply<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:09.040> 22

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
going to go ahead and apply that for 22

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.360 
going to go ahead and apply that for 22
22<00:03:09.610> 22<00:03:09.970> 22<00:03:10.269> card<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:11.200> flirt<00:03:11.380> skate<00:03:11.650> it's<00:03:12.310> how

22 22 22 card just flirt skate it's how

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.150 
22 22 22 card just flirt skate it's how
can<00:03:12.489> improve<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.790> chemistry<00:03:13.290> 62<00:03:14.290> there<00:03:14.829> we<00:03:14.980> go

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
can improve on chemistry 62 there we go

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.819 
can improve on chemistry 62 there we go
so<00:03:15.430> let's<00:03:15.519> look<00:03:15.700> at<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.850> bit<00:03:16.060> bear<00:03:16.299> so<00:03:17.049> I've<00:03:17.380> kind

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
so let's look at a bit bear so I've kind

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.530 
so let's look at a bit bear so I've kind
of<00:03:17.980> got<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> few<00:03:18.670> links<00:03:18.880> i've<00:03:19.060> started<00:03:19.269> good<00:03:19.420> for

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
of got a few links i've started good for

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.819 
of got a few links i've started good for
the<00:03:19.690> four<00:03:19.900> triple<00:03:20.200> too<00:03:20.290> because<00:03:20.500> we<00:03:20.590> were<00:03:20.680> one

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
the four triple too because we were one

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.370 
the four triple too because we were one
two<00:03:21.040> three<00:03:21.400> four<00:03:22.000> players<00:03:22.299> that<00:03:22.630> were<00:03:22.780> all<00:03:23.260> in

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
two three four players that were all in

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.720 
two three four players that were all in
that<00:03:23.500> formation<00:03:23.829> out<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.310> post<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:24.579> got<00:03:24.700> i

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
that formation out the post we got i

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.590 
that formation out the post we got i
think<00:03:24.940> that's<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.209> most<00:03:25.420> for<00:03:25.690> any<00:03:27.600> hope

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
think that's the most for any hope

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.789 
think that's the most for any hope
there's<00:03:28.840> not<00:03:28.930> another<00:03:28.989> one<00:03:29.260> this<00:03:29.350> one<00:03:29.530> more<00:03:29.769> i

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
there's not another one this one more i

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.220 
there's not another one this one more i
don't<00:03:29.980> think<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.340> for<00:03:31.239> two<00:03:31.420> free<00:03:31.690> one<00:03:31.900> might<00:03:32.170> be

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
don't think so for two free one might be

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.830 
don't think so for two free one might be
a<00:03:32.290> couple<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.709> those<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.489> that's<00:03:34.480> going<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.750> be

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
a couple of those but that's going to be

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.060 
a couple of those but that's going to be
the<00:03:34.959> formation<00:03:35.410> when<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.620> use<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.890> for

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
the formation when you use the for

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.610 
the formation when you use the for
triple<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.660> didn't<00:03:37.660> get<00:03:37.810> any<00:03:37.989> good<00:03:38.110> right<00:03:38.380> back

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
triple to didn't get any good right back

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.370 
triple to didn't get any good right back
so<00:03:39.340> I've<00:03:39.549> gotta<00:03:39.730> reach<00:03:40.000> third<00:03:40.269> right<00:03:41.079> back<00:03:41.260> at

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
so I've gotta reach third right back at

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.720 
so I've gotta reach third right back at
the<00:03:41.440> moment<00:03:41.560> which<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:42.040> mean<00:03:42.280> he's<00:03:42.430> getting

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
the moment which I mean he's getting

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.430 
the moment which I mean he's getting
terrible<00:03:43.329> chemistry<00:03:43.750> one<00:03:43.930> chemistry

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
terrible chemistry one chemistry

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.840 
terrible chemistry one chemistry
doubtlessly<00:03:44.739> if<00:03:44.829> we<00:03:44.920> swap<00:03:45.100> at<00:03:45.250> all<00:03:45.459> if<00:03:45.640> down

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
doubtlessly if we swap at all if down

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.880 
doubtlessly if we swap at all if down
make<00:03:46.269> things<00:03:46.450> better<00:03:46.660> oh<00:03:46.930> it's<00:03:47.380> just<00:03:47.560> lowered

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
make things better oh it's just lowered

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.470 
make things better oh it's just lowered
the chemistry<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:48.670> I'm<00:03:49.090> just<00:03:49.269> gonna<00:03:49.360> have

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
the chemistry so I'm just gonna have

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.509 
the chemistry so I'm just gonna have
reached<00:03:49.780> someone<00:03:50.049> chemistry<00:03:50.769> is<00:03:50.829> not<00:03:51.220> very

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
reached someone chemistry is not very

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.520 
reached someone chemistry is not very
good<00:03:51.790> not<00:03:52.000> really<00:03:52.180> ideal<00:03:52.540> but<00:03:52.840> we<00:03:53.230> got<00:03:53.380> some

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
good not really ideal but we got some

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.720 
good not really ideal but we got some
pretty<00:03:53.650> solid<00:03:53.860> centre-backs<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.549> without

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
pretty solid centre-backs it without

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.720 
pretty solid centre-backs it without
Bona<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.390> Dougal<00:03:55.959> ow<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.220> one<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.610> always

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
Bona and Dougal ow so I one is always

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.759 
Bona and Dougal ow so I one is always
got<00:03:57.970> 80<00:03:58.209> place<00:03:58.570> quite<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.870> good<00:03:59.140> center<00:03:59.560> back<00:03:59.680> we

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
got 80 place quite a good center back we

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.310 
got 80 place quite a good center back we
got<00:03:59.860> to<00:04:00.220> see<00:04:00.670> dm's<00:04:00.940> from<00:04:01.209> Syria<00:04:01.630> are<00:04:01.900> quite<00:04:02.290> a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
got to see dm's from Syria are quite a

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.350 
got to see dm's from Syria are quite a
few<00:04:02.380> Syria<00:04:02.739> our<00:04:02.920> players<00:04:03.160> in<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.400> team<00:04:03.579> not

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
few Syria our players in the team not

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.390 
few Syria our players in the team not
the<00:04:04.390> fastest<00:04:05.049> always<00:04:05.380> at<00:04:05.530> 70<00:04:05.950> pace<00:04:06.130> but

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
the fastest always at 70 pace but

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.340 
the fastest always at 70 pace but
they've<00:04:06.940> got<00:04:06.970> quite<00:04:07.359> decent<00:04:07.690> defending<00:04:08.109> stats

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
they've got quite decent defending stats

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.479 
they've got quite decent defending stats
hopefully<00:04:08.739> they<00:04:08.829> should<00:04:08.980> be<00:04:09.100> good<00:04:09.220> for<00:04:09.400> the

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
hopefully they should be good for the

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.059 
hopefully they should be good for the
number<00:04:09.699> scene

top we got de Bayeux and a ruffie so you

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.370 
top we got de Bayeux and a ruffie so you
can<00:04:29.000> see<00:04:29.150> Rossi's<00:04:29.509> any<00:04:29.630> game<00:04:29.810> free<00:04:30.050> chemistry

can see Rossi's any game free chemistry

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.960 
can see Rossi's any game free chemistry
tries<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.740> again<00:04:30.800> for<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.250> really<00:04:31.759> want<00:04:31.910> your

tries it again for you really want your

tries it again for you really want your
strikers<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.479> begin<00:04:32.690> more<00:04:32.900> chemistry<00:04:33.169> than

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
strikers to begin more chemistry than

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.020 
strikers to begin more chemistry than
that<00:04:33.500> but<00:04:33.710> i<00:04:33.919> just<00:04:34.490> don't<00:04:34.669> really<00:04:34.820> think
