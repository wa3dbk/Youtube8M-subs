00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200
 today germany was going to be so awesome 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.950
 so devastating 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.720
 so strong 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.810
 because there came a moment of the game 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.140
 where the midfielders who returns to 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.789
 repeat that Brazil does not have a filter 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.050
 midfield 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.029
 as to anyone 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:36.590
 the defenders today between front and of 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.910
 louis never ever coordinated 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.450
 but it looked like a football game 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.850
 you'll see rings from the ones from abÃ³s and bueno 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.000
 pushed 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.890
 the goals of germany were like that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.640
 but the most serious 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.380
 is that what we have been saying in 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.740
 left 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.100
 what brasil 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:06.560
 without neymar 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.600
 cinema brasil has no game and today 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.010
 Brazil 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.010
 they were the balls david luiz 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.850
 it was some incursions of jul 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:24.520
 but that Germany always had the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.520
 match in hand germany looked like brazil 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.650
 I think they looked like two fair brazilians 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.900
 because they were everywhere which 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.300
 they wanted it all 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.640
 they asked for everything they wanted to play all 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.640
 they wanted to participate all 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.010
 And I think that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.860
 look for a figure in germany is made 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.180
 very difficult it becomes very difficult because 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.560
 from the goalkeeper 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.260
 until the last the last replacement that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.260
 did 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.270
 and everything was done well a 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.270
 replacement got two goals south south 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:19.450
 It would be nice to always have it in the bank 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.450
 no but but I'm sorry for this one 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.870
 because Brazil 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.890
 he was full of pride of his 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.890
 is reelection 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.890
 and I wanted to get to the final 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.980
 but 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.400
 football gives you these cases last night 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.400
 someone
