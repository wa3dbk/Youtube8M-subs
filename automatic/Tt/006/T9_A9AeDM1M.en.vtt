this deck the softer foundry sword
things<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.300> not<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.590> want<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.859> be

things just not what you want to be

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.599 
things just not what you want to be
doing<00:00:21.170> especially<00:00:22.170> since<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.619> found<00:00:22.980> myself<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
doing especially since I found myself a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.480 
doing especially since I found myself a
game<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.029> didn't<00:00:24.330> record<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:25.490> brainstormed

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
game that I didn't record I brainstormed

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.750 
game that I didn't record I brainstormed
and<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.480> had<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> shuffle<00:00:28.470> effect<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.039> brainstorm

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
and I had a shuffle effect I brainstorm

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.049 
and I had a shuffle effect I brainstorm
into<00:00:30.150> foundry<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.289> sword<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.910> just

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
into foundry and sword and then I just

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.080 
into foundry and sword and then I just
shuffled<00:00:33.719> them<00:00:33.840> away<00:00:34.140> because<00:00:34.820> if<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:36.350> did

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
shuffled them away because if they did

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.729 
shuffled them away because if they did
so<00:00:39.090> trivial<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.870> mean<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.290> want<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> be

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
so trivial I mean you just want to be

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.459 
so trivial I mean you just want to be
doing<00:00:41.180> much<00:00:42.180> more<00:00:42.450> interesting<00:00:42.989> things<00:00:43.170> than

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
doing much more interesting things than

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.799 
doing much more interesting things than
making<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:44.129> ones<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.579> gaining<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:45.000> life<00:00:45.210> dr.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809

foundry<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.430> make<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> case<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
foundry you can make a case for if you

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.700 
foundry you can make a case for if you
wanted<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> add<00:00:49.469> more<00:00:51.199> synergistic<00:00:52.199> parts<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
wanted to add more synergistic parts and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.560 
wanted to add more synergistic parts and
I<00:00:52.770> don't<00:00:52.949> need<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.340> synergistic<00:00:54.000> parts<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
I don't need more synergistic parts in

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.590 
I don't need more synergistic parts in
making<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.559> ones<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.100> mean<00:00:56.390> things<00:00:57.390> that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
making one ones I mean things that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
making one ones I mean things that
benefit<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.500> sacking<00:00:59.010> artifacts<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
benefit you from sacking artifacts and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.369 
benefit you from sacking artifacts and
putting<00:01:00.120> artifacts<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.750> graveyard<00:01:00.960> and

putting artifacts in your graveyard and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.830 
putting artifacts in your graveyard and
stuff<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.329> thought<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> founders

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
stuff like that but thought the founders

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.219 
stuff like that but thought the founders
should<00:01:03.960> probably<00:01:04.290> come<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:05.750> sure<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
should probably come out sure there's a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.920 
should probably come out sure there's a
million<00:01:07.439> different<00:01:07.590> things<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.250> add<00:01:08.460> in
