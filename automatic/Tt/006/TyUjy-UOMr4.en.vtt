00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.330
 the clearings of dir and swat the initial zone 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.600
 of the undead and one of the most 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.850
 dark and gloomy of the game 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.860
 Many believe it's hidden secrets 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.830
 under this floor formerly 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.140
 sacred 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.579
 and some claim to have seen strangers 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.859
 events in some parts of this forest 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.890
 in this first chapter of drop legends 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:41.990
 bow I will teach you one thing that few people 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.360
 He has seen with his own eyes 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.130
 and that, however, is enough 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.270
 known simply among the 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.990
 enthusiasts of the subject but that is secret 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.140
 can hide these mills plains and 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.320
 trees 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.149
 a very peculiar one and one that since 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.780
 then you would not expect a person to see 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.780
 this forest 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.020
 look at the map of tÃ­rig garden that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.390
 You see a typical area with a capital 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.930
 down here that we can open and enter 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.740
 the same the zone where they initiate their 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.620
 adventures the undead graveyard a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.560
 small town called oars and a lot 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.720
 of territories to do quest and kill 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.280
 bugs 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.780
 you do not see anything else 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.780
 thanks about this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.260
 this was here from the beginning of 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.180
 the times since it went wow without 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.490
 But we could never access that 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.820
 zone because we could not fly by 11-0 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.860
 obviously 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.510
 now I am dangerously close to the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.560
 restricted area 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.750
 however as for the 4.0 point 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.900
 zero 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.460
 have taken flights for steels and the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.460
 people started to explore the world 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.840
 and many decided to go through an area 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.670
 that was previously inaccessible 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.830
 and they found our prey 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.569
 If this area seems very typical there is a 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.959
 lots of areas so they are simply 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.450
 filling a small lake a small 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.410
 forest and nothing important or interesting 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.030
 there are not even structures here 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.360
 there's nothing interesting until you see 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.360
 this 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.450
 are circles of mushrooms three circles 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.190
 completely perfect is not any 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.130
 coincidence there is no similar fungus 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.530
 around and with a rare fog over 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.880
 there are some small moths not card 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.370
 talk flying around which 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.200
 means that people who have done 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.150
 this has taken a lot of effort 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.960
 because I have not seen anything similar in 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.910
 no part of the game 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.910
 what is this site about 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.330
 nobody knows 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.250
 but basically every 15 or 30 minutes 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.140
 they will add small spherical dragon 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.630
 around this circle 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.610
 little by little one by one they will give 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.980
 small laps around here around here 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.459
 here 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.730
 to be seven of them and when they are 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.830
 seven take a couple more laps and in a 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.580
 given moment will do one thing really 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.580
 strange 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.520
 so you do not have to wait for the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.830
 event you with me I will leave it in 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.100
 background and I'll go back and record the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.180
 start of the event when it happens 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.530
 now for the moment I can not teach you 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.330
 no federico dragon because 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.060
 apparently they try on Fridays to 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.060
 join and I do not see any 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.160
 and that is the strange event 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.859
 It happens once every six hours and nobody 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.099
 knows what it is for or what it is 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.099
 exactly 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.270
 but 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.009
 if they are again 7 dragon spherical 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.270
 who are singing 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:08.050
 some people thought that all this has 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.050
 what to do with the ancient gods 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.000
 and in fact someone asked one 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.410
 of the developers 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.910
 to which he got a clear answer not 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.460
 there are no ancient gods below you 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.240
 bisbal but I know there is something 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.490
 completely evil and terrifying 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.820
 they also gave advice I do not know 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.920
 recommends finishing very deep in this area 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.680
 is what you see 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.980
 luckily here there are dead worlds and no 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.980
 in years 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.840
 and you have to talk many times about this 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.590
 phenomenon that first appeared in 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.840
 the patch 4 xx that is to say in cataclysm 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.990
 because obviously this area was not before 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.990
 accessible 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.620
 and it's the first time I see him with my 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.919
 own eyes 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.860
 before you could card what is the 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.630
 own portal that if this was a 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.270
 sort of portal now and you can not 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.710
 do and you can not enter inside nor 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.169
 nothing like that is simply a 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.040
 thing that is there that they invoke these 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:18.160
 little cute creatures and doe 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.470
 all of these see deer how they are called 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.500
 plagued people gather around for 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.490
 look at it and it just ends in a couple of 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:31.070
 minutes of making that quote song 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.990
 everyone goes to their place and disappears 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.020
 so curious is this phenomenon 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:40.700
 an urban legend that nobody knows what 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.700
 means what it means 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.550
 this music track has not been used in 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:10.500
 no other part of the game and its only 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.500
 for this area and this event in particular 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.449
 and the truth is that it does not look like anything 

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:31.249
 I 've heard in this game 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.409
 the style is completely different to 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:35.320
 any melody that you find 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:37.210
 Any part of the world 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.890
 at least for me I did not hear anything 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.600
 similar to say neither you in the 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.410
 comments 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.720
 meanwhile I hope that I have 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.750
 liked this first chapter of legends 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.210
 in world of warcraft as always give it 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.990
 Like favorites subscribe to the channel or 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.770
 how are you here 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.960
 until next time 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.530
 We will see dragon circle again 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.530
 spherical
