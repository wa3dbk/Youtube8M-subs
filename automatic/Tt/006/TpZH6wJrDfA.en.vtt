00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.920 

okay<00:00:02.590> I<00:00:02.620> have<00:00:02.889> a<00:00:02.920> new<00:00:03.130> effect<00:00:03.509> which<00:00:04.509> I<00:00:04.660> call

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:04.930 
okay I have a new effect which I call

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.749 
okay I have a new effect which I call
art<00:00:05.350> pencil

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.400 

and<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.839> the<00:00:12.990> default<00:00:13.469> view

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.210 

and<00:00:18.009> it's<00:00:18.640> pretty<00:00:18.880> simple<00:00:19.349> just<00:00:20.349> one<00:00:20.590> caveat

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.909 

it<00:00:24.220> is<00:00:24.429> processed<00:00:25.090> or<00:00:25.239> intensive<00:00:25.779> so<00:00:26.169> it'll

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
it is processed or intensive so it'll

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.369 
it is processed or intensive so it'll
take<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.160> while<00:00:27.460> for<00:00:27.599> rendering<00:00:28.599> to<00:00:28.779> finish<00:00:31.379> but

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
take a while for rendering to finish but

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.090 
take a while for rendering to finish but
it's<00:00:32.829> interesting<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.510> it<00:00:35.470> has<00:00:35.620> a<00:00:35.650> fairly

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
it's interesting and it has a fairly

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.330 
it's interesting and it has a fairly
wide<00:00:36.820> latitude<00:00:37.150> of<00:00:37.690> effect

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.550 

there<00:00:41.340> are<00:00:41.520> four<00:00:41.880> types<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:44.070> default<00:00:44.790> I

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
there are four types the default I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.290 
there are four types the default I
called<00:00:46.560> the<00:00:46.710> second<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.190> oil<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:48.090> when<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
called the second one oil because when I

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880 
called the second one oil because when I
was<00:00:48.510> developing<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.470> looked<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.770> little

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
was developing this it looked a little

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.190 
was developing this it looked a little
like<00:00:50.040> oil<00:00:50.460> pastels<00:00:51.150> but<00:00:51.630> that<00:00:51.870> won't<00:00:52.020> always

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
like oil pastels but that won't always

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.640 
like oil pastels but that won't always
be<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.620> case<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.190> every<00:00:53.550> clip<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.470> will

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
be the case on every clip so it will

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.190 
be the case on every clip so it will
depend<00:00:55.950> on<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.100> type<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.400> clip<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.200> then

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
depend on the type of clip and then

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.470 
depend on the type of clip and then
there<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.560> sketch<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> sketch<00:00:59.280> too

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

fan of that if you do try and keep it
low<00:01:39.690> but<00:01:40.400> some<00:01:41.400> Clips<00:01:41.700> might<00:01:42.030> look<00:01:42.390> good<00:01:42.630> with

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
low but some Clips might look good with

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.800 
low but some Clips might look good with
a<00:01:43.170> lot<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> stroke<00:01:43.890> animation<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.600> can

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
a lot of stroke animation and you can

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.130 
a lot of stroke animation and you can
tone<00:01:46.320> down<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.920> stroke<00:01:47.330> or<00:01:48.330> ramp<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> up

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
tone down the stroke or ramp it up

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.210 
tone down the stroke or ramp it up
pretty<00:01:49.470> good<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.899> let's<00:01:51.899> take<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.679> look<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.009> some

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
pretty good so let's take a look at some

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
pretty good so let's take a look at some
of<00:01:53.250> these<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.580> settings

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:44.800 

let's<00:01:59.020> start<00:01:59.230> with<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.590> pressure

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:54.080

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.140 

so<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:19.850> can<00:03:20.120> get<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.840> lot<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.230> different<00:03:22.150> looks

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
so you can get a lot of different looks

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:56.559 
so you can get a lot of different looks
with<00:03:23.540> this

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.830 

well<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:57.110> hope<00:03:57.319> you<00:03:57.439> enjoy<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:59.239> I'll<00:03:59.569> catch
