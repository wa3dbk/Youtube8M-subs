00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.890
 Unfortunately I have the fair in Oldenburg 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.359
 missed today I have at 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.700
 audi center in oldenburg the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.519
 possibility the audi a3 sportback goes 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.590
 to drive by sample 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.940
 hello my will I have here the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.590
 trial ride prepared for you that is 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.180
 I wish you a lot of fun and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.869
 good bike friendly friendly 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.869
 thank you 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.740
 the car is of interest to the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.500
 environmentally friendly drive of the audi a3 e 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.000
 tron for gasoline or natural gas driven 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.650
 on request can even complete 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.080
 be driven climate neutral with the 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.250
 Audi e-gas is currently a family man 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.830
 me the environmentally bear a particularly 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.830
 But now I want to drive first 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.950
 my first impression is he is 40 very 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.799
 Quiet, very good on the street and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.929
 moved to the top at 100 kilometers 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.710
 the audi a3 e-tron consumes less 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:27.020
 than 35 kilograms 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.969
 These 100 kilometers would be three today 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.979
 euro fifty to four euros cost each 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:36.350
 after gas stations but also with gasoline 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.920
 he consumes only 57 liters per 100 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.920
 kilometre 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.850
 so the test drive will be like 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:06.070
 wonderful is a very nice rides 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.780
 Drenching would be sparkling than me 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.660
 Vehicle at home very much 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.000
 class you still have questions about the technology 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.250
 or to the vehicle's total gasoline 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.560
 natural gas is known to me yes but what is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.960
 the audi e-gas by means of audi e-gas have 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.340
 you the possibility of the vehicle 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.430
 Audi A3 is going to drive neutral from CO2 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.530
 in a power to gas plant in werlte 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.560
 it turns into green electricity from natural gas 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.040
 produced the so-called e gas and co2 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.350
 output from the vehicle will be the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.020
 Vehicle consumed is guaranteed that 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.880
 the value of the gas system 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.240
 is saved accordingly and thus 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.250
 is neutral with the audi a3 e-tron co2 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.470
 flags possible that sounds good 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.860
 he would thank me very much 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.130
 I have fun to thank for 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.459

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.459
