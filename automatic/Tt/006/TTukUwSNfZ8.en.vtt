when<00:00:04.020> my<00:00:04.319> clients<00:00:04.859> told<00:00:05.609> me<00:00:05.790> they<00:00:05.940> were

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
when my clients told me they were

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.089 
when my clients told me they were
building<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.509> cottage<00:00:06.990> as<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.740> thought<00:00:07.890> that

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
building a cottage as I thought that

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.890 
building a cottage as I thought that
sounds<00:00:08.490> really<00:00:08.700> exciting<00:00:08.730> I've<00:00:09.450> worked<00:00:09.780> on

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
sounds really exciting I've worked on

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.560 
sounds really exciting I've worked on
two<00:00:10.290> cottages<00:00:10.650> before<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.519> then<00:00:12.059> when<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.300> saw

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
two cottages before and then when I saw

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.539 
two cottages before and then when I saw
the<00:00:12.630> plans<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.259> realized<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.040> was<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> lot

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
the plans I realized that it was a lot

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.760 
the plans I realized that it was a lot
larger<00:00:14.790> than<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.150> had<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.599> my<00:00:15.750> head<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.440> me<00:00:16.590> this

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
larger than I had in my head to me this

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.630 
larger than I had in my head to me this
is<00:00:16.949> more<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.550> second<00:00:18.180> home<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:19.220> feel<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
is more of a second home I feel that the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.420 
is more of a second home I feel that the
Muskoka<00:00:21.000> area<00:00:21.359> has<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.990> certain<00:00:22.619> style<00:00:22.980> and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
Muskoka area has a certain style and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.460 
Muskoka area has a certain style and
this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> style<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.869> sort<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.230> worked

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
this is the style that we sort of worked

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.439 
this is the style that we sort of worked
from<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.010> really<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.550> how<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> dark<00:00:27.090> gray

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
from I really like how the dark gray

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.080 
from I really like how the dark gray
fits<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.500> Muskoka<00:00:29.039> setting<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.670> then

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
fits in this Muskoka setting and then

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.400 
fits in this Muskoka setting and then
the<00:00:30.330> fact<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.689> we've<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> bit<00:00:31.320> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the fact that we've got a bit of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.650 
the fact that we've got a bit of

the material selection was very

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.669 
the material selection was very
important<00:01:49.819> but<00:01:50.149> we<00:01:50.689> did<00:01:50.899> keep<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.469> consistent

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
important but we did keep a consistent

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.889 
important but we did keep a consistent
palette<00:01:52.490> throughout<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.030> entire<00:01:53.329> home

palette throughout the entire home

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.200 
palette throughout the entire home
because<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.710> gives<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.219> style<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:56.119> the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
because it gives you a style to the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.760 
because it gives you a style to the
whole<00:01:56.359> place<00:01:56.539> it<00:01:56.899> allows<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.319> to<00:01:57.350> move<00:01:57.560> things

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
whole place it allows you to move things

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.349 
whole place it allows you to move things
around<00:01:58.009> which<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.549> like<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.759> do<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.209> they'll

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
around which I like to do and they'll

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.690 
around which I like to do and they'll
look<00:01:59.509> good<00:01:59.750> almost<00:02:00.079> in<00:02:00.350> every<00:02:00.560> space<00:02:00.829> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
look good almost in every space the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.520 
look good almost in every space the
flooring<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:02.240> another<00:02:02.509> consistent<00:02:02.959> element

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
flooring is another consistent element

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.469 
flooring is another consistent element
we<00:02:03.649> have<00:02:03.679> it's<00:02:04.159> reclaimed<00:02:04.640> wood<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:05.149> that

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
we have it's reclaimed wood and that

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.559 
we have it's reclaimed wood and that
gives<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.140> new<00:02:07.009> build<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.939> old<00:02:08.149> feeling

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
gives that new build the old feeling

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.600 
gives that new build the old feeling
again<00:02:08.840> which<00:02:09.080> is<00:02:09.259> really<00:02:09.590> important<00:02:10.069> one

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
again which is really important one

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.339 
again which is really important one
thing<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:10.849> found<00:02:11.000> tricky<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.629> coordinate<00:02:12.049> was

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
thing I found tricky to coordinate was

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.890 
thing I found tricky to coordinate was
the<00:02:12.799> lighting<00:02:13.220> because<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.790> do<00:02:14.060> see<00:02:14.540> them

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
the lighting because you do see them

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.020 
the lighting because you do see them
everywhere<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.830> are<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:16.519> had<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.760> find

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
everywhere you are so we had to find

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.030 
everywhere you are so we had to find
things<00:02:17.269> that<00:02:17.599> really<00:02:17.989> complemented<00:02:18.829> each

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
things that really complemented each

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.150 
things that really complemented each
other<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:19.790> have<00:02:19.879> pendants<00:02:20.360> over<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.349> island<00:02:21.829> a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
other we have pendants over the island a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.280 
other we have pendants over the island a
glass<00:02:22.610> fixture<00:02:23.209> over<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.420> dining<00:02:23.750> table<00:02:24.170> and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
glass fixture over the dining table and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.229 
glass fixture over the dining table and
then<00:02:24.379> another<00:02:24.650> glass<00:02:24.920> pendant<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.670> entry

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
then another glass pendant in the entry

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.420 
then another glass pendant in the entry
and<00:02:26.450> then<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.110> showstopper<00:02:27.799> ends<00:02:28.160> up<00:02:28.250> being

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
and then the showstopper ends up being

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.160 
and then the showstopper ends up being
the<00:02:28.640> extra-large<00:02:29.090> lantern<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.810> living
