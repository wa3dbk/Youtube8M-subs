00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
 everyone today I'm coming back 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.799
 for a bone 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.190
 so no need to see him today 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.840
 the small hall will be at stokomani 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.670
 so that's really small because 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.900
 you must know if you have one 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.630
 home loan are as nice is 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.270
 really small prices so in fact 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.790
 I went there to find something 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.110
 and I did not find them but by 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.420
 against suddenly I found full 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.270
 other stuff that was cheap from the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.310
 everything so I took them so we 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.360
 start with then I warn you 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.090
 it's stuff for home la 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:50.950
 most of the time a lot of tea towel to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.750
 3,095 are three here and as I have 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.210
 decided that I wanted blue in my 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.600
 living room and that my kitchenette and in my 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.760
 living room 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.470
 when I saw that it was in shades 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.810
 of blue and green I said to myself go 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.920
 tea towels we never have too much especially the 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.560
 links start to be a little bit 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.020
 old worn so I took some tea towels 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.070
 in short I think the rest will be more 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.200
 interesting really though then I 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.030
 arrived in the cup department is in 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.859
 made a direct tax radius my 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.600
 look was caught by star so I got 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.539
 I'm told but it's not a cup 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.450
 did what there I prices I opened and 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.600
 in fact it was a candle that smelled 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.950
 too good and the worry is that she 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.299
 was lost in this radius in fact she 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.829
 is not at all like often 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.179
 in this kind of store where people get 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.069
 move things and do not bother 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.990
 so I had to wait to arrive 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.789
 at the end of the store to finally fell 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.369
 above were all a little up to 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.109
 corner actually with this one that is 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.600
 so raspberry 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:53.859
 this one vanilla quest is 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.119
 also at the cherry then at 1,095 the 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.850
 candle I immediately thought of 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.499
 yankee kandel and I thought to myself if 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.760
 it may not be as effective in 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.580
 Under water regulations 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.650
 avoid at this price there I will test the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.910
 shot I took three perfumes and if 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.320
 it interests you if you want to know 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.240
 it works well I think I'm going 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.620
 start them on tonight I 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.150
 could tell you more imposed me 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.950
 the question just below phl you 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.810
 know it's done for that and there I 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.100
 finally go to do not even I do not pass 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.220
 to beauty products because actually 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.990
 like I thought it was not 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.880
 anything else show upside down who 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.540
 was not at all in the radius 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.270
 appropriate either are these you know 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.610
 little stickers stuff there 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.750
 to mark your pages in fact in the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.340
 note pads and I told myself that in 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.550
 my little notebook it will be very practical 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.950
 it was 50 cents and is against 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.230
 I actually never really found 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.880
 risk it was in the store it's at 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.580
 to say that I pick them up where I found 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.650
 and at no time did I see the same 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.330
 thing so I do not know if it was the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.880
 last or if I missed the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.880
 ray but good then I went in 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.490
 the beauty ray the ray created the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.390
 shampoo all that and I looked at a 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.980
 little what is the high level of 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.320
 care there was not much that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.450
 interested me however I saw this 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.040
 little there finally this is not a stick in 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.040
 do it's a thing with three lives for 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.170
 do an anti-concealer facial massage 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.390
 pocket anti swelling brand menem 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.730
 care and in fact I immediately thought of 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.080
 my darling who started telling me there is 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.650
 a few days he needed him 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.900
 buy back decree m 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.280
 eye care etc and when 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.750
 I saw that I thought that good 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.430
 I was still going to buy better sacred 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.920
 but without eye contour no problem 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.450
 but that could not be luxury 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.879
 for 2 euros 99 to test since since 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.599
 it has a cold effect necessarily it must 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.450
 do good 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.500
 so here I pray to them saying that 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.879
 will make him a little surprise besides 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.599
 I have not given yet so it is not 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.340
 still aware 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.379
 and like that at the same time he can 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.030
 test and give me his opinion so the same 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.680
 if you want to know project you me 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.540
 ask and tell you this after test 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.780
 Then I came across 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.970
 solvents and that's where I hit 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.560
 that I almost had it so it was 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.870
 It may be wise to redeem 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.629
 lower cost so much to do and I 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.810
 took a basic solvent so at 1.049 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.819
 which is therefore paraben free without acetone 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.099
 and sweet almond oil so has 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.530
 priori the smell should not be too much 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.359
 Too much disgust and the same brand 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.729
 freshness there was this little bath 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.360
 dissonant express so with the concept 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:28.039
 cotton inside a vest and one 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.840
 it cost 3 euros 99 and still 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.370
 I had that of sephora and I had 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.690
 found very nice even though he had found 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.060
 that he had not lasted long 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.880
 it was still very practical 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.349
 I said to myself here at 3.099 I know 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.960
 how much does it cost and that of sephora 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:44.090
 but there I was there he was there so I 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.260
 pray them saying that when I 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.750
 was fed up with that one I would take 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.340
 that one and vice versa and arrived this 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.889
 was not excessively expensive of any 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.470
 way so it went well then you 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.270
 know that I really like the care for 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.940
 hair and if I especially like them 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.960
 care without rinsing in fact and as I do not 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.090
 do not know this brand at all 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.030
 fresh and that I saw that there was this 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.030
 care without rinsing shea and mango and 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.349
 I love shea and mango except 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.909
 it's really products that are 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.940
 perfect for hair and already had 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.640
 full of care without rinsing abbas 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.750
 - go and or shea I've always been 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.180
 very happy with the result 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.040
 so suddenly I have the prices and this one 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.050
 was 1 euros 99 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.280
 so that's kind of product that 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.260
 I will use me and I will 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.120
 also put it at my fingertips after 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.680
 the hair it looks all good it detangles 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.840
 easily it's a real treat 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.400
 so it's just nickel and then so much 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.170
 to be in this brand fia who 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.690
 was not very very expensive I am 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.000
 also came across this hand cream 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.160
 moisturizing with sweet almond oil and 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.170
 it's a secret I love 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.030
 the smell of the world actually 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:50.650
 and suddenly and suddenly I thought bah 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.210
 like hand creams with 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.670
 the coming winter is not going to be 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.130
 luxury so at least I would still have 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.750
 one in Arabic and I do not have that much 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.810
 actually because I'm mom every 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.460
 So here another night small product 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.080
 I passed before I told myself 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.490
 hold that each time you groan because 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.620
 that you do not have and every time you 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.930
 forget to buy it so it's thing 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.630
 repaired talent like fuck everything 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.850
 simply because it has several uses 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.730
 one two three six and hard to say 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.430
 because it uses several very 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.110
 interesting and suddenly this time 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.450
 I have one and the next time you 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.290
 would seek I would rent and then a 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.360
 little gadget 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.030
 it is a support for tablets 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.650
 touch is a little thing in fact 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.210
 which is a priori and you put to 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.760
 touch pad at lets you the 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.800
 to watch without necessarily having support 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.620
 and for it to be pretty much straight 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.419
 war is actually I took it by telling myself 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.990
 good it may be able to serve me with 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.730
 the ipad but I also told myself I was 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.750
 disappointed that my phone because the 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.910
 morning when I take my brekkie 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.669
 sometimes not all the time but sometimes 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.970
 I put my phone I turned on I 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.310
 look where a video that interests me or 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.410
 here are the videos of the girlfriends at all and 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.610
 it is true that it must be held or 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.400
 after you have to put it on the table and 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.530
 it's not super nice to watch 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.729
 phone like that so I thought 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.650
 that I was going to test see if it's a 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.759
 market also with the telephone and that 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.520
 shot in the morning I could put the 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.680
 phone like that and a lot more see 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.840
 on it so that's it for all 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.009
 what I bought at stokomani but 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.930
 good as you will understand it is 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.009
 really the typical place where you 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.410
 find lots of little things 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:28.080
 interesting at a low price so at the same 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.150
 time do not really ruin yourself by going 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.860
 in this kind of store so suddenly it 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.410
 are two ways of seeing things so 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.720
 you do not know stokomani the 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.190
 first is alesi because you 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.220
 go see there are lots of little things 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.690
 super and cheap the second way of 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.280
 to see things is not to go 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.139
 because even if you do not need to 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.560
 nothing you will find something to 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:49.050

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.760
 exactly what you want to do 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.530
 but overall it's that so on this 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.970
