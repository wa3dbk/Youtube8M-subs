00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
game I think I match up pretty well if I

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.219

can<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.479> execute<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.079> want

can go out there and execute what I want
to<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.549> fact<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.790> Roger<00:01:51.030> Rasheed's

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
to do is the fact that Roger Rasheed's

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.120 
to do is the fact that Roger Rasheed's
been<00:01:52.020> involved<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.560> both<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.979> any

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
been involved with you both have any

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.880 
been involved with you both have any
give<00:01:54.000> any<00:01:54.149> extra<00:01:54.450> significance<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
give any extra significance to to the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.859 
give any extra significance to to the
next<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.460> don't<00:01:56.850> think<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.719> once

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
next one I don't think so I think once

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.459 
next one I don't think so I think once
we<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.259> there<00:01:58.500> some<00:01:59.780> yeah<00:02:00.780> maybe<00:02:01.290> we

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
we get out there some yeah maybe we

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.539 
we get out there some yeah maybe we
played<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> couple<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.979> times<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.340> he

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
played a couple of times I think he

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
played a couple of times I think he
knows<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:02.909> game<00:02:02.969> really<00:02:03.390> well<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.960> know

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
knows my game really well and I know

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.230 
knows my game really well and I know
he's<00:02:04.590> pretty<00:02:04.799> well<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.850> know<00:02:05.909> once<00:02:06.090> it's

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
he's pretty well so you know once it's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.550 
he's pretty well so you know once it's
going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.659> there<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
going to be out there this is going to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.190 
going to be out there this is going to
be<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> different<00:02:07.920> map<00:02:08.039> scores<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.489> grass<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
be a different map scores on grass and I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.600 
be a different map scores on grass and I
think<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:10.770> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> biggest

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
think that's going to be the biggest

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.300 
think that's going to be the biggest
hopefully<00:02:12.910> telling<00:02:13.210> point<00:02:13.390> yeah<00:02:14.200> yeah<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
hopefully telling point yeah yeah the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.630 
hopefully telling point yeah yeah the
first<00:02:15.760> match<00:02:15.940> was<00:02:16.110> physically<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.410> long<00:02:18.310> points

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
first match was physically a long points

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.280 
first match was physically a long points
out<00:02:18.760> there<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.540> always<00:02:19.810> hard<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.140> first

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
out there and it's always hard the first

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.560 
out there and it's always hard the first
five<00:02:20.560> setter<00:02:20.830> on<00:02:20.980> grass<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.400> think<00:02:21.610> but<00:02:22.540> a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
five setter on grass I think but a

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.450 
five setter on grass I think but a
bounce-back<00:02:22.900> well<00:02:23.140> today<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.710> obviously

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
bounce-back well today and obviously

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.490 
bounce-back well today and obviously
today<00:02:24.760> didn't<00:02:25.090> take<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.510> whole<00:02:25.720> heap<00:02:26.110> out<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.410> me

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
today didn't take a whole heap out of me

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.940 
today didn't take a whole heap out of me
which<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.680> good<00:02:27.870> moving<00:02:28.870> forward<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.440> know<00:02:29.470> if

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
which is good moving forward you know if

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.500 
which is good moving forward you know if
you<00:02:30.100> can<00:02:30.190> keep<00:02:30.340> doing<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.820> put<00:02:31.420> yourself

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
you can keep doing that and put yourself

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.120 
you can keep doing that and put yourself
in<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.900> position<00:02:31.930> where<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.590> feel<00:02:32.770> pretty<00:02:32.980> good

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
in a position where you feel pretty good

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.830 
in a position where you feel pretty good
in<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.280> second<00:02:33.610> week<00:02:33.700> then<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.360> makes<00:02:34.510> life<00:02:34.750> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
in the second week then it makes life a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.990 
in the second week then it makes life a
lot<00:02:34.930> easier
