what'd<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.809> think<00:00:09.990> about<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.710> g1<00:00:11.130> X<00:00:11.280> depends

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
what'd you think about the g1 X depends

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.249 
what'd you think about the g1 X depends
upon<00:00:11.790> whether<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.360> view<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.630> as<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.929> cheap

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
upon whether you view it as a cheap

alternative to the fujifilm x100t to a

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.460 
alternative to the fujifilm x100t to a
lot<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> other<00:00:18.300> fixed<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.900> interchangeable

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
lens models because the price of the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.990 
lens models because the price of the
camera<00:00:22.470> sets<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.980> apart<00:00:23.070> from<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.550> crowd<00:00:23.760> as

camera sets it apart from the crowd as

camera sets it apart from the crowd as
much<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.420> its<00:00:24.570> largest<00:00:24.930> sensor<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.130> despite

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
pretty nice shooting design the lens and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.959 
pretty nice shooting design the lens and
to<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> lesser<00:00:32.160> extent<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.640> shooting

performance hold it back from being
worth<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> price<00:00:35.460> its<00:00:36.450> bigger<00:00:36.780> heavier<00:00:37.140> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
worth the price its bigger heavier and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.920 
worth the price its bigger heavier and
boxier<00:00:37.950> than<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> G<00:00:38.430> 12<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.629> uses<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
boxier than the G 12 and it uses a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.369 
boxier than the G 12 and it uses a
pop-up<00:00:40.200> rather<00:00:40.710> than<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> front-mounted<00:00:41.430> flash

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
pop-up rather than a front-mounted flash

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.110 
pop-up rather than a front-mounted flash
but<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> g1<00:00:43.800> X<00:00:43.980> nevertheless<00:00:44.370> looks<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
but the g1 X nevertheless looks and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.770 
but the g1 X nevertheless looks and
feels<00:00:45.300> quite<00:00:45.600> similar<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.140> its<00:00:46.500> older<00:00:46.800> sibling

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
feels quite similar to its older sibling

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
feels quite similar to its older sibling
overall<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.110> design<00:00:49.530> though<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
overall I like the design though the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.650 
overall I like the design though the
function<00:00:50.489> button<00:00:50.879> behavior<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
function button behavior can get a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
function button behavior can get a
little<00:00:51.899> frustrating<00:00:52.530> unlike<00:00:53.520> other<00:00:53.730> cameras

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
little frustrating unlike other cameras

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
little frustrating unlike other cameras

is<00:01:12.270> still<00:01:12.450> useful<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:14.460> buttons<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
is still useful to have the buttons and
