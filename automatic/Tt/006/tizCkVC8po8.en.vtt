00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
the amount of cloth that's there okay I

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.570 
the amount of cloth that's there okay I
can<00:04:51.630> even<00:04:51.810> go<00:04:53.000> like<00:04:54.000> this<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.720> as<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:55.440> see<00:04:55.830> it

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
can even go like this and as you see it

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.710 
can even go like this and as you see it
may<00:04:57.500> come<00:04:58.500> unraveled<00:04:59.090> but<00:05:00.090> your<00:05:00.270> cards<00:05:00.600> are

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
may come unraveled but your cards are

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.140 
may come unraveled but your cards are
unharmed<00:05:02.870> they're<00:05:03.870> nice<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.110> safe<00:05:04.620> and

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
unharmed they're nice and safe and

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.490 
unharmed they're nice and safe and
they're<00:05:06.150> nice<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.540> buffered<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.320> don't

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
they're nice and buffered and you don't

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.370 
they're nice and buffered and you don't
have<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.710> worry<00:05:07.860> about<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:10.020> reason

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
have to worry about it and the reason

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.290 
have to worry about it and the reason
why<00:05:10.500> I<00:05:10.560> say<00:05:10.920> that<00:05:10.950> I'd<00:05:11.280> like<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.640> to<00:05:11.760> use<00:05:11.910> black

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
why I say that I'd like you to use black

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.400 
why I say that I'd like you to use black
and<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.440> reason<00:05:13.710> why<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:14.010> do<00:05:14.100> use<00:05:14.640> black<00:05:14.970> is

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
and the reason why I do use black is

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.030 
and the reason why I do use black is
because<00:05:16.410> I<00:05:17.040> find<00:05:18.050> that<00:05:19.050> not<00:05:19.230> only<00:05:19.290> does<00:05:19.770> black

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
because I find that not only does black

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.780 
because I find that not only does black
make<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.370> great<00:05:20.760> way<00:05:21.450> to<00:05:21.680> block<00:05:22.680> out<00:05:22.919> any<00:05:23.220> extra

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
make a great way to block out any extra

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.640 
make a great way to block out any extra
psychic<00:05:25.250> negativity<00:05:26.250> or<00:05:27.410> anything<00:05:28.410> like<00:05:28.620> that

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
psychic negativity or anything like that

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.940 
psychic negativity or anything like that
really<00:05:28.980> static<00:05:29.700> if<00:05:29.850> you<00:05:29.880> will<00:05:33.590> most<00:05:34.590> colors

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
really static if you will most colors

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.400 
really static if you will most colors
don't<00:05:35.100> do<00:05:35.250> that<00:05:35.690> black<00:05:36.690> is<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> only<00:05:37.169> one<00:05:37.350> that

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
don't do that black is the only one that

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.580 
don't do that black is the only one that
I<00:05:37.590> have<00:05:37.620> found<00:05:37.890> that<00:05:38.100> actually<00:05:38.430> does<00:05:38.610> it<00:05:39.590> just

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
I have found that actually does it just

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.250 
I have found that actually does it just
as<00:05:40.740> a<00:05:40.770> side<00:05:41.070> note<00:05:41.390> never<00:05:42.390> makes<00:05:42.690> purple<00:05:42.990> with

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
as a side note never makes purple with

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.159 
as a side note never makes purple with
black<00:05:43.530> because<00:05:44.370> especially<00:05:45.360> on<00:05:45.780> your<00:05:45.930> tarot

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
black because especially on your tarot

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.070 
black because especially on your tarot
cards<00:05:46.560> because<00:05:47.160> it<00:05:47.340> will<00:05:47.580> allow<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:48.390> certain

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
cards because it will allow a certain

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.190 
cards because it will allow a certain
amount<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.729> negativity<00:05:50.729> into<00:05:51.360> your<00:05:51.510> cards<00:05:51.960> and

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
amount of negativity into your cards and

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.780 
amount of negativity into your cards and
you<00:05:52.590> really<00:05:52.830> don't<00:05:53.010> want<00:05:53.190> that<00:05:53.220> because<00:05:53.640> then

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
you really don't want that because then

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.420 
you really don't want that because then
only<00:05:53.820> give<00:05:54.150> you<00:05:54.240> false<00:05:54.450> readings<00:05:55.160> but<00:05:56.160> I

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
only give you false readings but I

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.890 
only give you false readings but I
thought<00:05:57.030> this<00:05:57.210> would<00:05:57.390> be<00:05:57.450> a<00:05:57.570> really<00:05:57.780> cool
