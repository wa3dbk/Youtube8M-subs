00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.540 

and<00:02:29.550> then<00:02:30.180> using<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.690> thin<00:02:30.930> flexible<00:02:31.200> wire<00:02:31.710> you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
and then using a thin flexible wire you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.510 
and then using a thin flexible wire you
tie<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.820> around<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.300> base<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.840> strip<00:02:34.110> to

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
tie it around the base of the strip to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:44.390 
tie it around the base of the strip to
tighten<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.700> pips

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:01.010 
of the petals and you applied you on its
base<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.900> then<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.020> stick<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.500> on<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.920> strip

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
base and then you stick it on the strip

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.400 
base and then you stick it on the strip
you<00:03:02.020> do<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.350> same<00:03:02.650> for<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.950> other<00:03:03.130> two<00:03:03.550> petals

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
you do the same for the other two petals

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.060 
you do the same for the other two petals
are<00:03:05.410> sticking<00:03:05.980> them<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.550> rotation<00:03:08.070> after

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
are sticking them in a rotation after

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.130 
are sticking them in a rotation after
you<00:03:09.490> start<00:03:09.760> with<00:03:09.880> three<00:03:10.120> petals<00:03:10.630> they<00:03:10.870> look

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
you start with three petals they look

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.010 
you start with three petals they look
like<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.060> take<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> thin<00:03:13.720> flexible

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
like this now you take a thin flexible

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.199 
like this now you take a thin flexible
wire<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:14.890> tie<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.130> around<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.550> base<00:03:15.910> of

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
wire and you tie it around the base of

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:25.670 
wire and you tie it around the base of
the<00:03:16.440> flower<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:19.650> then<00:03:20.650> twist<00:03:20.950> it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.850 

and<00:03:25.769> look<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:28.019> take<00:03:28.290> rational

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
and look like this you take rational

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.619 
and look like this you take rational
Street<00:03:29.069> petals<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.849> you<00:03:29.879> stick<00:03:30.180> them<00:03:30.360> in<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
Street petals and you stick them in a

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.229 
Street petals and you stick them in a
similar<00:03:30.900> manner<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.590> apply<00:03:32.370> glue<00:03:32.790> on<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
similar manner you apply glue on the

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.690 
similar manner you apply glue on the
base<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.049> stick<00:03:34.349> them<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.860> between<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
base and you stick them in between the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.600 
base and you stick them in between the
gap<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.360> petals<00:03:37.319> other<00:03:37.650> petals<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:41.400> do

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
gap of the petals other petals you do

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.580 
gap of the petals other petals you do
the<00:03:41.760> same<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.359> other<00:03:42.510> two<00:03:42.659> petals<00:03:43.349> and

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
the same for the other two petals and

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.839 
the same for the other two petals and
then<00:03:44.069> you<00:03:44.250> Y<00:03:44.849> then<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.629> find<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.670> flexible<00:03:47.670> wire

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
then you Y then you find a flexible wire

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.479 
then you Y then you find a flexible wire
around<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.329> page<00:03:48.680> after<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.799> stuck<00:03:50.129> all<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
around the page after you stuck all the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.210 
around the page after you stuck all the
petals<00:03:50.879> will<00:03:51.090> look<00:03:51.269> like<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.829> now<00:03:52.829> you<00:03:52.920> take

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
petals will look like this now you take

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.140 
petals will look like this now you take
this<00:03:53.489> green<00:03:53.879> shawl<00:03:54.329> tape<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.700> start

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
this green shawl tape and you start

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.309 
this green shawl tape and you start
winding<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.200> around<00:03:58.879> the<00:03:59.879> wire<00:04:00.150> from<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.049> base

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
winding it around the wire from the base

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.930 
winding it around the wire from the base
of<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.620> flower<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:04.280> take<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.459> leaf<00:04:05.670> and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
of the flower you take the leaf and

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.759 
of the flower you take the leaf and
using<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.359> pair<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.569> scissors<00:04:06.659> you<00:04:07.049> make<00:04:07.379> a<00:04:07.409> slit

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
using a pair of scissors you make a slit

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.770 
using a pair of scissors you make a slit
add<00:04:07.980> space<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.730> 1/2<00:04:09.030> centimeter

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.270 

now<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.610> stick<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.790> leaf<00:04:15.799> on<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.980> flower

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
now you stick the leaf on the flower

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.520 
now you stick the leaf on the flower
leaving<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.820> gap<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.269> 15<00:04:18.630> centimeter<00:04:19.290> from<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
leaving a gap of 15 centimeter from the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.099 
leaving a gap of 15 centimeter from the
base<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.160> flower<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.700> then<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:21.720> wind<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
base of the flower and then you wind the

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:33.609 
base of the flower and then you wind the
tape<00:04:22.290> around<00:04:22.500> the

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:33.619 

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:42.559 

we<00:04:34.069> do<00:04:34.219> the<00:04:34.339> same<00:04:34.609> for<00:04:34.969> the<00:04:35.119> second<00:04:35.809> petal

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.939 

after<00:04:43.569> you<00:04:43.690> start<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.080> tape<00:04:44.380> will<00:04:44.650> look<00:04:44.800> like

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
after you start the tape will look like
