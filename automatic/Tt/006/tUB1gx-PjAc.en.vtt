00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.540
 the art 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.970
 Y 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 ah 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.320
 once 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.700
 superhero movies are loved 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.920
 by many and hated by others because 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.199
 the fans are often not left to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 taste with the adaptations that since 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.970
 you can see a comic taken to the seventh 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.120
 art and complicates things a little more 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.760
 in particular this film and in general 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.800
 this saga of spiderman was most hated 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.159
 that beloved then won a saga 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.470
 earlier as a particular point I can 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.869
 to say that I've always liked this more 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.090
 saga that the previous one and the reasons are 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.180
 many but this does not matter much here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.729
 do not worry in this video do not throw 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.710
 spoilers except a special section in 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.140
 the last few minutes that you're free of 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.380
 remove for easy understanding 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.810
 I will divide this review into characters and in 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.429
 general aspects of the saga without more 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.429
 what to say enjoy the video 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.460
 the movie is very fast dynamic and 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.490
 concise that at the same time gives you a feeling 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.619
 of dissatisfaction although I suppose 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.530
 this was planned like that to bite us with 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.210
 the third delivery from start to finish 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.649
 the movie has that action that one 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.110
 so much yearns to see in films of 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.210
 superheroes as a fanatic can 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.100
 reward marc webb for giving him 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.590
 that unique essence of comics to 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.200
 the characters and specifically to the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.000
 villains since in them feel 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.250
 really an absolute grudge towards 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.250
 spider-man something the lizard and these 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.769
 five did not have loved that peter 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.989
 keep remembering the captain stacy and 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.880
 the promise he made to her at the end of 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.400
 the first part I thought that would be 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.500
 omitted in the second as point 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.080
 stressed something mentions one of my 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.780
 favorite shows scenes where 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.310
 public and heroic richard parker which 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.860
 he was not left until the end of his life 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.050
 I want to make honorable mention to the fact 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.180
 of the insulating cobwebs as it is a 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.640
 strong and maximum point of the comic and by 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.770
 last I think the romance of peter and 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.080
 wen and in general the interaction between 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.060
 characters was very dynamic 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.510
 practically only the characters speak 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.120
 main small postscript that you do not know 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.060
 apply as spoiler peter parker 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.810
 mentions jota jonah jameson and says that 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.810
 sells photos 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.250
 I loved his character I do not want 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.290
 compare it with everything but this one does have 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.990
 that charisma spirit those 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.870
 characteristic jokes teasing and teasing 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.210
 towards his opponents in general via 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.430
 android too natural and that's 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.090
 thanks, he is the real 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.600
 spider-man and particularly he is peter 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.600
 parker 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.930
 she is not a damsel in danger she 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.720
 it does not matter that they protect it and that's great 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.180
 on the contrary she helps spider-man 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.519
 as we saw in the previous movie and in 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.730
 is without your help spies would not have 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.129
 achieved so many things I saw a mom 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.720
 sarcastic and eloquent than the previous one and 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.720
 that leaves a good taste in your mouth 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.460
 I do not participate much but I keep his 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.870
 speech that talk with peter a 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.540
 talk that every fan of spiderman 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.210
 where practically you would like to have 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.160
 Say forget your father and start crying 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.160
 they see that the guy who matters the most 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.260
 in this section both harry and 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.810
 norman because norman was not seen much 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.750
 but you can only feel that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.750
 malignant essence as far as harry 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.330
 this character is literal to the comic 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.970
 delicate naive animated and daddy's boy 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.070
 also since he meets again with 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.670
 Peter feels a great essence of 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.950
 very credible friendship by the way 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.260
 the green goblin was not so much what 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.470
 I was expecting but when it comes to harry it's very 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:09.290
 credible but yes when listening to your 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.290
 laughter my hairs got a lot of emotion 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.280
 I loved your character because he has that 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.470
 loser essence has that max that what 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.680
 he returns on the long and his hatred towards 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.690
 spider-man is extremely credible the 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.120
 character is very creepy and that is 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.340
 thank you very much he had a power 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.410
 immense that he could not control and the 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.000
 direction of the film knew how to handle it 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.100
 to perfection 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.780
 finally I mention that electro 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.970
 it reminded me so much auto octavius ​​of 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.910
 spider-man 2 there are two scenes 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.860
 similar one like in the operating room and 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.960
 another when it destroys everything without wanting to 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.080
 the city and the same says it does not have 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:00.070
 the blame for the damage just a 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.500
 perfect cliché mind villain 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.230
 in synthesis this was the best movie 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.210
 of all of spider-man in my opinion already 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.750
 that centered very large bases for 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.970
 Rino see future projects and I do not know 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.560
 if this is spoiler but I warn you 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.420
 spider-man does not fight with all 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.240
 villains at once but they 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.040
 gradually appear in the film what 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.780
 more I love the saga are their 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.870
 final epic battles in the middle city 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.810
 not in isolated places and having said 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.520
 that happened to the area of ​​spoilers you still 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.880
 watching this video under your 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.880
 responsibility 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.400
 the scene of richard I loved it and more 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.230
 that final part where he decides to die and 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.200
 they shoot the windows of the plane so that 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.230
 this one will collapse also I loved it 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.360
 that touch of a greenish norman record 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.800
 and with long nails and I dare to 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.310
 say that he is the man in the hat 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.160
 then in the end the king see croft harry him 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.380
 he says you look very relieved so I think 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.630
 that Norman feigned his death and under 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.550
 shadows accommodates their centuries to form 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.040
 the six sinister ones where we see 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.920
 first to rhino and I have to say 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.350
 that I managed to feel that tiny power 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.690
 and that temper so low compared to 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.270
 the other two electro villains and the 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.580
 green elf juniors in terms of electro 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.500
 I loved that he will not seek revenge in 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.220
 his colleagues but he just wanted to call 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.380
 attention and that is very credible the 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.930
 bases that give for a future delivery and 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.760
 finally I mention that literally 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.130
 the end of this movie touched me 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.030
 enormously and I know that you too 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.180
 will move when you see it 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:51.020
 you do not know what I mean, just you 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.020
 I leave with this 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:05.180
 like the days afternoons or evenings, be it 

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.180
 normal you're seeing goodbye
