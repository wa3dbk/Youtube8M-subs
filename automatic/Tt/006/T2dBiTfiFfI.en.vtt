hour markers and the eye and the hands

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.800 
hour markers and the eye and the hands
that's<00:02:09.700> what<00:02:09.910> makes<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.180> Luminox<00:02:10.630> and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
that's what makes the Luminox and

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.410 
that's what makes the Luminox and
Luminox<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.380> guess<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.680> could<00:02:11.800> say<00:02:12.420> looking

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
Luminox I guess you could say looking

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.540 
Luminox I guess you could say looking
again<00:02:13.630> at<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.870> face<00:02:14.170> here<00:02:14.530> one<00:02:15.160> other<00:02:15.280> thing

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
again at the face here one other thing

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.090 
again at the face here one other thing
that<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.110> just<00:02:18.010> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
that I really like is is that just the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.580 
that I really like is is that just the
overall<00:02:18.370> design<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.420> face<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:20.320> me<00:02:20.470> it

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
overall design of the face to me it

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.480 
overall design of the face to me it
makes<00:02:20.740> me<00:02:20.920> feel<00:02:21.070> like

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
makes me feel like

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.610 
makes me feel like
driving<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.090> car<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.360> mean<00:02:22.600> you've<00:02:23.050> got<00:02:23.260> you've

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
driving a car I mean you've got you've

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.190 
driving a car I mean you've got you've
got<00:02:23.650> Tony<00:02:24.070> Kanaan's<00:02:24.570> signature<00:02:25.570> logo<00:02:25.750> here<00:02:26.110> at

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
got Tony Kanaan's signature logo here at

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.350 
got Tony Kanaan's signature logo here at
4<00:02:26.410> o'clock<00:02:26.440> but<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.520> know<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.670> think<00:02:27.850> even<00:02:28.240> the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
4 o'clock but you know I think even the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.180 
4 o'clock but you know I think even the
date<00:02:28.570> window<00:02:29.050> looks<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.440> bit<00:02:29.470> like<00:02:29.620> an<00:02:29.890> odometer

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
date window looks a bit like an odometer

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.070 
date window looks a bit like an odometer
and<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> sub<00:02:31.030> dials<00:02:31.450> are<00:02:31.630> kind<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.870> designed

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
and the sub dials are kind of designed

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.220 
and the sub dials are kind of designed
to<00:02:32.680> look<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:34.120> dials<00:02:34.510> on<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.750> dashboard

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
to look like the dials on the dashboard

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.630 
to look like the dials on the dashboard
of<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.410> car<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:35.920> think<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.250> that's<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.490> real

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
of a car so I think that that's a real

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.680 
of a car so I think that that's a real
nice<00:02:36.820> feature<00:02:38.280> looking<00:02:39.280> at<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.580> strap<00:02:40.330> here

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
it's leather construction and it

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.540 
it's leather construction and it
features<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.870> these<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.890> know<00:02:44.980> yellow<00:02:45.370> and

it<00:03:03.130> looks<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.490> my<00:03:03.670> wrist<00:03:03.940> here<00:03:04.650> certainly

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
it looks like on my wrist here certainly

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.430

a<00:03:05.680> substantial<00:03:05.920> watch<00:03:06.660> since<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.810> retails<00:03:08.230> at

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
a substantial watch since it retails at

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.410 
a substantial watch since it retails at
a<00:03:08.500> higher<00:03:08.740> price<00:03:09.100> point<00:03:09.460> than<00:03:09.700> most<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.330> the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
a higher price point than most of the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.330 
a higher price point than most of the
Luminox<00:03:10.870> models<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.560> think<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.160> would<00:03:12.280> have

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
Luminox models I think it would have

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.690 
Luminox models I think it would have
been<00:03:12.460> nicer<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:13.150> an<00:03:13.270> automatic<00:03:13.630> movement

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
been nicer to have an automatic movement

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.160 
been nicer to have an automatic movement
but<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.910> can<00:03:16.120> look<00:03:16.330> for<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.600> discounted<00:03:17.110> price

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
but you can look for a discounted price

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.070 
but you can look for a discounted price
