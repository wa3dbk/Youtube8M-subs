first<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.450> start<00:00:12.690> out<00:00:12.809> with<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.230> 17

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
first you start out with a 17

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.950 
first you start out with a 17
approximately<00:00:15.179> by<00:00:15.570> 12<00:00:16.080> inch<00:00:16.410> cookie<00:00:16.920> sheet

approximately by 12 inch cookie sheet

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.080 
approximately by 12 inch cookie sheet
you<00:00:18.960> cover<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.439> with<00:00:19.470> aluminum<00:00:20.400> foil<00:00:20.699> first

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
you cover it with aluminum foil first

you cover it with aluminum foil first
you<00:00:21.359> tear<00:00:21.630> off<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.869> piece<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.590> aluminum<00:00:22.949> foil

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
you tear off a piece of aluminum foil

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.029 
you tear off a piece of aluminum foil
that<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.580> larger<00:00:24.000> than<00:00:24.210> 17<00:00:24.900> by<00:00:25.080> 12<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.650> crumple

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
that is larger than 17 by 12 and crumple

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.009 
that is larger than 17 by 12 and crumple
it<00:00:26.099> up<00:00:26.220> into<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.519> ball<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.359> do<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> tightly

it up into a ball do not do it tightly

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.650 
it up into a ball do not do it tightly
because<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.769> UNCHR<00:00:29.519> umple<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.510> do

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
because when you UNCHR umple it you do

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.030 
because when you UNCHR umple it you do
not<00:00:30.779> want<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.080> tear<00:00:31.260> any<00:00:31.439> holes<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.949> the

poured the plaster of Paris where she

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.570 
poured the plaster of Paris where she
wanted<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:03.470> where<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> lake<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:05.100> going

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
wanted it to be where the lake was going

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.320 
wanted it to be where the lake was going
to<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.270> where<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> rivers<00:01:07.320> were<00:01:08.330> were

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.149 
butter knife or any type of pottery tool
is<00:01:15.270> fine<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.170> make<00:01:16.350> sure<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.650> there<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.979> no

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
is fine but make sure that there is no

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.240 
is fine but make sure that there is no
plaster<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.700> Paris<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.110> surface<00:01:19.650> if

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
plaster of Paris on that surface if

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.870 
plaster of Paris on that surface if
there<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:22.080> okay<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.520> extent

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
there is it will be okay to some extent

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.820 
there is it will be okay to some extent
because<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.420> will<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.630> pouring<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> liquid

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
because you will be pouring the liquid

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.020 
because you will be pouring the liquid
over<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> aluminum<00:01:29.340> foil<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
over the aluminum foil for the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.179 
over the aluminum foil for the
appearance<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> water<00:01:31.070> after<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
appearance of the water after the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.910 
appearance of the water after the
plaster<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.670> Paris<00:01:32.970> has<00:01:33.119> time<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.570> dry<00:01:33.920> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
plaster of Paris has time to dry you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.359 
plaster of Paris has time to dry you
then<00:01:35.130> paint<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.119> plaster<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.540> Paris<00:01:36.960> is

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
then paint it as the plaster of Paris is

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.700 
then paint it as the plaster of Paris is
drying<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.549> are<00:01:38.670> able<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.000> use<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.439> becomes

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
drying you are able to use it it becomes

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.069 
drying you are able to use it it becomes
more<00:01:41.180> solid<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.450> you're<00:01:42.570> able<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> do

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
more solid and you're able to do

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.679 
more solid and you're able to do
three-dimensional<00:01:44.360> mountains<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
three-dimensional mountains and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.460 
three-dimensional mountains and
volcanoes<00:01:46.790> of<00:01:47.899> which<00:01:49.369> is<00:01:51.079> easier<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.290> work

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
volcanoes of which is easier to work

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.039 
volcanoes of which is easier to work
with<00:01:52.530> when<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.759> plaster<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> Paris<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.840> too

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
with when the plaster of Paris is too

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.980 
with when the plaster of Paris is too
liquid<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.829> fluid<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.820> easier<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.659> smooth

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
liquid to fluid it's easier to smooth

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.289 
liquid to fluid it's easier to smooth
things<00:01:58.530> smooth<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.520> surface<00:01:59.670> out<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.210> you

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
things smooth the surface out so you

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.260 
things smooth the surface out so you
have<00:02:00.380> planes<00:02:01.380> flat<00:02:02.040> planes<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:03.060> when<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
have planes flat planes but when it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.749 
have planes flat planes but when it
becomes<00:02:03.570> thicker<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.619> work<00:02:04.799> with<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.009> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
becomes thicker as you work with it you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.080 
becomes thicker as you work with it you
can<00:02:06.000> work<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:07.049> making<00:02:09.619> more<00:02:10.619> texture<00:02:11.190> after

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
can work with making more texture after

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.220 
can work with making more texture after
it<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.690> done

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
it is done

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.940 
it is done
you<00:02:15.230> then<00:02:15.440> paint<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:16.190> she<00:02:16.940> painted<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.510> and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
you then paint it she painted this and
