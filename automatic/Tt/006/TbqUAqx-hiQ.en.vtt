what is the bigger picture across the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.200 
what is the bigger picture across the
spectrum<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.950> think<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.730> story<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
spectrum I think the story of the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.630 
spectrum I think the story of the
rankings<00:02:32.600> actually<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.110> is<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.710> shift<00:02:34.460> of

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
rankings actually is is the shift of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.360 
rankings actually is is the shift of
power<00:02:34.850> from<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.300> west<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.140> east<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:37.040> US

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
power from the west to the east the US

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.800 
power from the west to the east the US
the<00:02:37.520> UK<00:02:37.820> have<00:02:37.940> always<00:02:38.150> dominated<00:02:38.720> these

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
the UK have always dominated these

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.510 
the UK have always dominated these
rankings<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.440> they<00:02:39.500> still<00:02:39.740> do<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.130> terms<00:02:40.310> of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
rankings and they still do in terms of

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.160 
rankings and they still do in terms of
numbers<00:02:40.850> but<00:02:41.390> what<00:02:41.600> we're<00:02:41.750> seeing<00:02:41.930> is

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
numbers but what we're seeing is

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.110 
numbers but what we're seeing is
tremendous<00:02:42.830> upward<00:02:43.220> movement<00:02:43.670> from<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
tremendous upward movement from the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.150 
tremendous upward movement from the

in Hong Kong Singapore and actually the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.970 
in Hong Kong Singapore and actually the
u.s.<00:02:49.370> institutions<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.540> as<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.140> whole<00:02:51.440> taken

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
u.s. institutions have as a whole taken

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.340 
u.s. institutions have as a whole taken
quite<00:02:52.160> substantial<00:02:52.790> hit<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.210> so<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.020> UK

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
quite substantial hit and so of the UK

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.230 
quite substantial hit and so of the UK
and<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.860> Canada's<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.700> top<00:02:55.880> 10<00:02:56.060> could

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
and so of Canada's so the top 10 could

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.850 
and so of Canada's so the top 10 could
look<00:02:56.360> different<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.990> a<00:02:57.050> few<00:02:57.080> years<00:02:57.380> time<00:02:57.530> I

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
look different in a few years time I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.410 
look different in a few years time I
think<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.220> trend<00:02:58.490> is<00:02:58.580> definitely<00:02:58.760> towards

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
think the trend is definitely towards

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.180 
think the trend is definitely towards
Asia<00:02:59.720> continuing<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.500> rise<00:03:00.710> they're<00:03:00.950> putting

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
Asia continuing to rise they're putting

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.650 
Asia continuing to rise they're putting
a<00:03:01.250> lot<00:03:01.460> of<00:03:01.490> money<00:03:01.760> into<00:03:01.910> their<00:03:02.090> universities

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
a lot of money into their universities

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.140 
a lot of money into their universities
there<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.410> UK's<00:03:03.830> facing<00:03:04.340> austerity<00:03:04.820> measures

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
there the UK's facing austerity measures

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.580 
there the UK's facing austerity measures
the<00:03:05.300> US<00:03:05.570> have<00:03:05.750> had<00:03:05.900> some<00:03:06.110> real<00:03:06.260> issues<00:03:06.410> with

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
the US have had some real issues with

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.050 
the US have had some real issues with
austerity<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.340> they're<00:03:07.460> great<00:03:07.640> public

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
austerity and they're great public

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.030 
austerity and they're great public
funded<00:03:08.420> institutions<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:09.740> I<00:03:09.770> think<00:03:09.860> there's

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
funded institutions so I think there's

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.280 
funded institutions so I think there's
no<00:03:10.070> doubt<00:03:10.220> we're<00:03:10.640> going<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.910> see<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.390> continuing

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
no doubt we're going to see a continuing

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.280 
no doubt we're going to see a continuing
trend<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.770> Asia<00:03:13.220> rising<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.810> Western
