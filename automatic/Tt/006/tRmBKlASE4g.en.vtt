a 24 millimeter front sway bar but it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.960 
a 24 millimeter front sway bar but it
doesn't<00:02:14.800> look<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.250> same<00:02:15.580> as

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
doesn't look like it's the same as

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
previous years it looks like a new

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.410 
previous years it looks like a new
design<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.100> just<00:02:18.280> can't<00:02:18.520> swap<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.090> over

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
design so you just can't swap this over

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.330

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.530 
you know we Mishimoto picked the CVT

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
bigger turbo setup or whatnot but right

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.010 
bigger turbo setup or whatnot but right
here<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.130> see<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.610> actual<00:02:37.330> liquid<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.870> liquid

transmission cooler at the CVT actually

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.660 
transmission cooler at the CVT actually
uses<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:40.750> not<00:02:40.959> an<00:02:41.170> in-tank<00:02:41.650> radiator<00:02:42.340> cooler

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
uses it's not an in-tank radiator cooler

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.970 
uses it's not an in-tank radiator cooler
it's<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.510> small<00:02:43.750> core<00:02:44.020> that<00:02:44.140> uses<00:02:44.440> transmission

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
it's a small core that uses transmission

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.690 
it's a small core that uses transmission

to<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.080> 2014<00:02:53.770> but<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.459> rear<00:02:54.790> subframe<00:02:55.330> looks

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
to the 2014 but the rear subframe looks

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.060 
to the 2014 but the rear subframe looks
to<00:02:55.570> be<00:02:55.690> slightly<00:02:55.959> different<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.530> bushings

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
to be slightly different the bushings

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.620 
to be slightly different the bushings
are<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.250> smaller<00:02:57.550> diameter<00:02:57.730> which<00:02:58.180> means<00:02:58.239> the

are a smaller diameter which means the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.140 
are a smaller diameter which means the
