hi on the woodpecker this time I will
show<00:00:04.049> you<00:00:04.110> all<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.380> did<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:05.819> dance<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.359> box

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.530 

last<00:00:24.410> year<00:00:24.710> I<00:00:24.890> built<00:00:25.430> this<00:00:25.550> mahogany<00:00:25.880> jewelry

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
last year I built this mahogany jewelry

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.720 
last year I built this mahogany jewelry
box<00:00:26.780> for<00:00:27.020> my<00:00:27.170> daughter<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:27.800> took<00:00:28.310> me<00:00:28.460> a<00:00:28.490> lot<00:00:28.670> of

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
box for my daughter it took me a lot of

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.750 
box for my daughter it took me a lot of
time<00:00:29.120> to<00:00:29.330> build<00:00:29.500> this<00:00:30.500> year<00:00:30.800> I'm<00:00:30.950> making<00:00:31.670> a

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
time to build this year I'm making a

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.820 
time to build this year I'm making a
bandsaw<00:00:32.150> box<00:00:32.330> for<00:00:32.599> my<00:00:32.780> son's<00:00:33.110> girlfriend

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
bandsaw box for my son's girlfriend

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.730 
bandsaw box for my son's girlfriend
because<00:00:34.520> it's<00:00:34.700> easier<00:00:35.150> I<00:00:35.560> start<00:00:36.560> by<00:00:36.710> cutting

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
because it's easier I start by cutting

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.280 
because it's easier I start by cutting
one<00:00:37.220> pattern<00:00:37.460> length<00:00:37.820> in<00:00:38.030> maple<00:00:38.630> and<00:00:38.780> two

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
one pattern length in maple and two

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.310 
one pattern length in maple and two
lengths<00:00:39.500> in<00:00:39.680> walnut<00:00:43.690> when<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.780> three<00:00:44.960> boards

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
lengths in walnut when the three boards

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.130 
lengths in walnut when the three boards
are<00:00:45.559> cut<00:00:45.800> I<00:00:46.010> check<00:00:46.520> how<00:00:46.670> crooked<00:00:46.970> they<00:00:47.210> are<00:00:47.450> the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
are cut I check how crooked they are the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.160 
are cut I check how crooked they are the
boards<00:00:48.470> are<00:00:48.620> wider<00:00:49.550> than<00:00:49.970> my<00:00:50.120> jointer<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.140> I

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
boards are wider than my jointer so I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.960 
boards are wider than my jointer so I
mark<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.710> eye<00:00:51.860> spots<00:00:52.220> and<00:00:52.570> unplanned<00:00:53.570> them<00:00:53.840> I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.940 

also<00:00:58.970> check<00:00:59.420> with<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.630> ruler<00:01:00.079> if<00:01:00.230> it's<00:01:00.710> flat

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
also check with a ruler if it's flat

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.359 
also check with a ruler if it's flat
again<00:01:01.790> I<00:01:01.970> mark<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.780> eye<00:01:02.900> spot<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.440> and<00:01:03.980> plan

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
again I mark the eye spot and and plan

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.310 
again I mark the eye spot and and plan
that<00:01:06.640> when<00:01:07.640> it's<00:01:07.790> fat<00:01:07.970> enough<00:01:08.240> I<00:01:08.450> do<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.110> same

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
that when it's fat enough I do the same

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.430 
that when it's fat enough I do the same
thing<00:01:09.380> on<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.890> maple<00:01:10.040> board<00:01:10.399> too

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.139 

after<00:01:15.440> I<00:01:15.649> pass<00:01:16.070> all<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.490> boards<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
after I pass all the boards to the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.030 
after I pass all the boards to the
thickness<00:01:17.479> planner<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:18.500> make<00:01:18.649> sure<00:01:18.860> both

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
thickness planner to make sure both

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.480 
thickness planner to make sure both
surfaces<00:01:19.700> are<00:01:19.940> straight<00:01:20.690> then<00:01:21.380> I<00:01:21.619> send<00:01:22.369> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
surfaces are straight then I send the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.630 
surfaces are straight then I send the
boards

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.180 

on<00:01:25.730> the<00:01:26.360> wall<00:01:26.540> nog<00:01:26.720> board<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.200> put<00:01:27.800> one<00:01:27.980> edge

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
on the wall nog board I put one edge

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.480 
on the wall nog board I put one edge
straight<00:01:28.900> this<00:01:29.900> way<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:30.320> make<00:01:30.890> sure<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:31.070> have<00:01:31.280> one

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
straight this way I make sure I have one

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.430 
straight this way I make sure I have one
straight<00:01:31.820> edge<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.660> reference<00:01:33.080> on<00:01:33.230> my

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
straight edge to reference on my

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.750 
straight edge to reference on my
crosscut<00:01:33.890> sled<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:34.610> can<00:01:34.910> cut<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.330> enough

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
crosscut sled so I can cut it enough

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.430 
crosscut sled so I can cut it enough
it's<00:01:37.760> time<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.180> do<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.450> boards<00:01:38.750> together<00:01:38.960> I

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
it's time to do the boards together I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.950 
it's time to do the boards together I
put<00:01:39.920> glue<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.400> two<00:01:40.550> walnut<00:01:40.940> boards<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.780> I

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
put glue on the two walnut boards and I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.440 
put glue on the two walnut boards and I
spread<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.350> with<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.650> ink<00:01:42.890> roller<00:01:43.190> I<00:01:43.550> put<00:01:44.270> glue

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
spread it with the ink roller I put glue

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.990 
spread it with the ink roller I put glue
on<00:01:44.660> both<00:01:45.080> sides<00:01:45.410> of<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.740> maple<00:01:46.070> board<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.490> put

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
on both sides of the maple board and put

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.770 
on both sides of the maple board and put
all<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.390> boards<00:01:47.690> together<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:49.540> put<00:01:50.540> several

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
all the boards together I put several

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.350 
all the boards together I put several
clamps<00:01:51.290> around<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.860> boards<00:01:52.220> at<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.970> end<00:01:53.150> I

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
clamps around the boards at the end I

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.740 
clamps around the boards at the end I
have<00:01:53.780> six<00:01:54.110> of<00:01:54.260> them<00:01:54.490> yeah<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.790> think<00:01:56.360> I<00:01:56.420> was<00:01:56.570> too

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
have six of them yeah I think I was too

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.900 
have six of them yeah I think I was too
generous<00:01:56.990> with<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.530> glue<00:01:57.710> when<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.729> glue<00:01:58.880> is

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
generous with the glue when the glue is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.300 
generous with the glue when the glue is
dry<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.240> remove<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.110> on<00:02:00.229> one<00:02:00.440> side<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.160> N

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
dry I remove it on one side to the N

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.950 
dry I remove it on one side to the N
planks<00:02:03.220> then<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:04.490> push<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.210> sandwich<00:02:05.570> through

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
planks then I push the sandwich through

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.080 
planks then I push the sandwich through
the<00:02:06.080> jointer<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:07.130> will<00:02:07.340> be<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.580> bottom<00:02:07.759> of

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
the jointer this will be the bottom of

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.530 
the jointer this will be the bottom of
the<00:02:08.239> box<00:02:09.070> then<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.280> stick<00:02:10.880> Mac<00:02:11.060> back<00:02:11.239> on<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the box then I stick Mac back on the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.080 
the box then I stick Mac back on the
block<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:11.930> glue<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.680> pattern<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.220> top<00:02:13.459> I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.120 

carefully<00:02:17.090> check<00:02:17.630> my<00:02:17.810> bandsaw<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.530> make<00:02:18.890> sure

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
carefully check my bandsaw to make sure

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.729 
carefully check my bandsaw to make sure
the<00:02:19.430> blade<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.850> straight<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:21.140> important

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
the blade is straight it's important

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.910 
the blade is straight it's important
because<00:02:22.070> in<00:02:22.400> my<00:02:22.520> prototype<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.420> wasn't<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.989> had

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
because in my prototype it wasn't I had

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.610 
because in my prototype it wasn't I had
to<00:02:25.100> glue<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.370> front<00:02:25.610> in<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.910> back<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.320> I<00:02:27.350> could

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
to glue the front in the back so I could

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.770 
to glue the front in the back so I could
open<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:28.010> drawer<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.550> didn't<00:02:29.239> want<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.570> to

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
open the drawer I didn't want this to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.410 
open the drawer I didn't want this to
happen<00:02:29.900> again<00:02:30.430> now<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:31.880> time<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.239> cut<00:02:32.390> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
happen again now it's time to cut the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.940 
happen again now it's time to cut the
exterior<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.110> box<00:02:33.320> on<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.950> bandsaw<00:02:34.340> this

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.430 

type<00:02:39.950> time<00:02:40.450> after<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.570> pattern<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.989> cut<00:02:42.230> I

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
type time after the pattern is cut I

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.530 
type time after the pattern is cut I
slice<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.549> back<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:48.489> pass<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.670> slice<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
slice the back I pass the slice to the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.840 
slice the back I pass the slice to the
drum<00:02:50.840> sander<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.100> will<00:02:52.280> be<00:02:52.400> straight<00:02:52.700> and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
drum sander so it will be straight and

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.100 
drum sander so it will be straight and
smooth

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.869 

the<00:02:57.110> rest<00:02:57.319> is<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.860> take<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.340> go<00:02:58.430> inside<00:02:58.700> the

the rest is to take to go inside the

the rest is to take to go inside the
drum<00:02:59.090> sander<00:02:59.379> so<00:03:00.379> it<00:03:00.500> goes<00:03:00.709> through<00:03:00.950> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
drum sander so it goes through the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.539 
drum sander so it goes through the
jointer<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:02.180> send<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.720> after<00:03:06.280> it's<00:03:07.280> time

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
jointer and I send it after it's time

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:15.850 
jointer and I send it after it's time
now<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.939> cut<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.360> tree<00:03:08.540> inside<00:03:08.930> growlers

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.970 

when<00:03:16.730> they<00:03:16.850> are<00:03:16.970> cut<00:03:17.240> I<00:03:17.510> go<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.260> spots<00:03:18.710> where

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
when they are cut I go to spots where

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.700 
when they are cut I go to spots where
the<00:03:19.100> banza<00:03:19.550> had<00:03:19.730> entered<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.450> find<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.410> wooden

the banza had entered I find that wooden

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.830 
the banza had entered I find that wooden
clamps<00:03:21.950> are<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.700> best<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.270> hold<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.630> Box

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.830
