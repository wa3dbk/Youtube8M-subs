00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
talking but p JP isn't because it's like

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.569 
talking but p JP isn't because it's like

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.240 

yeah<00:01:06.320> if<00:01:06.409> we<00:01:06.560> worked<00:01:06.799> out<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:07.280> room<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:09.130> 50<00:01:10.130> by

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
yeah if we worked out this room is 50 by

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.289 
yeah if we worked out this room is 50 by
50<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.570> means<00:01:12.640> 2,500<00:01:13.640> lava<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:14.180> we

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
50 and that means 2,500 lava that we

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.270 
50 and that means 2,500 lava that we
need<00:01:15.670> but<00:01:16.670> we<00:01:16.790> are<00:01:16.940> getting<00:01:17.710> more<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.159> more

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
need but we are getting more and more

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.330 
need but we are getting more and more
and<00:01:19.850> we<00:01:19.970> just<00:01:20.150> dig<00:01:20.360> for<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.070> turns<00:01:22.070> out

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
and we just dig for it and turns out

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.930 
and we just dig for it and turns out
there's<00:01:22.700> about<00:01:22.909> 300<00:01:23.360> lava<00:01:23.840> spots<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.380> each

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
there's about 300 lava spots in each

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.719 
there's about 300 lava spots in each
love<00:01:25.940> pool<00:01:26.330> probably<00:01:27.080> more<00:01:27.350> because<00:01:28.310> every

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
love pool probably more because every

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.300 
love pool probably more because every
single<00:01:29.360> thing<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.409> lava<00:01:30.680> block<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.130> just

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
single thing is a lava block you just

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.760 
single thing is a lava block you just
need<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.610> work<00:01:31.909> out<00:01:32.149> properly<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.619> way

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
need to work out properly and the way

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.480 
need to work out properly and the way
you<00:01:33.830> can<00:01:34.460> do<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.940> like<00:01:35.119> take<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.860> block

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
you can do that is like take the block

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.090 
you can do that is like take the block
of<00:01:37.670> larvae<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.479> then<00:01:39.170> place<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.470> block<00:01:39.800> there

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
of larvae and then place a block there

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.029 
of larvae and then place a block there
and<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:40.460> will<00:01:40.580> stop<00:01:40.789> it<00:01:40.940> flow<00:01:41.590> so<00:01:42.590> basically<00:01:42.920> I

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
and it will stop it flow so basically I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.219 
and it will stop it flow so basically I
put<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:43.399> there<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:47.300> it<00:01:47.450> shows<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:48.050> this

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
put on there and and it shows that this

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.830 
put on there and and it shows that this
one's<00:01:48.530> still<00:01:48.770> which<00:01:49.159> means<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:50.420> can<00:01:50.630> take

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
one's still which means you can take

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.749 
one's still which means you can take
from<00:01:51.050> there<00:01:56.259> see<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.470> show<00:01:57.679> we're<00:01:57.950> legit<00:01:58.399> even

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
the middle this is going to be larvae

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.810 
the middle this is going to be larvae
running<00:02:29.810> for<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.049> middle<00:02:30.320> as<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.530> know<00:02:30.820> also

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
running for the middle as you know also

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.860 
running for the middle as you know also
we<00:02:32.209> have<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.720> finish<00:02:32.930> our<00:02:33.290> mob<00:02:33.709> spawner<00:02:34.870> you

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
we have to finish our mob spawner you

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.199 
we have to finish our mob spawner you
can't<00:02:36.140> hear<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.280> gets<00:02:37.430> rather<00:02:37.640> dark<00:02:38.000> and

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
can't hear and it gets rather dark and

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.349 
can't hear and it gets rather dark and
you<00:02:38.269> probably<00:02:38.450> can't<00:02:38.750> see<00:02:39.820> but<00:02:40.820> yeah<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:41.209> not

you probably can't see but yeah it's not

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.080 
you probably can't see but yeah it's not
totally<00:02:41.780> finished<00:02:41.989> but<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:43.760> does<00:02:43.940> actually

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
totally finished but it does actually

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.660 
totally finished but it does actually
work<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:45.590> probably<00:02:45.890> won't<00:02:46.070> work<00:02:46.160> because<00:02:46.430> I'm
