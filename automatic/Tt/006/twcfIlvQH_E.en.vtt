a review of mobis magic bar this is an

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.740 
a review of mobis magic bar this is an
inductive<00:00:08.730> charging<00:00:09.090> solution<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.660> either

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
inductive charging solution for either

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.900 
inductive charging solution for either
apples<00:00:10.290> magic<00:00:10.679> trackpad<00:00:11.099> or<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.460> wireless

apples magic trackpad or the wireless
bluetooth<00:00:12.300> keyboard<00:00:12.780> by<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.290> way<00:00:13.469> which<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.769> do

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
bluetooth keyboard by the way which I do

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.350 
bluetooth keyboard by the way which I do
have<00:00:14.160> both<00:00:14.370> but<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.849> video<00:00:15.150> i'll<00:00:15.299> be

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
have both but for this video i'll be

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.029 
have both but for this video i'll be
using<00:00:15.570> their<00:00:16.049> wireless<00:00:16.260> keyboard<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
using their wireless keyboard to

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.740 
using their wireless keyboard to
demonstrate<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.940> basically<00:00:18.210> like<00:00:18.480> i<00:00:18.570> said

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
demonstrate and basically like i said

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.150 
demonstrate and basically like i said
this<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.990> an<00:00:19.080> inductive<00:00:19.470> charging<00:00:19.770> solution

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
this is an inductive charging solution

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.410 
this is an inductive charging solution
which<00:00:20.369> basically<00:00:20.640> means<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.330> know

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
which basically means that you know

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.609 
which basically means that you know
those<00:00:21.570> double<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> batteries<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
those double a batteries that the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.439 
those double a batteries that the
keyboard<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.070> trackpad<00:00:23.220> use<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.119> don't<00:00:24.269> have

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
keyboard and trackpad use you don't have

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.939 
keyboard and trackpad use you don't have
to<00:00:24.539> go<00:00:24.660> out<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.930> spend<00:00:25.140> money<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.470> those<00:00:25.650> every

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
to go out and spend money on those every

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.620 
to go out and spend money on those every
week<00:00:26.099> anymore<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.970> basically

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
week anymore because this basically

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.970 
week anymore because this basically
takes<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> place<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.289> those<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.769> an

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
takes the place of those this is an

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.710 
takes the place of those this is an
inductive<00:00:29.460> battery<00:00:29.970> always<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> know<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
inductive battery always you know I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.269 
inductive battery always you know I
believe<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> right<00:00:31.740> terminology<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
believe that's the right terminology I

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.530 
believe that's the right terminology I
really<00:00:32.520> haven't<00:00:32.669> done<00:00:32.790> my<00:00:32.969> research<00:00:33.000> when<00:00:33.450> it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
really haven't done my research when it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.299 
really haven't done my research when it
comes<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.960> sort<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.260> stuff<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.070> is

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
comes to this sort of stuff but this is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.770 
comes to this sort of stuff but this is
this<00:00:35.550> right<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.420> battery

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
this right here is actually the battery

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
this right here is actually the battery
and<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> what<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.770> use<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.950> charge<00:00:38.309> it

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
and this is what you use to charge it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
and this is what you use to charge it
now<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> very<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.570> guess<00:00:40.020> unique

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
now this is a very I guess unique

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.690 
now this is a very I guess unique
product<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.100> I've<00:00:41.250> never<00:00:41.370> quite<00:00:41.640> seen

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
product because I've never quite seen

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400 
product because I've never quite seen
anything<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.570> any<00:00:42.750> other<00:00:42.930> apple

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
anything like this for any other apple

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.020 
anything like this for any other apple

put this battery in and of course it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010 
put this battery in and of course it
goes<00:00:47.489> where<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.270> double-a<00:00:48.690> batteries

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
goes where all the double-a batteries

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
goes where all the double-a batteries
went<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> keyboard<00:00:49.860> same<00:00:50.550> exact<00:00:50.879> spot<00:00:51.000> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
went for the keyboard same exact spot so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.540 
went for the keyboard same exact spot so
I'm<00:00:51.750> gonna<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:51.989> ahead<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.199> unscrew<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.829> all

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I'm gonna go ahead and unscrew this all

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.520 
I'm gonna go ahead and unscrew this all
right<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.239> access<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.469> course

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
right and we have access and of course

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
right and we have access and of course
there's<00:00:56.190> no<00:00:56.309> batteries<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:57.059> now

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
there's no batteries in here right now

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
there's no batteries in here right now
but<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:58.050> where<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.680> comes<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.100> handy<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
but that's where this comes in handy and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.729 
but that's where this comes in handy and
then<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
then if you can see here this is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
then if you can see here this is
actually<00:01:02.190> threaded<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.149> it'll<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
actually threaded so it'll it will it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660 
actually threaded so it'll it will it
will<00:01:03.989> screw<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.159> old<00:01:05.339> thing

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
will screw in just like that old thing

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.789 
will screw in just like that old thing
did<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.479> pro<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.900> end<00:01:07.229> piece<00:01:07.530> here

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
did this little pro this end piece here

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
did this little pro this end piece here
so<00:01:08.189> while<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.580> battery<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.180> actually

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
so while this battery is actually

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
so while this battery is actually
installed<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.260> will<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.560> need<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.070> little

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
installed you will not need that little

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.770 
installed you will not need that little
end<00:01:11.580> piece<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.119> sure<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.570> somewhere

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
end piece so be sure to put it somewhere

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.750 
end piece so be sure to put it somewhere
safe<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.070> goes<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
safe but this just goes right in the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.179 
safe but this just goes right in the
keyboard<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.409> from<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
keyboard just like so and from there you

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.580 
keyboard just like so and from there you
can<00:01:17.360> screw<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:18.930> now<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
can screw it it and there you go now it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.109 
can screw it it and there you go now it
does<00:01:19.770> stick<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.549> little<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:21.030> but

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
does stick out just this little bit but

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.520 
does stick out just this little bit but
that's<00:01:21.330> actually<00:01:21.479> how<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> charge<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
that's actually how you charge it and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.260 
that's actually how you charge it and
that's<00:01:22.920> where<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> guy<00:01:23.400> comes<00:01:23.520> into<00:01:23.939> handy

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that's where this guy comes into handy

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149 
that's where this guy comes into handy
and<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.570> course<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.080> guys<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.380> see<00:01:25.439> all

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and of course as you guys can see all

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.890 
and of course as you guys can see all
rise<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.460> guys<00:01:26.580> could<00:01:26.790> probably<00:01:27.060> guess<00:01:27.450> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
rise you guys could probably guess this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.810 
rise you guys could probably guess this
is<00:01:28.110> actually<00:01:28.500> how<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.369> works<00:01:29.579> it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
is actually how that this works it's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.310 
is actually how that this works it's
actually<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.180> sort<00:01:30.390> USB<00:01:30.750> connection<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
actually just sort USB connection it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.480 
actually just sort USB connection it
just<00:01:31.500> takes<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.799> power<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.400> computer

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
just takes some power from your computer

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999 
just takes some power from your computer
and<00:01:33.110> that's<00:01:34.110> actually<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.500> little<00:01:34.650> battery

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and that's actually a little battery

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.410 
and that's actually a little battery
goes<00:01:35.189> but<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:35.790> tour<00:01:36.000> around<00:01:36.030> this

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
goes but just a little tour around this

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.760 
goes but just a little tour around this
guy<00:01:36.600> real<00:01:36.810> quick<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.409> was<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.590> basically

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
guy real quick it was just basically

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.289 
guy real quick it was just basically
like<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> little<00:01:38.310> trench<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.939> where<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
like a little trench here where the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.940 
like a little trench here where the
keyboard<00:01:39.659> actually<00:01:39.960> sits<00:01:40.259> there's<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> little

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
keyboard actually sits there's a little

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.039 
keyboard actually sits there's a little
power<00:01:41.220> LED<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.850> you'll<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.210> glow<00:01:42.479> red<00:01:42.780> once

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
power LED that you'll see glow red once

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.109 
power LED that you'll see glow red once
I<00:01:43.140> turn<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.590> by<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> USB<00:01:44.549> connection<00:01:45.000> which

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
I turn it in by the USB connection which

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.789 
I turn it in by the USB connection which
is<00:01:45.210> located<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> back<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.259> other<00:01:46.680> than

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
is located on the back and other than

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.139 
is located on the back and other than
that<00:01:46.950> there's<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.369> nothing<00:01:47.790> else<00:01:47.880> there's

on the back very simple and you guys
probably<00:01:59.820> can't<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.509> frame<00:02:00.750> there

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
can see my power LED has now since been

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.109 
can see my power LED has now since been
turned<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.649> now<00:02:07.920> glowing<00:02:08.489> red<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.940> means

now if I can get this in frame a little

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.300 
now if I can get this in frame a little
bit<00:02:15.230> better<00:02:15.320> for<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.620> guys<00:02:15.740> maybe<00:02:15.920> throw<00:02:16.220> it

up here here's the keyboard and keep in

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.770 
up here here's the keyboard and keep in
mind<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.040> little<00:02:19.310> NP<00:02:19.610> sticking<00:02:20.030> out<00:02:20.180> I'm

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
mind this little NP sticking out I'm

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.270 
mind this little NP sticking out I'm
just<00:02:20.990> going<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.230> put<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.470> keyboard<00:02:21.830> in<00:02:22.160> that

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
just going to put that keyboard in that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.210 
just going to put that keyboard in that
little<00:02:22.520> trench<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.290> now<00:02:24.290> as<00:02:24.500> soon<00:02:24.680> as<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:24.890> slide

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
little trench and now as soon as I slide

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.980 
little trench and now as soon as I slide
it<00:02:25.280> over<00:02:25.640> you'll<00:02:25.880> see<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.450> once<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.840> enters

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
it over you'll see that once it enters

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.830 
it over you'll see that once it enters
that<00:02:27.200> little<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:28.100> guess<00:02:28.460> hole<00:02:28.790> over<00:02:28.970> here<00:02:29.090> you

that little I guess hole over here you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.570 
that little I guess hole over here you
can<00:02:29.960> see<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.110> we<00:02:30.350> now<00:02:30.380> have<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.740> blinking

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
can see that we now have a blinking

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.610 
can see that we now have a blinking
green<00:02:31.610> LED<00:02:32.270> which<00:02:32.780> means<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> keyboard

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
green LED which means that the keyboard

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.980 
green LED which means that the keyboard
is<00:02:33.740> actually<00:02:34.160> being<00:02:34.310> charged<00:02:34.820> now<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.480> beats

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
is actually being charged now this beats

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.720 
is actually being charged now this beats
the<00:02:36.110> crap<00:02:36.290> out<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.620> those<00:02:36.860> double<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.310> batteries

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
the system i have figured out usually

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.940 
the system i have figured out usually
about<00:03:41.150> two<00:03:41.390> three<00:03:41.660> weeks<00:03:41.750> i<00:03:42.230> can<00:03:42.739> get<00:03:42.860> away

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
those die then you can just whip this

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.229 
those die then you can just whip this
little<00:03:57.950> battery<00:03:58.190> pack<00:03:58.370> out<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:58.820> start<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.150> and
