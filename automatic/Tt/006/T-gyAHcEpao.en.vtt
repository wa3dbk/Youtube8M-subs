00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.090
 and flight that you have thought of doing 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.860
 remain or less the truth is that 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.959
 our plan from the beginning was 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.150
 leave we have come to the ventures 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.400
 to catch a plane and go to any 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.560
 desert island although our plan is us 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.560
 He twisted a bit after suffering several casualties 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.260
 efe the scare that they are throwing 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.260
 downstairs 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.079
 We are lost 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.550
 the zombies have entered the building 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.550
 fast to the roof 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.430
 ah 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.310
 forms asked to upload we will keep them to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310
 stripe 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.549
 you think they will be alive the idea makes 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.950
 long time we would not know anything about 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.259
 they have not come out so I do not know 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.180
 but we should go in before we 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.810
 give something for the rain we can not 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.810
 get sick 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.500
 I do not know why but something has gone wrong and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.240
 have caught my friend luckily gave me 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.480
 time to escape and I have not been infected 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.320
 it's okay to go outside again here 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.320
 we are not sure 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.290
 I can not believe it a miracle 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.879
 Quick your life before the time 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.799
 I'll make it worse I'll explain everything on the way to 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.799
 my base is a safe place 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.730
 and well we have already reached my refuge in 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.150
 my house 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:04.799
 a car dealership fierce sant 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.349
 yes but it's safe believe me and excuse me 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.019
 for not presenting myself, I am a driver 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:14.000
 good ex-driver of the deceased 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.000
 president of the sanitary government 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.970
 how they killed the president when 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.040
 the president was killed in his jet 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.959
 private with a chainsaw he would take a 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.450
 helicopter and I came to the zero point of 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.730
 all this and to my surprise is the way 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.490
 calmest of all in the diaz and 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.490
 I've been living here for a few months now 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.430
 still there are still zombies 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.519
 clear as in all san andreas but for 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.750
 some strange reason these zombies are 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.090
 weaker and slower 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.849
 it will be because this is the place where 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.920
 started everything or something like that anyway 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.170
 we can spend a season living 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.170
 quietly to you 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.170
 ah 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.420
 where they will have gotten roberto cain and 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.420
 Richard 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.130
 no idea maybe they have given us 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.990
 dead and have gone to any 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.820
 site but I think I just saw a 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.550
 Helicopter direction to fierce sant 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.950
 we should go diego I think they are 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.910
 hallucinations of yours but good not 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.910
 we have nothing to lose 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.350
 I think this is fierce sand and apparently 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.350
 there is nobody or nothing 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.820
 nobody or anything says barrel I think this 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.260
 it is the zero point of all this 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.260
 look at the poster 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.620
 are boats if this is the zero point this 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.199
 it's the place where everything started 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.199
 we must pass but we play our 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:38.599
 diego lives follow that ring is the price 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:42.460
 to know the truth and we have not arrived 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.460
 back far away to surrender now 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.270
 runs diego the zombies approach 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.440
 damn elevator it takes to open up the 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.440
 door and the zombies come 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.990
 we get it from above we are inside 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.990
 of the answer to all our doubts 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.210
 yes but look there is someone behind him 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.569
 high there who the hell are you 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.569
 confess everything or die
