00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.570
 in front of the days we knew the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.180
 last week 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.510
 the competition bmx track left by 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.510
 Ezequiel every month 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.040
 that started in the 80s in the cadet 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.110
 after pilots and this is the first 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.960
 Current bmx track in the capital 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.270
 general began everything from the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.370
 four years ago with the games of 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.320
 beijing began to gestate all part of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.400
 the city that feel this as a sport 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.570
 they contacted me the people of the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.629
 Buenos Aires space and the park 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.629
 shoot and started to diagram 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.269
 each singer 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.909
 a track that gives a lot of speed that does not 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.490
 it has resting place in the curves 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.280
 they are broad and it is where theoretically 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.929
 of the bmx you rest here is where more 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.880
 you have to demand it because they are the 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:22.840
 only places you have to be able to 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.950
 react and pedal has two straights 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.950
 of session but in measure 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.950
 oversized 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.160
 and well-being what is the new levels 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.340
 of mx the big difference is that being 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.320
 demanding rests very much the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.590
 arms the legs because they are 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.720
 practically almost 400 meters there is no 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.000
 rest in one place to rest 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.150
 and at all times you have to go 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.360
 working with the body for the jumps 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.190
 that there are many types pedaling for 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.740
 to be able to reach the jumps that are 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.350
 pretty big that if you perez a 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.130
 little speed you can not do it well 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.130
 fluid the turn 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.080
 we have as goal sport initiation and 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.790
 training center on the track what 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.800
 what is racing all that will continue with the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.350
 time was good a couple of programs 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.540
 of sports initiation from outside and 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.030
 we merged and put it into reality 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.980
 our from Argentina and in sports 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.260
 of the bmx and that the truth that they are very 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.570
 fun for the kids work because 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.100
 will teach them to be able to master well of 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.920
 the bicycle before you can enter a 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.480
 track and for the big ones it will serve them 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.440
 because they're going to help you a lot and they're going to 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.570
 be bigger than the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.660
 tiny blood kilo also makes a 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.680
 little stop for the new guys do not know 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.450
 retracted and here has the part 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.520
 competitive 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.879
 unconsciously the boys when they are 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.840
 new ones want to compete and that many 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.879
 Sometimes he frustrates us when he does not do well 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.060
 you have to work well with that subject that 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.290
 it's really fun to do things you can 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.610
 do without racing 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.370
 to compete among them in a way 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.530
 fun 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.700
 and used and then do careers 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.520
 for the biggest guys the security 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.250
 it's the main thing 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.260
 the helmet for the subject of what the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.060
 school we do not demand general helmet but 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.670
 for what is helmet training 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.870
 full length long sleeve long pants 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.100
 as the regulation says it was a matter of 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.430
 also take care of the security that many 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.430
 of people 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.290
 is very happy less than a month ago 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.180
 practically finish the whole track 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.600
 after so many things I felt a relief 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.130
 very big because always with the rain 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.410
 One thing for the other was truncated 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.570
 everything and the truth as I felt a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.630
 little frustrated that I can not finish a 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.880
 track that is something so simple with the 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.730
 Tails with economic support is something very 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.630
 simple, it cost us a lot and for 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.630
 luck, I'm very happy 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.430
 I'm very good the truth that I had been doing for a while 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.340
 that something was needed backwards 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.670
 after many years now that yes 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.110
 because there was nothing close I had to go 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.510
 all very far so it comes to us 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.910
 barbarian but the aerobic this does not give you 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.770
 nothing and good I do not dedicate mail in this 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.750
 but fun is practically the 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.500
 same for everyone now that it is very 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.440
 interesting is very very aerobic of cajo 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.270
 very homework and it's been a long time since there was something 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.460
 similar that getting is the truth that 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.500
 the work of Ezequiel excellent the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.470
 I congratulate it took a lot but it's worth 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.230
 I'm sorry, I do not have to give you more time 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.660
 and more more work and that the kids go 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.850
 stepping to get there not in form but the 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.210
 track is amazing now for fun 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.590
 it has big curves this only makes 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.590
 it's time that can be rolled
