00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:22.920
 the night bad night last night 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:26.609
 peskov off and real and speak my name is 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.260
 Carlos studied the first year and all 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.130
 days drives the car with the pro students 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.450
 school 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.469
 my cousin from piauí does not drink 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.910
 cheaper goes from coke to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.489
 candê is not used but in the efficiency 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.579
 replaces the hook 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.469
 so it was easy to pass our difficult 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.320
 because we did not have the resources to 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.539
 structure we did not have material every time 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.570
 we had no resources here in our nothingness 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.719
 nothing nothing then we had that we have 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.980
 these two classrooms a patio 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.510
 already abandoned composition used with 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
 Get out of the corner. 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 so we use this space as 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.200
 classroom with all this with 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.720
 this whole situation still had us 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.610
 we can make it happen my 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.159
 results and the results were 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.270
 increasing order in 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.409
 year after year and the school began to be 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.720
 placed in the ranking of the top ten 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:34.829
 always 46 seconds and then after 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.360
 two last years is the first first I 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.100
 I am living proof that we all 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 these my awards around you 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.520
 everything and all this I got 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.950
 to conquer that it is possible but a student 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240
 teacher can achieve his or her 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.890
 dreams 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.200
 disregarding whatever the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.360
 obstacles because I come from the world 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.380
 interior of the state's inner city 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.930
 and that I fought I counted on the structure 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.270
 of well-trained teachers 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.149
 elusive teacher was engaged in teaching 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.030
 What I really wanted to do was do with myself. 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.039
 my dream I could accomplish great 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.930
 part of it 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.340
 I want to be able to accomplish others that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.340
 coming to pass in medicine 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:32.659
 College was the first in six in the 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.879
 average was the week of mother is that 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:39.819
 it was possible to achieve a result that 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.819
 it was possible they passed the entrance exam 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.430
 distance is always healthy because it is 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.620
 good let homesickness 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.510
 as I think everyone expects to 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.709
 leaving home without longing for the family of 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.970
 friends of the house will have to talk to her more 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.340
 Even though you do not want to go back to 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.049
 home from here the following career 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:12.109
 professional hereinafter will 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:14.209
 get to tread the flemish we did 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.000
 more than our obligation as long as the 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.620
 teacher and people who have a 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.290
 commitment because only the teacher 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.290
 can not just from the nba have a 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.849
 work but you have to understand is here 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.479
 that his work is a job 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.299
 differentiated because ice creates an action 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:34.370
 repercussions on society in general is 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.169
 did not do this work with 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.669
 dedication the way it was for everything 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.500
 world including making the rulers 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.019
 including the people who have it's 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.989
 responsibility to take care of this and 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.060
 do not do it, you have to play in a 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.079
 I just do not like the way we come. 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.079
 doing here
