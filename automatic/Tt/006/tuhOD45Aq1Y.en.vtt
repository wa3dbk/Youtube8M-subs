showing you an aspect of industrialcraft
which<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.380> how<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> make<00:00:14.370> an<00:00:14.580> electronic

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
which is how to make an electronic

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.290 
which is how to make an electronic
circuit<00:00:16.190> now<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.730> do<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.260> you<00:00:19.260> will<00:00:19.289> need<00:00:19.710> a

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
circuit now to do this you will need a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.269 
circuit now to do this you will need a
piece<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> iron<00:00:23.240> you<00:00:24.240> will<00:00:24.420> need<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:25.250> lot<00:00:26.250> of

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
piece of iron you will need a lot of

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.049 
piece of iron you will need a lot of
wood<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:28.880> lot<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.090> wood<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:31.199> will<00:00:31.410> need<00:00:32.059> copper

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
wood a lot of wood you will need copper

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:43.220 
wood a lot of wood you will need copper
and<00:00:35.930> that<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:41.420> first<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.719> need<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> get

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and that is it so first we need to get

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.610 
and that is it so first we need to get
rubber<00:00:43.620> fraud<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.200> make<00:00:46.440> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
rubber fraud and to do that we make it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:59.810 
rubber fraud and to do that we make it
tap<00:00:46.920> like<00:00:47.640> such<00:00:49.129> but<00:00:50.239> we<00:00:51.590> need<00:00:53.000> more<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:58.640> if<00:00:59.640> i

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
tap like such but we need more so if i

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.080 
tap like such but we need more so if i
put<00:01:00.030> tap<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:03.979> put<00:01:04.979> three<00:01:05.580> piece<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
put tap there and put three piece of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.469 
put tap there and put three piece of
wood<00:01:06.270> along<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> top<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.549> piece<00:01:09.180> of

copper bars here which are you get from
copper<00:02:30.130> ore<00:02:30.400> which<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.940> can<00:02:31.090> only<00:02:31.270> get<00:02:31.480> in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
copper ore which you can only get in

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.670 
copper ore which you can only get in
Industrial<00:02:32.290> Craft<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.959> put<00:02:35.200> them<00:02:35.410> down

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
Industrial Craft and you put them down

Industrial Craft and you put them down
the<00:02:35.800> middle<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.250> get<00:02:36.850> eight<00:02:37.060> cables<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:39.330> now

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
the middle to get eight cables and now

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.510 
the middle to get eight cables and now
we're<00:02:41.230> going<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.740> need<00:02:43.200> redstone<00:02:44.200> two<00:02:44.950> pieces

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
we're going to need redstone two pieces

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.410 
we're going to need redstone two pieces
respect<00:02:46.480> dust<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.580> we're<00:02:48.580> going<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.060> need<00:02:49.209> a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
respect dust and we're going to need a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.870 
respect dust and we're going to need a
piece<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.690> vine<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:51.400> turn<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.940> refine<00:02:52.360> by<00:02:52.630> I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
piece of vine to turn to refine by I

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.140 
piece of vine to turn to refine by I
think<00:02:54.880> they<00:02:55.030> call<00:02:55.239> it<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:56.820> we're<00:02:57.820> going<00:02:58.120> to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
think they call it and we're going to

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.010 
think they call it and we're going to
need<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.630> smelt<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.560> do<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.840> hope<00:03:01.840> this

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
need to smelt it to do that I hope this

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.100 
need to smelt it to do that I hope this
works<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> normal<00:03:02.800> furnace<00:03:03.750> yep<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.959> does

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
works with a normal furnace yep it does

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.770 
works with a normal furnace yep it does
so<00:03:06.070> we'll<00:03:06.340> need<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.670> wait<00:03:06.700> for<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.239> smelt

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
so we'll need to wait for that to smelt

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.759 
so we'll need to wait for that to smelt
I<00:03:09.360> should<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.480> just<00:03:10.660> used<00:03:10.780> piece<00:03:11.320> of<00:03:11.350> wood

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
I should have just used piece of wood

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.270 
I should have just used piece of wood
that's<00:03:12.670> pretty<00:03:13.030> wasteful<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.739> there<00:03:15.130> we<00:03:15.250> have

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
that's pretty wasteful so there we have

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.910 
that's pretty wasteful so there we have
our<00:03:15.580> refined<00:03:16.360> iron<00:03:16.720> oh<00:03:19.200> yeah<00:03:20.200> I'll<00:03:20.470> just<00:03:20.680> stick

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
our refined iron oh yeah I'll just stick

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.030 
our refined iron oh yeah I'll just stick
some<00:03:20.980> wood<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.489> there<00:03:22.110> just<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.500> use<00:03:23.799> up<00:03:24.010> that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
some wood in there just to use up that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.539 
some wood in there just to use up that
last<00:03:24.400> bit<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.670> cup<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:26.220> here<00:03:27.220> we<00:03:27.340> have<00:03:27.370> our

last bit of cup so here we have our

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.229 
last bit of cup so here we have our
refined<00:03:28.060> iron<00:03:28.299> so<00:03:29.019> we're<00:03:29.170> going<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.440> put<00:03:29.470> cable

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
refined iron so we're going to put cable

side piece of redstone and there you

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.729 
side piece of redstone and there you
have<00:03:47.049> an<00:03:47.940> electronic<00:03:48.940> circuit<00:03:49.350> which<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.560> can

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
have an electronic circuit which you can

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.990 
have an electronic circuit which you can
use<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.480> for<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.709> manufacture<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.519> most

machines Industrial Craft something you
need<00:03:58.750> an<00:03:58.900> even<00:03:59.230> more<00:03:59.410> advanced<00:03:59.950> circuit<00:04:00.459> than

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
need an even more advanced circuit than

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.430 
need an even more advanced circuit than
that<00:04:00.959> but<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.680> is<00:04:02.709> usually<00:04:03.250> enough<00:04:03.880> add<00:04:04.440> in

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
that but that is usually enough add in

Industrial<00:04:06.040> Craft<00:04:06.220> there<00:04:06.549> are<00:04:06.640> lots<00:04:06.850> more

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
Industrial Craft there are lots more

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.780 
Industrial Craft there are lots more
cool<00:04:07.299> things<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:07.900> I'll<00:04:08.680> give<00:04:09.340> some<00:04:09.670> more

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
cool things and I'll give some more

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.030 
cool things and I'll give some more
tutorials<00:04:10.480> on<00:04:10.660> them<00:04:10.840> as<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.320> get<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.650> resources

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
tutorials on them as I get the resources

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.479 
tutorials on them as I get the resources
to<00:04:12.430> do<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.690> i'll<00:04:14.140> see<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.739> next<00:04:14.800> time<00:04:15.220> and

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
to do it so i'll see you next time and

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.690
