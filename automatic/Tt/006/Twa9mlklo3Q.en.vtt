00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.710
 I believe that God looks good on you and you say 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.290
 if I know you have that strength but 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.900
 in your weakness, that's where I'm going to 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.240
 pour out my grace in favor of skill 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.340
 in what does not work in what for the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.010
 other is useless what for you is 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.619
 useless there I'm going to spill my power 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.050
 there I am going to glorify myself there I go to 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.480
 empty my grace there I'm going to do that 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.660
 my grace be manifested where we 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.879
 serves where no one can see remember 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.699
 you samuel had a perpetual fake 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.129
 perspective about what was god in 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.220
 As for men God sends them to 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.170
 anoint the future king of israel and when 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.199
 see toasted the tall, stocky man 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.229
 a military whole and then samuels 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.430
 emotion and says that in front of my eyes 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:55.900
 truly the one who is going to be the king of 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.809
 israel and samuel law is wrong not 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.820
 I see what you men see and I 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.979
 I think Samuel was embarrassed and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.629
 said good that the next one continues and 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.180
 then finally told him there are six that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.640
 you do not have another child and he said and 6 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.210
 I do not know if there is one but that is not a 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.310
 little shepherd gave scholarships and said and said 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.050
 samuel well we will not eat come and 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.420
 bring not because I do not get up from here 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.710
 until they bring it to me and when it gives me 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:27.150
 life between that cipote of 15 17 years 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.150
 skinny all hairy 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.320
 and suddenly god says samuel you know 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.750
 it's wrong 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.590
 that's the king and I think samuel for 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.110
 one moment said 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.270
 That gentleman will not be that I'm 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.940
 wrong woman all wrong other 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.180
 every garden is not that's the skinny 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.010
 that you see there that guy you stay there 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.470
 the only thing he knows how to do is shepherd 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.360
 sheep is military has nothing 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.460
 because this one has not even been called 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.990
 to be part of Saul's army but 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.659
 This one to this I have chosen 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.450
 or when we manage to understand as God 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.979
 work then we are going to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.049
 allow God to do the work 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.789
 perfect to our lives we 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.660
 many times we try to impress 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.770
 God 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.390
 how beautiful and we try to bring 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.700
 in front of God as our offering 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.200
 our strongest parts because 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.590
 we believe that's where God is going to 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.510
 verify and suddenly god says not all 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.040
 that you see everyone sees it no no 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.700
 and that you are ashamed that it creates you 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.270
 guilt 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.080
 and that makes you feel bad that 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:43.989
 you hide it very well that I'm going to 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.989
 valerio that beautiful because God is good 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:53.030
 you know why and it's important to understand 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:55.360
 that God does not limit our 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.360
 weaknesses 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:04.150
 say it to god do not imitate my 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.430
 weaknesses disqualified me when I see 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.620
 my weaknesses the engine disqualifies me 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.330
 when I see when they see my weaknesses 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.620
 but when the father lives my 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.140
 weaknesses then says the father yes 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.780
 Choose that weakness in which I chose 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.629
 because look what it says 2nd Corinthians 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.299
 he enjoys putting his power in glasses 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.670
 fragile this is beautiful 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:32.480
 he enjoys putting his power in glasses 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.580
 fragile of what it says 2nd Corinthians 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.560
 47 but we have this treasure in glasses of 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.140
 mud so that the excellence of power 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.299
 be of god and one of us that cute 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.269
 That's why he said he enjoys using people 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.579
 weak and fragile people so that for that 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.920
 just like crafts like 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.650
 the clay vessels are so weak that 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.079
 they can easily be broken easily 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.409
 can be deformed and says sir if 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:05.069
 this is what it says it says it true that 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.690
 I do not know if I'll be wrong but I do not know 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.480
 if in his bible he says that the sea wood 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.250
 that he is going to put this treasure in a glass of 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.160
 gold says 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.900
 or of diamonds says of mud 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.690
 mohamed and mud 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.560
 and he says I'm going to put my treasure 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.800
 treasure life power the power of 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.050
 God says I put it but I do not put it 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.289
 I do not put it in glasses of gold 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.340
 diamonds but I put it in glasses of 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.860
 mud so that when excellence 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.620
 manifested from that treasure in you not 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.449
 give themselves the glory because then they go to 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.949
 see that mud from that earthen vessel and 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.770
 they will say no no no mud cups 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.560
 this clay vessel easily breaks 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.470
 easily shatters and is the emmy 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.289
 the glory is for him all the glory and 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.680
 all honor is for him the strong one is the 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:05.930
 powerful in him is the I am fragile 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.139
 I am weak I easily weakened 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:15.210
 tell someone our god tell them to 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:17.120
 our god enjoys putting his power in 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.660
 fragile vessels 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.660
 ah 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.920
 God will use us if we allow him 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.260
 work through our 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.620
 weaknesses throughout history 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.470
 you find that god of weak people 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.720
 he made strong people you read Hebrews 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.430
 then one of the books that I 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.640
 I enjoy personally I enjoy 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.620
 read them and I say we could preach 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.440
 a whole year talking only about seeing you 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.170
 11 I call him the gallery of men 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.530
 of faith there appear men and women 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:55.030
 most powerful women appears sansÃ³n 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:59.750
 appears barack appears that this one does not 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:02.000
 appears abraham appears not appear 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.330
 those women who say in their hands 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.940
 by faith they received their children 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:11.060
 resurrected appears daniela vale appears 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.240
 sada table that to see denied and start already 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.640
 start to see all those people 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.500
 shocking that he did tremendous things but 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.750
 when we read all that that comes first 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.710
 that you come to mind 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.710
 God used because 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.949
 is that me but when you start to 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:31.199
 study and start for the profile of 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:35.160
 each one of them you noticed 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:36.870
 realize that all were weak 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.380
 but the nicest thing is to see the 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.780
 transformation that God makes in the 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.970
 weak and turn them into something strong 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.210
 I'm going to give you some examples and one of 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.390
 they will be moses the weakness of bassinet 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:55.890
 what was his temperament very being 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:58.770
 covered, I looked at Moses, it was a serious thing 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.270
 bassinet as pse not played and 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.400
 The first time you see it is the 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.070
 that says he went out to the field because he 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.230
 had been grown in the house of Pharaoh 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.020
 He goes out to the countryside to see his brothers and 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:13.740
 he soon sees even a Hebrew with an Egyptian 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.240
 fighting and feel the anger and as it is 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.220
 that people who have the problem of 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.340
 this kind of temper now they believe 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:23.730
 the vigilantes believe they are 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.040
 to defend the weak and the unjust but 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.750
 then they go out and do not measure 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.760
 consequences because they think they're going 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.190
 to fix the world then they go out 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.830
 moses min and when you see that the Egyptian 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.620
 that is mistreating and hitting the wta 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.630
 He goes out and gets in the middle of the fight and does not 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.840
 it only separates them is that it kills the 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.760
 Egyptian buries him 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.610
 was that every act in which I had a lot 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.240
 conventions appropriated 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:53.110
 but one day god chooses him says bassinet 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.110
 I chose you
