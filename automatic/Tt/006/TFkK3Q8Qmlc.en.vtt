year time on these synthetic lanes I

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.620

believe there was not enough aberration

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.990 
believe there was not enough aberration
so<00:03:14.290> that's<00:03:14.560> reported<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:15.070> combination<00:03:15.610> of<00:03:15.760> oil

so that's reported a combination of oil

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.910 
so that's reported a combination of oil
and<00:03:16.300> water<00:03:16.540> on<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.900> ball
