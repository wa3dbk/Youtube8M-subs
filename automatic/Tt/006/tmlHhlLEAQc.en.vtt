00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
snow just to sort of get a bit of layer

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.070 
snow just to sort of get a bit of layer
I<00:03:17.560> think<00:03:17.950> would<00:03:18.100> work<00:03:18.340> beautifully<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.510> don't

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
I think would work beautifully I don't

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.360 
I think would work beautifully I don't
have<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.440> unfortunately<00:03:21.070> but<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:23.530> kind<00:03:24.310> of

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
have it unfortunately but in kind of

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.460 
have it unfortunately but in kind of
like<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.790> then<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.239> could<00:03:25.390> add<00:03:25.570> pearls<00:03:25.930> or

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
like it then you could add pearls or

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.640 
like it then you could add pearls or
whatever<00:03:26.980> bling<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:28.330> sort<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.690> jazz<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.500> up<00:03:29.590> a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
whatever bling to sort of jazz it up a

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.630 
whatever bling to sort of jazz it up a
bit<00:03:29.920> but<00:03:30.820> Natasha<00:03:31.480> said<00:03:31.930> not<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.440> add<00:03:33.220> too<00:03:33.459> much

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
bit but Natasha said not to add too much

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.360 
bit but Natasha said not to add too much
of<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.970> banishment<00:03:34.390> sand<00:03:35.049> she<00:03:35.860> didn't<00:03:36.220> want

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
of the banishment sand she didn't want

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.140 
of the banishment sand she didn't want
it<00:03:36.459> too<00:03:36.640> dimensional<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:38.110> I<00:03:38.140> hope<00:03:38.680> this<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:38.980> not

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
it too dimensional so I hope this is not

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.190 
it too dimensional so I hope this is not
two-dimensional<00:03:40.150> for<00:03:40.299> her<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:41.049> I<00:03:42.870> did<00:03:43.870> use

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
two-dimensional for her and I did use

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.729 
two-dimensional for her and I did use
dim<00:03:44.590> holes<00:03:44.910> laters<00:03:48.780> another<00:03:49.780> die<00:03:50.019> cut<00:03:50.320> for

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
dim holes laters another die cut for

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.490 
dim holes laters another die cut for
this<00:03:51.299> also<00:03:52.299> very<00:03:52.480> pretty<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:53.049> like<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.380> way

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
this also very pretty I like the way

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.670 
this also very pretty I like the way
turned<00:03:53.739> out<00:03:53.950> it's<00:03:54.190> quite<00:03:54.580> simple<00:03:55.090> but

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
turned out it's quite simple but

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.160 
turned out it's quite simple but
effective<00:03:57.180> doesn't<00:03:58.180> take<00:03:58.299> much<00:03:58.480> time<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.989> make

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
effective doesn't take much time to make

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.190 
effective doesn't take much time to make
it<00:03:59.610> this<00:04:00.610> was<00:04:00.940> made<00:04:01.180> earlier<00:04:01.720> because<00:04:02.170> I

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
it this was made earlier because I

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.039 
it this was made earlier because I
wanted<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.709> try<00:04:02.920> out<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.870> die<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:07.049> what

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
wanted to try out the the die and what

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.340 
wanted to try out the the die and what
else<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.440> got

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
else I got

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.930 
else I got
yes<00:04:11.350> I<00:04:12.040> used<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:14.230> same<00:04:14.380> dye<00:04:14.710> this<00:04:15.340> is<00:04:15.460> a<00:04:15.490> single

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
yes I used the same dye this is a single

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.610 
yes I used the same dye this is a single
layer<00:04:16.090> still<00:04:16.720> very<00:04:17.050> effective<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:19.620> know

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
layer still very effective and you know

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.450 
layer still very effective and you know
played<00:04:20.860> with<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.070> black<00:04:22.770> cardstock<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.280> I

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
played with a black cardstock and I

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.130 
played with a black cardstock and I
think<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:24.790> looks<00:04:25.000> good<00:04:25.210> actually

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
think it looks good actually

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.160 
think it looks good actually
and<00:04:26.230> then<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.220> same<00:04:27.400> message<00:04:27.790> inside<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:31.170> just

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
and then the same message inside so just

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
you know I've made some without any

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.310 
you know I've made some without any
embellishments<00:04:39.310> at<00:04:39.400> all<00:04:39.550> just<00:04:40.030> embossed<00:04:40.540> and

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
the message is inside made another one

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.890 
the message is inside made another one
like<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:48.810> with<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.870> message<00:04:50.200> inside<00:04:50.760> so<00:04:51.900> these
