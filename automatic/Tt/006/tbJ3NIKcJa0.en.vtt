00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.839
 I am not 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.520
 or 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.440
 let's prepare homemade icing sugar 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 and what are we going to need for 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.440
 prepare the white sugar in grain and a 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.750
 food processor in terms of 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.330
 food processor can be 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.410
 whatever you have at home the 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.040
 thermomix the blender chopper 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.220
 hand a little robot like the one I 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.350
 I'm going to use a coffee grinder in 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.989
 definitive whatever you have in 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.239
 house that crushes can also be a 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.770
 blender cup good what you 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.790
 you have and we just have to put 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.990
 an amount to eye of sugar in our 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.900
 processor 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.440
 and try not to fill it too much for 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.630
 make it easier to crush it and nothing 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.960
 then we just have to put in 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.500
 march our food processor and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.280
 crush it and crush it until 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.960
 that we have a texture like flour 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.970
 both in sight and touch 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.980
 look flour but actually what 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.980
 we have is homemade icing sugar 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.540
 so we can use this sugar 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.060
 glas good for example for a 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.640
 Sponge cake sprinkle on top of sugar 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.710
 with the help of a colander and so 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.630
 we can decorate 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.960
 for many preparations in pastry 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.770
 who asks us for icing sugar 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.140
 even to make pater cream but for 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.869
 do to make cream is much better if 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.360
 we use a commercial icing sugar the 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.340
 that we buy in stores because 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.670
 we are going to obtain a result very much 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.130
 better but if we do not have that option or not 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 We want to buy the icing sugar because it is 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.030
 a solution to make our own 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.479
 toilet cream with a pretty result 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.180
 good this icing sugar what can we 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.400
 use to make the fondant dough 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.260
 because many of you have asked me in 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.390
 this video if you could replace the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.420
 icing sugar for normal sugar and not 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.230
 can but it's as simple as shred 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.019
 the sugar in grain and we use it to 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.720
 do our background so I hope that to 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.910
 all that you do not have easy to get 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 the icing sugar serves you this video and 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.290

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.780
 you have pending if you liked the
