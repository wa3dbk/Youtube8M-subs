happened<00:00:33.260> feisty<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.440> don't<00:00:34.620> really<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:34.980> as

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.710 
happened feisty we don't really know as
we<00:00:35.309> came<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> grid<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.269> just<00:00:36.449> seems<00:00:36.629> to

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
we came to the grid that just seems to

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.990 
we came to the grid that just seems to
be<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> lot<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.989> burning<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.830> the<00:00:38.550> back<00:00:38.730> body

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
be a lot of burning of the the back body

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.479 
be a lot of burning of the the back body
work<00:00:39.330> so<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.720> seems<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.080> he's<00:00:40.199> got<00:00:40.440> very<00:00:41.190> hot

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
work so it seems if he's got very hot

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.360 
work so it seems if he's got very hot
and<00:00:42.260> then<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.530> stopped<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.010> grid<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and then as we stopped on the grid I

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
and then as we stopped on the grid I
could<00:00:44.670> get<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.910> smoke<00:00:45.269> was<00:00:45.449> really<00:00:45.809> coming

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
could get the smoke was really coming

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
could get the smoke was really coming
but<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.559> lost<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> throttle<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.700> think

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
but then I lost the throttle so I think

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
but then I lost the throttle so I think
it<00:00:48.059> must<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.390> burned<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.690> bit<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> wiring<00:00:49.140> at
