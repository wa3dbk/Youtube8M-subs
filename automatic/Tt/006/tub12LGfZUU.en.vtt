00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.960 

so<00:00:01.530> lately<00:00:01.709> I've<00:00:01.829> noticed<00:00:01.949> that<00:00:02.669> I've<00:00:02.820> had<00:00:02.939> a

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
so lately I've noticed that I've had a

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.380 
so lately I've noticed that I've had a
lot<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.179> film<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.840> surface<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.380> water

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
lot of film on the surface of the water

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.049 
lot of film on the surface of the water
there's<00:00:06.390> dust<00:00:06.660> if<00:00:07.020> there's<00:00:07.259> film<00:00:08.059> there's

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
there's dust if there's film there's

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.650 
there's dust if there's film there's
scum<00:00:10.490> now<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:12.690> open<00:00:13.219> top<00:00:14.219> tank<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.969> just

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
scum now this this open top tank is just

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.529 
scum now this this open top tank is just
off<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.839> kitchen<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.529> I'm<00:00:17.190> wondering<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.760> if

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
off the kitchen so I'm wondering if if

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.320 
off the kitchen so I'm wondering if if
I'm<00:00:18.720> getting<00:00:19.020> some<00:00:22.310> you<00:00:23.310> know<00:00:23.430> when<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> cook

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I'm getting some you know when I cook

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.269 
I'm getting some you know when I cook
some<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> oils<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.410> landing<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
some of the oils in here landing on the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.820 
some of the oils in here landing on the
surface<00:00:27.769> plus<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.010> normal<00:00:29.130> fish<00:00:29.580> load<00:00:30.830> is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
surface plus the normal fish load is

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.010 
surface plus the normal fish load is
just<00:00:32.160> producing<00:00:32.820> its<00:00:32.940> own<00:00:33.059> bio<00:00:33.390> proteins<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
just producing its own bio proteins and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.139 
just producing its own bio proteins and
such<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:36.020> my<00:00:37.020> solution<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> get<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
such so my solution is to get this the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.959 
such so my solution is to get this the
surface<00:00:39.480> skimmer<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.370> actually<00:00:41.790> one

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
surface skimmer and this is actually one

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.100 
surface skimmer and this is actually one
of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.210> cheapest<00:00:42.600> things<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.989> I've

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
of the cheapest things that I've

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.350 
of the cheapest things that I've
purchased<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> tank<00:00:44.160> which<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.610> strange

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
purchased for the tank which is strange

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.000 
purchased for the tank which is strange
because<00:00:45.690> everything's<00:00:46.559> usually<00:00:46.860> really

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
because everything's usually really

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.549 
because everything's usually really
expensive<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.510> thing<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.410> under

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
expensive so this thing was just under

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.049 
expensive so this thing was just under
20<00:00:49.860> bucks<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.260> does<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:53.850> does

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
20 bucks and what it does is it it does

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.029 
20 bucks and what it does is it it does
two<00:00:54.270> things<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:55.050> draw<00:00:55.320> below<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> water

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
two things it will draw below the water

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.229 
two things it will draw below the water
line<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.059> will<00:00:57.120> draw<00:00:58.940> just<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
line and it will draw just at the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.460 
line and it will draw just at the
surface<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.000> see<00:01:03.239> this

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
surface here so here you can see this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.240 
surface here so here you can see this
cylinder<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.739> floats

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
cylinder it floats

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.679 
cylinder it floats
if<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.360> line<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.750> correctly<00:01:08.450> they<00:01:09.450> should

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
if you line it up correctly they should

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.039 
if you line it up correctly they should
Bob<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.520> water<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.600> evaporates

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
Bob with the water and as it evaporates

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.770 
Bob with the water and as it evaporates
so<00:01:13.590> basically<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.760> want<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so basically what you want to do it's

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.920 
so basically what you want to do it's
got<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.049> little<00:01:17.299> thing<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> middle<00:01:18.720> here

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
got this little thing in the middle here

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
got this little thing in the middle here
you<00:01:19.110> want<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.680> turn<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.840> until

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.260 

you<00:01:26.950> know<00:01:27.040> a<00:01:27.280> little<00:01:27.729> Bob

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
you know a little Bob

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.190 
you know a little Bob
I'll<00:01:28.450> get<00:01:28.600> sucked<00:01:28.899> down<00:01:30.479> okay<00:01:31.479> so<00:01:31.960> because

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
I'll get sucked down okay so because

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.749 
I'll get sucked down okay so because
that's<00:01:32.439> getting<00:01:32.619> sucked<00:01:33.009> down<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.310> know<00:01:33.549> that's

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
that's getting sucked down I know that's

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.480 
that's getting sucked down I know that's
too<00:01:33.939> far<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.930> what<00:01:35.080> it'll<00:01:35.290> do<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.740> it'll<00:01:36.310> come

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
too far and what it'll do is it'll come

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.830 
too far and what it'll do is it'll come
up<00:01:36.580> yeah

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
up yeah

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.710 
up yeah
look<00:01:38.110> come<00:01:39.009> down<00:01:39.189> and<00:01:40.060> every<00:01:40.240> time<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.539> do

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
look come down and every time you do

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
look come down and every time you do
that<00:01:41.909> you're<00:01:42.909> taking<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.240> little<00:01:43.509> blast<00:01:43.750> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that you're taking a little blast of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.120 
that you're taking a little blast of
bubbles<00:01:45.280> into<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.640> into<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.299> filter<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:47.130> so

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
bubbles into the into the filter and so

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.960 
bubbles into the into the filter and so
what<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.399> want<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.610> do<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.490> want<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.729> turn

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
what you want to do is you want to turn

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.730 
what you want to do is you want to turn
it<00:01:52.179> until<00:01:52.479> just<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:56.200> it's<00:01:56.350> not<00:01:56.439> sucking

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
it until just so it's not sucking

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.340 
it until just so it's not sucking
bubbles<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:58.390> pulling<00:01:58.720> stuff<00:01:58.990> off<00:01:59.170> the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
bubbles but pulling stuff off the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.969 
bubbles but pulling stuff off the
surface<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:03.729> filter<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.209> doesn't<00:02:04.479> like<00:02:04.630> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
surface my filter it doesn't like that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.050 
surface my filter it doesn't like that
so<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.009> don't<00:02:06.130> know<00:02:06.340> if<00:02:06.459> you<00:02:06.520> can<00:02:06.670> see<00:02:06.909> the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
so I don't know if you can see the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.949 
so I don't know if you can see the
surface<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.600> water<00:02:07.810> now<00:02:09.720> what<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.780> mean

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
surface of the water now what I mean

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.140 
surface of the water now what I mean
that's<00:02:12.510> that's<00:02:13.510> pulling<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.170> water<00:02:14.530> pretty

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
that's that's pulling in water pretty

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.320 
that's that's pulling in water pretty
water<00:02:16.150> from<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.450> surf<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.750> pretty<00:02:17.110> aggressive

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.700 

well<00:02:21.840> if<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.170> see<00:02:22.320> all<00:02:22.410> those<00:02:22.500> little

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
well if you can see all those little

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.490 
well if you can see all those little
particulates<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.780> day<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.170> put<00:02:25.410> it

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
particulates but the day that I put it

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.580 
particulates but the day that I put it
on<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.770> tank<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:27.420> entire<00:02:27.750> surface<00:02:28.230> was

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
on the tank the entire surface was

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.730 
on the tank the entire surface was
filled<00:02:29.100> with<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> slime<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:31.110> was<00:02:31.230> pretty<00:02:31.500> gross

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
filled with a slime it was pretty gross

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.400 
filled with a slime it was pretty gross
I<00:02:32.010> tried<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> napkin<00:02:33.120> thing<00:02:33.330> no<00:02:33.840> didn't<00:02:34.290> work

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
I tried the napkin thing no didn't work

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.020 
I tried the napkin thing no didn't work
that<00:02:34.710> just<00:02:34.890> added<00:02:35.100> more<00:02:35.280> little<00:02:35.520> bits<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.910> this

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
that just added more little bits in this

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.760 
that just added more little bits in this
water<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.060> uh<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.840> my<00:02:40.110> solution

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
water so this is uh this is my solution

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.040 
water so this is uh this is my solution
so<00:02:41.190> within<00:02:41.460> five<00:02:41.820> minutes<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.870> thing

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
so within five minutes of this thing

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.110 
so within five minutes of this thing
being<00:02:43.260> on<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.590> tank<00:02:46.160> clear<00:02:47.160> surface<00:02:47.370> we've

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
being on the tank clear surface we've

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.420 
being on the tank clear surface we've
also<00:02:48.270> noticed<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:50.280> smells<00:02:50.610> better<00:02:50.790> too

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
also noticed that it smells better too

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:01.790 
also noticed that it smells better too
so<00:02:53.430> yeah<00:02:54.270> it's<00:02:54.570> pretty<00:02:54.720> good<00:02:54.930> so<00:03:00.590> here's<00:03:01.590> what

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
so yeah it's pretty good so here's what

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.160 
so yeah it's pretty good so here's what
it<00:03:01.830> looks<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:02.220> from<00:03:02.340> underneath<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:07.110> is

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
it looks like from underneath so this is

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.510 
it looks like from underneath so this is
the<00:03:07.470> intake<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.720> threw<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.840> an<00:03:09.990> elbow<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.310> just

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
the intake I threw in an elbow just just

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.700 
the intake I threw in an elbow just just
a<00:03:11.580> PVC<00:03:12.030> elbow<00:03:12.150> from<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.780> hardware<00:03:13.230> store<00:03:13.470> and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
a PVC elbow from the hardware store and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.050 
a PVC elbow from the hardware store and
it<00:03:14.310> connects<00:03:14.580> right<00:03:14.790> onto<00:03:15.090> here<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:17.060> remember

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
it connects right onto here so remember

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.170 
it connects right onto here so remember
that<00:03:18.180> thing<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.540> was<00:03:18.690> turning<00:03:18.960> around<00:03:19.170> here

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that thing I was turning around here

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.140 
that thing I was turning around here
that<00:03:21.180> shaft<00:03:21.450> runs<00:03:21.780> all<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.050> way<00:03:22.380> through<00:03:23.150> this

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
that shaft runs all the way through this

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.060 
that shaft runs all the way through this
piece<00:03:24.450> here<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.850> right<00:03:27.780> where<00:03:27.990> I<00:03:28.020> removed<00:03:28.709> a

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
piece here and right where I removed a

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.790 
piece here and right where I removed a
piece<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.350> algae<00:03:32.270> java<00:03:33.270> moss<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.680> the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
piece of algae java moss this is the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.040 
piece of algae java moss this is the
other<00:03:34.980> intake<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:35.940> when<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.120> turn<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.870> tweak

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
other intake so when I turn it and tweak

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.890 
other intake so when I turn it and tweak
it<00:03:37.170> at<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.410> top<00:03:38.060> it's<00:03:39.060> moving<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.630> little

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
it at the top it's moving this little

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.650 
it at the top it's moving this little
piston<00:03:40.320> up<00:03:40.890> or<00:03:41.190> down<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:42.300> basically

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
piston up or down so it's basically

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.720 
piston up or down so it's basically
monitoring<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.780> flow<00:03:46.080> so<00:03:46.920> whatever<00:03:47.610> it

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
monitoring the flow so whatever it

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.690 
monitoring the flow so whatever it
doesn't<00:03:48.120> suck<00:03:48.300> through<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.600> surface<00:03:48.810> it'll

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
doesn't suck through the surface it'll

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.150 
doesn't suck through the surface it'll
it'll<00:03:50.700> take<00:03:50.940> through<00:03:51.180> here<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.830> that's<00:03:52.980> pretty

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
it'll take through here so that's pretty

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.150 
it'll take through here so that's pretty
good<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:54.450> far<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.930> am<00:03:55.080> really<00:03:55.530> really<00:03:55.740> impressed

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
good so far I am really really impressed

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.950 
good so far I am really really impressed
with

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960
