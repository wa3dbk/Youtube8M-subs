00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
that the mean time between failure is

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.700 
that the mean time between failure is
much<00:03:06.940> worse<00:03:07.390> on<00:03:07.660> these<00:03:07.870> than<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.260> hard<00:03:08.470> drive

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710
