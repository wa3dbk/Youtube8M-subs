00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 the platform now a separate against 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.570
 to video so pd 2000 bar and have that 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.570
 you have a few times in my blogs 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.450
 or flops or whatever that means 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.770
 and also in the last good wood and me 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 have you said yes do something 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.930
 separate to what was it on 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.760
 what it's all about, why me 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.039
 such a fan of bin and what I have 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.140
 So you can do everything on the one hand 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.820
 I came to it because I am happy 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.530
 so tells me in the internet in the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.020
 whole mégane sport fitness and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 bodybuilding and that too scary like 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.100
 But it must be from the States 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.860
 also a lot and there it will be like 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.559
 used and because all are so one 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.520
 little pink monkey that is called machine 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.520
 after job 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.420
 Of course that has a bit too 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.039
 fat to do yes good are healthy though 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.320
 the fat needs the body off 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 however, you should be so too 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.809
 do not overdo it and he beautiful it here 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.170
 was and therefore you have the peanuts 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.540
 The very slowly prepared then will be there 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.760
 85 percent of the fat taken out 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.970
 So the Jewish house was built and then 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.200
 the rest of it will be left over 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.030
 pulverized so says you have then 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.930
 natural product i know so 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.540
 One always does not think of powder like that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.490
 and i too yes if your diet is very 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.890
 Of course, they are very clean 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.720
 it's never been my first for me either 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.430
 where I laughed like that before that 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.250
 right for you but as I said 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.790
 under reserve 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.200
 to change the way it is done 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.970
 So since then I have now even 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.770
 Colleagues with it yes and exactly seen 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.350
 This is what a classic looks like for that 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.360
 already pretty good 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.030
 this is also my new favorite for 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.340
 be sweet and become another with water 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.270
 I now enlarge the portion with it 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.470
 I can see a little something, too 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.470
 already prepared something 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.880
 with the dosage you have to be good 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:17.390
 she's such a skinny sauce or too 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:24.320
 A peanut with draws if you then 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:28.420
 still want to do a bit more you 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.980
 you still see it dissolve 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.520
 if you want to have spreadable 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:40.810
 everything complains about water sosa sauce 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.810
 we just say tighter 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.160
 or the less water the less 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.160
 that could be now a bread on 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.290
 a raise cracker or something 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.120
 and the taste I 've got it several times 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.350
 already quiet for you but I like to do 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.350
 Of course, a second time 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.730
 So lay slice says and so can 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.930
 you prove through his cover 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.090
 make sandwich so that the classic is 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.980
 synonymous for sap sauces for example 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.190
 Vegetables are delicious everywhere 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.250
 fruits take you too can the mission 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.560
 ins müli has a first result and 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.140
 It's more fluid than I say 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.180
 time with the liquid for me like 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.340
 Also delicious so different hand and so on 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.670
 example some bookmakers hand with 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:04:02.629
 Oatmeal with fruit on it 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:05.750
 I can do it really well or things 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:11.379
 So maybe looking to the wheel more 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.379
 still so good taste 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:20.370
 the job there again after the same 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.480
 principle 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.570
 I'm doing a bit right now 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.570
 more 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:40.560
 He speaks of the water here you need real 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:40.560
 Not much if you're creamy 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.710
 so prof 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.900
 that is clear that you can of course 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.000
 Also entry used salty stuff 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.630
 doping cookies or such things cookies 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.700
 and here is chocolate, actually 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.070
 both newspapers won the sweet ones 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.930
 taste of the lager in breakfast 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:18.120
 sheikh in any case in the molli of her 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:22.360

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:32.830
 over cut snecma hamburg here 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:44.790
 the chocolate taste comes too 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:49.330
 So powerful do not imagine chocolate 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:52.990
 that this is even more so, too 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:58.930

 hope you have this little video 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.600
 I also liked one more 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.370
 impression that one then 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.650
 actually everything can do so 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.410
 He says it's just about listening to fruit 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.930
