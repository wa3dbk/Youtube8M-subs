video codec HD now unfortunately Adobe

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.130 
video codec HD now unfortunately Adobe
Premiere<00:02:41.690> does<00:02:41.840> not<00:02:42.080> support<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:43.420> codec<00:02:44.420> so

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
Premiere does not support that codec so

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.370 
Premiere does not support that codec so
I<00:02:45.550> tried<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.670> pull<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.300> nothing<00:02:48.080> was

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
I tried to pull it in and nothing was

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.040 
I tried to pull it in and nothing was
there<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.460> thought<00:02:50.210> I<00:02:50.240> was<00:02:50.420> all<00:02:50.540> set<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.780> go

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050

vegas now this is another tip I want to
tell<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.560> if<00:03:03.710> you're<00:03:04.220> if<00:03:04.460> you're<00:03:04.670> looking

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
tell you is if you're if you're looking

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.170 
tell you is if you're if you're looking
at<00:03:05.090> Sony<00:03:05.360> Vegas<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.370> you're<00:03:07.370> using<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.880> camera

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
at Sony Vegas and you're using a camera

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.220 
at Sony Vegas and you're using a camera
that<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.140> sony<00:03:09.560> camera<00:03:10.070> or<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:11.480> panasonic

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
that is not a sony camera or a panasonic

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.560 
that is not a sony camera or a panasonic
i<00:03:12.350> think<00:03:12.710> sony<00:03:13.010> vegas<00:03:13.460> supports<00:03:13.880> panasonic

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
i think sony vegas supports panasonic

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.840 
i think sony vegas supports panasonic
products<00:03:15.910> they<00:03:16.910> don't<00:03:17.150> support<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.850> AVCHD

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
products they don't support the AVCHD

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.750 
products they don't support the AVCHD
file<00:03:20.480> format<00:03:21.020> of<00:03:21.200> other<00:03:21.440> cameras<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.160> my<00:03:22.310> canon

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
file format of other cameras so my canon

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.610 
file format of other cameras so my canon
it<00:03:22.880> says<00:03:23.450> they<00:03:23.690> support<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.090> vc<00:03:26.090> HD

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
it says they support the this a vc HD

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.290 
it says they support the this a vc HD
codec<00:03:27.620> but<00:03:27.860> they<00:03:27.980> don't<00:03:28.190> support<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:29.090> type

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
codec but they don't support the type

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.230 
codec but they don't support the type
that<00:03:29.540> cannon<00:03:30.070> produces<00:03:31.070> so<00:03:31.400> they<00:03:31.700> they<00:03:32.030> only

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
that cannon produces so they they only

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.740 
that cannon produces so they they only
support<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.440> Sony<00:03:33.740> version<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.460> that

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
support this the Sony version of that

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.180 
support this the Sony version of that
codec<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.020> you<00:03:36.080> have<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.440> be<00:03:36.470> very<00:03:36.620> aware<00:03:36.890> of

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
codec so you have to be very aware of

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.730 
codec so you have to be very aware of
what<00:03:37.370> kind<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.850> raw<00:03:38.780> video<00:03:39.200> footage<00:03:39.440> your

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
what kind of raw video footage your

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.010 
what kind of raw video footage your
camera<00:03:40.160> creates<00:03:40.400> in<00:03:40.760> your<00:03:40.910> video<00:03:41.240> software

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
camera creates in your video software

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.080 
camera creates in your video software
editing<00:03:42.680> program<00:03:43.070> has<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.400> be<00:03:43.490> able<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.760> handle

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
editing program has to be able to handle

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.050 
editing program has to be able to handle
that<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.890> that's<00:03:46.100> kind<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.430> where<00:03:46.760> I'm<00:03:46.880> at<00:03:47.000> now

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
that so that's kind of where I'm at now

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.570 
that so that's kind of where I'm at now
and<00:03:47.570> I'm<00:03:48.080> getting<00:03:48.710> better<00:03:48.830> with<00:03:49.070> Pinnacle
