welcome<00:00:00.930> back<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.500> part<00:00:01.800> two<00:00:02.010> of<00:00:02.040> the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
welcome back this is part two of the

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.120 
welcome back this is part two of the
breakout<00:00:03.300> tutorial<00:00:04.020> using<00:00:04.380> construct<00:00:04.950> two

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
breakout tutorial using construct two

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.849 
breakout tutorial using construct two
alright<00:00:06.000> last<00:00:06.270> time<00:00:06.480> we<00:00:06.600> set<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:06.930> up<00:00:06.990> don't

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
alright last time we set this up don't

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.290 
alright last time we set this up don't
really<00:00:08.099> need<00:00:08.220> these<00:00:08.400> white<00:00:08.639> bricks<00:00:08.910> here<00:00:09.090> so

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
really need these white bricks here so

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.759 
really need these white bricks here so
first<00:00:09.540> I'll<00:00:09.660> get<00:00:09.750> rid<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.960> them<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.650> don't

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
first I'll get rid of them so don't

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.620 
first I'll get rid of them so don't
overlap<00:00:11.190> now<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> great<00:00:12.389> things

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
overlap now one of the great things

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.600 
overlap now one of the great things
about<00:00:12.750> construct<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:14.219> can<00:00:14.400> add

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
about construct is you can add

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.460 
about construct is you can add
pre-programmed<00:00:15.450> behaviors<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.139> send<00:00:16.350> you

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
pre-programmed behaviors to send you

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.800 
pre-programmed behaviors to send you
some<00:00:16.650> time<00:00:16.859> encoding<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:18.150> instance<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
some time encoding for instance the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.320 
some time encoding for instance the
walls<00:00:19.020> I'm<00:00:20.010> going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> right<00:00:20.430> click<00:00:20.460> go<00:00:20.850> down

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
walls I'm going to right click go down

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.599 
walls I'm going to right click go down
to<00:00:21.510> behaviors<00:00:21.960> I'm<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.980> add<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> solid

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
to behaviors I'm going to add a solid

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.170 
to behaviors I'm going to add a solid
behavior<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> walls<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.619> solid<00:00:26.180> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
behavior because the walls are solid the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.370 
behavior because the walls are solid the
ball<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> add<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> couple<00:00:28.260> of

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
ball I'm going to add a couple of

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.099 
ball I'm going to add a couple of
behaviors<00:00:28.800> as<00:00:29.010> well<00:00:29.269> balls<00:00:30.269> will<00:00:30.510> also<00:00:30.810> act

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
behaviors as well balls will also act

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.290 
behaviors as well balls will also act
like<00:00:31.230> solids<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.579> balls<00:00:32.759> will<00:00:32.969> also

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
like solids but the balls will also

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.750 
like solids but the balls will also
travel<00:00:33.690> under<00:00:34.260> their<00:00:34.410> own<00:00:34.440> velocity<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.700> I'm

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
travel under their own velocity so I'm

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.340 
travel under their own velocity so I'm
going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.030> add<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.980> bullet<00:00:37.980> behavior<00:00:39.350> bricks

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
going to add a bullet behavior bricks

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.720 
going to add a bullet behavior bricks
are<00:00:40.500> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.739> interesting<00:00:41.219> I'm<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.640> add

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
are kind of interesting I'm going to add

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.790 
are kind of interesting I'm going to add
a<00:00:41.760> couple<00:00:41.969> behaviors<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> them<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:42.899> well<00:00:43.050> they

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
a couple behaviors to them as well they

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.760 
a couple behaviors to them as well they
also<00:00:43.920> act<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.370> solids<00:00:44.850> however<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.110> want<00:00:46.649> them

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
also act as solids however I want them

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.560 
also act as solids however I want them
to<00:00:46.890> disappear<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> cool<00:00:47.910> way<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.180> I'm<00:00:48.420> going

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
to disappear in a cool way so I'm going

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.799 
to disappear in a cool way so I'm going
to<00:00:48.629> add<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> fade<00:00:49.200> behavior<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:49.800> well

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
to add the fade behavior as well

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.330 
to add the fade behavior as well
now<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> paddle<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.530> could<00:00:52.770> treat<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
now the paddle I could treat that like a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
now the paddle I could treat that like a
solid<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:53.910> well<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.660> some<00:00:54.840> more

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
solid as well but I want some more

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
solid as well but I want some more
custom<00:00:55.289> ability<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.190> will<00:00:56.370> play<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
custom ability so I will play with that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900 
custom ability so I will play with that
later<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> event<00:00:57.960> sheet<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.910> down

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
later in the event sheet I'm going down

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.360 
later in the event sheet I'm going down
to<00:01:00.090> ball<00:01:00.300> 400<00:01:01.199> pixels<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.859> second<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> little

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to ball 400 pixels a second is a little

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.609 
to ball 400 pixels a second is a little
bit<00:01:02.579> too<00:01:02.699> quick<00:01:02.969> I'll<00:01:03.210> set<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> 200<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
bit too quick I'll set that to 200 I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.370 
bit too quick I'll set that to 200 I
want<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> ball<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.580> fall<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> little<00:01:06.659> bit<00:01:07.049> under

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
want the ball to fall a little bit under

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
want the ball to fall a little bit under
its<00:01:07.500> own<00:01:07.590> gravity<00:01:07.650> I'll<00:01:08.640> set<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.180> 3

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
its own gravity I'll set that to 3

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.170 
its own gravity I'll set that to 3
pixels<00:01:09.810> per<00:01:10.020> second<00:01:10.350> per<00:01:10.439> second<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.729> do

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
pixels per second per second but I do

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.230 
pixels per second per second but I do
want<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> bounce<00:01:13.140> off<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> solids<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> I'll

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
want it to bounce off of solids so I'll

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.649 
want it to bounce off of solids so I'll
change<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> yes

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
change that to yes

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.480 
change that to yes
now<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> bricks<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.409> don't<00:01:19.890> want<00:01:20.009> them<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.280> fade

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
now the bricks I don't want them to fade

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
now the bricks I don't want them to fade
right<00:01:20.700> away<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.030> I'll<00:01:21.330> switch<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> no<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
right away so I'll switch that to no I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.010 
right away so I'll switch that to no I
want<00:01:23.159> them<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.280> fade<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.580> away<00:01:24.000> quickly<00:01:24.869> when

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
want them to fade out away quickly when

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.070 
want them to fade out away quickly when
they<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.500> I'll<00:01:25.590> set<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.950> fade<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.520> time

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
they do so I'll set that fade out time

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.420 
they do so I'll set that fade out time
to<00:01:28.080> half<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> second<00:01:30.409> now<00:01:31.409> under<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> event

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
to half a second now under the event

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.460 
to half a second now under the event
sheet<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.880> don't<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.170> much<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
sheet I don't really have much to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.039 
sheet I don't really have much to
interact<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.890> yet<00:01:35.130> I'll<00:01:35.369> do<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.700> more<00:01:35.729> thing

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
interact with yet I'll do one more thing

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.990 
interact with yet I'll do one more thing
right-click<00:01:37.049> insert<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> new<00:01:37.740> object<00:01:38.009> going<00:01:38.909> to

right-click insert a new object going to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.420 
right-click insert a new object going to
insert<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.630> mouse<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.770> means<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.189> will<00:01:41.250> let

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
insert the mouse which means it will let

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.120 
insert the mouse which means it will let
me<00:01:41.479> interact<00:01:42.479> with<00:01:42.750> my<00:01:42.960> mouse<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:44.009> now

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
cause it to fade away next when the ball

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.310 
cause it to fade away next when the ball
interacts<00:02:54.360> with<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> paddle<00:02:54.959> when<00:02:55.140> you're

all<00:04:03.030> right<00:04:03.269> so<00:04:03.840> anything<00:04:04.080> else<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.290> need<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.530> do

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
all right so anything else I need to do

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.210 
all right so anything else I need to do
let's<00:04:04.980> test<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:09.239> look<00:04:09.420> at<00:04:09.540> that

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
let's test and look at that

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.560 
let's test and look at that
so<00:04:12.220> notice<00:04:12.610> if<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.880> hit<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.180> ball<00:04:13.330> on<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.540> left

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
so notice if I hit the ball on the left

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.780 
so notice if I hit the ball on the left
side<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.140> paddle<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.620> has<00:04:14.770> a<00:04:14.800> very<00:04:15.160> left

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
side of the paddle it has a very left

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.910 
side of the paddle it has a very left
angle<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.330> hit<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.840> in<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.019> middle<00:04:17.080> it<00:04:17.470> goes<00:04:17.620> up

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
angle I hit it in the middle it goes up

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.330 
angle I hit it in the middle it goes up
hit<00:04:18.670> it<00:04:18.760> in<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:18.910> right<00:04:19.030> goes<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.959> right<00:04:20.340> so

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
hit it in the right goes to the right so

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.070 
hit it in the right goes to the right so
now<00:04:21.489> our<00:04:21.519> breakout<00:04:22.030> game<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.390> interactive

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
now our breakout game is interactive

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.710 
now our breakout game is interactive
that's<00:04:23.260> fantastic<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:25.120> part<00:04:25.390> of<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.510> fun<00:04:25.690> of

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
that's fantastic but part of the fun of

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.220 
that's fantastic but part of the fun of
breakout<00:04:26.170> is<00:04:26.320> adding<00:04:26.620> things<00:04:26.830> like<00:04:26.980> power-ups

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
breakout is adding things like power-ups

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.280 
breakout is adding things like power-ups
so<00:04:29.230> we'll<00:04:29.710> do<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:30.040> next
