electrical<00:03:04.660> tape<00:03:04.870> because<00:03:05.379> it<00:03:05.500> gives<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.830> a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
electrical tape because it gives it a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.160 
electrical tape because it gives it a
much<00:03:06.069> better<00:03:06.340> look

for<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> shooting<00:03:14.920> part<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.430> need<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.760> make

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
for the shooting part you need to make

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.780 
for the shooting part you need to make
those<00:03:16.510> two<00:03:16.810> pair<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.170> pieces<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:18.250> trigger<00:03:18.519> and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
those two pair of pieces the trigger and

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.449 
those two pair of pieces the trigger and
the<00:03:19.180> trigger<00:03:19.209> roll

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
the trigger roll

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.580 
the trigger roll
so<00:03:21.459> take<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.150> remaining<00:03:22.510> paper<00:03:22.720> roll<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.230> cut

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
so take the remaining paper roll and cut

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.330 
so take the remaining paper roll and cut
it<00:03:23.709> into<00:03:23.860> three<00:03:24.190> pieces<00:03:24.400> like<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:29.280> glue<00:03:30.280> the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
it into three pieces like this glue the

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.220 
it into three pieces like this glue the
bottom<00:03:30.610> of<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.000> barrel<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.480> stick<00:03:32.079> the

bottom of the barrel and stick the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.690 
bottom of the barrel and stick the
biggest<00:03:32.560> piece<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:32.920> roll<00:03:33.099> on<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:35.430> then<00:03:36.430> take

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
biggest piece of roll on it then take

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.550 
biggest piece of roll on it then take
the<00:03:36.879> smallest<00:03:37.000> piece<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.659> roll<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.140> fold<00:03:38.379> it

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
the smallest piece of roll and fold it

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.339 
the smallest piece of roll and fold it
reversely<00:03:38.709> like<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.690> then<00:03:40.690> glued<00:03:40.959> at<00:03:41.230> the

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
reversely like this then glued at the

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:49.229 
reversely like this then glued at the
front<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.860> bow<00:03:47.700> take<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.879> remaining

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
front of the bow take the remaining

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.270 
front of the bow take the remaining
piece<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.750> also<00:03:49.930> fold<00:03:50.349> it<00:03:50.470> reversely<00:03:50.620> like

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
piece and also fold it reversely like

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.339 
piece and also fold it reversely like
this<00:03:53.760> then<00:03:54.760> make<00:03:55.000> an<00:03:55.209> angle<00:03:55.540> cut<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.170> top

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
this then make an angle cut on the top

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.020 
this then make an angle cut on the top

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
put it around the trigger then just take

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.759 
put it around the trigger then just take
the<00:04:04.269> program<00:04:04.450> between<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:05.079> rolls<00:04:05.290> until<00:04:05.709> it

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
the program between the rolls until it

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.150 
the program between the rolls until it
gets<00:04:05.980> from<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.220> other<00:04:06.430> side

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.430 

make<00:04:11.820> another<00:04:12.060> piece<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.600> roll<00:04:12.780> unfold<00:04:13.290> it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
make another piece of roll unfold it

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.170 
make another piece of roll unfold it
like<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:18.739> then<00:04:19.739> put<00:04:20.160> some<00:04:20.340> hot<00:04:20.520> glue<00:04:20.730> to<00:04:21.060> hold

in<00:04:30.780> front<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.170> it<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:31.440> prevent<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.920> from

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
in front of it to prevent it from

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.950 
in front of it to prevent it from
slipping

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.570

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
the rubber band will be released I hope
