00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.750
 I'm an engineer, Roberto. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.459
 oak junior author of books and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.320
 drug installations the project 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.760
 architecture electrical installations o 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 architectural design 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080
 both edited by the witch publisher here 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.179
 of São Paulo and no contest 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.160
 to administer the course of pathology without 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.109
 hydraulic systems and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.040
 toilets and today I'm going to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.680
 information about this course during 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.020
 30 years of acting as he prophesied 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.900
 building installations could see 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.150
 various causes of endogenous pathologies 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.210
 in building systems and sanitary drugs 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.330
 originated by inherent factors 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.630
 to the building itself, such as 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.170
 design failures quality of the 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.330
 materials and use of facilities 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.880
 constructive failures they are very 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.310
 are as old as the 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.810
 old man-made buildings 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.900
 through the time 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.840
 a classic example of constructive failure 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.109
 is the steeple tower in the dental city that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.700
 today it has become a tourist reference 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:17.100
 the occurrence of pathologies in the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.979
 buildings, it implies costs 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.840
 additional legal actions loss of 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.840
 confidence in the company responsible for 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.350
 construction and many other things 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.600
 to get an idea 5 percent of the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.479
 The total cost of the work is the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.130
 companies spend on repairs to works 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.520
 delivered to customers 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.979
 according to sinduscon são paulo 75 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.479
 percent of construction pathologies 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.749
 are due to problems 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.649
 related to building installations 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.139
 hydraulic locks 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.789
 this usually happens because you never 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:53.280
 much importance was attached to the facilities 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.459
 and difficult because they are 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.920
 are hidden or are therefore hidden . 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.240
 very common is the execution of works without 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.609
 hydrological project 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.889
 Furthermore in the search for another 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.289
 that using materials 

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:09.479
 inadequate and of inferior quality and 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.790
 a rich performing improvisations and 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.730
 gambiarras due to lack of project 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.380
 low qualification of the workforce 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.780
 compromising 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.970
 the final quality of the work by these 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.130
 reasons the professionals of the area have to 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.050
 know the causes of these 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.180
 problems that appear during the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.670
 execution of the work or during the use of 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.860
 building after the completed work is 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.960
 It is important to note that the study of 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.360
 frequent pathologies in 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.660
 and lethal drugs does not require 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.480
 only in collective action but also in 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.430
 in the possibility of preventive action 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.380
 especially when they are caused by 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.200
 of failures in the production process of 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.820
 respective engineering projects 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.160
 however, the frequency of these 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.470
 pathologies in drug building systems 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.690
 toilets have been little 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.400
 world-wide research and 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.680
 private in brazil 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.340
 this perhaps for demanding long periods 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.920
 observation resources vultuosos trials 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.500
 simulations and tests, or 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.080
 destructive real-scale buildings 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.910
 existing 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.710
 the course of pathology without systems 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.360
 buildings and sanitary drugs was 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.630
 developed for the purpose of 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.130
 introduce the engineer architect 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.720
 builders of all types of 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.960
 professionals involved in construction 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.390
 a more didactic conceptual vision 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.760
 simplified practice of key 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.430
 pathologies that occur in the sub systems 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.920
 the hydraulic installations on the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.410
 course it addresses the main defects of 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.210
 project and the main pathologies that 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.830
 occur in cold water installations and 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.830
 hot sewage and rainwater 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.720
 such as performance failures quality 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.730
 the use of materials 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.440
 installations and other 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.940
 the guard then you in the course of 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.800
 pathology without building systems 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.900
 hydraulic and sanitary
