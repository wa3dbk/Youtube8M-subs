00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello here's how to make a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.350
 delicious lime sauce for 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.660
 start you need the juice of a half 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:17.609
 Clementine then 10 g of fine sugar 100 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.430
 milliliters of lime juice a 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.189
 tablespoon of liquid honey as well 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.779
 than a teaspoon of clove 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.410
 vanilla in a pan I start 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:44.280
 by putting the fine sugar and the juice of 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:46.739
 lime then I add the juice of a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.219
 half clementine it is she who will 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.020
 soften our sauce that will also 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.020
 give a nice little color 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.160
 he 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.210
 now I add my little seeds 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:14.070
 of vanilla so they will bring a 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:19.940
 great taste to my lime sauce and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.940
 to finish a tablespoon of honey 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.030
 it only remains for me to heat the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.220
 all over low heat for 5 minutes 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.000
 I mix from time to time with a 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.000
 wooden spoon 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.360
 after five minutes 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.410
 my sauce starts to thicken thanks to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.430
 sweet with honey 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:54.950
 I will be able to cut my gas reserved 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.950
 in a small ramekin and let cool 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.540
 and once your sauce is attiedis it 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.910
 there is more she tasted I you the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.119
 strongly recommend with a cake or 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.840
 lemon pie but it will be accompanied by 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.340
 also with all your fruity desserts 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.320
 a source that I recommend because 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.190
 it is delicious and very simple to 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.880
 achieve 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.950
 the vanilla lime mix is 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.950
