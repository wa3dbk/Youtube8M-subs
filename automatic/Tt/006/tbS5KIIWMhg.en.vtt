00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
rise of Kanye West because of the little

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.369

West produced every track and this is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.359 
West produced every track and this is
where<00:01:03.960> everybody<00:01:04.290> first<00:01:04.769> became<00:01:05.129> familiar

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
where everybody first became familiar

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
where everybody first became familiar
with<00:01:05.610> him<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> rapper<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:07.170> thing<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
with him as a rapper and one thing that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.380 
with him as a rapper and one thing that
is<00:01:07.890> really<00:01:07.920> interesting<00:01:08.340> about<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.150> album

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
is really interesting about this album

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
is really interesting about this album
is<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.350> close<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:11.070> happening<00:01:11.610> at

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
is that it was close to not happening at

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
is that it was close to not happening at
all<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.479> no<00:01:12.720> label<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.200> wanted<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> take<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
all because no label is wanted to take a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.070 
all because no label is wanted to take a
chance<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.340> Kanye<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> rapper<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.869> all

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
chance on Kanye as a rapper they all

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.840 
chance on Kanye as a rapper they all
thought<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.470> Kanye<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.520> better<00:01:17.759> off

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
thought that Kanye was just better off

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.749 
thought that Kanye was just better off
as<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> producer<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.350> eventually<00:01:19.680> Dame<00:01:20.460> Dash

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
as a producer but eventually Dame Dash

as a producer but eventually Dame Dash

Ludacris<00:04:46.000> on<00:04:46.180> breathe<00:04:46.509> in<00:04:46.810> breathe<00:04:47.349> out

Ludacris on breathe in breathe out

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.010 
Ludacris on breathe in breathe out
because<00:04:48.130> all<00:04:48.400> he<00:04:48.580> did<00:04:48.789> was<00:04:48.819> the<00:04:49.120> hook<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.599> I've

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
because all he did was the hook and I've

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.659 
because all he did was the hook and I've
always<00:04:50.259> wondered<00:04:50.560> about<00:04:50.770> that<00:04:50.919> because<00:04:51.550> at

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
always wondered about that because at

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.189 
always wondered about that because at
the<00:04:51.789> time<00:04:52.000> this<00:04:52.270> album<00:04:52.660> came<00:04:52.840> out

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
the time this album came out

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.710 
the time this album came out
Ludacris<00:04:53.770> was<00:04:53.979> absolutely<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.729> fire<00:04:54.759> so<00:04:55.690> I

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
Ludacris was absolutely on fire so I

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.570 
Ludacris was absolutely on fire so I
don't<00:04:55.960> get<00:04:56.139> why<00:04:56.289> Kanye<00:04:56.710> West<00:04:56.949> didn't<00:04:57.430> get<00:04:57.550> a

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
don't get why Kanye West didn't get a

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.460 
don't get why Kanye West didn't get a
verse<00:04:57.880> from<00:04:58.090> him<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.449> guess<00:04:58.810> maybe<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.259> wasn't

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
verse from him I guess maybe it wasn't

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.469 
verse from him I guess maybe it wasn't
in<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.770> album's<00:05:00.130> budget<00:05:00.610> or<00:05:00.819> maybe<00:05:01.060> he<00:05:01.449> just

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
in the album's budget or maybe he just

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.120 
in the album's budget or maybe he just
didn't<00:05:01.810> want<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.050> get<00:05:02.139> eaten<00:05:02.349> alive<00:05:02.470> by<00:05:02.710> loot

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
didn't want to get eaten alive by loot

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.460 
didn't want to get eaten alive by loot
on<00:05:03.280> his<00:05:03.460> own<00:05:03.580> track<00:05:03.909> whatever<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:05.020> case<00:05:05.229> a

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
on his own track whatever the case a

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.260 
on his own track whatever the case a
Ludacris<00:05:06.069> verse<00:05:06.340> would<00:05:06.610> have<00:05:06.699> really<00:05:06.970> helped

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
Ludacris verse would have really helped

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.939 
Ludacris verse would have really helped
the<00:05:07.389> song<00:05:07.630> out<00:05:07.900> because<00:05:08.319> I<00:05:08.409> think<00:05:08.650> it<00:05:08.740> was<00:05:08.830> one

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
the song out because I think it was one

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.680 
the song out because I think it was one
of<00:05:09.069> the<00:05:09.159> more<00:05:09.280> dull<00:05:09.610> moments<00:05:10.090> on<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.330> album

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.870 
of the more dull moments on the album
and<00:05:10.870> I<00:05:11.080> usually<00:05:11.470> skip<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:11.949> but<00:05:12.490> one<00:05:12.669> of<00:05:12.699> the

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
and I usually skip it but one of the
