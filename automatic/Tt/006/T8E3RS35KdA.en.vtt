00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.700
It's a lifestyle, a feeling that cannot be
described, you need to try it.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.040
Preparation, performance, pushing the physical
boundaries, the love of the fans, the results

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.020
â€“ I think, it's a very good package.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.849
I've been racing for 20 years, practically
it has become my life.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's a sensational feeling to drive a rally
car, as the car goes through, and the limits it has...

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.380
It's difficult to put into words,
you have to try it to feel its real worth.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.830
I was very young when I was caught by this,
and since then I want to do it at all costs.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.950
Actually this is my hobby, I love to do it.
It turns you off, develops your skills and your concentration.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.750
I think that when you
find your hobby, you try to live for that.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.550
When you're there and puts on the helmet,
the adrenaline goes up, so you try to cool

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.029
down yourself, and be calm. The routine helps
a lot in that.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.950
To race on a closed circuit with such a creaking,
crackling car to the voice of your navigator..

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.169
It's an unutterable good feeling.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.000
The hardest job is the processing, the training
and the prescribing of the track,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.500
you can develop a lot in that. It takes a lot of time,
but the rally is different than motor racing.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.541
Well, this is very complex, there are many
things you need. In fact, you need a good

00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:59.541
service team in the first place, a good car,
and a lot of money, and then comes the driver

00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:01.531
and all the other things.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.000
The service team is the most important element,
we, the drivers just put the dot on the i.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.581
If we don't have a good car and a perfect
service team, it's not worth anything.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.500
You need a lot of experience, and a little
bit of talent, which I think almost everybody

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.031
has here; you need to be persistent, and drive
very-very lot.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:54.800
The driving of these cars demands cruel concentration,
even a small mistake can lead to a fatal accident.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.010
You have to be prepared not only in brain,
but physically and in every other aspect,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.010
because if you're not perfectly prepared,
you get tired, your brain gets tired too,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.540
and your race completely falls apart.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.300
Similarly to motor racing, I completely turn
off, and try to focus only on my job.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:28.029
It's unbelievable what these cars are capable of,
they rag, spin, drag, go through everything.

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:29.210
It's amazing to drive them.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.800
These cars have such speed that you can do
all these things only with maximum concentration.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:47.000
We try to distract the outside world. Thank
God, we have a professional team, which can solve this,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.040
they take off the burden, so the
racing is only about us,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.291
and when we sit there in the car, we can give our best.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.000
There are always youngsters coming in and
try to beat us. We're getting older and

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.229
we have a big advantage, our experience, but
when it's dark, and you can't see clearly,

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:23.090
you have to take on things that are sometimes
incompatible with life.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.980
Racing between the trees at night, in rain is not as much fun.
They still enjoy it, but we're not.
