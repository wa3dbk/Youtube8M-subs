New<00:01:46.380> Castle<00:01:46.740> high<00:01:46.860> school<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> great

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
New Castle high school so a great

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.719 
New Castle high school so a great
commonality<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.890> great<00:01:50.070> sense<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.460> purpose

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
commonality and a great sense of purpose

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.630 
commonality and a great sense of purpose
between<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> two<00:01:51.899> schools<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:53.310> what's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
between the two schools I think what's

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.209 
between the two schools I think what's
really<00:01:53.790> exciting<00:01:54.149> about<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.290> opportunity<00:01:55.979> is

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
really exciting about the opportunity is

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.550 
really exciting about the opportunity is
that<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.060> been<00:01:57.210> able<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> both

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that we have been able to take the both

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.730 
that we have been able to take the both
the<00:01:58.829> best<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.759> each<00:01:59.909> school<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.570> very<00:02:01.500> much

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the best from each school and very much

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.130 
the best from each school and very much
to<00:02:02.100> look<00:02:02.280> at<00:02:02.460> how<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.869> create

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
to look at how we can we can create

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.740 
to look at how we can we can create
something<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.710> completely<00:02:05.070> different<00:02:05.750> so

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
something that's completely different so

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.510 
something that's completely different so
both<00:02:07.469> heads<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.950> been<00:02:08.069> working<00:02:08.489> very

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
both heads have been working very

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.820 
both heads have been working very
closely<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.390> our<00:02:09.569> director<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.349> innovation

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
closely with our director of innovation

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.430 
closely with our director of innovation
and<00:02:10.979> learning

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
and learning

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.500 
and learning
to<00:02:11.800> come<00:02:11.980> up<00:02:12.130> with<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> new<00:02:12.610> curriculum<00:02:13.000> that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
to come up with a new curriculum that

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.480 
to come up with a new curriculum that
really<00:02:13.990> offers<00:02:14.380> girls<00:02:14.650> something<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.310> bit

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
really offers girls something a bit

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.190 
really offers girls something a bit
different<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:16.210> something<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.990> bit<00:02:17.140> special

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
different and something a bit special

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.500 
different and something a bit special
this<00:02:18.160> will<00:02:18.340> be<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.490> different<00:02:18.820> way<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.150> learning

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
this will be a different way of learning

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.500 
this will be a different way of learning
in<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.080> very<00:02:20.440> stimulating<00:02:21.510> educational

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
in a very stimulating educational

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.420 
in a very stimulating educational
environment<00:02:23.170> we're<00:02:23.680> really<00:02:23.860> trying<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.220> find

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
environment we're really trying to find

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.310 
environment we're really trying to find
something<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.730> stood<00:02:25.240> out<00:02:25.390> from<00:02:25.720> from<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
something that stood out from from the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.380 
something that stood out from from the
crowd<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.130> went<00:02:27.280> through<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.640> process<00:02:27.850> as

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
crowd so we went through the process as

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.720 
crowd so we went through the process as
we<00:02:28.510> do<00:02:28.630> as<00:02:28.720> an<00:02:28.840> agency<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.460> looking<00:02:30.460> around

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
we do as an agency of looking around

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.060 
we do as an agency of looking around
doing<00:02:31.600> out<00:02:31.720> doing<00:02:32.020> our<00:02:32.140> research<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.860> one

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
doing out doing our research and one

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.790 
doing out doing our research and one
thing<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.340> came<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.850> our<00:02:33.880> mind<00:02:33.970> was<00:02:34.770> sort<00:02:35.770> of

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
thing that came to our mind was sort of

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.500 
thing that came to our mind was sort of
City<00:02:36.010> kress<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.820> city<00:02:37.000> crestor<00:02:37.390> was

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
City kress so the city crestor was

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.770 
City kress so the city crestor was
formed<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.670> 1554<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:40.240> spend<00:02:40.480> some<00:02:40.600> time

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
formed in 1554 to spend some time

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.630 
formed in 1554 to spend some time
exploring<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.530> crest<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.070> actually<00:02:42.400> taking

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
exploring the crest and actually taking

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640 
exploring the crest and actually taking
pieces<00:02:43.150> from<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.110> there<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.620> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
pieces from that and there is the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.560 
pieces from that and there is the
mythical<00:02:45.160> sea<00:02:45.340> horse<00:02:45.550> within<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:45.970> crest<00:02:46.330> so

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
mythical sea horse within that crest so

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.850 
mythical sea horse within that crest so
we<00:02:47.100> extracted<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.430> from<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.410> crest<00:02:50.680> and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
we extracted that from the crest and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.500 
we extracted that from the crest and
actually<00:02:51.250> went<00:02:51.460> to<00:02:51.550> work<00:02:51.790> on<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.210> we<00:02:52.390> just

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
actually went to work on that we just

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.110 
actually went to work on that we just
felt<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.980> hit<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.400> mark<00:02:54.640> in<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.880> sense

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
felt it it it hit the mark in a sense

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.090 
felt it it it hit the mark in a sense
that<00:02:55.270> there<00:02:55.930> was<00:02:56.020> a<00:02:56.050> certain<00:02:56.320> amount<00:02:56.650> or<00:02:56.920> sort

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
that there was a certain amount or sort

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.250 
that there was a certain amount or sort
of<00:02:57.160> femininity<00:02:57.550> about<00:02:58.240> it<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.690> wasn't<00:02:58.930> too

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
of femininity about it it wasn't too

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.310 
of femininity about it it wasn't too
cutesy<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.830> girly<00:03:00.570> could<00:03:01.570> operate<00:03:01.990> on<00:03:02.200> its

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
cutesy and girly could operate on its

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.230 
cutesy and girly could operate on its
own<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.890> was<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:03.340> was<00:03:03.490> smooth<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.120> was

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
own it was it was smooth and it was

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.320 
own it was it was smooth and it was
quite<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.750> proud<00:03:05.230> symbol<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.940> actually

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
quite a proud symbol that actually

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.180 
quite a proud symbol that actually
resonated<00:03:07.870> with<00:03:08.050> everything<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.740> girls
