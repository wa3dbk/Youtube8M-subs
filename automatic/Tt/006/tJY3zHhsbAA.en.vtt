00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.480
 until here careful alliance that has 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.480
 guillermo guizasola center is hot 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.029
 ah 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.430
 continued 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.199
 there is a mental quickness to take the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.800
 short ball that change of pace that 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.960
 does my actions good and in gesture 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.480
 technical we were asking for goals not 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.750
 He had only two head seems 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.350
 the two and here is a strong change them the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.070
 very good trajectory 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.170
 Excellent excellent handling of 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.170
 nod in that aspect 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 technical fundamentals really not 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.310
 excellent the goal the center especially 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.200
 precise 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.110
 It is just left then if the goal is concrete 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.119
 it did not seem to me that the alliance could 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.679
 to have scored a goal because he was playing a 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.049
 little mess wanted Juan Carlos 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.000
 Mariño solves with said appearance and 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.009
 now sergio be for the wilmer fox 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.689
 aguirre arranca wilmer aguirre the search 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.140
 alliance with aguirre take aguirre tops 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.140
 come here 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.659
 annual kickback is always good 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.590
 have to live for the backlash came 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.590
 good israel khan 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.050
 then to 0 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.690
 feature of the game of that look 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.730
 there are two of line four and two and 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.270
 alliance and three at this time and that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.310
 fox's speed is deadly I do not know 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.010
 if you want to kick you want to enter the topic 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.080
 that the counter is perfect and every 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.470
 accompanies that what is important in a flyer 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.200
 exact and I had just said jose 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.690
 and you are presented with a list of cons 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.030
 exactly one after another the previous 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.160
 that was the fox's own auction and a 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.440
 counterattack with the run of it 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.580
 but now I think this time 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.540
 He said 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.540
 I do not know if the center 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.330
 in the center of can care closed 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.650
 have 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.780
 have to mark that god yang so that 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.920
 be the 9 of alliance it seems that it is god 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.500
 yang 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.800
 9 of alliance in the Armenian area 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.620
 kill allies goals and fell alliance lover 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.220
 in the elías aguirre alliance 3 aurich ero 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.280
 a disorder taken advantage of by a 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.709
 number 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.480
 because the mess there is doubt look 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.730
 Valbuena like that thinks that the archer 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.190
 will come out is lack of coordination of 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.920
 communication the second goal makes a 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.600
 break point for the alliance and this 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.030
 9 is where it has to be and has done 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.950
 everyone today has said 2 the 4 goals of 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.940
 head must be required to follow 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.220
 making goals 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.080
 alliance is scoring I do not know if the 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.530
 very good strategy in this second 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.290
 weather 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.959
 that is, alliance started waiting 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.329
 conversely Juan Aurich started 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.359
 pressing in the opposite field but 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:13.209
 that tells us that the facilities 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:17.760
 you put them coming walter ibáñez roberto 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:20.070
 merino to take the photo guisasola 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.720
 and all other 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.150
 this coming 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.420
 forwards the aurich center care 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.420
 true 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.930
 three years 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.770
 chiclayano 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.700
 sancio did not give the goal to aurich diego 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.990
 haro alliance lima 3 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.910
 Juan Aurich 15 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.600
 but the buffalo roberto silvera appeared 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.750
 the goal of the aurich is to ovelar 3 alliance 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.050
 and aurich 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.050
 the boat
