00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.610
 I have a serious problem urgently needed 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.540
 something to eat you just look 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.700
 how lovely 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.550
 same steak free in the middle of the forest 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.740
 need to eat sure to eat yes 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.720
 no, well, are you kidding me 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.449
 and so everything is empty hello my dear 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.269
 friends with you i'm rick paw and this is ours 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.340
 review of the fashion model in this series 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.390
 I'll show you a mod that adds items. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.370
 trolling 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.879
 Now you can mock your 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.590
 friends they undermine poison shorter 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.480
 mock black 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.690
 let's consider these items which 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.719
 add this mod first item 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.199
 we will have a workbench an unusual workbench 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.379
 crafted it so red dust dynamite and 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.140
 in the center are ordinary ordinary workbench 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.050
 Well, immediately this oven is fast 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.990
 the same craft only stove in the center 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.000
 so so and let's test bench 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 unusual workbench we put it 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.970
 looks like normal but this workbench 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.659
 there is an interesting feature 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.170
 when you come up to him and try 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.490
 open it with the right mouse button like this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.500
 nothing happens just now will 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.650
 explosion 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.210
 yes so what if you suddenly 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.229
 met somewhere in the center 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.630
 ordinary wood workbench immediately speak better 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.439
 not fit because you can 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.299
 get dynamite they're a workbench that's an oath 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.119
 microphone and nothing happens something 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.549
 It is why he is not doing anything right now 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.189
 will now be really simple such 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.579
 here's a blast check ok 'out 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.600
 we choose the next item is with us 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.430
 oven is the same situation as with the workbench 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.000
 came up with an oath nothing happens to me 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.679
 immediately unwound because it would 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.230
 explosion and it will hurt you anyway 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.750
 so we get out we get out 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.530
 how does it work need to put here 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.930
 here so activate and see throw 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.680
 just shades appear 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:29.090
 from the bottom of this workbench so nicely 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.370
 Well life is ladnenko need careful 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.480
 we drop it and let's look at 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.600
 the following subjects the next subject and 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.260
 detonator 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.260
 and unusual bib really unusual 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.860
 crafting it so iron bar dynamite 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.300
 and the usual iron bib in the center 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.450
 next is the detonator 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.570
 iron bar gold bar block 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.310
 red stone what does she do we 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.350
 we put on just like an iron bib 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.970
 but only behind here are such colored 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.700
 squares are like wiring in front 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.019
 like an ordinary iron bib nothing 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.450
 distinguish now we take a detonator for example 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.540
 there are such situations that you are somewhere in 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.180
 the crowd and already like there is no point in fighting 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.709
 next you just quickly take this one 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.480
 right detonator and 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.209
 happens with a scarlet such an explosion 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.870
 believe everyone scatters unequivocally 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:37.579
 let's be reborn and see yes 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.930
 not bad 1 stove some bib 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.950
 who can really scatter everyone 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.579
 let's take a good look at 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.670
 the following items are we yes yes 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:52.100
 unusual food that can very cool 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.250
 harm almost anyone 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.180
 Well, another cheating subject 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.360
 emerald but not the usual emerald this 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.880
 Emerald can not be crafted and generally can not be 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.190
 there is such a cheat thing which 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.530
 present and good not 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.170
 to craft and how does it work for 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.770
 start we need to somehow harm ourselves 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.579
 zombies will switch the view for what zombies 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.299
 now we will see 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.669
 you need to beat us like that 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.340
 here so super super well come on come on 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.310
 beat in-in super super now need 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.590
 such move away and so here so here so 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.930
 a little hunger you need everything there is a little 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.650
 got hungry and now you can something 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.759
 eat but immediately warn again 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.240
 like with a workbench 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.810
 suddenly somewhere in the middle of the forest or somewhere on 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.909
 field 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:51.240
 did you notice steak lies or else chicken 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:54.539
 take don't take guys don't risk 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.740
 crafted so spider eye 4 things and 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:01.860
 usually fried chicken steak in the center 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.520
 carrots potatoes ie kraft 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:10.610
 standard so dough for example here i am 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.529
 I found a chicken and eat here bam 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.310
 slowness of poisoning fatigue 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:18.240
 nausea 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.580
 trace of the so hard to survive hard 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.889
 survive really especially if somewhere 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.699
 someone waiting around the corner and just 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:30.210
 fits you and finishes all common 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.150
 the actions of these all equally eat 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:37.349
 potatoes are the same slowly from 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.379
 poisoning fatigue nausea blind but 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:43.560
 if you are some kind of admin and you have 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:48.990
