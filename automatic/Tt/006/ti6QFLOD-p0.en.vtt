and<00:03:36.010> our<00:03:36.400> style<00:03:36.880> of<00:03:37.060> fights<00:03:37.359> is<00:03:37.630> going<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.959> make

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
and our style of fights is going to make

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.509 
and our style of fights is going to make
it<00:03:38.319> another<00:03:38.560> candidate<00:03:39.010> for<00:03:39.160> fight<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.340> the

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
it another candidate for fight of the

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.640 
it another candidate for fight of the
year<00:03:39.549> that's<00:03:39.940> what<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.450> really<00:03:40.720> believe<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.319> I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
year that's what I really believe and I

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.349 
year that's what I really believe and I
think<00:03:41.829> he'll<00:03:41.920> bring<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.670> best<00:03:42.819> out<00:03:42.970> in<00:03:43.030> me<00:03:43.150> and

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
think he'll bring the best out in me and

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.629 
think he'll bring the best out in me and
I'll<00:03:43.480> bring<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.750> best<00:03:43.900> out<00:03:44.049> of<00:03:44.109> him<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:45.310> I

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
I'll bring the best out of him so I

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.979 
I'll bring the best out of him so I
don't<00:03:45.910> think<00:03:46.030> it'll<00:03:46.180> take<00:03:46.239> much<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.750> get<00:03:46.840> him

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
don't think it'll take much to get him

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.809 
don't think it'll take much to get him
in<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.200> ring<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.560> really<00:03:48.190> feel<00:03:48.400> like<00:03:48.430> he's<00:03:48.700> not

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
in the ring I really feel like he's not

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.819 
in the ring I really feel like he's not
the<00:03:49.120> kind<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.359> guy<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.480> avoids<00:03:49.930> people<00:03:50.139> he

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
the kind of guy that avoids people he

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.199 
the kind of guy that avoids people he
said<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.130> himself<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:51.790> not<00:03:51.910> about<00:03:52.060> the

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
said it himself that it's not about the

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.550

the<00:03:53.709> fans<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.069> greatest<00:03:54.430> fights<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:55.000> that

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
the fans the greatest fights that that

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.839 
the fans the greatest fights that that
he<00:03:55.930> can<00:03:56.110> put<00:03:56.260> on<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.860> lot<00:03:57.340> of<00:03:57.370> respect<00:03:57.700> for

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.170 
him I just think stylistically it's a
matchup<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.160> needs<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.550> happen<00:04:00.580> it<00:04:01.000> will
