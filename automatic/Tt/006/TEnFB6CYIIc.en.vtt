00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
the all-new FIA formula for let's take a

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.630 
the all-new FIA formula for let's take a
look<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.720> firstly<00:00:29.080> what<00:00:29.320> exactly<00:00:29.830> is<00:00:30.099> formula

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
look so firstly what exactly is formula

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.820 
look so firstly what exactly is formula
for<00:00:30.849> well<00:00:31.390> it's<00:00:31.509> a<00:00:31.570> category<00:00:31.900> adopted<00:00:32.560> by<00:00:32.770> the

much like a Formula One car
adjustable<00:01:00.520> suspension<00:01:00.730> we<00:01:01.390> can<00:01:01.540> adjust<00:01:01.630> the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
adjustable suspension we can adjust the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.009 
adjustable suspension we can adjust the
front<00:01:02.410> sway<00:01:02.680> bars<00:01:02.980> here<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:04.000> shock<00:01:04.479> absorbers

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
front sway bars here the shock absorbers

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.770 
front sway bars here the shock absorbers
a<00:01:05.289> lot<00:01:05.799> if<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.369> like<00:01:06.549> by<00:01:06.789> the<00:01:06.850> by<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.329> factory

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
a lot if you like by the by the factory

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.599 
a lot if you like by the by the factory
so<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.170> drivers<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.799> teams<00:01:08.829> can't

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:09.609 
so the drivers and the teams can't

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:11.190 
so the drivers and the teams can't
adjust<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.030> shocks<00:01:10.299> but<00:01:10.750> there's<00:01:10.899> a<00:01:10.960> couple

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
adjust the shocks but there's a couple

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.260 
adjust the shocks but there's a couple
of<00:01:11.409> different<00:01:11.770> springs<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.850> can<00:01:13.060> run<00:01:13.240> a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
of different springs that you can run a

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.050 
of different springs that you can run a
soft<00:01:13.689> medium<00:01:14.079> or<00:01:14.409> hard<00:01:14.560> compound<00:01:15.070> designated

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
soft medium or hard compound designated

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.490 
soft medium or hard compound designated
by<00:01:16.359> the<00:01:16.420> color

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.860 

so<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.180> business<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
so this is the the business in the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.420 
so this is the the business in the
office<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.410> like<00:01:22.440> for<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.830> driver

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
office if you like for the driver

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
the driver shape and size paddle shift

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.760 
the driver shape and size paddle shift
which<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.390> fantastic<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.200> young<00:01:31.380> driver<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
which is fantastic for a young driver to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.490 
which is fantastic for a young driver to
get<00:01:31.920> used<00:01:32.160> to<00:01:32.250> 6-speed<00:01:33.240> sequential<00:01:34.050> paddle

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
get used to 6-speed sequential paddle

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.170 
get used to 6-speed sequential paddle
