00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and it crystallizes and causes cell

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.030 
and it crystallizes and causes cell
damage<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:03.540> best<00:01:03.750> thing<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.409> with

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
that or any other cold is to get out of

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.499 
that or any other cold is to get out of
cold<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.740> expose<00:01:08.070> yourself<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.329> there<00:01:09.479> are

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
cold not expose yourself so there are

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.870 
cold not expose yourself so there are
things<00:01:09.749> people<00:01:09.929> can<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.499> prevent<00:01:10.880> injury

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
from cold temperatures simple things

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
from cold temperatures simple things
like<00:01:14.909> covering<00:01:15.329> up<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.200> always<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.530> hour

and<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:29.969> didn't<00:01:30.179> expect<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.539> be<00:01:30.630> exposed

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and they didn't expect to be exposed

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.629 
and they didn't expect to be exposed
because<00:01:31.469> they're<00:01:31.619> inside<00:01:31.889> of<00:01:32.069> their<00:01:32.189> car<00:01:32.399> but

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639 
because they're inside of their car but

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:34.160 
because they're inside of their car but
they're<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:32.880> prepared<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.899> don't<00:01:34.109> have

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
they're not prepared so I don't have

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.870 
they're not prepared so I don't have
hats<00:01:34.439> they<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.069> gloves<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.729> don't

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
have multiple layers of clothing they

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.739 
have multiple layers of clothing they
don't<00:01:38.249> have<00:01:38.369> good<00:01:38.549> shoes<00:01:38.819> to<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.389> able<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> walk

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
don't have good shoes to be able to walk

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.830 
don't have good shoes to be able to walk
in<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.319> so<00:01:40.590> being<00:01:41.219> prepared<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.090> nine-tenths

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
in and so being prepared is nine-tenths

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.379 
in and so being prepared is nine-tenths
of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> situation<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.969> have<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.359> go

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:45.389 
of the situation so if you have to go

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:46.730 
of the situation so if you have to go
out<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.109> keep<00:01:46.200> yourself<00:01:46.560> covered

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
out you want to keep yourself covered

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.059 
out you want to keep yourself covered
covered<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.399> layers<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:48.119> best<00:01:48.389> so<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.889> it

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
covered in layers are best so if it

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.590 
covered in layers are best so if it
happens<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.429> warm<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.179> take<00:01:51.359> some<00:01:51.539> of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
happens to warm up you can take some of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.809 
happens to warm up you can take some of
those<00:01:51.659> layers<00:01:51.929> off<00:01:52.289> or<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.039> cool<00:01:53.249> down<00:01:53.520> you

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
those layers off or the cool down you

injury<00:02:53.420> from<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.780> higher<00:02:54.019> temperatures<00:02:54.709> you

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
injury from the higher temperatures you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.070 
injury from the higher temperatures you
know<00:02:55.340> let<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.790> temperature<00:02:56.239> come<00:02:56.480> back<00:02:56.660> up<00:02:56.900> if

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
know let the temperature come back up if

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.050

you<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.380> run<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.530> little<00:02:57.769> cool<00:02:58.010> water<00:02:58.310> over

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
you have to run a little cool water over

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.520 
you have to run a little cool water over
top<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.630> make<00:02:59.840> them<00:03:00.019> feel<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> little<00:03:00.350> bit

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
better that's okay too but make sure you

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.330 
better that's okay too but make sure you

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
sit next to a fire or you know just warm

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.729 
sit next to a fire or you know just warm
yourself<00:03:08.540> up<00:03:08.660> in<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.870> blanket<00:03:09.019> can<00:03:09.380> go<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.560> long

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
yourself up in a blanket can go a long

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.560 
yourself up in a blanket can go a long
way<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.640> there's<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.880> couple<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.269> things<00:03:11.299> that

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
way so there's a couple of things that

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.110 
way so there's a couple of things that
people<00:03:11.989> were<00:03:12.320> had<00:03:12.950> more<00:03:13.190> severe<00:03:13.670> hypothermia

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
people were had more severe hypothermia

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.030 
people were had more severe hypothermia
whether<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.019> be<00:03:15.110> second<00:03:15.530> or<00:03:15.620> third<00:03:15.829> degree

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
whether it be second or third degree

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.180 
whether it be second or third degree
you'll<00:03:16.730> notice<00:03:17.209> some<00:03:17.239> findings<00:03:18.049> on<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.590> pain

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
you'll notice some findings on the pain

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.920 
you'll notice some findings on the pain
will<00:03:19.310> be<00:03:19.459> severe<00:03:19.820> something<00:03:20.269> mean<00:03:20.390> we<00:03:20.690> can't

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
will be severe something mean we can't

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.330 
will be severe something mean we can't
handle<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.470> that's<00:03:21.650> kind<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.100> sign<00:03:22.310> that

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
handle and that's kind of a sign that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.949 
handle and that's kind of a sign that
you<00:03:22.730> may<00:03:22.880> be<00:03:22.940> having<00:03:23.150> some<00:03:23.390> tissue<00:03:23.630> damage

out of that carbon monoxide poisoning it

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.129 
out of that carbon monoxide poisoning it
and<00:04:22.100> bad<00:04:22.700> things<00:04:23.000> can<00:04:23.180> happen<00:04:23.240> from<00:04:23.720> that<00:04:23.780> so

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
and bad things can happen from that so

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.250 
and bad things can happen from that so
not<00:04:24.380> only<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.800> car<00:04:25.270> but<00:04:26.270> also<00:04:26.570> from<00:04:26.960> heaters

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
not only the car but also from heaters

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.730 
not only the car but also from heaters
and<00:04:27.470> from<00:04:28.190> fireplaces
