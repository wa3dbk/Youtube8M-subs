00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
of speak the process of ripening up if

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.190 
of speak the process of ripening up if
you<00:03:41.130> do<00:03:41.370> pick<00:03:41.640> them<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.720> pick<00:03:42.900> them<00:03:43.140> and

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
you do pick them you can pick them and

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.360 
you do pick them you can pick them and
just<00:03:43.350> kind<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.560> leave<00:03:43.710> them<00:03:43.920> out<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.220> open
