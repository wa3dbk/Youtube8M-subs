00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
buying it but I don't recommend using as

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.710 
buying it but I don't recommend using as
you<00:02:30.530> can<00:02:30.709> see<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.160> very<00:02:31.209> awkward<00:02:32.209> for<00:02:32.239> me<00:02:32.510> to

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
you can see it is very awkward for me to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.900 
you can see it is very awkward for me to
use<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.560> I'm<00:02:33.860> just<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.370> need<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.670> put

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
this down boo because I like to use my

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.630 
this down boo because I like to use my
hands<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.180> mix<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.660> mixture<00:02:38.720> around<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.340> so

hands to mix this mixture around and so

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.120 
hands to mix this mixture around and so
I<00:02:40.670> make<00:02:41.060> sure<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.750> put<00:02:42.170> her<00:02:42.380> hair<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:42.739> two

put bantu knots throughout her hair also

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.710 
put bantu knots throughout her hair also
to<00:02:54.739> keep<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.190> out<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.430> way<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.880> put<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.420> ends

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
to keep it out the way and put the ends

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.470 
to keep it out the way and put the ends
under<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.280> when<00:02:58.459> she<00:02:58.610> does<00:02:58.850> put<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.180> bag

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.880 
under so it so when she does put the bag
on<00:02:59.720> her<00:02:59.900> hair<00:03:00.170> for<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:02.350> like<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.590> don't<00:03:03.709> want

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
on her hair for it to like I don't want

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.820 
on her hair for it to like I don't want
to<00:03:03.950> say<00:03:04.040> marinade<00:03:04.519> but<00:03:04.670> marinate<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:06.140> hair

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
to say marinade but marinate the hair

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.940 
to say marinade but marinate the hair
for<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:08.269> believe<00:03:08.750> she<00:03:08.930> did<00:03:09.080> hers<00:03:09.319> for<00:03:09.590> two<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:09.920> a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
for I believe she did hers for two and a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.640 
for I believe she did hers for two and a
half<00:03:10.130> hours<00:03:10.489> but<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.120> recommend<00:03:11.510> doing<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.320> for

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
half hours but I recommend doing it for

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.460 
half hours but I recommend doing it for
like<00:03:13.459> four<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.060> five<00:03:14.090> or<00:03:14.480> even<00:03:14.600> overnight<00:03:15.079> I

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
like four to five or even overnight I

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.590 
like four to five or even overnight I
believe<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.310> if<00:03:16.459> she<00:03:16.670> left<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.180> longer

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
believe that if she left it on longer

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.780 
believe that if she left it on longer
she<00:03:18.019> would<00:03:18.200> have<00:03:18.380> better<00:03:18.620> hair<00:03:18.920> color<00:03:19.280> results

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
she would have better hair color results

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.060 
she would have better hair color results
because<00:03:20.480> even<00:03:21.200> though<00:03:21.290> she<00:03:21.350> likes<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.890> burst

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
because even though she likes the burst

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.250 
because even though she likes the burst
of<00:03:22.220> highlights<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.730> she<00:03:22.910> got<00:03:23.260> eventually

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
of highlights that she got eventually

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.890 
of highlights that she got eventually
because<00:03:24.829> I<00:03:24.920> followed<00:03:25.280> up<00:03:25.430> with<00:03:25.459> her<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:26.180> through

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
because I followed up with her I through

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.960 
because I followed up with her I through
two<00:03:27.109> weeks<00:03:27.320> after<00:03:27.739> they<00:03:27.890> had<00:03:28.579> the<00:03:28.730> treatment

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
two weeks after they had the treatment

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.349 
two weeks after they had the treatment
she<00:03:29.900> her<00:03:30.109> hair<00:03:30.380> is<00:03:30.530> not<00:03:30.709> completely<00:03:31.359> dark

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
she her hair is not completely dark
