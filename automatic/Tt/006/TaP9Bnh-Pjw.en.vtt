00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
if I had to go to 10 I probably give

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.599 
if I had to go to 10 I probably give
like<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> six<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:46.290> know<00:03:46.470> it's<00:03:47.160> one<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.430> his

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
like a six you know it's one of his

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.370

better<00:03:47.850> projects<00:03:48.420> as<00:03:48.510> far<00:03:48.750> as<00:03:48.840> almond<00:03:49.230> eyes

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
better projects as far as almond eyes

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.020 
better projects as far as almond eyes
but<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.709> just<00:03:49.829> seemed<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.400> make<00:03:50.850> steaks

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
but it just seemed like a to make steaks

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.569 
but it just seemed like a to make steaks
be<00:03:51.180> better<00:03:51.390> than<00:03:51.540> its<00:03:51.720> albums<00:03:52.109> but<00:03:52.650> um<00:03:52.769> if<00:03:53.070> you

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
be better than its albums but um if you

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.280 
be better than its albums but um if you
guys<00:03:53.790> are<00:03:54.000> not<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> fan<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.480> would<00:03:54.780> suggest<00:03:54.930> that

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290
