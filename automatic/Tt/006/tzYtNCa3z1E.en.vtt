review on the iPad Mini nude case this
one<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.240> from<00:00:12.630> lifeproof<00:00:13.910> so<00:00:15.049> this<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
one is from lifeproof so this is a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.710 
one is from lifeproof so this is a
little<00:00:16.859> bit<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.220> different<00:00:18.000> review<00:00:18.150> because

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
little bit of a different review because

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.279 
little bit of a different review because
not<00:00:19.470> only<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.460> case<00:00:20.880> meant<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> iPad

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
not only is this case meant for the iPad

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.460 
not only is this case meant for the iPad
Mini<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.060> not<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.600> iPad<00:00:24.840> Mini<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.410> Retina

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
Mini and not the iPad Mini with Retina

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.060 
Mini and not the iPad Mini with Retina
display<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.900> fact<00:00:28.289> an<00:00:28.470> ipad<00:00:28.830> mini

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
display this is in fact an ipad mini

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.780 
display this is in fact an ipad mini
ipad<00:00:29.810> but<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.990> case<00:00:31.230> again<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
ipad but the case again it's for the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.580 
ipad but the case again it's for the
original<00:00:33.329> iPad<00:00:33.510> Mini<00:00:34.110> now<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.350> only

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
original iPad Mini now the only

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.069 
original iPad Mini now the only
difference<00:00:35.010> between<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.489> two<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
difference between the two is one the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.479 
difference between the two is one the
weight<00:00:37.320> that's<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> come<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
weight that's not going to come in a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.510 
weight that's not going to come in a
factor<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.440> millimeters<00:00:41.340> maybe

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
factor here but it is millimeters maybe

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.330 
factor here but it is millimeters maybe
less<00:00:42.180> than<00:00:42.210> millimeters<00:00:43.070> difference<00:00:44.070> in

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
less than millimeters difference in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.950 
less than millimeters difference in
thickness<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.120> iPad<00:00:45.510> Mini<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.840> Retina

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
thickness the iPad Mini with Retina

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.639 
thickness the iPad Mini with Retina
display<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> few<00:00:47.309> millimeters<00:00:47.940> thick<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
display is a few millimeters thick so I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.970 
display is a few millimeters thick so I
would<00:00:49.890> assume<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.289> any<00:00:52.620> kind

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
would assume that if they have any kind

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.529 
would assume that if they have any kind
of<00:00:53.160> well<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:54.030> warranty<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.020> return<00:00:55.710> policy

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
of well not warranty but return policy

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.080 
of well not warranty but return policy
it<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.809> not<00:00:58.109> work<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.340> case<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.940> you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
it would not work in this case if you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
it would not work in this case if you
were<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.449> use<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.350> am<00:01:01.500> using<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> got

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
were to use it like I am using now I got

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.149 
were to use it like I am using now I got
this<00:01:02.850> case<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> few<00:01:03.449> months<00:01:03.750> ago<00:01:03.840> when<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.979> did

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
this case a few months ago when they did

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.850 
this case a few months ago when they did
not<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> specific<00:01:06.000> iPad<00:01:06.630> Mini<00:01:06.990> with

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
not have a specific iPad Mini with

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.880 
not have a specific iPad Mini with
Retina<00:01:08.189> display<00:01:08.880> nude<00:01:09.540> case<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:10.770> are

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
Retina display nude case now they are

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
Retina display nude case now they are
exactly<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> same<00:01:11.580> price<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.360> assume

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
exactly the same price but I assume

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.230 
exactly the same price but I assume
because<00:01:13.020> they<00:01:13.320> still<00:01:13.619> come<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.119> there<00:01:15.119> are

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
because they still come out there are

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
because they still come out there are
still<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:15.840> separate<00:01:16.170> listings<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.770> lifeproof

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
still two separate listings on lifeproof

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.410 
still two separate listings on lifeproof
comm<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> nude<00:01:18.780> case<00:01:20.090> for<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
comm one for the nude case for just the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.999 
comm one for the nude case for just the
iPad<00:01:21.780> Mini<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.200> then<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> retina

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
iPad Mini and then one with the retina

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.710 
iPad Mini and then one with the retina
display<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:23.549> both<00:01:23.759> exactly<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> same

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
display they are both exactly the same

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.660 
display they are both exactly the same
price<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.380> imagine<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.250> use<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> same

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
price I imagine they use the same

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.260 
price I imagine they use the same
material<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.950> probably<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.159> fraction<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
material but probably just fraction of a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.410 
material but probably just fraction of a
difference<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.840> thickness<00:01:32.150> now<00:01:33.150> why<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
difference in thickness now why that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.080 
difference in thickness now why that
matters<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.700> because<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:35.970> no

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
matters here is because there is no

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.179 
matters here is because there is no
screen<00:01:36.990> protector<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.560> here<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.009> what

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
screen protector on here and what

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
screen protector on here and what
actually<00:01:38.490> seals<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.329> still<00:01:39.540> makes<00:01:39.750> this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
actually seals this and still makes this

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.920 
actually seals this and still makes this

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
would say resistant because you could

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.030 
would say resistant because you could

throw it anywhere and it may still do

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.200 
throw it anywhere and it may still do
some<00:01:50.250> damage<00:01:50.869> what<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.990> has<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.210> seals

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
some damage what it has here is seals

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.260 
some damage what it has here is seals
all<00:01:54.630> around<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.740> believe<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.729> silicone

all around here believe it's silicone

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.260 
all around here believe it's silicone
around<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.380> edges<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.009> that's<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.119> keeps

around the edges and that's what keeps

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
for it this does work I've used it in

snow you can actually look at our past

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.420 
snow you can actually look at our past
video<00:02:10.500> where<00:02:10.739> we<00:02:10.860> did<00:02:11.039> that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
video where we did that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.179 
video where we did that
and<00:02:11.579> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.659> see<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.079> drop<00:02:13.290> test<00:02:13.560> even<00:02:14.040> where

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
and you can see the drop test even where

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.030 
and you can see the drop test even where
I<00:02:14.220> drop<00:02:14.579> it<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:14.879> its<00:02:15.120> face<00:02:15.450> no<00:02:16.409> of<00:02:16.560> course<00:02:16.829> you

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
I drop it on its face no of course you

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.199 
I drop it on its face no of course you
would<00:02:17.159> have<00:02:17.189> to<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.459> dropping<00:02:17.909> it<00:02:18.000> on<00:02:18.150> a

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
would have to be dropping it on a

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.649 
would have to be dropping it on a
surface<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.769> flat<00:02:20.250> if<00:02:20.519> you<00:02:20.670> drop<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.390> on

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
surface that is flat if you drop this on

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.500 
surface that is flat if you drop this on
a<00:02:21.689> jagged<00:02:22.470> surface<00:02:22.829> on<00:02:23.040> its<00:02:23.220> face<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:24.329> of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
a jagged surface on its face it of

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.050 
a jagged surface on its face it of
course<00:02:24.720> will<00:02:25.079> hurt<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.220> screen<00:02:26.579> because

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
course will hurt the screen because

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.940 
course will hurt the screen because
there<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:27.360> no<00:02:27.599> screen<00:02:27.959> protector<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.530> there

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
there is no screen protector on there

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.369 
there is no screen protector on there
now<00:02:29.640> personally<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.090> do<00:02:30.209> like<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.629> nude<00:02:30.870> more

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
now personally I do like the nude more

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.869 
now personally I do like the nude more
than<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.769> free<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> free<00:02:32.670> has<00:02:32.849> a

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
than the free because the free has a

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.759 
than the free because the free has a
screen<00:02:33.239> protector<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.409> just<00:02:34.620> takes

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
screen protector and that just takes

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.490 
screen protector and that just takes
away<00:02:34.890> from<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.220> experience<00:02:35.750> I've<00:02:36.750> loved<00:02:37.230> this

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
away from the experience I've loved this

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.220 
away from the experience I've loved this
I<00:02:37.799> carry<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:38.640> around<00:02:38.939> without<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.629> optional

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
I carry this around without the optional

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.640 
I carry this around without the optional
Smart<00:02:40.950> Cover<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.819> get<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.329> and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
it's been perfect the only problem is

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.330 
it's been perfect the only problem is
when<00:02:46.409> you<00:02:46.470> don't<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.769> Smart<00:02:47.010> Cover<00:02:47.159> you

stand for this now I use this a lot when
I'm<00:02:56.879> going<00:02:57.150> out<00:02:57.299> but<00:02:57.989> when<00:02:58.170> I'm<00:02:58.260> at<00:02:58.349> home<00:02:58.379> I<00:02:58.590> do

caseless<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.299> that's<00:03:04.079> where<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> run<00:03:04.500> into<00:03:04.769> a

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
caseless and that's where I run into a

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.500 
caseless and that's where I run into a
little<00:03:05.040> problem<00:03:05.159> unless<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:06.000> have<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.180> coin

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
little problem unless you have a coin

little problem unless you have a coin
it's<00:03:07.139> kind<00:03:07.379> of<00:03:07.439> hard<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.799> take<00:03:08.099> this<00:03:08.310> case<00:03:09.030> off

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
it's kind of hard to take this case off

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.809 
it's kind of hard to take this case off
this<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.769> how<00:03:10.859> you<00:03:10.920> would<00:03:11.099> take<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.340> off<00:03:11.459> you

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
this is how you would take it off you

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.759 
this is how you would take it off you
would<00:03:11.909> open<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.329> flap<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:12.689> first<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.470> also

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
would open this flap up first this also

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.589 
would open this flap up first this also

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
shows where the lightning connector is

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.129 
shows where the lightning connector is

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
and it's also waterproof water resistant

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.979 
and it's also waterproof water resistant
but<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:20.010> need<00:03:20.340> something<00:03:20.760> more<00:03:21.480> than<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.750> key

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
but you need something more than a key

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.199 
but you need something more than a key
you<00:03:22.590> need<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.799> coin<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.459> me<00:03:23.699> personally<00:03:24.150> I

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
long fingernails but I can't I just

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.909 
long fingernails but I can't I just
can't<00:03:35.849> get<00:03:36.359> in<00:03:36.569> that<00:03:36.720> gap<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.290> what<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.739> is

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
can't get in that gap and what this is

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.530 
can't get in that gap and what this is
honestly<00:03:38.280> made<00:03:38.459> for<00:03:38.669> is<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.819> coin<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.329> go<00:03:39.419> in

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
honestly made for is a coin to go in

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.800 
honestly made for is a coin to go in
here<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.729> separate<00:03:41.729> the<00:03:41.879> two<00:03:41.909> pieces<00:03:42.090> and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
here and separate the two pieces and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.140 
here and separate the two pieces and
then<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.349> kind<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.709> pry<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.129> rest<00:03:44.519> off<00:03:44.819> here

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
then you kind of pry the rest off here

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.479 
then you kind of pry the rest off here
that's<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.199> only<00:03:46.530> real<00:03:46.709> problem<00:03:47.129> I<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.370> with

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
that's the only real problem I have with

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.550 
that's the only real problem I have with
this<00:03:47.639> that<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.659> it's<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.989> little<00:03:49.139> bit<00:03:49.349> hard

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
this that is that it's a little bit hard

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.439 
this that is that it's a little bit hard
to<00:03:49.680> take<00:03:49.859> off<00:03:50.010> but<00:03:50.549> otherwise<00:03:50.849> it<00:03:51.150> provides

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
to take off but otherwise it provides

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.589 
to take off but otherwise it provides
great<00:03:51.810> protection<00:03:52.699> it<00:03:53.699> does<00:03:53.970> cause<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.359> little

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
great protection it does cause a little

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.960 
great protection it does cause a little
bit<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.930> fogginess<00:03:55.379> on<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.889> back<00:03:56.099> through<00:03:56.849> the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
bit of fogginess on the back through the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.899 
bit of fogginess on the back through the
camera<00:03:57.389> and<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:58.560> only<00:03:58.889> difference<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.879> only

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
camera and the only difference the only

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.689 
camera and the only difference the only
major<00:04:00.269> difference<00:04:00.449> is<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:02.010> iPad<00:04:02.159> Mini

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
major difference is on the iPad Mini

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.280 
major difference is on the iPad Mini
with<00:04:02.909> Retina<00:04:02.940> display<00:04:03.629> there<00:04:03.900> are<00:04:04.019> two

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
with Retina display there are two

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.360 
with Retina display there are two
microphones<00:04:04.790> one<00:04:05.790> here<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.359> one<00:04:06.540> here<00:04:06.569> on<00:04:07.079> the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
microphones one here and one here on the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.640 
microphones one here and one here on the
ipad<00:04:08.370> mini's<00:04:08.909> case<00:04:09.329> they're<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.139> only<00:04:10.409> one

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
ipad mini's case they're the only one

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.099 
ipad mini's case they're the only one
microphone<00:04:11.159> hole<00:04:11.489> so<00:04:11.970> if<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.269> are<00:04:12.569> recording

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
microphone hole so if you are recording

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.819 
microphone hole so if you are recording
