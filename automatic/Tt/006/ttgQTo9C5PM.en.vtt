the last video I with a caption but part
number<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.830> 5435<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.959> it's<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:47.069> very<00:03:47.370> very<00:03:47.640> soft

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
number of 5435 and it's a very very soft

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.820 
number of 5435 and it's a very very soft
spring<00:03:48.780> rate<00:03:49.019> because<00:03:49.200> they're<00:03:49.350> actually

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
spring rate because they're actually

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.039 
spring rate because they're actually
very<00:03:49.860> this<00:03:50.549> soft<00:03:50.850> spring<00:03:51.090> rate<00:03:51.360> is<00:03:51.480> very<00:03:51.540> hard

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
very this soft spring rate is very hard

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.750 
very this soft spring rate is very hard
on<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.290> Rustler<00:03:52.769> because<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.370> goes<00:03:53.489> on<00:03:53.609> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
on this Rustler because it goes on the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.830 
on this Rustler because it goes on the
revo<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.390> 2.6<00:03:55.140> rate<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.510> perfect<00:03:57.510> for<00:03:57.720> it

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
revo so the 2.6 rate is perfect for it

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.090 
revo so the 2.6 rate is perfect for it
so<00:03:58.560> that's<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.829> one<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.040> used<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.700> I<00:04:01.100> wouldn't

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
so that's the one I used and I wouldn't

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.650 
so that's the one I used and I wouldn't
go<00:04:02.160> any<00:04:02.310> harder<00:04:02.640> on<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.910> hit<00:04:03.329> this<00:04:03.510> is

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
go any harder on it hit this is

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.530 
go any harder on it hit this is
absolutely<00:04:04.380> perfect<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:06.230> I'm<00:04:07.230> out
