00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670 

I<00:00:01.129> had<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.159> question<00:00:02.429> about<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.680> compatibility

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
I had a question about the compatibility

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.099 
I had a question about the compatibility
of<00:00:04.740> mounts<00:00:05.250> between<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.930> sj4000<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
of mounts between the sj4000 and the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.400 
of mounts between the sj4000 and the
GoPro<00:00:07.560> i<00:00:07.799> had<00:00:08.700> read<00:00:08.960> previously<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.230> they

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
GoPro i had read previously that they

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.459 
GoPro i had read previously that they
were<00:00:10.469> compatible<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:12.570> i<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:13.019> thought<00:00:13.230> i

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
were compatible so i just thought i

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.519 
were compatible so i just thought i
tested<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:13.889> itself<00:00:14.250> they<00:00:14.400> eat<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.639> question

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
tested out itself they eat the question

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.960 
tested out itself they eat the question
the<00:00:16.529> specific<00:00:16.980> question<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.460> about<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.699> head

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the specific question was about the head

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.710 
the specific question was about the head
mount<00:00:18.470> see<00:00:19.970> that<00:00:20.970> looks<00:00:21.210> like<00:00:21.449> right<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:23.720> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
mount see that looks like right there to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.339 
mount see that looks like right there to
the<00:00:24.810> other<00:00:24.930> camera<00:00:26.960> anyway<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.109> just

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the other camera anyway this just

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.820 
the other camera anyway this just
basically<00:00:28.650> goes<00:00:28.890> over<00:00:29.130> your<00:00:29.160> head<00:00:30.619> goes<00:00:31.619> over

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
basically goes over your head goes over

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.220 
basically goes over your head goes over
your<00:00:31.859> head<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.149> GoPro<00:00:33.510> mounts<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:33.930> here

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
your head and the GoPro mounts on here

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.850 
your head and the GoPro mounts on here
on<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.559> front<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> faces<00:00:35.790> forward<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
on the front of it faces forward so that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.560 
on the front of it faces forward so that
was<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> specific<00:00:39.000> question<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
was the specific question I'm going to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.569 
was the specific question I'm going to
start<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.870> little<00:00:39.989> bit<00:00:40.170> more<00:00:40.290> general<00:00:40.770> first<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
start a little bit more general first of

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
start a little bit more general first of
all<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.969> an<00:00:42.090> sj4000<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
all this is an sj4000 now one of the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
all this is an sj4000 now one of the
ones<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.710> came<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
ones that came with it and this is the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
ones that came with it and this is the
connector<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.649> goes<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.210> sj4000<00:00:48.440> so

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
connector that goes with the sj4000 so

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.799 
connector that goes with the sj4000 so
I'll<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.100> throw<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.629> how

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
I'll just throw that on just to see how

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.260 
I'll just throw that on just to see how
it<00:00:51.840> goes<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> does<00:00:53.879> no

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it goes on and you see that it does no

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.590 
it goes on and you see that it does no
problem<00:00:55.309> right<00:00:57.469> take<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> off<00:00:59.359> this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
problem right take it off this is a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.889 
problem right take it off this is a
GoPro<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.739> strap<00:01:02.039> mount<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.719> this<00:01:03.719> is

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
GoPro just a strap mount and this is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.020 
GoPro just a strap mount and this is
with<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.519> sj4000<00:01:06.590> well<00:01:07.729> hopefully<00:01:08.729> it's

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
with the sj4000 well hopefully it's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.789 
with the sj4000 well hopefully it's
durable<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.600> try<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> put<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
durable so we just try and put it on and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.070 
durable so we just try and put it on and
you<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> fits<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:15.360> fine<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.930> like

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you see that it fits just fine just like

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.770 
you see that it fits just fine just like
the<00:01:16.200> GoPro<00:01:16.530> mounted<00:01:16.920> no<00:01:17.759> problem<00:01:20.450> no<00:01:21.450> expert

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780

mount let's just give it a try i'm going
on<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> screw<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.720> came<00:01:33.900> with

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
on do this is the screw that came with

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.520 
on do this is the screw that came with
the<00:01:34.170> sj4000<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.369> i<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> undo<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.530> I

do it up see it's nice and tight on
there<00:02:14.360> looks<00:02:15.360> good<00:02:16.580> normally<00:02:17.580> you'd<00:02:17.760> probably

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
there looks good normally you'd probably

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:27.730 
there looks good normally you'd probably
have<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.390> up<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:21.890> let's<00:02:22.890> try<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.250> on
