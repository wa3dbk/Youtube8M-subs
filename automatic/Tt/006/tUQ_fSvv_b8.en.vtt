00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 you want to make creations with your own 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.430
 figurines in polymer clay and not 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.109
 you know where to get it or do not have me 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.700
 I'm Marin's pauner, you're in the channel 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.800
 of the art of payment I will teach you to do 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.519
 a substitute of chicisimo made in your 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.910
 own house 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.630
 we'll see 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.630
 A) Yes 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.100
 and a couple of steps at this time we 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.080
 to make a substitute for clay 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.120
 polymeric is called cold porcelain but 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.890
 that cold porcelain has a variation 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.050
 that gives a little better we have to 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.080
 remember that polymer clay and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.000
 cold porcelain or flexible dough or dough 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.370
 flexible are similar but they are 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.530
 different the polymer clay is a 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239
 Factory made product and porcelain 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.739
 cold is a product that we can 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.650
 make our house the polymer clay 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.930
 hardens only by baking it and 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.430
 cold porcelain hardens with the sun is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.280
 with more natural polymer clay 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.170
 the pieces adhere themselves and the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.910
 cold porcelain the pieces you have to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.680
 paste with a little bit, resist the clay 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.590
 polymeric comes in many colors and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 It has special variations like 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.770
 silver metallic gold color the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.420
 cold porcelain you have to paint it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.100
 down here I leave you how you can paint the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.660
 cold porcelain as I was telling you are very 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.250
 similar but the processes are 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.660
 different and then good without more but 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.759
 teach how to make this cold porcelain 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.210
 improved and we will see what wave 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.210
 needs to 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.050
 well, this time we're going to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.960
 need wheat flour 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.160
 although not wholemeal flour and none 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.470
 it has to be wheat flour 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.330
 we're going to need cornstarch this hill and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.550
 olive oil you can also use 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.520
 a substitute that is baby oil 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.440
 vinegar hand cream I resist 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.300
 white preferably than the resistol 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.700
 be of high quality and that is very 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.170
 thick and is very watery because this sheet 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.650
 and it's not going to work for you then you have to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.440
 use the screaming as a container 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:51.170
 one bowl one spoon 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.170
 waxed paper and a measuring cup 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.250
 Well, we are starting what 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.580
 let's do it's going to be put 200 grams 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.580
 of flour 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.679
 If you do not have to measure the 200 grams are 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.679
 equal to a cup 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.920
 Now let's add 180 grams of 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.660
 I resist , it happened to me, it happened to me that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.390
 I will come doing about two centimeters more 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.170
 below the rate we add the resistol and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.170
 the sugar rate 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.040
 of sugar sugar ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.260
 now we are going to add half of the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.190
 half or until here of cornstarch 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.040
 and now 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.259
 to stir 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.259
 [Music] 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.290
 you can say as you go 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.970
 your mass if it is very liquid then 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.409
 You can put a little flour and if it is left 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.370
 a little dry you can put a 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.370
 little bit of resistol 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.770
 [Music] 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.200
 and well then when you can not move 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.030
 there with the little 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:22.290
 it's time to put your hands 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:24.409
 [Music] 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.409
 ah 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:35.310
 [Music] 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.260
 and now we start 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.260
 [Music] 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.070
 and now almost immediately we put a 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.070
 teaspoon of oil 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.630
 almost immediately afterwards we're also going to 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:26.050
 put 4 drops of vinegar this is for 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.050
 that is preserved and does not come out 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.629
 [Music] 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.520
 a very important thing that never 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:35.520
 you never have to pour water 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.839
 [Music] 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.770
 another little bit more kneading and we put a 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:51.050
 little oil in the hands 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.050
 [Music] 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.610
 so when I grasp a consistency of 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.130
 plasticine means that it is already 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.389
 list 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.389
 [Music] 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:07.940
 so it's very manageable 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.940
 like a plasticine totally 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.829
 father 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:17.099
 with equity now what they have to 

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:19.699
 to do is put it in an airtight stop 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.699
 with cap 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:30.099
 studying that he does not get any air 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.099
 and 30 minutes 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.190
 at first 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.330
 Well then that's all for today 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.860
 and wait for the next video where we are going to 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.960
 work with this paste for your in 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.960
 I love you goddesses a lot 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.629
