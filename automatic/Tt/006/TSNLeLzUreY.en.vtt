hello and welcome everyone in this video
I<00:00:03.270> will<00:00:03.570> show<00:00:03.750> you<00:00:03.810> how<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.140> Sims<00:00:04.440> 4<00:00:04.740> runs<00:00:04.980> on

an<00:00:05.310> early<00:00:05.580> 2015<00:00:06.480> MacBook<00:00:06.720> Pro<00:00:07.140> under<00:00:07.529> OS<00:00:07.799> X

an early 2015 MacBook Pro under OS X

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.400 
an early 2015 MacBook Pro under OS X
let's<00:00:09.269> see<00:00:09.450> how<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.630> game<00:00:09.840> runs<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.260> low

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
let's see how the game runs to low

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.310 
let's see how the game runs to low
settings<00:00:10.969> as<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.030> can<00:00:12.269> see<00:00:12.450> only<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.870> retina

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
settings as you can see only the retina

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.320 
settings as you can see only the retina
resolutions<00:00:13.860> available<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.940> settings

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
resolutions available in the settings

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.450 
resolutions available in the settings
but<00:00:15.929> most<00:00:16.139> probably<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> game<00:00:16.740> renders<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
but most probably the game renders in a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.720 
but most probably the game renders in a
lower<00:00:17.640> resolution<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.539> then<00:00:19.080> app<00:00:19.230> scales

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
lower resolution and then app scales

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
lower resolution and then app scales
anyway<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:21.000> doing<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.359> right<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.289> game

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
anyway it's doing it right the game

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.779 
anyway it's doing it right the game
looks<00:00:22.680> sharp<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.369> framerate<00:00:23.609> is

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
looks sharp and the framerate is

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
looks sharp and the framerate is
perfectly<00:00:24.359> fine<00:00:26.390> it<00:00:27.390> runs<00:00:27.660> between<00:00:27.840> 35<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.590> 45

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
perfectly fine it runs between 35 and 45

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.580 
perfectly fine it runs between 35 and 45
frames<00:00:29.609> per<00:00:29.910> second<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:30.960> definitely<00:00:31.199> have

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
frames per second so we definitely have

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.410 
frames per second so we definitely have
room<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:31.890> higher<00:00:32.340> graphics<00:00:32.790> settings<00:00:35.420> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
room for higher graphics settings the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.760 
room for higher graphics settings the
sims<00:00:36.660> 4<00:00:36.930> was<00:00:37.110> designed<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
sims 4 was designed to be a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.860 
sims 4 was designed to be a
multi-platform<00:00:38.309> title<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.180> therefore<00:00:39.660> it's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
multi-platform title and therefore it's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.860 
multi-platform title and therefore it's
a<00:00:39.960> native<00:00:40.350> OSX<00:00:40.829> game<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.399> runs<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.660> well

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
a native OSX game and runs just as well

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.700 
a native OSX game and runs just as well
on<00:00:42.899> OSX<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.920> Windows<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:46.200> fan<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.620> spinning

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
on OSX as on Windows the fan is spinning

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
on OSX as on Windows the fan is spinning
up<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.160> bit<00:00:47.309> during<00:00:47.489> games<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.360> play

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
up a bit during games so if you play

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.810 
up a bit during games so if you play
without<00:00:48.809> sound<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> silent

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
without sound and you are in a silent

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.779 
without sound and you are in a silent
room<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.600> hear<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.079> definitely<00:00:52.890> but

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
room then you can hear it definitely but

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
room then you can hear it definitely but
normally<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.510> disturbing<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
normally it's not disturbing because of

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.340 
normally it's not disturbing because of
the<00:00:55.770> game<00:00:55.980> music<00:00:59.210> obviously<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.780> MacBook<00:01:01.109> Pro

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the game music obviously the MacBook Pro

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.799 
the game music obviously the MacBook Pro
gets<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.980> bit<00:01:02.160> warm<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> big

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
gets a bit warm but it's not a big

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
gets a bit warm but it's not a big
problem<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.710> hot<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.489> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
problem it's not that hot that you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:15.419 
problem it's not that hot that you
cannot<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.260> still<00:01:07.500> ok

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.639 

on<00:01:16.429> medium<00:01:17.030> settings<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.750> with<00:01:18.020> laptop<00:01:18.439> mode

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
on medium settings and with laptop mode

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.490 
on medium settings and with laptop mode
on<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.700> game<00:01:19.880> looks<00:01:20.119> much<00:01:20.390> much<00:01:20.780> better<00:01:21.049> and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
on the game looks much much better and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.880 
on the game looks much much better and
the<00:01:22.189> iris<00:01:22.460> 6100<00:01:23.299> IGP<00:01:23.780> can<00:01:24.049> still<00:01:24.350> handle<00:01:24.770> the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
the iris 6100 IGP can still handle the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.330 
the iris 6100 IGP can still handle the
game<00:01:25.039> pretty<00:01:25.310> well<00:01:25.609> at<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.090> level<00:01:27.189> we<00:01:28.189> got

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
game pretty well at this level we got

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.260 
game pretty well at this level we got
around<00:01:29.170> 28<00:01:30.170> 35<00:01:30.950> frames<00:01:31.310> per<00:01:31.490> second<00:01:31.909> which<00:01:32.090> is

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
around 28 35 frames per second which is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.149 
around 28 35 frames per second which is
pretty<00:01:32.719> good<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.289> it's<00:01:33.469> enough<00:01:33.829> for<00:01:34.069> this

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
pretty good and it's enough for this

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.029 
pretty good and it's enough for this
kind<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:34.520> game<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:35.350> definitely<00:01:36.350> recommend<00:01:36.649> this

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
kind of game I definitely recommend this

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.240 
kind of game I definitely recommend this
setting<00:01:37.719> it<00:01:38.719> looks<00:01:39.020> good<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.500> runs<00:01:39.799> smooth

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
setting it looks good and runs smooth

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.789 
setting it looks good and runs smooth
even<00:01:40.759> if<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.119> zoom<00:01:41.780> out<00:01:41.959> or<00:01:42.109> speed<00:01:42.530> up<00:01:42.649> the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
even if you zoom out or speed up the

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.919 
even if you zoom out or speed up the
time<00:01:43.009> or<00:01:43.310> have<00:01:43.369> several<00:01:43.939> sims<00:01:44.329> on<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.750> same

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
time or have several sims on the same

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.589 
time or have several sims on the same
screen<00:01:48.189> also<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.640> game<00:01:49.819> interface<00:01:50.090> feels

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:50.599 
screen also the game interface feels

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:53.020 
screen also the game interface feels
pretty<00:01:51.229> smooth<00:01:51.619> it's<00:01:52.009> responsive<00:01:52.700> it's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
pretty smooth it's responsive it's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.199 
pretty smooth it's responsive it's
catching<00:01:54.020> up<00:01:54.349> all<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.969> rotation<00:01:55.969> and

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
catching up all the rotation and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:57.969 
catching up all the rotation and
dragging<00:01:56.630> commands<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.380> it's<00:01:57.530> it's<00:01:57.739> working

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
dragging commands so it's it's working

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.479 
dragging commands so it's it's working
fine<00:01:58.810> it's<00:01:59.810> not<00:02:00.020> like<00:02:00.200> sims<00:02:00.500> 3<00:02:00.560> which<00:02:01.280> was

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:01.489 
fine it's not like sims 3 which was

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.490 
fine it's not like sims 3 which was
lagging<00:02:01.759> with<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.450> interface<00:02:02.899> it's<00:02:03.259> it's

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
lagging with the interface it's it's

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.530 
lagging with the interface it's it's
running<00:02:04.129> really<00:02:04.340> well

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.810 

now<00:02:11.540> if<00:02:11.930> we<00:02:12.200> keep<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.620> medium<00:02:12.980> settings<00:02:13.430> but

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
now if we keep the medium settings but

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.630 
now if we keep the medium settings but
we<00:02:13.970> turn<00:02:14.210> off<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.780> laptop<00:02:15.230> mode<00:02:15.410> then<00:02:16.340> it

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
we turn off the laptop mode then it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.590 
we turn off the laptop mode then it
causes<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:18.020> framerate<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.680> drop<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.160> lot<00:02:19.600> we

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
causes the framerate to drop a lot we

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.310 
causes the framerate to drop a lot we
get<00:02:20.780> around<00:02:21.110> 14<00:02:21.920> 15<00:02:22.550> frames<00:02:23.270> per<00:02:23.570> second<00:02:23.990> which

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
get around 14 15 frames per second which

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
get around 14 15 frames per second which
is<00:02:24.350> pretty<00:02:24.830> much<00:02:25.520> unplayable<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.570> would<00:02:26.900> say<00:02:27.340> if

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
is pretty much unplayable I would say if

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
is pretty much unplayable I would say if
you<00:02:28.610> are<00:02:28.760> watching<00:02:29.300> this<00:02:29.540> video<00:02:29.870> with<00:02:30.490> 720p<00:02:31.490> 60

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
you are watching this video with 720p 60

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.350 
you are watching this video with 720p 60
frames<00:02:32.570> per<00:02:32.630> second<00:02:33.110> then<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.490> can<00:02:34.700> see<00:02:34.940> how

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
frames per second then you can see how

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.310 
frames per second then you can see how
smooth<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.260> mouse<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.710> but<00:02:37.100> how<00:02:37.310> jerky<00:02:37.880> the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
smooth the mouse is but how jerky the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:46.300 
smooth the mouse is but how jerky the
scrolling<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> game<00:02:39.860> is

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.300 

if<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:48.000> go<00:02:48.150> even<00:02:48.360> further<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.170> set<00:02:50.069> high

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
if we go even further and set high

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.330 
if we go even further and set high
settings<00:02:50.819> without<00:02:51.090> laptop<00:02:51.720> mode<00:02:51.950> then<00:02:52.950> I

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
settings without laptop mode then I

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.670 
settings without laptop mode then I
think<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.510> game<00:02:54.690> looks<00:02:54.959> pretty<00:02:55.050> much<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
think the game looks pretty much the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.850 
think the game looks pretty much the
same<00:02:55.890> as<00:02:56.129> a<00:02:56.220> medium<00:02:56.670> for<00:02:57.269> me<00:02:57.450> okay<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.500> might

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
same as a medium for me okay you might

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.670 
same as a medium for me okay you might
have<00:02:59.160> sharper<00:02:59.910> textures<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.780> smoother<00:03:01.200> edges

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
have sharper textures and smoother edges

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.610 
have sharper textures and smoother edges
and<00:03:02.220> finer<00:03:02.489> shadows<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.750> really<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.379> doesn't

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
and finer shadows but really it doesn't

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.070 
and finer shadows but really it doesn't
add<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.190> much<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.849> game<00:03:06.000> experience<00:03:06.420> and

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
add that much to the game experience and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.150 
add that much to the game experience and
the<00:03:07.560> framerate<00:03:07.860> gets<00:03:08.280> really<00:03:09.000> low<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:10.160> get

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
the framerate gets really low we get

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.570 
the framerate gets really low we get
around<00:03:11.400> seven<00:03:12.060> eight<00:03:12.420> frames<00:03:13.140> per<00:03:13.410> second<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
around seven eight frames per second the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.640 
around seven eight frames per second the
interface<00:03:15.060> legs<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.080> scrolling<00:03:16.530> is

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
interface legs and the scrolling is

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.949 
interface legs and the scrolling is
jerky<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.310> sometimes<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.450> doesn't<00:03:18.690> always

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
jerky and sometimes it doesn't always

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.199 
jerky and sometimes it doesn't always
register<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.860> mouse<00:03:20.040> dragging<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:20.910> it's<00:03:21.060> not

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
register the mouse dragging so it's not

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.380 
register the mouse dragging so it's not
easy<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.750> rotate<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.349> camera<00:03:22.760> however<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
easy to rotate the camera however the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.809 
easy to rotate the camera however the
mouse<00:03:24.569> cursor<00:03:24.870> itself<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.980> perfectly<00:03:26.489> smooth

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
mouse cursor itself is perfectly smooth

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.089 
mouse cursor itself is perfectly smooth
which<00:03:27.569> is<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.750> very<00:03:27.989> good<00:03:28.049> thing<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.829> really

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
which is a very good thing and it really

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.250 
which is a very good thing and it really
helps<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.519> have<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.790> nice<00:03:30.030> gaming<00:03:30.329> experience

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
helps to have a nice gaming experience

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.589 
helps to have a nice gaming experience
because<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.310> don't<00:03:32.519> feel<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:33.120> your<00:03:33.239> average

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
because you don't feel then your average

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.130 
because you don't feel then your average
25<00:03:34.319> frames<00:03:34.680> per<00:03:34.739> second<00:03:35.250> drops<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.910> 15<00:03:36.629> for<00:03:37.110> a

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
25 frames per second drops to 15 for a

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.750 
25 frames per second drops to 15 for a
second<00:03:37.590> because<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.250> mouse<00:03:38.400> remains

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
second because the mouse remains

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.150 
second because the mouse remains
perfectly<00:03:39.239> smooth<00:03:39.599> so<00:03:40.319> that's<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.010> good<00:03:41.129> thing
