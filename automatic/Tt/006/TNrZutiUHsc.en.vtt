looking<00:03:07.180> at<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:07.359> by<00:03:07.510> looking<00:03:07.810> at<00:03:07.840> this<00:03:07.959> color

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
looking at just by looking at this color

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.319 
looking at just by looking at this color
it's<00:03:08.859> probably<00:03:09.190> not<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> color<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.030> would

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
it's probably not a color that I would

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.390 
it's probably not a color that I would
kind<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.840> gravitate<00:03:11.320> towards<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.250> actually

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
kind of gravitate towards but I actually

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.770 
kind of gravitate towards but I actually
ended<00:03:12.730> up<00:03:12.940> really<00:03:13.329> really<00:03:13.600> loving<00:03:13.959> this<00:03:14.049> color

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.880 

I<00:03:19.270> know<00:03:20.270> is<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.660> mixture<00:03:21.020> between<00:03:21.110> like<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.590> new

I know is a mixture between like a new

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.449 
I know is a mixture between like a new
tea<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.120> brick<00:03:23.450> red<00:03:23.840> kind<00:03:24.770> of<00:03:24.830> orange<00:03:25.190> color

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
tea and a brick red kind of orange color

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.100 
tea and a brick red kind of orange color
