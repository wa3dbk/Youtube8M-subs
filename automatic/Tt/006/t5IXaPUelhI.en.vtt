00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
they're the small pellets right here and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.600 
they're the small pellets right here and
what<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.580> will<00:01:17.970> grab<00:01:18.390> some<00:01:19.610> of

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
what I do is just I will grab some of

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.660 
what I do is just I will grab some of
them

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.880 

and<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.390> put<00:01:24.600> them<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.110> little<00:01:25.380> dish<00:01:25.710> right

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and I put them on this little dish right

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.719 
and I put them on this little dish right
here<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.940> after<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.159> grabbed<00:01:32.580> a

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
here and after that I just grabbed a

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
here and after that I just grabbed a
spoon<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.800> crushed<00:01:35.130> them<00:01:35.340> slightly<00:01:36.710> just

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
spoon and I crushed them slightly just

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.710 
spoon and I crushed them slightly just
so<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> fish<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.550> be<00:01:38.700> able<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.090> eat<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.479> at

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so the fish will be able to eat them at

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.780 
so the fish will be able to eat them at
their<00:01:39.900> full<00:01:40.140> size<00:01:40.440> they<00:01:40.920> won't<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.310> able<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
their full size they won't be able to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.050 
their full size they won't be able to
eat<00:01:41.970> them<00:01:42.240> doesn't<00:01:42.720> fit<00:01:42.900> their<00:01:43.110> mouth<00:01:43.350> they're

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
eat them doesn't fit their mouth they're

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.550 
eat them doesn't fit their mouth they're
still<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> bit<00:01:45.360> small<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:49.350> how

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
still a bit small for that so that's how

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.140 
still a bit small for that so that's how
what<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> looks<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.280> after<00:01:50.759> they've<00:01:50.940> been

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150
