00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the answer to that question seems to lie

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
the answer to that question seems to lie
in<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> concept<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> self<00:00:49.379> compassion<00:00:49.850> now

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
in the concept of self compassion now

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.000 
in the concept of self compassion now
whereas<00:00:51.149> self<00:00:51.360> esteem<00:00:51.750> involves<00:00:52.530> how<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:52.949> do

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
whereas self esteem involves how good do

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.799 
whereas self esteem involves how good do
you<00:00:53.039> feel<00:00:53.129> about<00:00:53.489> yourself<00:00:53.670> how<00:00:54.120> positively

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
do you evaluate yourself self compassion

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.569 
do you evaluate yourself self compassion
involves<00:00:57.840> how<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.559> treat<00:00:58.859> yourself<00:00:59.070> when

goofed it up badly until one of my
graduate<00:01:47.729> students<00:01:48.060> had<00:01:48.210> been<00:01:48.240> working<00:01:48.479> on

this<00:01:48.780> line<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.110> research<00:01:49.200> said<00:01:49.590> dr.<00:01:50.130> Leary

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
this line of research said dr. Leary

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.149 
this line of research said dr. Leary
just<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.329> compassion<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:52.110> yourself<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.829> it

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
just have compassion on yourself and it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.100 
just have compassion on yourself and it
really<00:01:53.310> did<00:01:53.549> changed<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> frame<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.899> makes

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
really did changed the frame it makes

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.749 
really did changed the frame it makes
you<00:01:55.259> sort<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> stop<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.890> think<00:01:56.040> well<00:01:56.610> yeah

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you sort of stop and think well yeah

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
you sort of stop and think well yeah
everybody<00:01:57.299> goofs<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.689> now<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.380> bad

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
everybody goofs up now and then it's bad

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.249 
everybody goofs up now and then it's bad
I<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:59.100> fix<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> but<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.090> don't<00:02:00.329> need<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> agonize

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I can fix it but I don't need to agonize

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.760 
I can fix it but I don't need to agonize
over<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.680> well<00:02:02.399> one<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> our<00:02:02.700> concerns<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.390> is

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
over it well one of our concerns was is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.950 
over it well one of our concerns was is
it<00:02:04.770> possible<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.460> person<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.570> self

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
it possible for a person to be so self

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.630 
it possible for a person to be so self
compassionate<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.979> they<00:02:08.099> become<00:02:08.399> self

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
compassionate that they become self

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.609 
compassionate that they become self
indulgent<00:02:09.209> because<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.200> sense<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.500> can

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
indulgent because in a sense you can

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.420 
indulgent because in a sense you can
think<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.890> person<00:02:11.190> who's<00:02:11.310> really

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
think of a person who's really

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.830 
think of a person who's really
compassionate<00:02:12.060> toward<00:02:12.209> themselves<00:02:12.629> just

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
compassionate toward themselves just

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.710 
compassionate toward themselves just
cutting<00:02:13.170> themselves

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
cutting themselves

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.540 
cutting themselves
so<00:02:13.990> much<00:02:14.230> slack<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:15.070> they<00:02:15.220> never<00:02:15.400> take

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
so much slack that they never take

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.520 
so much slack that they never take
responsibility<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:16.330> what<00:02:16.570> they<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:16.750> or<00:02:17.110> never

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
responsibility for what they do or never

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.140 
responsibility for what they do or never
even<00:02:17.590> admit<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.250> they<00:02:18.340> make<00:02:18.520> mistakes<00:02:18.910> they

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
even admit that they make mistakes they

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.970 
even admit that they make mistakes they
just<00:02:19.390> dance<00:02:19.990> through<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> garden<00:02:20.710> when<00:02:20.830> bad

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
just dance through the garden when bad

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.580 
just dance through the garden when bad
things<00:02:21.010> happen<00:02:21.310> our<00:02:22.180> research<00:02:22.600> suggests<00:02:23.050> that

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
things happen our research suggests that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.710 
things happen our research suggests that
is<00:02:23.710> not<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.010> case<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.970> people<00:02:25.270> who<00:02:25.450> are<00:02:25.540> self

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
is not the case that people who are self

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.910 
is not the case that people who are self
compassionate<00:02:26.320> take<00:02:26.560> full<00:02:26.890> responsibility

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
compassionate take full responsibility

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.190 
compassionate take full responsibility
for<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.090> bad<00:02:28.240> things<00:02:28.270> they<00:02:28.690> do<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:28.900> their

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
for the bad things they do for their

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.750 
for the bad things they do for their
failures<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.710> their<00:02:30.010> losses<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.550> their

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
failures and their losses and their

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.790 
failures and their losses and their
goof-ups<00:02:31.150> they<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.110> don't<00:02:32.260> feel<00:02:32.410> quite<00:02:32.650> as

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
goof-ups they just don't feel quite as

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.470 
goof-ups they just don't feel quite as
badly<00:02:33.130> about<00:02:33.340> them<00:02:33.550> yeah<00:02:33.940> they<00:02:34.060> still<00:02:34.240> feel

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
badly about them yeah they still feel

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.960 
badly about them yeah they still feel
bad<00:02:34.690> but<00:02:35.050> they<00:02:35.200> don't<00:02:35.590> add<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.130> extra<00:02:36.370> layer

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
bad but they don't add that extra layer

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.420 
bad but they don't add that extra layer
of<00:02:37.170> catastrophe<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:38.770> many<00:02:38.890> people<00:02:39.220> do

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
of catastrophe that so many people do

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.300 
of catastrophe that so many people do
when<00:02:39.610> bad<00:02:39.760> things<00:02:39.790> happen
