00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.889 

so<00:00:00.359> today<00:00:00.659> we're<00:00:00.840> making<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:02.179> yeast<00:00:03.179> starter

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
so today we're making a yeast starter

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.809 
so today we're making a yeast starter
we're<00:00:04.560> starting<00:00:04.830> with<00:00:04.920> 2<00:00:05.100> cups<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.460> water<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
we're starting with 2 cups of water and

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.629 
we're starting with 2 cups of water and
1/2<00:00:06.270> cup<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.690> DME<00:00:08.300> use<00:00:09.300> your<00:00:09.480> water<00:00:09.690> boiling

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
1/2 cup of DME use your water boiling

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.850 
1/2 cup of DME use your water boiling
and<00:00:11.639> add<00:00:11.790> your<00:00:11.940> D<00:00:12.090> me<00:00:12.290> so<00:00:13.290> once<00:00:13.440> your<00:00:13.559> two<00:00:13.650> cups

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
and add your D me so once your two cups

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.499 
and add your D me so once your two cups
of<00:00:13.950> water's<00:00:14.250> boiling<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:15.000> had<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.330> cup

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
of water's boiling you had you have cup

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.400 
of water's boiling you had you have cup
of<00:00:15.630> DME<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.940> I<00:00:17.940> like<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.330> add<00:00:18.449> true<00:00:19.199> hot

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
of DME and I like to add true hot

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.980 
of DME and I like to add true hot
pellets<00:00:20.210> because<00:00:21.210> then<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.510> really<00:00:21.660> mimic

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
pellets because then you really mimic

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.150 
pellets because then you really mimic
the<00:00:22.109> environment<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.590> your<00:00:22.740> beer<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.010> gonna

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the environment that your beer is gonna

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.000 
the environment that your beer is gonna
be<00:00:23.279> fermenting<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.570> once<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.990> water<00:00:25.769> gets

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
be fermenting in so once that water gets

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.410 
be fermenting in so once that water gets
blown<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.490> got<00:00:26.609> your<00:00:26.730> DME<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.090> there<00:00:27.269> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
blown and you got your DME in there I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.349 
blown and you got your DME in there I
like<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.320> get<00:00:28.500> my<00:00:28.560> starter<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.269> use<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
like to get my starter going I use a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.990 
like to get my starter going I use a
half<00:00:30.449> gallon<00:00:30.750> quart<00:00:30.779> holder<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.759> right

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
half gallon quart holder and so right

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.340 
half gallon quart holder and so right
now<00:00:33.030> before<00:00:33.600> we're<00:00:33.690> gonna<00:00:33.750> add<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> yeast<00:00:34.200> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
now before we're gonna add the yeast and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.810 
now before we're gonna add the yeast and
everything<00:00:34.620> else<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> get

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
everything else in here when you get

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.720 
everything else in here when you get
this<00:00:35.940> thing<00:00:36.149> sanitized<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:40.399> one<00:00:41.399> reason<00:00:41.670> I

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
this thing sanitized up one reason I

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.670 
this thing sanitized up one reason I
like<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> use<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.360> wider<00:00:42.629> pot<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.290> two<00:00:43.410> cups

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
like to use the wider pot for two cups

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.080 
like to use the wider pot for two cups
is<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.579> cool<00:00:44.760> down<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
is so that when I cool down in the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.970 
is so that when I cool down in the
fridge<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.629> surface<00:00:45.930> area<00:00:46.110> cools<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.530> faster

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
fridge the surface area cools it faster

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.790 
fridge the surface area cools it faster
but<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.370> negative<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.410> water

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
but one negative here is that the water

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
but one negative here is that the water
escapes<00:00:50.219> faster<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.760> more<00:00:50.789> surface<00:00:51.120> area

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
escapes faster with more surface area

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.389 
escapes faster with more surface area
exposed<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> air<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:53.070> could<00:00:53.219> put<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
exposed to the air so you could put a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.680 
exposed to the air so you could put a
lid<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.090> would<00:00:54.210> minimize<00:00:54.329> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
lid on this and that would minimize it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.959 
lid on this and that would minimize it
or<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:55.370> start<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> little<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.730> more

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
or just start with a little bit more

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.310 
or just start with a little bit more
than<00:00:57.120> 2<00:00:57.210> cups<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.510> water<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.840> playing<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
than 2 cups of water and playing for the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
than 2 cups of water and playing for the
boil<00:00:58.500> off<00:00:58.739> which<00:01:00.469> doing<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.820> 15

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
boil off which doing right here so 15

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.030 
boil off which doing right here so 15
minutes<00:01:03.270> cut<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> heat<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.199> put<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
minutes cut the heat and put this in the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.420 
minutes cut the heat and put this in the
fridge<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.880> let<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.080> cool<00:01:07.380> down<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:08.130> at

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
fridge and let this cool down to at

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.690 
fridge and let this cool down to at
least<00:01:08.610> under<00:01:08.880> 80<00:01:09.030> degrees<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:10.610> breaking<00:01:11.610> their

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
least under 80 degrees or breaking their

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.649 
least under 80 degrees or breaking their
pitching<00:01:12.000> temp<00:01:14.030> all<00:01:15.030> right<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
pitching temp all right this is the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.120 
pitching temp all right this is the
yeast<00:01:15.840> left<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.290> poured<00:01:16.560> off<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> rest<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
yeast left I poured off the rest of the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.649 
yeast left I poured off the rest of the
liquid<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.909> same<00:01:18.119> ease<00:01:18.330> from<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
liquid this is the same ease from the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
liquid this is the same ease from the
other<00:01:18.780> video<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> when<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.439> watch<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.860> yeast

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
other video and when we watch the yeast

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.630 
other video and when we watch the yeast
and<00:01:20.820> now<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.030> gonna<00:01:21.119> add<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.640> stir

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and now we're gonna add that to stir

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300 
and now we're gonna add that to stir
their<00:01:23.820> vessel<00:01:24.740> see<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> rest<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> yeast

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
their vessel see the rest of the yeast

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.560 
their vessel see the rest of the yeast
out<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> add<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.240> bit<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
out I like to add a little bit of the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510 
out I like to add a little bit of the
starter<00:01:27.869> liquid<00:01:28.229> you're<00:01:29.130> gonna<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.400> out

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
starter liquid you're gonna be out

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
starter liquid you're gonna be out
together<00:01:29.880> anyways<00:01:31.460> swirl<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.640> around<00:01:38.540> now

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
together anyways swirl that around now

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.800 
together anyways swirl that around now
we<00:01:39.600> got<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> yeast<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.439> sure<00:01:41.810> can

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
we got all the yeast of it that sure can

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.260 
we got all the yeast of it that sure can
you<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> rest<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.439> starter<00:01:43.770> mixture

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.310 

then<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.360> had<00:01:49.479> all<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.689> trouble<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.020> because

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
then I had all the trouble to because

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.389 
then I had all the trouble to because
it's<00:01:50.439> all<00:01:50.530> gonna<00:01:50.619> settle<00:01:50.890> all<00:01:51.040> in<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.250> East

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
it's all gonna settle all in the East

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.010 
it's all gonna settle all in the East
cake<00:01:51.610> but<00:01:51.820> it's<00:01:51.970> personal<00:01:52.420> preference<00:01:52.810> if<00:01:52.930> you

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
cake but it's personal preference if you

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.639 
cake but it's personal preference if you
don't<00:01:53.170> want<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.820> don't<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:56.170> instead<00:01:56.470> of<00:01:56.560> an

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
don't want to don't and instead of an

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.810 
don't want to don't and instead of an
airlock<00:01:56.890> on<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.159> started<00:01:57.430> we're<00:01:57.520> gonna<00:01:57.579> put

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
airlock on the started we're gonna put

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.190 
airlock on the started we're gonna put
tinfoil<00:01:58.240> because<00:01:58.539> you<00:01:58.720> kind<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.930> want<00:01:58.990> these

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
tinfoil because you kind of want these

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.990 
tinfoil because you kind of want these
yeast<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.920> get<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.070> lot<00:02:00.220> of<00:02:00.250> oxygen<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.759> idea

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
yeast to get a lot of oxygen the idea

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.219 
yeast to get a lot of oxygen the idea
the<00:02:01.119> starter<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.780> get<00:02:01.929> a<00:02:01.960> lot<00:02:02.140> of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
the starter is to get a lot of

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.080 
the starter is to get a lot of
reproduction<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.890> increase<00:02:03.729> your<00:02:03.880> number<00:02:04.030> of

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
reproduction and increase your number of

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.669 
reproduction and increase your number of
yeast<00:02:04.299> cells<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:04.990> these<00:02:05.229> guys<00:02:05.409> want

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
yeast cells and so these guys want

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.770 
yeast cells and so these guys want
oxygen<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.250> do<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.539> don't<00:02:07.689> use

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
oxygen to do that and so you don't use

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.970 
oxygen to do that and so you don't use
an<00:02:07.869> airlock<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.229> use<00:02:08.440> oil<00:02:11.489> as<00:02:12.489> your<00:02:12.730> start
