00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
scratch in the device so let's scratch

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.290 
scratch in the device so let's scratch
the<00:03:18.240> device<00:03:18.600> with<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.050> knife<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:21.060> will

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
the device with the knife and that will

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.120 
the device with the knife and that will
be<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:23.790> will<00:03:23.940> be<00:03:24.090> our<00:03:24.240> last<00:03:24.600> test<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:25.860> let

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
be the that will be our last test so let

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:59.930 
be the that will be our last test so let
me<00:03:26.780> apply<00:03:27.780> much<00:03:28.050> pressure

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.720 

so<00:04:00.420> let<00:04:00.600> me<00:04:00.720> clean<00:04:00.960> the<00:04:01.140> device<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:02.280> let's

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
so let me clean the device and let's

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.450 
so let me clean the device and let's
check<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.120> there<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.330> scratch<00:04:03.840> or<00:04:04.230> any<00:04:04.380> mark<00:04:05.040> and

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
check is there a scratch or any mark and

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.350 
check is there a scratch or any mark and
sport<00:04:05.910> anything

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:18.520 

so<00:04:10.900> let<00:04:11.170> me<00:04:11.200> allow<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.710> show<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.700> de<00:04:12.940> Vries

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.770 

okay<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.250> there<00:04:19.489> is<00:04:19.519> one<00:04:19.850> scratch<00:04:20.180> I<00:04:20.360> can<00:04:20.540> see

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
okay so there is one scratch I can see

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.680 
okay so there is one scratch I can see
here<00:04:21.049> it's<00:04:21.860> a<00:04:22.100> permanent<00:04:22.460> scratch<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.480> there
