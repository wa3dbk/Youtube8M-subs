for the intel i series 1155 socket does
i<00:00:15.240> will<00:00:15.839> be<00:00:15.960> using<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> motherboard

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
i will be using this is the motherboard

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.510 
i will be using this is the motherboard
for<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.609> hackintosh<00:00:18.830> the<00:00:19.830> main<00:00:19.980> reason<00:00:20.340> what

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
for the hackintosh the main reason what

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.099 
for the hackintosh the main reason what
going<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> because<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.930> one<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
going this one is because this is one of

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.769 
going this one is because this is one of
the<00:00:22.260> recommended<00:00:22.830> boards<00:00:23.250> used<00:00:24.000> by<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.300> Tony

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the recommended boards used by the Tony

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.330 
the recommended boards used by the Tony
Mack<00:00:25.279> x86<00:00:26.330> com<00:00:27.330> site<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.710> too<00:00:28.920> many

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
Mack x86 com site and they do too many

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.880 
Mack x86 com site and they do too many
of<00:00:29.519> their<00:00:29.640> custom<00:00:30.029> builds<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.560> board

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
of their custom builds on on this board

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.250 
of their custom builds on on this board
so<00:00:32.489> let's<00:00:32.669> take<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.880> look<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.350> lots<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:36.260> icons

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
so let's take a look at it lots of icons

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.030 
so let's take a look at it lots of icons
on<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.590> top<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.520> most<00:00:38.790> pretty<00:00:39.180> box<00:00:40.040> go

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
on the top not the most pretty box go

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.610 
on the top not the most pretty box go
inside<00:00:41.370> yet<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.059> here's<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.690> RAM<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.079> just

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
inside yet so here's the RAM I just

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.940 
inside yet so here's the RAM I just
slipped<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.489> beforehand<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.950> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
slipped that in there beforehand so it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.330 
slipped that in there beforehand so it
came<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.430> package<00:00:48.090> from<00:00:48.539> NCIX<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.070> got<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
came as a package from NCIX so I got a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.110 
came as a package from NCIX so I got a
package<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.270> Patriot<00:00:51.809> 8<00:00:52.770> gigahertz<00:00:53.219> dual

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
package of that Patriot 8 gigahertz dual

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.540 
package of that Patriot 8 gigahertz dual
channel<00:00:54.420> memory<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:55.500> 1600<00:00:56.160> megahertz<00:00:57.320> pc3

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
channel memory at 1600 megahertz pc3

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.340 
channel memory at 1600 megahertz pc3
1280<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> we'll<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.780> putting<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.320> there

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
1280 so we'll be putting that in there

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.270 
1280 so we'll be putting that in there
so<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> manuals<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:04.220> couple<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
so we have the manuals a couple of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.350 
so we have the manuals a couple of
stickers<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:07.729> an<00:01:08.729> SLI<00:01:10.970> connector<00:01:11.970> which<00:01:12.150> we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
stickers and an SLI connector which we

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
stickers and an SLI connector which we
most<00:01:12.810> likely<00:01:13.020> won't<00:01:13.409> use<00:01:13.650> since<00:01:13.950> we're<00:01:14.159> using

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
most likely won't use since we're using

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.240 
most likely won't use since we're using
it<00:01:14.610> radeon<00:01:15.509> ati<00:01:16.049> card<00:01:16.939> some<00:01:18.140> SATA<00:01:19.140> cables<00:01:19.680> come

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it radeon ati card some SATA cables come

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.280 
it radeon ati card some SATA cables come
with<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:21.720> i/o<00:01:22.500> guard<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.360> lot<00:01:25.170> of

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
with it the i/o guard there a lot of

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.420 
with it the i/o guard there a lot of
extra<00:01:25.710> stuff<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:28.619> once<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
extra stuff there and once just get to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.179 
extra stuff there and once just get to
the<00:01:29.520> main<00:01:29.729> part<00:01:30.060> here

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.190 

so<00:01:35.189> once<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.969> decent<00:01:36.450> from<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.689> reviews

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
so once it's a decent from the reviews

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.749 
so once it's a decent from the reviews
this<00:01:37.920> motherboard<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> decent<00:01:39.619> mid-range

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
this motherboard is a decent mid-range

of you know the typical arrangement the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.630 
of you know the typical arrangement the
good<00:02:22.049> thing<00:02:22.079> is<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.530> does<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.860> firewire<00:02:23.340> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
good thing is it does have firewire so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.970 
good thing is it does have firewire so
that<00:02:23.790> will<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.000> handy<00:02:24.390> for<00:02:24.980> hackintosh

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
that will be handy for hackintosh

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.759 
that will be handy for hackintosh
because<00:02:26.400> i<00:02:26.489> do<00:02:26.549> have<00:02:27.079> several<00:02:28.079> firewire
