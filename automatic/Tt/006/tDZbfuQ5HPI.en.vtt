edges<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.509> there<00:01:11.720> was<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:12.380> I'm<00:01:12.500> just<00:01:12.590> gonna

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
edges and there was so I'm just gonna

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.100 
edges and there was so I'm just gonna
reglue<00:01:13.310> them<00:01:13.340> down<00:01:13.790> not<00:01:14.150> all<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.479> way<00:01:14.630> just<00:01:14.990> on

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
the parts that are rigid or sticking up

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.260 
the parts that are rigid or sticking up
and<00:01:18.110> then<00:01:18.860> I'll<00:01:18.979> just<00:01:19.220> leave<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.700> rest<00:01:19.820> powder

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
and then I'll just leave the rest powder

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.139 
and then I'll just leave the rest powder
and<00:01:20.750> just<00:01:20.960> leave<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.380> as<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.860> because<00:01:22.640> brows

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
and just leave it as is because brows

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.700 
and just leave it as is because brows
are<00:01:23.360> very<00:01:23.509> delicate<00:01:23.690> especially<00:01:24.320> in<00:01:24.440> gluing

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
are very delicate especially in gluing

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.080 
are very delicate especially in gluing
them<00:01:24.799> down<00:01:25.009> this<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.460> very<00:01:25.670> complicated

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
them down this is a very complicated

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.830 
them down this is a very complicated
step<00:01:26.630> but<00:01:26.869> over<00:01:27.500> time<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:27.890> gets<00:01:27.950> easier<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.810> I

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
step but over time it gets easier so I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.289 
step but over time it gets easier so I
just<00:01:30.049> dust<00:01:30.320> everything<00:01:30.680> off<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.369> then<00:01:31.940> using

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
just dust everything off and then using

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.540 
just dust everything off and then using
my<00:01:32.330> dermablend<00:01:32.960> foundation<00:01:33.770> I'm<00:01:33.979> going<00:01:34.399> to

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
my dermablend foundation I'm going to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.540 
my dermablend foundation I'm going to
dab<00:01:34.819> that<00:01:35.030> onto<00:01:35.330> my<00:01:35.360> finger<00:01:36.080> because<00:01:37.039> it's<00:01:37.369> a

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
dab that onto my finger because it's a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.219 
dab that onto my finger because it's a
lot<00:01:37.700> more<00:01:37.819> delicate<00:01:38.000> using<00:01:38.630> my<00:01:38.720> finger<00:01:39.020> than<00:01:39.200> a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
lot more delicate using my finger than a

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.649 
lot more delicate using my finger than a
sponge<00:01:39.649> or<00:01:40.069> anything<00:01:40.520> really<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.390> just<00:01:41.539> use

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
sponge or anything really so I just use

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.840 
sponge or anything really so I just use
my<00:01:41.690> finger<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.140> kind<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.710> dab<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.009> on<00:01:43.429> to<00:01:43.729> the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
my finger and kind of dab that on to the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.059 
my finger and kind of dab that on to the
brows<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.420> then<00:01:44.509> I<00:01:44.690> powder<00:01:45.259> as<00:01:45.560> quickly<00:01:45.890> as

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
brows and then I powder as quickly as

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.740 
brows and then I powder as quickly as
possible<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.850> moisture<00:01:47.240> doesn't<00:01:47.420> lock

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
possible so the moisture doesn't lock

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.219 
possible so the moisture doesn't lock
into<00:01:48.020> my<00:01:48.110> brows<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.850> really<00:01:50.300> helps<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:50.840> mean<00:01:51.050> I

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
into my brows this really helps I mean I

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.809 
into my brows this really helps I mean I
don't<00:01:51.470> know<00:01:51.560> if<00:01:51.649> it's<00:01:51.770> even<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:52.039> true<00:01:52.340> like

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
don't know if it's even a true like

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.700 
don't know if it's even a true like
factual<00:01:53.360> statement<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:53.899> it's<00:01:54.049> gonna<00:01:54.470> lock

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
factual statement that it's gonna lock

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.010 
factual statement that it's gonna lock
moisture<00:01:54.979> in<00:01:55.369> using<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.240> foundation<00:01:56.780> but

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
moisture in using the foundation but

and using the bluish like deep blue

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.270 
and using the bluish like deep blue
color<00:02:19.060> I'm<00:02:19.420> going<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.830> kind<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.890> create<00:02:21.099> my

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
color I'm going to kind of create my

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.610 
color I'm going to kind of create my
crease<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.390> start<00:02:22.810> by<00:02:23.200> creating<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
crease and I start by creating the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.449 
crease and I start by creating the
crease<00:02:23.920> by<00:02:25.170> making<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.260> look<00:02:26.349> very<00:02:26.410> blended<00:02:27.069> so

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
crease by making it look very blended so

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.930 
crease by making it look very blended so
I<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:28.030> use<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.390> shadow<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.019> I<00:02:29.730> kind<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.760> go

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
I just use the shadow and I kind of go

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.420 
I just use the shadow and I kind of go
over<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.540> then<00:02:31.599> I<00:02:32.260> define<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.980> crease<00:02:33.160> at

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
over it and then I define the crease at

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.820 
over it and then I define the crease at
the<00:02:33.519> end<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.239> I'm<00:02:34.599> going<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:34.989> use<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.530> shadow

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
the end so I'm going to use the shadow

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.150 
the end so I'm going to use the shadow
and<00:02:36.310> create<00:02:36.370> my<00:02:37.030> crease<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.709> by<00:02:38.709> creating<00:02:38.920> my

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and create my crease and by creating my

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.740 
and create my crease and by creating my
crease<00:02:39.400> I'm<00:02:39.549> gonna<00:02:39.700> make<00:02:39.849> my<00:02:39.970> eye<00:02:40.000> look<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.510> lot

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.720 
crease I'm gonna make my eye look a lot
bigger<00:02:41.110> so<00:02:41.620> I'm<00:02:41.709> gonna<00:02:41.830> put<00:02:42.099> that<00:02:42.250> above<00:02:42.700> my

bigger so I'm gonna put that above my
actual<00:02:43.540> crease<00:02:43.810> because<00:02:43.989> if<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.260> fill<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.650> my

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
actual crease because if I fill in my

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
of small I am Asian so it's going to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.589 
of small I am Asian so it's going to
come<00:02:49.840> out<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:50.170> bit<00:02:50.620> tinier<00:02:51.519> than<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.180> regular

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
come out a bit tinier than the regular

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.979 
come out a bit tinier than the regular
hooded<00:02:52.989> eye<00:02:53.079> but<00:02:54.069> I'm<00:02:54.880> going<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.750> just

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
hooded eye but I'm going to just

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.420 
hooded eye but I'm going to just
recreate<00:02:56.349> my<00:02:56.620> crease<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.040> my<00:02:57.130> eye<00:02:57.160> looks

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
recreate my crease so my eye looks

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.229 
recreate my crease so my eye looks
bigger<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.590> magic<00:03:00.010> mirror<00:03:00.340> went<00:03:01.000> out

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
bigger and so the magic mirror went out

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.690 
bigger and so the magic mirror went out
of<00:03:01.540> light<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.739> had<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.190> move<00:03:03.340> into<00:03:03.519> another

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
of light so I had to move into another

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.150 
of light so I had to move into another
room<00:03:04.120> now<00:03:04.780> using<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.200> card<00:03:05.530> I'm<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:05.769> to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
room now using a card I'm going to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.819 
room now using a card I'm going to
create<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:06.730> angled<00:03:07.390> eye<00:03:07.599> shadow<00:03:07.690> look<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:08.709> it

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
create this angled eye shadow look so it

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.000 
create this angled eye shadow look so it
gets<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.190> more<00:03:09.519> sharp<00:03:10.120> effect<00:03:10.780> on<00:03:11.260> my<00:03:11.500> eyes<00:03:11.680> and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
gets a more sharp effect on my eyes and

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.740 
gets a more sharp effect on my eyes and
I'm<00:03:12.069> just<00:03:12.100> using<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.609> dark<00:03:12.850> blue<00:03:13.180> color<00:03:13.480> and

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
I'm just using that dark blue color and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.870 
I'm just using that dark blue color and
then<00:03:14.170> also<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.500> light<00:03:14.799> blue<00:03:15.010> color<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.400> kind<00:03:15.790> of

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
then also a light blue color to kind of

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.150 
then also a light blue color to kind of
contrast<00:03:16.239> with<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:16.900> make<00:03:17.019> it<00:03:17.049> really<00:03:17.319> pop

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.650 

aside<00:03:21.160> from<00:03:21.370> using<00:03:21.609> that<00:03:21.880> light<00:03:22.120> blue<00:03:22.329> color

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
aside from using that light blue color

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.360 
aside from using that light blue color
I'm<00:03:22.900> also<00:03:23.049> going<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.319> be<00:03:23.440> putting<00:03:23.560> silver<00:03:24.160> in

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
I'm also going to be putting silver in

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.789 
I'm also going to be putting silver in
to<00:03:24.940> where<00:03:25.060> my<00:03:25.180> actual<00:03:25.720> creases<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
to where my actual creases and on the

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.550 
to where my actual creases and on the
actual<00:03:27.459> lid<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.970> my<00:03:28.120> eye<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.200> way<00:03:29.380> it

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
actual lid of my eye so that way it

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.170 
actual lid of my eye so that way it
really<00:03:29.769> contrasts<00:03:30.370> with<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.579> crease<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.120> you

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
really contrasts with the crease and you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.270 
really contrasts with the crease and you
can<00:03:31.359> tell<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.840> that's<00:03:31.959> where<00:03:32.530> my<00:03:32.650> new<00:03:32.920> crease

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
can tell that that's where my new crease

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.940 
can tell that that's where my new crease
is<00:03:33.489> placed<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.150> doesn't<00:03:34.420> look<00:03:34.630> so<00:03:34.950> fake

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
is placed and it doesn't look so fake

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.370 
is placed and it doesn't look so fake
really<00:03:36.639> um<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:37.299> mean<00:03:37.630> of<00:03:37.720> course<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.989> looks<00:03:38.139> fake

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
really um I mean of course it looks fake

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:53.059 
really um I mean of course it looks fake
but<00:03:38.620> whatever<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:40.750> need

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.280 

it's<00:03:54.069> like<00:03:54.400> what<00:03:54.700> I'll<00:03:55.000> just<00:03:55.270> pass<00:03:55.599> you<00:03:55.870> it's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
it's like what I'll just pass you it's

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.839 
it's like what I'll just pass you it's
just<00:03:56.530> still<00:03:56.890> keep<00:03:57.190> going<00:03:59.250> so<00:04:00.250> once<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.520> blended

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
just still keep going so once I blended

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.880 
just still keep going so once I blended
that<00:04:00.910> out<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.690> looks<00:04:01.900> like<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.260> magic<00:04:02.500> has

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
that out it looks like the magic has

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.350 
that out it looks like the magic has
went<00:04:03.099> back<00:04:03.250> into<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.640> mirror<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.120> I'm<00:04:04.209> back

allows the lip color to stay on stronger

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.850 
allows the lip color to stay on stronger
whatever<00:05:52.790> longer<00:05:53.480> stronger<00:05:53.990> whatever<00:05:54.650> it

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.300 
whatever longer stronger whatever it
might<00:05:55.010> be

might be

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.430 
might be
I<00:05:55.550> just<00:05:55.760> heard<00:05:55.970> it<00:05:56.210> so<00:05:56.510> I<00:05:56.540> figured<00:05:57.020> it<00:05:57.140> might<00:05:57.170> be

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.550

true<00:05:57.650> so<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.430> did<00:05:58.670> it<00:05:58.820> and<00:05:58.940> it<00:05:59.600> works<00:05:59.900> so<00:06:00.050> far<00:06:00.320> I

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
true so I did it and it works so far I

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.200 
true so I did it and it works so far I
mean<00:06:00.860> it's<00:06:01.040> really<00:06:01.220> made<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.610> lip<00:06:01.760> color<00:06:01.940> kind

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
of look a bit more vibrant because it

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.590

really go into depth and detail of my
contour<00:06:21.710> and<00:06:21.740> brows<00:06:21.980> because<00:06:22.190> I'm<00:06:22.400> not<00:06:22.520> the

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
best at either of those but I figured I

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.320 
best at either of those but I figured I
just<00:06:24.860> you<00:06:25.490> know<00:06:25.520> do<00:06:25.820> it<00:06:25.850> anyway

just you know do it anyway

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.150 
just you know do it anyway

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
so using the electro palette I'm

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.800 
so using the electro palette I'm
actually<00:06:28.310> going<00:06:28.520> to<00:06:28.580> use<00:06:28.669> this<00:06:29.090> pink<00:06:29.390> color<00:06:29.660> as
