00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.950
 Many will say that I have sold myself and others 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.799
 but what do you want the big ones to tell you? 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.820
 Pleasures are worth money and I am very 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.820
 whimsical and 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.980
 for you 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.380
 the passing of people is risky and good 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.349
 I come well dressed and well uniformed 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.650
 to inform you about these two new 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.500
 components that I have assigned myself agency 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.110
 sexualized on my pc both of ms and one 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.420
 they are a graphics card it records the are 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.410
 very nice a graphics card and a 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.670
 new motherboard graphics card gtx 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.520
 980 you have gone well 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.199
 despite being Andalusian which is one of the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.260
 most powerful in the market in the 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.329
 present and a new motherboard the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.250
 which has many new technologies 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.470
 new technologies that there was not before and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.870
 which will serve you for those who 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.670
 you are gamers go I'm freaking 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.920
 basically because I shot this 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.170
 tomorrow and with this basically with the 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.369
 graphic card this new dsi as os 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.869
 I said that you will have more powerful of the 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.930
 market I'm practically playing 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.030
 all the games in a power go from 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.060
 a way that if it gave me 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.350
 sensuality playing with this and go 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.360
 They make my hair stand on end only 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.060
 talk about it so nothing I'm going to talk about 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.830
 the specifications of each one and we 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.420
 we see in the next video see you later 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.970
 good people can here we have the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.920
 graph gtx 986 gb gddr5 and let's go to it 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.980
 to begin with let's talk about our 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.440
 heatsink that is a current ford 5 the 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.870
 which will keep our gpu down 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.790
 temperature comes with an application that 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.710
 It serves to overclock one's own 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.990
 graph in which you have three modes 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.260
 mode overclock mode gaming and mode 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.540
 silence brings two fans called 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.060
 torch band that serves so that the graph 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.340
 have a good eye flow the super your country 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.050
 They will be responsible for the heat dissipation 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.370
 steel technology frob will make the 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.620
 fans when there is low 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.010
 temperature are off the memory 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.560
 bass of the graph is 384 bits 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.360
 we will have dvi hdmi connection and 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.810
 displayport for 3 because as I am 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.180
 Andalusian 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.250
 I have to cover a lot obviously this 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.410
 graphic is ready to handle 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.970
 with nvidia if I have to remind you that 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.880
 these graphs is already prepared for 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.400
 be connected to a pci express 3.0 it 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.200
 can also use in a 2.0 but it 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.810
 recommends a 3.0 so you have your 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.430
 greater sensual potential and remember that 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.819
 this range of graphics is already prepared 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.830
 for him 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.620
 12 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.080
 and now I bring you the motherboard z 97 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.620
 gaming 6 and I tell you its specifications 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.230
 sensual comes with a usb 3.1 which 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.060
 the difference with 3.0 is that 3.0 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.640
 makes a data transfer of 5 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.260
 gigabytes per second and instead the 3.1 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.480
 it does double 10 gigabytes per 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.790
 second comes prepared with multi gpu and 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.070
 what that means means that we can 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.980
 connect several graphics on this board 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.120
 base and we can be a slide on crossfire 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.710
 it also comes as with the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.930
 graphic with an application to do 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.150
 overclock to the processor one thing 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.680
 important is that it includes the exploit that 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.970
 who do not know is a program that 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.370
 use to stream either in 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.310
 youtube in tweet or anywhere 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.230
 web pages and what is good is that 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.840
 this brings a six-month license 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.980
 to be used with the motherboard 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.630
 good and now for the gamers I'm going to 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.270
 say a little thing that I assure you see me 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.940
 love and is that this motherboard brings a 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.890
 2200 killer network card 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.780
 game networking that what it will do is that 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.700
 while we are playing there is a greater 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.250
 traffic towards the game and this optimize 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.560
 what is being the online comes 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.400
 with a built-in audio power usb that 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.530
 this will cause when 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.870
 we have our helmets to the computer there 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.790
 to a very great improved quality of 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.739
 sound also say that this motherboard 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.689
 has a socket lga1156 z 97 that is 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.030
 prepared for gaming and one thing that 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:56.239
 I did not say is that the audio voice 2 accepts 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.340
 until stress 7.1 was going to say 7 but 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.379
 As I am Andalusian I correct myself I am the cock 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.750
 and finally tell the connections 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.329
 rear that has the motherboard that are 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.530
 a ps2 port to connect keyboard or 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:13.459
 mouse two ports usb 2.0 a connection 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:18.799
 vga another connection dvi another hdmi connection 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.600
 2 usb 3.0 optical audio a usb 3.1 la 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.930
 network card and sound card 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.139
 7.1 and with this this video ends up 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.139
 then
