it<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.949> unfortunate<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.789> do<00:00:17.880> know<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.480> is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
it is unfortunate that I do know what is

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.779 
it is unfortunate that I do know what is
already<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.109> here<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> reason<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.760> that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
already in here but the reason for that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.480 
already in here but the reason for that
is<00:00:20.910> because<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.810> got<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.260> after<00:00:22.949> my<00:00:23.100> friends

got it and so they posted pictures and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
got it and so they posted pictures and
such<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.150> facebook<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.840> wasn't<00:00:28.199> he<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.740> this
