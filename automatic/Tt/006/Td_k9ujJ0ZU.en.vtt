00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
remember you've got a controller I mean
usually<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:52.380> don't<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> mouse<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
usually you don't have a mouse and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.010 
usually you don't have a mouse and
keyboard<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.329> kind<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.600> stuff<00:01:54.659> if

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
keyboard and that kind of stuff if

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
keyboard and that kind of stuff if
there's<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.439> lot<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.680> buttons<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.369> press

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
there's a lot of buttons to press

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.480 
there's a lot of buttons to press
everything<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.450> that's<00:01:58.290> good<00:01:58.560> but

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
everything like that and that's good but

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.340 
everything like that and that's good but
the<00:01:59.759> only<00:01:59.909> problem<00:02:00.180> with<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.600> controller<00:02:01.170> when

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the only problem with a controller when

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350 
the only problem with a controller when
you<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.710> about<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.610> understand<00:02:03.240> how

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you think about it is I understand how

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.580 
you think about it is I understand how
it<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.570> work<00:02:03.630> actually<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.350> mean<00:02:04.469> you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it can work actually because I mean you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.249 
it can work actually because I mean you
can<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.829> move<00:02:05.100> along<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.460> orbits<00:02:06.049> but<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
can just move along the orbits but you

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.160 
can just move along the orbits but you
won't<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.770> full<00:02:08.129> control<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:09.390> don't<00:02:09.690> think<00:02:09.750> um

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
won't have full control I don't think um

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.020 
won't have full control I don't think um
I<00:02:10.950> understand<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.520> how

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
I understand know how

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.920 
I understand know how

science<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:54.220> very<00:02:54.400> very<00:02:55.030> precise<00:02:55.480> as<00:02:55.900> much<00:02:56.739> as

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
science is very very precise as much as

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.530 
science is very very precise as much as
it<00:02:57.040> looks<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.280> massive<00:02:57.849> rock<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.209> just<00:02:58.420> to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
it looks like massive rock is just to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.690 
it looks like massive rock is just to
add<00:02:58.629> hopefully<00:02:58.900> attempt<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.739> get<00:02:59.889> there<00:03:00.129> it<00:03:00.340> is

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
add hopefully attempt to get there it is

add hopefully attempt to get there it is
extremely<00:03:01.450> precise<00:03:02.109> some<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.680> maneuvers

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
extremely precise some of the maneuvers

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.520 
extremely precise some of the maneuvers
when<00:03:03.340> you're<00:03:03.489> planning<00:03:03.730> them<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.379> to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
when you're planning them you have to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.979 
when you're planning them you have to
sit<00:03:05.769> there<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.099> slowly<00:03:06.639> drag<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.299> mouse<00:03:07.420> only

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
sit there and slowly drag the mouse only

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.979 
sit there and slowly drag the mouse only
slightly<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.709> don't<00:03:09.099> miss<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.780> one<00:03:10.780> thing

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
slightly so you don't miss it one thing

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.479 
slightly so you don't miss it one thing
in<00:03:11.139> this<00:03:11.230> how<00:03:11.440> exactly<00:03:11.859> this<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.010> gonna<00:03:12.220> work

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
in this how exactly this is gonna work

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.430 
in this how exactly this is gonna work
on<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.790> ps4<00:03:13.239> because<00:03:13.959> when<00:03:14.079> anything<00:03:14.290> about

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
on the ps4 because when anything about

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.170 
on the ps4 because when anything about
with<00:03:14.590> tongue<00:03:14.829> sticks<00:03:15.280> they're<00:03:15.579> not<00:03:15.849> as

with tongue sticks they're not as

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.409 
with tongue sticks they're not as

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
accurate to move because usually when

you<00:03:19.599> move<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:19.930> need<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.230> move<00:03:20.379> it<00:03:20.530> very

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
you move it you need to move it very

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.559 
you move it you need to move it very

move<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.930> will<00:03:33.050> only<00:03:33.200> slightly<00:03:33.620> adjust

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950

keep<00:03:38.030> going<00:03:38.480> or<00:03:38.810> something<00:03:39.470> yet<00:03:39.740> it's<00:03:40.220> hard<00:03:40.400> to

problems<00:03:43.070> but<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:44.630> think<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.590> generally<00:03:46.190> a

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
problems but I think this is generally a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.550 
problems but I think this is generally a
good<00:03:46.430> thing<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.000> think<00:03:47.300> this<00:03:47.450> is<00:03:47.780> going<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.440> be<00:03:48.530> a

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
good thing I think this is going to be a

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.470 
good thing I think this is going to be a
thing<00:03:48.830> that's<00:03:49.250> going<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.670> happen<00:03:49.760> on<00:03:50.180> my

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:46.649 
course the limits i'm not too sure how

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.079 
course the limits i'm not too sure how
they're<00:05:46.800> gonna<00:05:46.889> work<00:05:47.099> on<00:05:47.339> that<00:05:47.490> but

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
they're gonna work on that but

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:50.029 
they're gonna work on that but
nevertheless<00:05:48.360> i<00:05:48.719> think<00:05:49.050> even<00:05:49.259> still<00:05:49.740> just<00:05:49.979> the

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
nevertheless i think even still just the

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.799 
nevertheless i think even still just the
base<00:05:50.309> game<00:05:50.339> itself<00:05:50.909> it<00:05:51.180> would<00:05:51.300> still<00:05:51.599> be<00:05:51.629> a

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:51.809 
base game itself it would still be a

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.659 
base game itself it would still be a
good<00:05:52.080> thing<00:05:52.379> i'm<00:05:52.919> not<00:05:53.069> too<00:05:53.279> sure<00:05:53.309> whether

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
good thing i'm not too sure whether

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.519 
good thing i'm not too sure whether
they're<00:05:54.300> just<00:05:54.449> gonna<00:05:54.599> literally<00:05:54.960> grab<00:05:55.379> what

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
they're just gonna literally grab what

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.049 
they're just gonna literally grab what
they've<00:05:55.680> gone<00:05:55.770> on<00:05:55.919> a<00:05:55.949> pc<00:05:56.369> and<00:05:56.460> kind<00:05:56.610> of<00:05:56.699> port<00:05:56.909> it

00:05:57.049 --> 00:05:57.059 
they've gone on a pc and kind of port it

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:59.629 
they've gone on a pc and kind of port it
over<00:05:57.180> and<00:05:57.659> of<00:05:57.990> course<00:05:58.080> get<00:05:58.830> again<00:05:59.279> everything

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
over and of course get again everything

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.950 
over and of course get again everything
working<00:05:59.819> class<00:06:00.149> they<00:06:00.300> said<00:06:00.479> they<00:06:00.629> want<00:06:00.809> to

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:04.619 
port they want to measure it's not laggy

00:06:34.609 --> 00:06:34.619 
creativity and that can sometimes not be

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:35.959 
creativity and that can sometimes not be
a<00:06:34.649> good<00:06:34.860> thing<00:06:34.919> so<00:06:35.129> I'm<00:06:35.339> not<00:06:35.459> too<00:06:35.610> sure<00:06:35.759> maybe

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
a good thing so I'm not too sure maybe

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.029 
a good thing so I'm not too sure maybe
they'll<00:06:36.240> just<00:06:36.330> have<00:06:36.479> like<00:06:36.719> a<00:06:36.779> bath<00:06:37.559> tell<00:06:37.949> you

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
they'll just have like a bath tell you

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.850 
they'll just have like a bath tell you
how<00:06:38.189> well<00:06:38.430> it'll<00:06:38.610> do<00:06:38.969> so<00:06:39.539> maybe<00:06:39.719> I'll<00:06:40.199> once<00:06:40.680> it

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
how well it'll do so maybe I'll once it

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.040 
how well it'll do so maybe I'll once it
fills<00:06:41.129> then<00:06:41.490> then<00:06:42.059> you<00:06:42.240> might<00:06:42.449> start<00:06:42.779> to<00:06:42.899> get

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
fills then then you might start to get

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.469 
fills then then you might start to get
performance<00:06:43.439> issues<00:06:43.949> because<00:06:44.849> in<00:06:45.089> my<00:06:45.389> opinion

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
performance issues because in my opinion

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.719 
performance issues because in my opinion
if<00:06:45.839> they<00:06:45.959> did<00:06:46.139> that<00:06:46.379> but<00:06:46.830> then<00:06:47.009> didn't<00:06:47.399> let<00:06:47.610> you

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
if they did that but then didn't let you

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.179 
if they did that but then didn't let you
stop<00:06:48.059> building<00:06:48.330> so<00:06:48.749> they<00:06:48.899> advised<00:06:49.469> you<00:06:49.860> hey

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:50.189 
stop building so they advised you hey

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.059 
stop building so they advised you hey
you're<00:06:50.519> kind<00:06:50.999> of<00:06:51.209> going<00:06:51.419> a<00:06:51.659> bit<00:06:51.839> too<00:06:52.069> what's
