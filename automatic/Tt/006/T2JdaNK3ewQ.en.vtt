00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.860
 Hello, friends 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.509
 one question caught my attention but how 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.279
 if circumstances are vital we are constantly 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:22.260
 face the fact that there are two 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.949
 opposing points of view on the question of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.039
 how big changes have happened 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.679
 in the life of post-Soviet countries 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.010
 spaces compared to how it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.600
 was in the Soviet Union and we see people 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610
 who say absolutely nothing 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 changed here was a dog have a scoop 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.410
 there are three variables purely cosmetic 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.149
 we see people who speak at all 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.800
 there it is generally impossible to recognize it 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.050
 it's impossible to compare changes so much 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.140
 dramatic that in general it is also not 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.680
 comparable and I think that in fact 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.410
 both points of view have some 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.890
 objective reality just below you 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.700
 we must use as an area 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.479
 there are people for whom 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.720
 significant is some 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.290
 fundamental cornerstones of life 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.830
 societies respect for personality respect 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.150
 human rights let's say democratic 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.950
 power than there we say totalitarian 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.900
 let's say the country in which there are honest 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.270
 elections and a country in which there is no fair 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.310
 elections in that form it happens or in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.380
 this form or there is one party or their 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.079
 four or five but still they don't 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.470
 honest and there and so on so people 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.290
 who are looking from this position for them 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.649
 this is important here they will tell you that there 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.990
 little has changed this decorative 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.790
 there are people for whom momentary 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.259
 circumstances like here 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.119
 take and leave the country wherever you are 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.610
 do you want to go abroad before 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.799
 it was impossible now free please 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 was it possible to have some business there 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.750
 here is bssr not only illegal with 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.420
 dumping potential and whether it is possible to have 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.159
 some now there but in those countries 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.580
 who stayed there before you can have your 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.140
 reservations of subtlety specifics then 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.420
 so I think everything just rests 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.270
 at that 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.390
 who is more important and I'm just against it 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.760
 that on this basis any 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.290
 fight misunderstandings 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.000
 some kind of antagonism arose there no 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.489
 reason for the body just have things 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.170
 which one people the important things that 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.300
 to other people it is important i can say that i am 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.980
 I know a number of people who 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.750
 got into emigration with me 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.670
 at about the same time there are such that 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.739
 10 years before me here we are with alex here 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.569
 filmed were people who with alex 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.180
 arrived there beads from the first year 8 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.790
 second year and which at some point 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.030
 suddenly quietly polygon cnc and 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.150
 quietly generally moved there just 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.880
 because what they really lacked 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.860
 for immigration that's all resolved 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.489
 a footballer their fundamental things are not 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.489
 so worried
