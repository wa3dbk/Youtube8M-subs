00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.960
 hello my name is east and I'm not going to 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.979
 teach how to make a bouncy ball 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.979
 with balloons 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.360
 the materials are those of a scissor 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.010
 the first step is to fill the sludge with 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.750
 Not too big water, not too young 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.330
 of the size that you have your ball 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.610
 I here already have my mouth to the water 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.910
 I cut the speck because I'm going to see 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.090
 very ugly and I was going to get round 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.720
 the water or the ball I made it 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.720
 this cut 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.420
 the second step is to cut the little 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.940
 to the balloon so this you leave it aside 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:00.789
 then you take your balloon with water 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:04.629
 you open the the globe opens it is like this the east 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.580
 is the balloon inside the case and here 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.920
 I have the first layer in fact like that 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.740
 spare a little bit of the globe does not matter 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.310
 you have to do the same procedure 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.880
 with all the balloons the easiest thing would be 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 go through all the broken matches 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 that this is so 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 yes 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 yes 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.440
 This is easier for your procedure 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.410
 and do not delay much later where 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.400
 then all these things you will have 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.400
 what to steal 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 Y 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 and if it can only ever be water and with 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.280
 air is not going to bounce 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.540
 ready I have all my balloon cut out 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.810
 Now the only thing I need is to put the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.030
 balloons cut here 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.180
 as you can see I have already put the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.360
 third layer in the last two colors 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.069
 they must be the color you want 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.519
 that your ball that is the color that is 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.560
 As you can see, I'm adding more layers and 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.400
 you can check in your houses 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.920
 He is going and leaving the ball 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.989
 Well, now these are the two 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.180
 last layers have to give are pink 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.470
 swathed because they are the colors that I 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.380
 I want it to be my ball 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.280
 As he gave me already I have my ball 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.380
 completed 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.350
 I will remind you of the steps of 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.960
 beginning to the end first they have 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.330
 have to put a balloon with 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.250
 water that is not too big or too 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.120
 small of the cut that you want your 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.540
 Second ball the balloons must cut 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.420
 the wick and put them inside and put it 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.080
 inside the new ones with water at the end 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.790
 The last two colors must be from the 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.790
 colors that you want your balls 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.750
 and now you can see how it bounces 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.750
 well 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.299
 Well I hope you liked goodbye
