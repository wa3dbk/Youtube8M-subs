00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
people are wondering why they calculate

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.340 
people are wondering why they calculate
that's<00:01:30.329> why<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:30.810> you're<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> newer

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that's why because you're on a newer

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.050 
that's why because you're on a newer
version<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> game<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.280> connects<00:01:32.970> with

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
version of the game that connects with

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.640 
version of the game that connects with
all<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> version<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.720> server<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
all the version of a server so the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
all the version of a server so the
servers<00:01:35.040> are<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.270> doing<00:01:36.450> alpha

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
servers are like kind of doing alpha

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.200 
servers are like kind of doing alpha
builds<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.470> same<00:01:37.770> way<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.939> like

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
builds the same way so this is like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.810 
builds the same way so this is like
another<00:01:39.450> version<00:01:39.720> test<00:01:40.680> service<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.430> so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
another version test service this so

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.679 
another version test service this so
you're<00:01:41.939> gonna<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.329> things<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
you're gonna see a lot of things you

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.990 
you're gonna see a lot of things you
might<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:44.070> what<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.939> on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
might be like you know what is going on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.609 
might be like you know what is going on
with<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> service<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.470> not

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
with the service you know that's not

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.050 
with the service you know that's not
right<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> good<00:01:47.939> example

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
right for this this is a good example

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.090 
right for this this is a good example
right<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.290> two<00:01:49.470> types<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.860> wood

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
right here it's got two types of wood

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.910 
right here it's got two types of wood
but<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> test<00:01:51.450> server<00:01:51.840> mainly<00:01:52.680> built

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
but this is a test server mainly built

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
but this is a test server mainly built
right<00:01:53.250> now<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.970> testing<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.329> plug-in

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
right now for testing for plug-in

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.539 
right now for testing for plug-in
developers<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:56.009> plug<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.340> our

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
developers so they can plug in our

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.480 
developers so they can plug in our
develop<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> plugins<00:01:57.540> before<00:01:58.189> 0.9.0<00:01:59.189> loses

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
develop the plugins before 0.9.0 loses

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.420 
develop the plugins before 0.9.0 loses
to<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> full<00:02:00.329> public<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:01.619> why<00:02:01.860> getting

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
to the full public so that's why getting

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.280 
to the full public so that's why getting
access<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.119> 0.9<00:02:03.600> point<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> service

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
access to the 0.9 point of service

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.830 
access to the 0.9 point of service
testing<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.030> somewhat<00:02:06.030> difficult<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.630> really

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
testing is somewhat difficult you really

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.359 
testing is somewhat difficult you really
need<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> developer<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.069> able<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.250> do

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
need to be a developer to be able to do

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
need to be a developer to be able to do
that<00:02:08.520> because<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.119> got<00:02:09.209> some<00:02:09.390> complicated

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that because it's got some complicated

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.600 
that because it's got some complicated
steps<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.160> not<00:02:11.220> completely

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
steps to it and it's not completely

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.559 
steps to it and it's not completely
ready<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.599> see<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
ready as you can see you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.759 
ready as you can see you
seen<00:02:13.719> a<00:02:13.749> couple<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.049> small<00:02:14.260> bugs<00:02:14.499> which<00:02:14.650> is

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
seen a couple of small bugs which is

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:15.989 
seen a couple of small bugs which is
awesome<00:02:15.129> because<00:02:15.219> the<00:02:15.370> world's<00:02:15.609> do<00:02:15.760> go<00:02:15.909> on

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:15.999 
awesome because the world's do go on

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.250 
awesome because the world's do go on
forever<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.480> most<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.049> features

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
forever this most of the features

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.800 
forever this most of the features
besides<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.519> new<00:02:18.609> servers<00:02:18.999> go<00:02:19.209> we're

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
besides the new servers go we're

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.069 
besides the new servers go we're
actually<00:02:19.959> working<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.829> in<00:02:21.819> that<00:02:22.030> way<00:02:22.269> it's

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
actually working so in that way it's

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.080 
actually working so in that way it's
really<00:02:23.170> nice<00:02:23.439> you<00:02:23.709> know<00:02:23.799> but<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.730> still<00:02:24.969> got

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
really nice you know but it still got

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.209 
really nice you know but it still got
quite<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.359> few<00:02:25.540> bugs<00:02:25.689> again<00:02:26.319> it's<00:02:26.499> mainly<00:02:26.799> for

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
quite a few bugs again it's mainly for

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.920 
quite a few bugs again it's mainly for
testing<00:02:27.639> purposes<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.329> that's<00:02:28.480> why<00:02:28.659> you<00:02:28.719> can't

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
testing purposes so that's why you can't

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.629 
testing purposes so that's why you can't
connect<00:02:29.170> servers<00:02:29.739> are<00:02:29.829> not<00:02:29.859> dead<00:02:30.189> servers<00:02:30.549> are

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
connect servers are not dead servers are

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.309 
connect servers are not dead servers are
not<00:02:30.670> going<00:02:30.939> away<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.810> just<00:02:31.840> gonna<00:02:32.019> take<00:02:32.290> some

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
not going away it's just gonna take some

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.589 
not going away it's just gonna take some
time<00:02:32.680> once<00:02:32.920> 0.9<00:02:33.549> point<00:02:33.790> O<00:02:33.849> comes<00:02:34.090> out<00:02:34.269> the

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
time once 0.9 point O comes out the

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.839 
time once 0.9 point O comes out the
public<00:02:35.019> for<00:02:35.200> iOS<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.680> Android<00:02:35.709> that's<00:02:36.459> when

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
public for iOS and Android that's when

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.179 
public for iOS and Android that's when
the<00:02:37.239> servers<00:02:37.599> will<00:02:37.750> update<00:02:37.930> completely<00:02:38.709> to

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
the servers will update completely to

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.670 
the servers will update completely to
support<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.609> 0.8<00:02:40.090> 0.0<00:02:40.359> that's<00:02:40.629> when<00:02:40.900> all<00:02:41.530> of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
support the 0.8 0.0 that's when all of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.289 
support the 0.8 0.0 that's when all of
your<00:02:41.769> servers<00:02:42.159> I'm<00:02:42.310> most<00:02:42.849> of<00:02:42.999> your<00:02:43.090> server

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
your servers I'm most of your server

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.399 
your servers I'm most of your server
hosts<00:02:43.599> I'm<00:02:43.689> sure<00:02:43.870> will<00:02:43.959> update<00:02:44.109> them

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
hosts I'm sure will update them

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.229 
hosts I'm sure will update them
automatically<00:02:45.069> usually<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:45.879> don't<00:02:46.000> have<00:02:46.150> to

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
automatically usually you don't have to

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.690 
automatically usually you don't have to
do<00:02:46.329> it<00:02:46.450> yourself<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.829> then<00:02:48.219> though<00:02:48.310> update<00:02:48.609> to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
do it yourself and then though update to

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.250 
do it yourself and then though update to
zero<00:02:48.849> point<00:02:48.969> I<00:02:49.120> point<00:02:49.329> out<00:02:49.419> and<00:02:49.719> you<00:02:49.959> can<00:02:50.079> start

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
zero point I point out and you can start

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
zero point I point out and you can start
playing<00:02:50.439> with<00:02:50.530> infinite<00:02:50.950> worlds<00:02:51.159> and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
playing with infinite worlds and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.699 
playing with infinite worlds and
everything<00:02:51.609> so<00:02:51.819> it's<00:02:52.389> really<00:02:52.449> simple<00:02:52.989> just

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
everything so it's really simple just

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.229 
everything so it's really simple just
make<00:02:53.889> sure<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.099> have<00:02:54.310> some<00:02:54.609> patience<00:02:54.969> for<00:02:55.180> it

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
make sure to have some patience for it

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.939 
make sure to have some patience for it
because<00:02:55.510> we're<00:02:56.109> still<00:02:56.230> an<00:02:56.349> alpha<00:02:56.439> build<00:02:56.739> 3

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:56.949 
because we're still an alpha build 3

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
because we're still an alpha build 3
here<00:02:57.159> as<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.400> can<00:02:57.430> see

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
here as you can see

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.179 
here as you can see
so<00:02:58.419> don't<00:02:58.569> expect<00:02:58.989> anything<00:02:59.230> too<00:02:59.650> quickly<00:02:59.949> to

guess<00:03:07.030> your<00:03:07.269> server<00:03:07.480> host<00:03:07.719> would<00:03:08.560> care<00:03:08.829> how

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
guess your server host would care how

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.949 
guess your server host would care how
far<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.459> go<00:03:09.639> I<00:03:09.909> would<00:03:10.419> think<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.629> could<00:03:10.780> do

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
far you go I would think you could do

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.959 
far you go I would think you could do
infinite<00:03:11.319> worlds<00:03:11.590> first<00:03:12.159> for<00:03:12.340> Part<00:03:12.489> C<00:03:12.549> hosting

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:12.969 
infinite worlds first for Part C hosting

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.300 
infinite worlds first for Part C hosting
my<00:03:13.090> hosting<00:03:13.510> company<00:03:13.840> obviously<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:15.069> can<00:03:15.189> go

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
my hosting company obviously you can go

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.860 
my hosting company obviously you can go
on<00:03:15.430> forever<00:03:15.609> have<00:03:16.060> infinite<00:03:16.389> worlds<00:03:16.629> we<00:03:16.719> don't

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
on forever have infinite worlds we don't

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.839 
on forever have infinite worlds we don't
really<00:03:16.959> care<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.560> have<00:03:17.979> a<00:03:18.009> lot<00:03:18.189> of<00:03:18.220> solid-state

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
really care I have a lot of solid-state

see<00:03:20.979> there's<00:03:21.189> some<00:03:21.280> bugs<00:03:21.430> like<00:03:21.579> this<00:03:21.609> which<00:03:22.329> is

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479 
see there's some bugs like this which is

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.879 
see there's some bugs like this which is
still<00:03:22.629> trying<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.870> generate<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.199> world<00:03:23.379> but

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
still trying to generate the world but

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.939 
still trying to generate the world but
you<00:03:23.979> can't<00:03:24.159> expect<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.579> do<00:03:24.669> this<00:03:24.790> because

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
you can't expect it to do this because

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.140 
you can't expect it to do this because
it's<00:03:26.949> not<00:03:27.009> fully<00:03:27.250> ready<00:03:27.489> for<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.759> zero<00:03:28.030> point

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
it's not fully ready for the zero point

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.539 
it's not fully ready for the zero point

for a version the developers of pocket

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.069 
for a version the developers of pocket
might<00:03:30.669> have<00:03:30.819> been<00:03:30.909> working<00:03:31.180> really<00:03:31.359> hard<00:03:31.449> to

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
might have been working really hard to

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.390 
might have been working really hard to
make<00:03:32.109> sure<00:03:32.409> this<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.620> all<00:03:32.739> prepared<00:03:33.159> and<00:03:33.250> ready

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
make sure this is all prepared and ready

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.490 
make sure this is all prepared and ready
for<00:03:33.699> when<00:03:34.060> zero<00:03:34.269> point<00:03:34.449> I<00:03:34.509> come<00:03:34.720> 0

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
for when zero point I come 0

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.619 
for when zero point I come 0
what<00:03:35.859> 9.0<00:03:36.250> comes<00:03:36.459> out<00:03:36.639> which<00:03:37.090> I'm<00:03:37.239> sure<00:03:37.419> by

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
what 9.0 comes out which I'm sure by

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.990 
what 9.0 comes out which I'm sure by
then<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.989> will<00:03:38.079> be<00:03:38.139> really<00:03:38.530> nice<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:39.099> right

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
then it will be really nice and right

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.249 
then it will be really nice and right
now<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.329> like<00:03:40.479> I<00:03:40.659> said<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:40.930> pretty<00:03:41.019> good

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:41.259 
now it's like I said it's pretty good

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.740 
now it's like I said it's pretty good
you<00:03:41.379> know<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.560> definitely<00:03:42.479> want<00:03:43.479> to<00:03:43.509> give<00:03:43.659> it

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
you know you definitely want to give it

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.689 
you know you definitely want to give it
much<00:03:43.959> heat<00:03:44.259> because<00:03:44.590> they've<00:03:45.370> done<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.519> good

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
much heat because they've done a good

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.159 
much heat because they've done a good
job<00:03:45.759> at<00:03:46.090> trying<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.389> implement<00:03:46.569> some<00:03:46.810> basic

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
job at trying to implement some basic

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.809 
job at trying to implement some basic
stuff<00:03:47.349> right<00:03:47.919> now<00:03:48.069> like<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.400> said<00:03:48.459> it's<00:03:48.759> just

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
stuff right now like I said it's just

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.729 
stuff right now like I said it's just
for<00:03:49.090> plug-in<00:03:49.269> developers<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:49.989> it's<00:03:50.439> basically

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
for plug-in developers so it's basically

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.979 
for plug-in developers so it's basically
some<00:03:50.949> cool<00:03:51.220> terrain<00:03:51.939> generation<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.900> know

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
some cool terrain generation you know

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.319 
some cool terrain generation you know
just<00:03:53.169> some<00:03:53.290> basic<00:03:53.680> stuff<00:03:53.949> to<00:03:54.489> make<00:03:54.609> sure<00:03:54.939> that

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
just some basic stuff to make sure that

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.729 
just some basic stuff to make sure that
they<00:03:55.509> can<00:03:55.629> develop<00:03:55.750> their<00:03:56.049> plugins<00:03:56.409> so<00:03:56.590> that

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
they can develop their plugins so that

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.619 
they can develop their plugins so that
when<00:03:56.919> the<00:03:57.069> server's<00:03:57.400> update<00:03:57.729> you<00:03:58.180> guys<00:03:58.209> can

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
when the server's update you guys can

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.240 
when the server's update you guys can
download<00:03:58.780> plugins<00:03:59.409> that<00:03:59.799> are<00:03:59.889> actually

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
download plugins that are actually

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.619 
download plugins that are actually
compatible<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:01.030> know<00:04:01.150> cuz<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:01.359> don't<00:04:01.509> want

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
compatible you know cuz you don't want

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.689 
compatible you know cuz you don't want
to<00:04:01.719> have<00:04:02.109> the<00:04:02.319> server's<00:04:02.650> generate<00:04:02.979> and<00:04:03.280> then

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
to have the server's generate and then

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.249 
to have the server's generate and then
have<00:04:03.849> zero<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.239> plugins<00:04:04.629> to<00:04:04.750> be<00:04:04.810> able<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.049> use

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:05.259 
have zero of plugins to be able to use

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:07.499 
have zero of plugins to be able to use
you<00:04:05.409> know<00:04:05.530> for<00:04:05.739> example<00:04:06.040> simple<00:04:06.669> often<00:04:07.120> other

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:07.509 
you know for example simple often other

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.030 
you know for example simple often other
password<00:04:08.049> ones<00:04:08.349> you're<00:04:08.469> gonna<00:04:08.560> want<00:04:08.739> people

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
password ones you're gonna want people

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.559 
password ones you're gonna want people
to<00:04:09.129> use<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.819> you're<00:04:09.909> not<00:04:10.000> gonna<00:04:10.120> be<00:04:10.269> able<00:04:10.389> to

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
to use and you're not gonna be able to

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.779 
to use and you're not gonna be able to
if<00:04:11.229> they<00:04:11.379> don't<00:04:11.409> update<00:04:11.680> them<00:04:12.039> beforehand<00:04:12.579> so

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:12.789 
if they don't update them beforehand so

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.490 
if they don't update them beforehand so
that's<00:04:12.939> why<00:04:13.120> they<00:04:13.299> update<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.930> test<00:04:14.139> servers

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
that's why they update the test servers

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.999 
that's why they update the test servers
are<00:04:14.979> available<00:04:16.289> but<00:04:17.289> that's<00:04:17.469> pretty<00:04:17.650> much<00:04:17.769> it

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.009 
are available but that's pretty much it

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.560 
are available but that's pretty much it
as<00:04:18.099> far<00:04:18.130> as<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.430> server's<00:04:18.759> go<00:04:18.909> I<00:04:19.150> want<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.449> make

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
as far as the server's go I want to make

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.149 
as far as the server's go I want to make
sure<00:04:19.599> we<00:04:19.989> answer<00:04:20.169> that<00:04:20.320> question<00:04:20.440> for<00:04:20.829> most<00:04:20.949> of

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.420 
you like I said a lot of people been
wondering<00:04:23.050> why<00:04:23.260> these<00:04:23.919> servers<00:04:24.250> are<00:04:24.310> not

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
wondering why these servers are not

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
I know you can see this it's generating

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.200 
I know you can see this it's generating
as<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.560> get<00:04:59.680> closer<00:04:59.920> I<00:05:00.280> don't<00:05:00.670> know<00:05:00.760> how<00:05:00.970> that's

as I get closer I don't know how that's

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.700 
as I get closer I don't know how that's
all<00:05:01.330> gonna<00:05:01.420> work<00:05:01.720> when<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.080> final<00:05:02.410> versions

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
all gonna work when the final versions

all gonna work when the final versions
out<00:05:02.890> I<00:05:03.610> would<00:05:04.180> expect<00:05:04.420> a<00:05:04.540> lot<00:05:04.660> of<00:05:04.750> things<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.050> be

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
out I would expect a lot of things to be

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.810 
out I would expect a lot of things to be
way<00:05:05.380> different<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:06.040> don't<00:05:06.310> know<00:05:06.430> if<00:05:06.520> I've<00:05:06.610> even

way different I don't know if I've even

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.920 
way different I don't know if I've even
seen<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:07.000> cave<00:05:07.270> I<00:05:07.450> don't<00:05:07.600> think<00:05:07.780> they've<00:05:07.900> even
