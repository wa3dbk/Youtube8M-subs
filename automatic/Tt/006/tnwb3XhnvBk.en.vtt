always best to start out on the finished

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.130 
always best to start out on the finished
string<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> bottom<00:00:21.510> string<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:22.070> so<00:00:23.070> three

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
string the bottom string here so three

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.040 
string the bottom string here so three
three<00:00:25.140> four<00:00:25.380> steps<00:00:26.029> you<00:00:27.029> start<00:00:27.420> out<00:00:27.570> with

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
three four steps you start out with

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.919 
three four steps you start out with
these<00:00:28.289> two<00:00:28.529> fingers<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.920> already<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.929> then

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
these two fingers on already and then

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.620 
these two fingers on already and then
your<00:00:31.740> middle<00:00:32.009> finger<00:00:32.309> or<00:00:32.880> whichever<00:00:33.239> finger

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
your middle finger or whichever finger

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.060 
your middle finger or whichever finger
tap<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.920> step<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.370> tap<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
tap with this is step one you tap so the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.830 
tap with this is step one you tap so the
tap<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> first<00:00:38.850> step<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.910> push<00:00:42.149> off<00:00:42.420> with

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
tap is the first step the push off with

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.400 
tap is the first step the push off with
dad<00:00:43.020> fingers<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.620> second<00:00:43.950> step

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:55.100 

then<00:00:48.410> pull<00:00:48.620> off<00:00:48.769> with<00:00:48.920> this<00:00:49.070> finger

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.960 

and<00:00:56.110> then<00:00:57.040> that<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.500> dad<00:01:00.430> is<00:01:00.610> a<00:01:00.670> combination

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
and then that the dad is a combination

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.380 
and then that the dad is a combination
of<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.449> fourth<00:01:01.870> step<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.410> first<00:01:03.129> step<00:01:03.430> fourth

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
of the fourth step and first step fourth

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.060 
of the fourth step and first step fourth
step<00:01:04.690> is<00:01:04.930> putting<00:01:05.229> this<00:01:05.470> finger<00:01:05.770> back<00:01:05.920> on

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
step is putting this finger back on

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.980 
step is putting this finger back on
first<00:01:06.400> step<00:01:06.850> again<00:01:07.150> is<00:01:07.300> putting<00:01:07.570> this<00:01:07.659> back<00:01:07.869> on

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
first step again is putting this back on

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.450 
first step again is putting this back on
but<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:08.260> have<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.440> do<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.650> at<00:01:08.770> exactly<00:01:09.310> the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
but you have to do it at exactly the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:18.300 
but you have to do it at exactly the
same<00:01:09.520> time

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.880 

so<00:01:19.310> let's<00:01:19.430> have<00:01:20.000> these<00:01:20.300> two<00:01:20.540> fingers<00:01:20.890> there

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
so let's have these two fingers there

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:32.530 
so let's have these two fingers there
already<00:01:23.350> tap<00:01:25.600> push<00:01:26.600> off<00:01:27.790> pull<00:01:28.790> off<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:32.420> then

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
already tap push off pull off and then

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.290 
already tap push off pull off and then
at<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.810> same<00:01:32.870> time<00:01:33.200> put<00:01:33.650> these<00:01:33.800> two<00:01:33.980> back<00:01:34.190> up

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.320 

now<00:01:41.300> for<00:01:41.360> two<00:01:42.310> fingers<00:01:43.310> like<00:01:43.729> do<00:01:43.910> stuff<00:01:43.970> of

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330
