up<00:01:44.270> with<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.540> that's<00:01:44.780> going<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.050> want<00:01:45.260> to<00:01:45.320> say

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
up with that that's going to want to say

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.870 
up with that that's going to want to say
that<00:01:45.680> when<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:45.920> actually<00:01:46.070> play<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:46.670> thing

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
that when you actually play that thing

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.520 
that when you actually play that thing
stays<00:01:47.240> there<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.570> then<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.110> launches<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
stays there and then it launches the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.830 
stays there and then it launches the
game<00:01:48.800> but<00:01:49.610> you're<00:01:50.000> going<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.300> want<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.450> keep<00:01:50.659> it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
game but you're going to want to keep it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.140 
game but you're going to want to keep it
in<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.200> portal<00:01:51.590> folder<00:01:51.950> or<00:01:52.070> else<00:01:52.400> it<00:01:52.670> will<00:01:52.880> not

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
in the portal folder or else it will not

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.480 
in the portal folder or else it will not
play<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.380> that's<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.770> only<00:01:54.890> one<00:01:55.280> drawback

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
play so that's the only one drawback

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.070 
play so that's the only one drawback
they<00:01:55.850> have<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.120> open<00:01:56.390> up<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.600> folder<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.020> then

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.020 
they have to open up the folder and then
play<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:57.830> other<00:01:58.460> than<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.760> it's

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
play it but other than that it's

play it but other than that it's
actually<00:01:59.390> not<00:01:59.479> that<00:01:59.540> bad<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.229> it's<00:02:00.409> I<00:02:00.740> played
