00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.350
 It makes us really want to eat them from this 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.900
 he took advantage of it in the party that 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.469

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.149
 juice from one top 8 cubes with one 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.739
 spearmint mint leaf as 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.079
 We need to have put them on 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.260
 the day before to freeze and a lime 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.730
 for decoration and a few sheets of 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.710
 peppermint or mint that will serve to 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.409
 decorating for this recipe is so simple 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.190
 like this we will have peelers 8 kiwis the 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.190
 we put in a container 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.650
 and we think about it 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.650
 the juice of the lime 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.350
 and add the cubes 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.730
 we could also add sweetener 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.000
 but as the kiwis are already sweet 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.000
 now we're going 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.260
 not too much because we want us 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.610
 pieces are left full now we're going 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.790
 to put here in this case has caught a 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.480
 beer glass but the container that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480
 more fit 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 a piece of 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.320
 and now we decorate 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.150
 so or we would cut a little corner and 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.150
 we would put here on the edge 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.030
 and the mint leaves 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.290
 and we can also decorate it with sugar 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.270
 around here by the edge that too 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.740
 would be very good I encourage you to try
