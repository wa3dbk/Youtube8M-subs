00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.829
 at the time in the body of a statement 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.349
 some organs were very well 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.699
 because many of us have jobs 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:28.659
 they 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:33.459
 they argued that there was for the ing that exposed we worked hard the donations 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.370
 and this situation is not the same as doing it as soon as possible 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.760
 except for competition min 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.880
 sun 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.120
 all for listening 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.120
 the investigations he had done sd 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.600
 at the lyceum 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.660
 the whole organization of the phoenix eu organs 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 they noticed their opponent 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 almost all were 11 percent 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 since it was a little more accelerated 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.310
 And it seems 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.310
 was going to have to postpone the breakwater 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.140
 but nevertheless 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.740
 thanks to the intelligence of the brain 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.150
 they joined him 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.000
 and they attended kill meeting those involved in the return 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.939
 the heart 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.990
 I was tired of the signature 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.320
 and not only that 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.170
 but every time without knowing why 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.200
 he had to work weirder 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.880
 the strongest 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.530
 we do not even say 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.660
 all the time they said they were tired 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.120
 and that there was a very hard situation for them 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.130
 is when I least thought 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.130
 they worked so much that they sweated without control 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.080
 the lungs and the bronchi were in agreement with the heart in homes 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.050
 also 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.729
 they also attended 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.280
 the templates of the two nations 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.810
 the cultured or 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.990
 happy 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.320
 the gil 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.480
 among other 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.400
 when they were in the middle of a long history 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.690
 of those who wanted to stop and those who seek guilty 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.569
 entered that meeting 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.919
 the autonomous nervous system 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.829
 with two guests 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.179
 which nobody knew 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.159
 the sympathetic division 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.959
 inhibition 4 5 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.960
 inside 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.349
 almost nobody paid attention 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.670
 but when it came time to find the culprit 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.670
 the body of Juan Iturbe instead 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.389
 with that goal we will work normally 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.239
 As we are, the activity started being slow 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.559
 lungs 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.729
 they could not stop inhaling and exhaling quickly and continuously 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.089
 and although all 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.789
 once each function one day 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.309
 haha the little bachelor vigil they had 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:56.400
 and the eyes 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.239
 they kept laughing 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.249
 one 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.600
 everything was wrong 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.829
 they had strange things 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.129
 strange smells better said 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.819
 it was not strange 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.919
 mitsubishi book 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.039
 everything started a nice 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.439
 the pique 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.149
 that's why everyone is like that 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:18.379
 but now 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.719
 everything was more confusing 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.049
 up to here said the division for sympathetic and those who have died 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.299
 when I pass 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.299
 they thanked the parasympathetic resignation 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:33.810
 they turned it around 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.339
 looking for reasons 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.879
 turkey initiated the sympathetic had armed so much stir 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.879
 what was that johnito 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.569
 I've been to the castle of terror 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.709
 of magic saltpeter
