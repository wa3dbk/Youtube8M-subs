00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.910
 hi everyone his iphone we get 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.160
 found today for a new 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.720
 video on skyward on the server 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.490
 fantasy baboons I hope you go 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.960
 all very well for having listened to it is going 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.920
 rather not bad so why I have you 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.119
 took time above all because its 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.790
 order directly when we arrive 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.200
 this is the reason is simple so if 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.119
 elsewhere these gases and all the players who 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.649
 give themselves on a small island each and 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.020
 the goal is to bring down the whole 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.110
 world so of course usually level 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.540
 stuff i 'm not the lucky one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.769
 so we will try to play caution 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.530
 we will knock down the players before 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:46.949
 anything that saw there a small mode 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.949
 chic nice nice hop 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.989
 I really like this cheat mode 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.640
 I approve it is rather not bad finally 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.179
 he could have killed me years he had 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.309
 to use me 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:02.170
 good unfortunately sometimes even the mode 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.219
 shit that's not good enough we're going 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.090
 will do with 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.710
 we will not spit on it 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.530
 done is done I think it will be bane 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.360
 on this little player so that's what we 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.930
 will do me I hesitate to rather rock the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.149
 center ok there's a guy there right this 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.829
 that can be done who is right 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.960
 no where he goes he would need food 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:28.030
 imperatively so we'll maybe here 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.840
 of rocks the player he has will see us 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.840
 not if we go through here 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:40.329
 ok we're doing bridge is also 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.829
 in the process of bridge is so small pot 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.079
 pot of speed and we will try to go the 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.079
 kill simply 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.980
 that's it's done and now we're going 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:58.110
 try to go to the center we will be well 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.790
 in the center I think there's no cable 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.860
 so we have the center really every 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.220
 interesting chests that are watched 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.460
 wearing pants in diam's and then going 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.100
 be good hot wheels and take a max 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.300
 of things here we are good with that 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.920
 so what is interesting 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.380
 just before we can take it 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.200
 for not letting his target is a member 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.000
 and by funding the freeze the rest 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.590
 so we have a lot of good things 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.130
 nice I think we have widely 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:35.700
 the advantage for this part so he had 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:41.660
 arrows so far the ex has given everything 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:45.030
 what they did very well very well 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.459
 so here we are we have almost the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.260
 victory there the thing that date to do 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.670
 do not be fooled by 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.440
 little players like this one down there 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.590
 can we have it found no 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:01.799
 not good my man we'll try 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.700
 to go the hour rush scared I think I 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.910
 do not know if it can be a good 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.910
 solution 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.380
 are we could see you 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.459
 do you expect a problem anyway? 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.750
 is that the players you see are camping 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.010
 a little bit here they stay on their 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.459
 position and I run to have them 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.220
 it's not obvious or without his fish the 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.930
 sipopo limit of origen it can always 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.160
 serve 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.730
 there are fishing rods we have ten 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.180
 times too much I have power of the so 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.790
 power of these missing bridges we get 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.209
 wireless champions card here we are 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.230
 well we are pretty good so yes 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.900
 now the thing is gonna be waiting 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.010
 a little bit the players the baiona we 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.120
 could have 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:50.090
 since the arrows are super 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:59.620
 badly we're going maybe six lÃ¤nder 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:04:02.480
 organic pearls hop and it's done 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.319
 we put a little popo I move that 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:11.780
 can always serve 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:14.510
 origen and there we poison hop we go 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.680
 try to put it badly if we can 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.680
 kill crowd bow that would be cool 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:27.169
 ok michael since these facts is what we 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.130
 go get his stuff what are we going 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.220
 look for his stuff 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.280
 the question is where is the last 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.260
 so I'm afraid of bruges 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.479
 I'm afraid of the bridge we'll try to 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.860
 bridge we never know I hope it 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.970
 will not make bullshit that will have no 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:51.530
 trickster hop nor calon masson stuff on 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.479
 take the shot the small plastron diam's 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.470
 and so it remains more than to find the 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.210
 last appointment and we go straight 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.210
 their beads low center I have not 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:08.240
 want to take a risk actually 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:10.450
 which is there, he is there, the little one 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.450

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.840

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.310
