00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.419
 series of crazy races leaves me 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.029
 betting on the team that 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.599
 today is ostentatious old and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.759
 ball 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.759
 races insane personal today will be 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.529
 pocket reis it well the name of the race and the 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.230
 pocket race to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.690
 We're here with the command guys. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.820
 I invited the galerinha of the command already go 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.100
 speak the name of each one of them and this 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 It's going to be pretty crazy going on. 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.269
 to be here in the middle of the city because 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.800
 some campas and everything else is the bagulho 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.070
 in sanaa instead we are here with 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.600
 cut with ryan zica with limpinho games 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.120
 with the shot gun and cupid and igor our 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.659
 volume will explode there but still 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.149
 not that I did not blow up the vehicle 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.489
 old is that the business to pocket is to 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.899
 Complaint and let's go 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.030
 I did not put the ghost business 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.680
 the check point took what matters is 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.930
 do not put the ghost business because I 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.030
 I think it loses its grace a little. 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.040
 the races so O unless it is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.070
 a more serious business like you 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.689
 put there the ghost mode that you 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 do not hit the other players and let's just 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.719
 here the guys are already fucking there 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.570
 here has to turn and well show here 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:39.960
 I think it's a pocket never I do not know 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.479
 which is but is a business more so as 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.759
 I'll tell you it's more 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.490
 simplified smaller so a run 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.920
 Let's face it, and we're not here. 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.659
 with the compact category that some 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.469

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.750

 card let's rotate the carjacking our 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:42.000
 No, I 'm not going to get the checkpoint anymore. 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:45.690
 I did not fucking fuck, did not I? 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.850
 the checkpoint and is already in penultimate here 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:54.120
 I 'm already penultimate 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:56.190
 What the hell is our face from the sky? 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.840
 I 'm not able to get the checkpoint myself. 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.560
 I have to get more speed 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.920
 impulse and let's go you better 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.480
 to do here with more old impulse than 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.900
 keep trying trying not 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.130
 to get take now and it is not 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:20.130
 possible 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:21.930
 It was then, our face is that they already 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.370
 are coming back and I have in the direction of 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.640
 space by the same path 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.400
 We just hit but we do not have 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.440
 Problems, right? I think it 's almost 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.940
 ending 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:44.190
 Let's speed it up here, I'll have to go back. 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:49.100

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.750
 Dear face, I did not know 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.560

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.489

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.820

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.710

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:39.710
