00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.359
 video on the web, repair the same in 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.570
 In this case, the video is dedicated to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.370
 light bulbs of two microwave weapons these 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.590
 what you see in the images are light bulbs 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.470
 which belong these two models to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.580
 microwave ovens from manufacturers 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.210
 koreans for example samsung sanyo ong and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.220
 they have the particularity with different 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.279
 with new European manufacturers or 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.250
 Chinese manufacturers that light bulbs 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.620
 Korean ovens or Korean brands the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.250
 cap is specific for said 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.500
 ovens 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.620
 what forces us to not be able to connect 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.720
 place in case of a light bulb 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.230
 of standard type such as that of 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.330
 refrigeration or other types of 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.730
 microwave ovens that are marketed 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.890
 in europe 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.950
 these bulbs as I have commented carry 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.989
 a proper cap with the bulb that 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.800
 you can not dismantle what forces us 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.680
 a in case of fusion of it having 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.280
 than buying a replacement specifically 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.369
 as the one that is the damaged ones are usually 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.580
 of the models we have some with the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.750
 terminals in huelva at an angle of 90 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.229
 degrees can be the bulb of 40 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.070
 watts or in this case 25 bulb 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.050
 watts 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.400
 the characteristic of this that the 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.330
 370 nomenclature and it already tells us that 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.330
 It is made in Korea 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.470
 This is manufactured by itself. LANKA is a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.770
 bulb also 170 but with the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.980
 straight terminals and a power of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.130
 40 watts we see the difference of one with 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.110
 the other differs in size and in 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.110
 the type of back connector they carry 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.630
 the bulbs of ovens manufactured in 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.140
 china with manufactured in europe carry 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.050
 bulb of standard type 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.030
 with small thread as what we can 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.069
 have in bedside lamps 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.200
 of our house therefore it is much 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.430
 easier to get a replacement 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.560
 practically in any store 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.819
 we can find this kind of light bulbs 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.709
 let's proceed to measure the resistance 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.989
 more than anything to determine if the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.340
 bulb is in good condition and that you see 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.890
 how it is done 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.860
 we will use a multimeter on the scale of 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.860
 ohm scalar of 2000 the others and bad 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.220
 what we do is we check 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.220
 the two terminals of the bulb 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.500
 his fame in our pool and metro 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.910
 a 25 - watt bulb and see that 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.500
 gives us a resistance of 218 ohms 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.340
 this bulb is in good condition not 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.099
 is melted 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.250
 we check the other bulb one of 40 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.250
 watts 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.269
 being of greater power has a lower 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:19.220
 resistance as it is natural and it gives us 114 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.200
 Ohms is not fused either 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.940
 If it is melted, we would see that the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.130
 inner filaments at some point 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.410
 are divided what will become 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.750
 bulbs of such a fine filament to 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.000
 Sometimes it's a bit difficult to prove it 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.420
 much more reliable the test of power and 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.970
 to put 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:42.180
 and we check the last bulb 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.180
 with a resistance of 168 ohms 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.000
 this is how it has been commented in 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.340
 any large electricity store 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.180
 warehouses and other things you can find 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.180
 without any difficulty 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.080
 I hope the little video can be 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.970
 help you know that the ovens 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.860
 Koreans carry light bulbs 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.810
 specific in case of merging 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.050
 you need the own replacement of the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.170
 manufacturer is usually in the 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.060
 most times you need to have to 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.970
 remove the oven housing to be able to 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.680
 replace them instead light bulbs 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.200
 some ovens the type bulbs 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.910
 standard on some occasions now we 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.580
 It has an outer cover to be able to 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.159
 subtitle the same 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.099
 I hope I can clarify a bit about 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:33.680
 concept of ideas on the subject of 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.360
 the bulbs of the microwave classrooms and 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.439
 that you continue visiting the web page 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.439
 repair yourself
