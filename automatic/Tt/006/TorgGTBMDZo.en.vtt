00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.720
 Welcome to the fifth class of 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.480
 Guitar Que.es 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.800
 to start, it will leave everyone happy and 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.800
 we want to follow it we have to learn a 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.390
 simple way to make blues bases 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.520
 simple because this is going to be just going to 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.880
 having three chords will continue to change the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.279
 fifth for which it is but it is a and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.410
 then on this basis we can sing 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.020
 a song of our girlfriend a song 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.329
 of church the shopping list for 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.150
 we want our physics exam 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.480
 after the holidays 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.150
 and also then on this basis we can 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.920
 see a single melody with the artist 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.960
 tonic for example the blues climbing 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.090
 we're going according to the genre we're 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.670
 playing with the scala that we want 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.920
 because music can be improvised to 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.309
 bottom 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.309
 ace 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.400
 now I will teach you because they are the degrees 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.040
 more chords of our light base 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.750
 first you have to choose a tonality yo 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.270
 I will choose the one of the minor because it is the most 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.620
 simple since the tonic notes fall 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.430
 on strings to the air 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.430
 would be in the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 and the notes of our blues base 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.869
 now we form the chords with the notes 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.740
 that we said before the first the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.740
 fifth chord of the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.970
 Y 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:53.730
 and others will have such a fat place 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:53.730
 then he remembers 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.579
 and then we went down to my cheese factory 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.369
 well this is very fast but I would be 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.550
 the last one that we have touched that would be the 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.290
 according to the air and fifth string 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.880
 with a fret and now we form the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.880
 chords consists of the following form 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.160
 with the fifth plus the crystal fret two 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.000
 above we click with the fifth 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.960
 would be 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.960
 02 04 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.980
 i 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.740
 Y 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.030
 in the fifth with nap for blues 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.310
 now I will show what the order of the 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.310
 chords first comes the one that are 8 times 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.459
 now it comes to network four times 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.510
 now comes the other time four times 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:32.010
 now we go down to me twice 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.250
 and again twice twice and I 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.560
 you say I can talk 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.190
 I repeat everything so you can see me better 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.130
 Y 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.880
 and 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.880
 dt 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.959
 Y 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.160
 it's very difficult, you just have to be clear 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:13.500
 you can understand the chords and follow them 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.500
 and of course
