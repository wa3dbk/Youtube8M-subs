00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.530
 Sergey and today 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.360
 tell you how to play minecraft by 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.189
 networks through hamachi to 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.860
 we will need a program 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:23.270
 hamachi which i'll throw off in the description under 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.570
 video and need a server which is itself a 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.640
 also throw off in the description under the video after 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.559
 As you download all the necessary files to us 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.570
 you will need to configure them for this 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.780
 We first go to the program logmein 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.570
 hamachi 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.920
 turn it on and check the program 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.690
 was the latest version 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.590
 after we checked and made sure 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.420
 what program is the latest version we need 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.120
 will create a network where they will be 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.060
 our friends who can play with us 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.180
 in minecraft on the net for this we 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:00.380
 click on the network item to create a new 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.360
 network and we offer to create a network 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.280
 Naturally the network indicator is 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.899
 network name password 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.659
 we have also come up with your password as 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.600
 network name whatever we confirm 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.659
 password and click create after this 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.540
 we have a room with the name 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.549
 players that are added to us 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.970
 that is, we give them an identifier and 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.950
 password and they connect to us that is 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.670
 only those players that we have added 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.840
 in hamachi can go to our server 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.930
 actually with hamachi more and more here 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.740
 nothing is required and now i will show 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.080
 how to configure minecraft server itself for 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.369
 this we run using java 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.159
 file mancraft server here we have 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.729
 different files start to appear on the pro 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.630
 I will tell them when it starts 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:57.380
 the server here it started us up being created 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.090
 the world is now it will be created 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.640
 and disconnect the server as we need 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.369
 will configure server files 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.560
 and in order to stop the server i 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.000
 I recommend it not to close the cross 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:16.010
 just set the stop command and press 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.990
 enter all files all saved 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.530
 successfully saved and the server is closing 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.100
 Now I will tell you that there what 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.820
 files 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.350
 what does my server for jim mean 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.810
 there is a server can be put 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.850
 model naturally description under video 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.840
 skin exactly this server which 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.120
 Now I will configure and here 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.540
 the necessary file folder and I now you 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.120
 show the first folder is this feed 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.910
 folder you will need to put the mod that you 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.890
 want to install on server 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.020
 folder mods from another folder too in 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.850
 which you can put mod that is 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.090
 depending on the mod it will be necessary 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.630
 put in this folder or in this folder 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.900
 world 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.740
 in the world folder is your world which 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.690
 you have generated a name 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.640
 I can change this daddy 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:14.370
 now tell how these two banner here 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.150
 file ban from ibs and player hurts with 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.340
 responsible for banned players that is to 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.680
 example if I wrote via server 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.290
 a team like a wand ban and a nickname 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.580
 the player will naturally be written here 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.100
 Here is the player's nickname and he is banned 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:40.330
 to dilute the player I stupidly erase 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.070
 his nickname and file next to this nickname and then 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:48.370
 there you are only these lines 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:52.860
 click save file it naturally 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:57.040
 our server file abs file abs file 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.470
 are some admins to write 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:07.600
 some admins just write your nickname on 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:10.720
 server, for example, write them in a column 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.780
 There is now for example my nickname Sergei then 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.460
 I do not know for example denis and then 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.690
 any more yet 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:24.370
 that is, in the post after that we 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.380
 save if you need it further 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.990
 the required file is called a server 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.930
 properties open with notebook 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.660
 and here we see a few lines with 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.500
 which I will tell you now laval mine 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.230
 this is exactly the name of your 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.840
 world folders with the world that is if we 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.830
 write laval on them and for example 1 2 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.610
 3 4 5 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:56.500
 we will create a folder with the world 12345 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.510
 further spawn songs can be resolved 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.120
 ban if you want to ban 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.320
 instead of true force, I am writing to you now 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.020
 show you how to spell white list 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.500
 players if you want to turn white 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.850
 list on the server is also true force spam 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:19.180
 animals too true force hardcore true 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:23.020
 force and here's the most important point is 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.000
 online mod online mod is if you 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.190
 It is here true to your server will be able to 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.110

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.640
 Minecraft license players if 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.490
 you play pirate you go to your 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.100
 server can not write for this 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.100
 instead of true deprived falls 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:45.370
 pvp well, of course whether it is forbidden or 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.000
 allowed to fight on the server too true 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:52.960
 force game mod game from server raids 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.689
 jim i could 0 then server mode game mod 1 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.009
 this is creative 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:01.379
 the maximum number of players here 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:06.099
 you can do any for example put 10 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:08.650
 spawn monsters true force is also the most 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.360
 the last item is your name 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.750
