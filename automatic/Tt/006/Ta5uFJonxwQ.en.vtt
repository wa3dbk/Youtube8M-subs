00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
comfort and everyday commuting it really

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.550 
comfort and everyday commuting it really
is<00:03:52.180> quite<00:03:52.420> comfortable<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.350> if<00:03:53.440> you're

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
is quite comfortable so if you're

somebody that's looking for a real
performance<00:03:55.540> suspension<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.530> might<00:03:56.710> want<00:03:56.890> to

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
performance suspension you might want to

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.460

bigger brakes on the GTS and the 18 inch

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.140 
bigger brakes on the GTS and the 18 inch
wheels<00:04:02.050> offer<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.680> level<00:04:02.950> of<00:04:03.160> security<00:04:03.730> but

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
wheels offer a level of security but

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.620 
wheels offer a level of security but
there's<00:04:04.780> no<00:04:04.930> traction<00:04:05.260> or<00:04:05.560> stability<00:04:05.740> control

there's no traction or stability control
okay<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.660> think<00:04:07.930> I'm<00:04:08.020> going<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.200> sound<00:04:08.440> like<00:04:08.530> a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
okay I think I'm going to sound like a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.020 
okay I think I'm going to sound like a
bit<00:04:08.830> of<00:04:08.860> an<00:04:09.010> old<00:04:09.130> fart<00:04:09.460> but<00:04:09.610> I<00:04:09.640> don't<00:04:09.850> want<00:04:09.970> to

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
bit of an old fart but I don't want to

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.640 
bit of an old fart but I don't want to
drive<00:04:10.240> around<00:04:10.270> with<00:04:10.630> a<00:04:10.690> big<00:04:10.900> spoiler<00:04:11.290> on<00:04:11.530> the

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
drive around with a big spoiler on the

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.170 
drive around with a big spoiler on the
back<00:04:11.800> of<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.010> car<00:04:12.190> first<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.610> obscures<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.060> bit

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
back of the car first it obscures a bit

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.790 
back of the car first it obscures a bit
of<00:04:13.270> your<00:04:13.360> outward<00:04:13.720> visibility<00:04:13.870> out<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.590> back

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
of your outward visibility out the back

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.380 
of your outward visibility out the back
and<00:04:15.130> I<00:04:15.370> think<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.580> look<00:04:15.700> like<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.880> big<00:04:16.090> dork

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
and I think I look like a big dork

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.880 
and I think I look like a big dork
driving<00:04:16.810> around<00:04:16.989> with<00:04:17.170> that<00:04:17.290> big<00:04:17.350> shopping

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
driving around with that big shopping

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.520 
driving around with that big shopping
cart<00:04:18.280> handle<00:04:18.610> on<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.850> back<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.300> wish<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.020> GTS

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
cart handle on the back I wish the GTS

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.860 
cart handle on the back I wish the GTS
came<00:04:21.250> without<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:21.910> then<00:04:22.240> if<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.450> wanted

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
came without it and then if you wanted

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.630 
came without it and then if you wanted
to<00:04:22.990> get<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.260> big<00:04:23.440> spoiler<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:24.040> dealer<00:04:24.460> would

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
to get the big spoiler the dealer would

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.730 
to get the big spoiler the dealer would
install<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:25.480> way<00:04:25.750> you<00:04:26.200> actually<00:04:26.530> have<00:04:26.620> to

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
install it this way you actually have to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.710 
install it this way you actually have to
get<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.890> dealer<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.430> take<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.970> off<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.420> fill

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
get the dealer to take it off and fill

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.060 
get the dealer to take it off and fill
in<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.930> holes<00:04:29.140> I<00:04:29.290> don't<00:04:29.470> know<00:04:29.530> what<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:29.800> do<00:04:29.950> to

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
in the holes I don't know what you do to

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.800 
in the holes I don't know what you do to
get<00:04:30.220> around<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:30.700> it's<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.300> good-looking<00:04:31.600> car

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
get around it it's a good-looking car

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.290 
get around it it's a good-looking car
but<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.320> think<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:33.160> really<00:04:33.250> is<00:04:33.760> a<00:04:33.790> bit<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.270> a

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
but I think it really is a bit of a

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.540 
but I think it really is a bit of a
sheep<00:04:34.750> in<00:04:34.960> wolf's<00:04:35.290> clothing<00:04:35.350> it<00:04:36.070> has<00:04:36.250> all<00:04:36.430> the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
front end the skirts and the spoiler but

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.720 
front end the skirts and the spoiler but
it<00:04:40.660> really<00:04:41.020> isn't<00:04:41.170> a<00:04:41.350> performance<00:04:41.890> car<00:04:42.100> it's<00:04:42.370> a
