MB at max

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.560

you'll<00:03:25.170> also<00:03:25.350> need<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.860> get<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:27.680> lame<00:03:28.680> mp3

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
you'll also need to get a lame mp3

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.650 
you'll also need to get a lame mp3
format<00:03:29.900> for<00:03:30.900> your<00:03:31.020> audio<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:32.300> you<00:03:33.300> can<00:03:33.480> go

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.490 
format for your audio and you can go
here<00:03:33.900> are<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.260> options<00:03:34.410> from<00:03:34.740> microphone<00:03:35.400> and

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
here are the options from microphone and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.590 
here are the options from microphone and
you<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.740> as<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.160> zoom<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:38.640> can<00:03:38.910> choose<00:03:39.210> the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
you can as you zoom you can choose the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.890 
you can as you zoom you can choose the
compressed<00:03:40.230> format<00:03:40.740> it<00:03:41.340> could<00:03:41.640> be<00:03:41.760> PCM<00:03:42.480> or<00:03:42.780> it

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
compressed format it could be PCM or it

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.040 
compressed format it could be PCM or it
could<00:03:43.050> be<00:03:43.170> lame<00:03:43.380> mp3<00:03:43.970> PCM<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.330> like<00:03:45.480> no

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
could be lame mp3 PCM just like no

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.990 
could be lame mp3 PCM just like no
compression<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.770> lame<00:03:46.980> mp3<00:03:47.190> gives<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.820> lot

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
compression and lame mp3 gives you a lot

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.540 
compression and lame mp3 gives you a lot
of<00:03:48.030> compression<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.470> suggest<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.130> use<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
of compression so I suggest you use the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.750 
of compression so I suggest you use the
lame<00:03:51.240> mp3<00:03:51.510> format<00:03:52.350> for<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.680> but<00:03:53.550> these<00:03:53.700> are

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
lame mp3 format for this but these are

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.580 
lame mp3 format for this but these are
the<00:03:53.910> settings<00:03:54.390> so<00:03:54.630> when<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.960> have<00:03:55.140> recorded

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
the settings so when you have recorded

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.220 
the settings so when you have recorded
the<00:03:55.680> video<00:03:56.000> for<00:03:57.000> example<00:03:57.090> I've<00:03:57.570> just<00:03:57.870> recorded
