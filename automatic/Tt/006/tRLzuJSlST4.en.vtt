00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 under a layer of a color that in addition the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.069
 own material is that color with what 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.629
 which even with scratches would keep 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.639
 the color therefore we are achieving a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.429
 very peculiar three-dimensional effect 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.380
 and that really is very differentiating 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.230
 print is only for model 4g or 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.090
 also for the dual for another g will come 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 with this format in three versions and the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.100
 3g version will come with a matte color like 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.590
 when it has this 3d effect or is it the most 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.750
 the best finished is the dual sim the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.699
 best 4g term that is not dual sim 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.550
 because the 3g version will have single sim 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.469
 dual sim has rated the hand but look 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.239
 that one characteristic is that in this 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.149
 so minimalist design we have integrated 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.010
 a large 4.5-inch screen in addition 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.809
 it is ips technology with which it shines 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.760
 very much and on top of ips we have 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.800
 incorporated the proprietary technology of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.149
 nokia that is clicks black display by 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.980
 which front how well I saw the screen 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.450
 and how good the windows phones look 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.130
 8.1 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.400
 an important issue this product we are 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.630
 talking about 119 euros in 1630 without VAT 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.630
 has the present changed 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 the zinc is yellow and the double 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.190
 teach people as if the sun that is 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.290
 of the double without 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.690
 here we have how we already integrate 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.350
 you have to have here you have one here 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.350
 you have another same 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.760
 OK 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.160
 here we have a shock of where a 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.200
 assignia that you have the other and fix 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.000
 like this body shell of a single 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.410
 piece where we integrate is also there 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.270
 to say that in the double if we think 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.850
 very interesting that you can customize 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.950
 each profile of each sim with a color in 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.840
 the icons so that you always know 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.460
 what profile of use are you working on 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.650
 that if you're working is transparent 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.420
 for the user, the bass and 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.710
 we find it very interesting too and very 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.720
 practical that was one of the great 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.030
 doubles problems without it had a 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.600
 memory you assign that whenever 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.030
 call you call with line 1 or with the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.410
 line 2 then when you call that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.700
 memory always uses the line that you 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.470
 you have fixed that happens also for 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.790
 Internet connections if you have a 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.450
 company that will not let you connect in 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.090
 public Wi-Fi whenever you enter with the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.730
 company will go to wifis also safe if 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.230
 you use the intuya that we say a little 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.150
 more free and you can do a little more what 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.459
 that you want with her the phone knows 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.320
 that can enter open wifi or 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.910
 usage profiles have two very 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.920
 transparent is very easy to use and 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.380
 breaks I insist with the myth of those of the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 dual sim that as well everyone knows 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.900
 there was the problem that there was 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.659
 change from a murderer 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.129
 that when you call with a memory there 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.560
 you knew that if he was not dating or 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.909
 be that much more important to me 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.829
 have double sim because much more 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.569
 terminals the market with double sim and 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.489
 that I insist that is key apart from the 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.769
 price that is at 130 and something in this 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.099
 case they are 129 euros plus iva mansion 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.480
 top perfect and remember also that 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.980
 are these products are the first 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.090
 incorporate quad core in this range of 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.700
 impression is to say that we are talking 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.349
 a processing is a which in qualcomm 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.680
 snapdragon 400 with which at the level of 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.720
 processor before it is a 430 euros 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.329
 more or less and olive will cease percent 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.680
 55 foundations will normally in the 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.569
 border of what are the android 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.420
 also 4 cheaper since it is very 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.519
 ok and then we have the super weird since 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.650
 the race the camera is we had 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.180
 now in as high-end on 15 2015 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.129
 lie is a favor to the is of products is 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.689
 inches with the best in camera the best 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.769
 on screen that have been able to 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.420
 do our engineers because they have been 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.730
 able to put all the technology that 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.150
 we had in the factory 15 20 in one size 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.819
 much more compact as is this 930 that 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.769
 has a 5 inch full screen screen 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.440
 hd with which in this sense at the level 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.090
 of pp and they are 440 and a country 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.190
 it looks good and as always 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.230
 we are talking about the best resolution 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.610
 with the best contrast the highest brightness 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.550
 that is, clearblack display technology 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.800
 of exclusive Nokia and also something very 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.360
 important note the level of the finish 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.260
 we are talking a body of one 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.610
 aluminum metal part like lightweight 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.680
 striking in addition to super polycarbonate 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.780
 resistant with which very well and something 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.000
 fundamental the 20 megapixel camera 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.620
 optic carl zeiss besides that we are 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.060
 talking about image stabilizer 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.190
 optical image with which we 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.350
 guarantees a mechanical worship aviation 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.210
 digital mechanism that is important 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.680
 floating or by lenses that's very 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.360
 important six optical lenses that 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.530
 float and that compensate for the movement of 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.299
 user with which the image quality 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.890
 or video is perfect concession 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.810
 we are talking about a quad core also and a 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.500
 quad core equipment 2 with 2 gigahertz in 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.600
 Aragon 800 2 GB RAM 32GB Memory 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.810
 internal all these benefits the 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.130
 screen is not surprising because it seems is 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.290
 rather lighter than it seems 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.790
 is very well finished in aluminum and 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.440
 then from behind you can have good 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.850
 here we have one more color has everything 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.129
 kind of colors has also some 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.779
 more discreet for those who do not want 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:44.399
 and give the cante but the truth is that the 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:44.399
 team has a brutal presence
