00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.010
 Is it appropriate as a document that describes matters to clarify the mainstay? 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.630
 I'm talking about not being appropriate 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.130
 Except the front of Maru 4 from Emar city in the past either 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.750
 I did not talk about it, but after that either 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.340
 The front may also be used as a boy to reveal the main force 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.689
 There is 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.369
 Offer I am also the same in grandchild space but also 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.179
 I will try to see the market what was possible 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.579
 From the first withholding slip and the second payment record height lined up in the middle 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.990
 It is yen because there is a pension common name of 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.070
 From Marichi to Maru 4 of the choices, in this vote 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.940
 Because there is 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.250
 Theoretically, it can be used when using it as a document to expand the instep 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.010
 There is a case 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.990
 The problem is cool 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.850
 The presence or absence of documents from the city of Hirano to the 10th from this 1 to the middle stage 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.949
 Status decline of documents 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.650
 Most other things are 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.140
 Principles are generally based on long-term issues. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.140
 The rule of having to be a principle theory 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.110
 Generally overwhelmed period, eg withholding slip year 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.870
 Because the next year has passed and the waveform is issued collectively by each 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.299
 It is 2009 but it is September 21, but 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.190
 If it is September, 2009, the long-term thing generally issued is 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.350
 It is withholding slip for 2008 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.740
 It is not good enough to bring in 19 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.290
 The principle theory is that of this generally issued long term 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.640
 There must be two escalators and I have to 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.670
 One is a payment statement of ¥ 94 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.950
 It is three times stronger than today by 3% 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.050
 This is also the statement of payment of salary 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.290
 It is issued every month 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.030
 Because it is basically based on monthly salary, it is issued every month and it is roughly 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.620
 The 21st September 21st 21st 21st August 21st year of the sns 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.640
 April minute 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.630
 It must be two months in diameter 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.210
 For example, it is 21 years of flying and there is January or January and January and May. 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.590
 Write this and you have 2 months to change this option 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.720
 I'm going 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.170
 Mari's option is 2 months for denim to be effective in 2001 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.010
 Yes December 10, 2008 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.710
 We said that there is May of 2009 or anything, but so 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.669
 Not 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:17.209
 As of the last two months, as of September 2009 as of now 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.269
 August 21st August, April 21 most recent month 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.129
 There is a rule that you must 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.379
 The other one has no problem this time, but the target No. 10 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.669
 Pension certificate 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.889
 This is a product when the right to receive a pension has occurred 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.310
 To be issued 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.399
 It wasn't a line every year because it was every month 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:40.019
 It is important to be able to receive pensions 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.680
 Because I have to do a little 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.409
 There is no such thing in the immediate or so about this 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.579
 Just because there are people who have 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.099
 Eye 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.919
 There is no limitation of 7 years or less 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.540
 Of the 10 things from the mouth I think Harajima 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.909
 Most things generally take the immediate period to be issued 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.569
 It must be a thing 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.989
 In the matter of this time, it is quite common to circle 102 yen 4 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:02.579
 is not it 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.259
 There is a wound that does not come or sound 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 The exception is if it is a statement of salary payment 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.849
 It should be the last two months instead of any two months 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.470
 If it is a pension certificate, it is assumed that this is issued as the city 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:16.169
 Because 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.119
 One by one without saying the pension certificate issued by 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:20.399
 I can't hold anything 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.079
 Ghosts are different 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.430
 From the above ecm times the problem is incorrect pay payment 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.950
 If it is 2 months within the source area of ​​statement times, it doesn't matter 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.220
 Mr. Maru who is doing it is wrong, so it's the opposite 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.750
 Will be
