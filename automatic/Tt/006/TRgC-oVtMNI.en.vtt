00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
morning she was not quite as crisp we

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.150 
morning she was not quite as crisp we
were<00:00:55.050> all<00:00:55.170> sitting<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> press<00:00:55.920> pit

remarking<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.920> tonight

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
remarking on it and I think that tonight

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.560 
remarking on it and I think that tonight
she<00:00:59.430> brought<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.760> sharper<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.390> also

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
she brought a little sharper but also

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810 
she brought a little sharper but also
yox<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.199> he<00:01:01.289> leaned<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.980> much<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.670> was

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
yox and he leaned out so much which was

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.329 
yox and he leaned out so much which was
a<00:01:02.850> big<00:01:03.059> WOW<00:01:03.270> factor<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> judges<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.189> when

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
a big WOW factor for the judges but when

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.380 
a big WOW factor for the judges but when
they<00:01:05.460> stood<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.000> they<00:01:06.090> did<00:01:06.240> that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
they stood there and they did that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.600 
they stood there and they did that
little<00:01:06.510> lat<00:01:06.810> spread<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.470> know<00:01:07.619> Irish<00:01:08.340> just

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
little lat spread you know Irish just

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.000 
little lat spread you know Irish just
overpowered<00:01:09.450> her<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.810> think<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.799> lot<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
overpowered her and I think in a lot of

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
overpowered her and I think in a lot of
times<00:01:11.310> iris<00:01:11.700> beat<00:01:12.030> her<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.240> back<00:01:12.450> poses

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
times iris beat her in the back poses

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
times iris beat her in the back poses
too<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> most<00:01:13.950> vulnerable<00:01:14.220> iris

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
too was this the most vulnerable iris

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.580 
too was this the most vulnerable iris
Kyle's<00:01:15.000> been<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.450> recent<00:01:15.630> memory<00:01:15.869> too<00:01:16.229> oh<00:01:16.380> yeah

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
Kyle's been in recent memory too oh yeah

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.140 
Kyle's been in recent memory too oh yeah
I<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.009> she<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.490> vulnerable<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
I think if she was very vulnerable I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.490 
I think if she was very vulnerable I
don't<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.509> she<00:01:18.600> dominated<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> show<00:01:19.350> by

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
don't think she dominated the show by

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.520 
don't think she dominated the show by
any<00:01:19.740> means<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.970> agree<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.479> ruth<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.080> yox<00:01:22.290> Annie

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
any means I agree with ruth at yox Annie

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.010 
any means I agree with ruth at yox Annie
she<00:01:23.220> leaned<00:01:23.520> down<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.299> almost<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.780> she

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
she leaned down it's almost like she

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.929 
she leaned down it's almost like she
went<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.650> bit<00:01:25.830> too<00:01:26.040> far<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.790> she

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
went a little bit too far I think it she

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.370 
went a little bit too far I think it she
just<00:01:26.970> stopped<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.930> she<00:01:27.990> was<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
just stopped the you know she was a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.039 
just stopped the you know she was a
little<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.920> flat<00:01:29.189> side<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.329> had<00:01:30.900> she

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
little on the flat side and it had she

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.510 
little on the flat side and it had she
had<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.470> bit<00:01:31.590> more<00:01:31.710> fullness<00:01:31.860> than<00:01:32.310> then

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
had a little bit more fullness than then

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.160 
had a little bit more fullness than then
I<00:01:32.549> think<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.210> could<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.390> been<00:01:33.479> tables

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
I think you know could have been tables

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.600 
I think you know could have been tables
could<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.380> been<00:01:34.500> turned<00:01:34.650> Irish<00:01:35.130> Kyle<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
could have been turned Irish Kyle was a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.399 
could have been turned Irish Kyle was a
six-time<00:01:36.180> Miss<00:01:36.360> Olympia<00:01:36.600> goings<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.259> had

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
six-time Miss Olympia goings is that had

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
six-time Miss Olympia goings is that had
a<00:01:37.439> count<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.799> something<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.460> had<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.880> give<00:01:39.030> her

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
a count for something it had to give her

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.789 
a count for something it had to give her
a<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.299> edge<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.720> believe<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.170> she<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.619> in

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
a little edge I believe that she was in

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.679 
a little edge I believe that she was in
the<00:01:40.890> Miss<00:01:41.009> Olympia<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.850> exciting<00:01:42.450> had<00:01:42.540> been

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the Miss Olympia and exciting had been

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.510 
the Miss Olympia and exciting had been
Miss<00:01:42.840> Olympia<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.920> yox<00:01:44.130> any<00:01:44.369> would

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
Miss Olympia I think that yox any would

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.770 
Miss Olympia I think that yox any would
have<00:01:44.640> walked<00:01:44.759> away<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:45.479> title

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
have walked away with this with title

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780 
have walked away with this with title
tonight<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.200> think<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> answer<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.579> is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
tonight I think the answer to that is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.300 
tonight I think the answer to that is
look<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.299> their<00:01:48.420> waists<00:01:48.890> iris<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:49.979> has<00:01:50.130> got<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
she does i think that yaks Annie even

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.590 
she does i think that yaks Annie even
though<00:01:56.219> she's<00:01:56.430> large<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.880> she's<00:01:57.030> majestic

wasn't that Nippon little waist ours is
is<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.439> think<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.740> counted<00:02:02.219> shape<00:02:03.060> counts

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
is and I think that counted shape counts

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.679 
is and I think that counted shape counts
I<00:02:03.750> think<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.259> yacht<00:02:04.409> standing<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:04.890> Quinn's<00:02:05.219> I

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
I think the yacht standing or Quinn's I

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.670 
I think the yacht standing or Quinn's I
guess<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.899> thing<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.079> hurt<00:02:07.350> her<00:02:07.500> was<00:02:07.649> that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
guess the thing that hurt her was that

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.199 
guess the thing that hurt her was that
her<00:02:07.860> legs<00:02:08.129> are<00:02:08.280> very<00:02:08.340> straight<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.090> now

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
her legs are very straight up and now

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.910 
her legs are very straight up and now
Chris<00:02:09.479> she<00:02:09.929> doesn't<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.379> sweep<00:02:10.770> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920

because she's got a little bit of

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.160 
because she's got a little bit of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
during the front where iris puts it away

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.649 
during the front where iris puts it away
it's<00:02:25.709> her<00:02:25.890> structure<00:02:26.459> which<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.269> little<00:02:27.569> you

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
it's her structure which is a little you

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.080 
it's her structure which is a little you
know<00:02:27.689> which<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.140> unique<00:02:28.609> she's<00:02:29.609> got<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.849> sweep

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
know which is unique she's got the sweep

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.179 
know which is unique she's got the sweep
to<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.299> thigh<00:02:30.540> which<00:02:30.840> kind<00:02:31.139> leaves<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.069> other

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
to the thigh which kind leaves the other

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.890 
to the thigh which kind leaves the other
girls<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.489> little<00:02:32.639> bit<00:02:32.760> vulnerable<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.540> she's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
girls a little bit vulnerable and she's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.420 
girls a little bit vulnerable and she's
still<00:02:34.049> got<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.290> cap<00:02:34.469> belts<00:02:34.829> with<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> small<00:02:35.250> way

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
still got the cap belts with a small way

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.369 
still got the cap belts with a small way
so<00:02:35.489> even<00:02:36.329> though<00:02:36.420> she's<00:02:36.599> not<00:02:36.629> at<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> best<00:02:37.200> and

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
so even though she's not at a best and

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.750 
so even though she's not at a best and
she<00:02:37.469> was<00:02:37.620> very<00:02:37.829> vulnerable<00:02:38.129> here<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.519> thought

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
she was very vulnerable here I thought

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.819 
she was very vulnerable here I thought
and<00:02:39.450> then<00:02:39.599> from<00:02:39.780> behind<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.409> didn't<00:02:40.590> think<00:02:40.739> she

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
and then from behind I didn't think she

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.379 
and then from behind I didn't think she
was<00:02:40.950> hard<00:02:41.219> from<00:02:41.519> behind<00:02:41.549> really<00:02:42.180> i<00:02:42.209> thought

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
was hard from behind really i thought

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.849 
was hard from behind really i thought
her<00:02:42.569> glutes<00:02:42.840> I've<00:02:42.989> seen<00:02:43.200> her<00:02:43.290> who<00:02:43.379> was<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.680> used

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
her glutes I've seen her who was so used

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.800 
her glutes I've seen her who was so used
to<00:02:44.010> seeing<00:02:44.189> this<00:02:44.579> that<00:02:44.819> Lonnie<00:02:45.090> Coleman<00:02:45.659> desk

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
to seeing this that Lonnie Coleman desk

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.740 
to seeing this that Lonnie Coleman desk
looking<00:02:46.319> cozy<00:02:46.769> up<00:02:47.280> here<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.849> she<00:02:48.359> didn't<00:02:48.599> have

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
looking cozy up here and she didn't have

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.479 
looking cozy up here and she didn't have
that<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.169> I<00:02:49.230> think<00:02:49.590> maybe<00:02:49.950> that's<00:02:50.189> why<00:02:50.340> we're

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
that and I think maybe that's why we're

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.280 
that and I think maybe that's why we're
being<00:02:50.669> a<00:02:50.879> little<00:02:51.060> bit<00:02:51.510> more<00:02:51.720> discerning<00:02:52.169> about

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
being a little bit more discerning about

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.379 
being a little bit more discerning about
her<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.950> guess<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.669> to<00:02:53.700> say<00:02:54.000> when<00:02:54.209> all

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
her but I guess you have to say when all

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:55.640 
her but I guess you have to say when all
said<00:02:54.629> then<00:02:54.840> she's<00:02:55.019> still<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.319> best<00:02:55.349> body

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
said then she's still the best body

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.409 
said then she's still the best body
builder<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.040> stage<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.489> think<00:02:56.970> that's<00:02:57.150> that's

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
builder on stage I think that's that's

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.909 
builder on stage I think that's that's
how<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.689> judges<00:02:57.930> are<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.349> that's<00:02:58.469> how<00:02:58.530> you

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
how the judges are and that's how you

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.800 
how the judges are and that's how you
know<00:02:59.010> pretty<00:02:59.159> much<00:02:59.250> too<00:02:59.579> you<00:02:59.849> know<00:02:59.969> experts

know pretty much too you know experts

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.080 
know pretty much too you know experts

last year she thinks she should have
better<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.799> year<00:03:07.859> people<00:03:08.159> are<00:03:08.340> telling<00:03:08.519> her

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.409 
at the bodies evidence if you're not
going<00:04:42.410> to<00:04:42.470> go<00:04:42.590> with<00:04:42.680> Elena<00:04:42.950> Pope<00:04:43.250> as<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.850> second

going to go with Elena Pope as a second
or<00:04:44.540> third<00:04:44.570> then<00:04:45.200> obviously<00:04:45.380> there's

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
or third then obviously there's

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.690 
or third then obviously there's
something<00:04:45.889> they<00:04:46.040> didn't<00:04:46.190> like<00:04:46.310> about<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.550> may

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
something they didn't like about it may

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.840 
something they didn't like about it may
be<00:04:46.760> too<00:04:46.970> blocky<00:04:47.210> may<00:04:47.840> be<00:04:47.900> needing<00:04:48.440> me<00:04:48.560> maybe<00:04:49.220> so

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
be too blocky may be needing me maybe so

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.070 
be too blocky may be needing me maybe so
they're<00:04:50.000> going<00:04:50.180> for<00:04:50.360> shape<00:04:50.570> so<00:04:50.840> then<00:04:50.960> I'm

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
they're going for shape so then I'm

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
there obviously that shape on stage wit

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.129 
there obviously that shape on stage wit
his<00:04:55.639> devilish<00:04:55.970> upski<00:04:56.389> fit<00:04:56.570> into<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.870> mix<00:04:57.020> here

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
his devilish upski fit into the mix here

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.990 
his devilish upski fit into the mix here

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
because she's arguably the hardest girl

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.330 
because she's arguably the hardest girl
in<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.240> class<00:04:59.389> and<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.750> her<00:05:00.740> height<00:05:00.979> maybe

packs the most muscle she absolutely

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.990 
packs the most muscle she absolutely
outmuscled<00:05:03.680> iris<00:05:04.040> she<00:05:04.310> did<00:05:04.460> was<00:05:04.669> harder<00:05:04.970> than

outmuscled iris she did was harder than
virus<00:05:05.510> I<00:05:05.630> don't<00:05:06.080> think<00:05:06.169> I<00:05:06.560> think<00:05:06.800> debbie<00:05:07.190> is

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
virus I don't think I think debbie is

virus I don't think I think debbie is
fighting<00:05:07.639> her<00:05:07.729> structure<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.419> don't<00:05:08.990> think

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.390 
fighting her structure I don't think
there's<00:05:09.290> anything<00:05:09.500> she<00:05:09.650> can<00:05:09.919> do<00:05:10.070> I<00:05:10.100> know<00:05:10.280> I

there's anything she can do I know I

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.310 
there's anything she can do I know I
think<00:05:10.550> she<00:05:10.760> thinks<00:05:11.120> she<00:05:11.570> can<00:05:11.750> keep<00:05:11.900> putting<00:05:12.229> on

on I think it probably is i think so but
