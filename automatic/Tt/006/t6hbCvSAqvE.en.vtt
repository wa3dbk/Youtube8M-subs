00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
great idea but it could work and again

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
another warrior this time I tried a

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.390 
another warrior this time I tried a
little<00:01:51.280> harder<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.910> I<00:01:52.540> did<00:01:52.930> manage<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.650> get<00:01:53.830> to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
little harder and I did manage to get to

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.610
