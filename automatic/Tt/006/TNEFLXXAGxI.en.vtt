00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.490
 good planets androlla here I bring you 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.550
 another video tutorial a little different to 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.860
 what I have previously placed this 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.900
 video tutorial is aimed at those 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.619
 new users in this system 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.570
 operative those who do not know how to spend 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.720
 even the games or app to your card 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.410
 microsd since as we know many 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.260
 smartphone come with internal card 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.449
 with little memory so good this 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.780
 program is recommended 100% to spend 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:57.030
 those apps and games to that micro sd 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.410
 we can also do it by the method 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.949
 native that is the system's colon 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.730
 two 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.770
 from now on it can be done natively 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:12.360
 but for those who get complicated 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.170
 much then we will have this app in the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.060
 video will be a link where you download this 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.560
 we unzip it in our 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:28.280
 and there will be a folder with this application 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.770
 this pk we will copy it in our 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.079
 smartphone and I put it 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.000
 later on my computer as I already 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.600
 they know what placed it in a folder called 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.890
 apk and good is already copied we are going to 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.150
 copy again 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.580
 OK ready 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.680
 let's go to the second part of the video 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.490
 tutorial inside the smartphone for the 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.770
 explanation and installation of this app 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.229
 we are in the second part within the 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.869
 smartphone so we went to 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.490
 our favorite explorer and we're leaving 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.110
 to the folder where we place the ape cam 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.830
 we give you here to install 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.490
 and we wait a few seconds 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.940
 we open and not go to some information 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.790
 of the system and here is not saying more or 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.160
 less is one minute and how is it 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.310
 use this verifiable license application 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.900
 and we accept it, we wait for it to recognize 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.100
 our applications within the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:36.630
 smartphone and ready good we start this 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.290
 in this app the most important thing that you have 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.840
 is it tells us what the programs are 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.489
 or mobile games of our card 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.459
 microsd we have the part in the sd that 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.160
 are the programs already placed within 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.950
 the micro sd and we have the part not 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.590
 movable are those that applications or 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.730
 games that we can not move towards 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.640
 our microsd card 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.340
 let's see the mobile and let's make a 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.980
 test let's move on to kings states 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.140
 we give him there and here he gives us a 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.769
 instructions how to do it for 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.879
 pass it to the sd card or vice versa 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.330
 they saw that has total 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.330
 storage 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:28.390
 let's go here this section where it says move 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:31.960
 the memory card is moving 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:37.180
 we hope and ready we go to the part of 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:41.800
 back and we go where it says in the headquarters 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:46.390
 as you already saw that step towards the card 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.790
 sd and we can do that vice versa what 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.320
 we can place if we want to the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:56.860
 device then it 's very easy to 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:00.250
 use it as you saw and we go to the part 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.300
 of mobiles and we choose our 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:07.750
 programs or games true of this era 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.760
 we want to move to our micro sd this 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.640
 is the part where we do it with the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.370
 program that is a bit automatic and we 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.450
 give that information where they are 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.820
 that can be moved or can not be moved 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.530
 we go to the part that is native that as 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.780
 I already told him before he does with 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.620
 versions in points 2 2 points 3 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.810
 have ahead we go to the part of 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.940
 configuration and we're going towards 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.890
 application manager or a lot 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.490
 they have applications 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:42.100
 we give it there and we enter the interface 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.460
 of application manager these 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.540
 are the latest downloaded programs will 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.050
 we turn aside and we are already in 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.260
 the part of the memory card 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.840
 internal these 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.420
 since it has the degrees are the 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.350
 programs that are already within the 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:07.230
 micro sd let's do an example here 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.290
 within this interface we give to 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.520
 mercadolibre and we give it in the part of 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:17.880
 move the card of a micro sd ready 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.360
 then already it had to move as they see and 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:26.550
 have the check in there so good try 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.280
 in as much the app that leaves him or they do 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.030
 for the native part as you 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.120
 prefer 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:39.520
 so comment how you thought about it 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.520
 video and like if they liked it
