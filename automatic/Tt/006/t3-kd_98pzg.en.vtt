 'Developer Diary' 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.920
 «World of Warships» - it is rich sea battles. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.240
 This game is about warships in its purest form. 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.840
 Ships - the first half of the 20th century. Brutal steel monsters in the tens of thousands of tons, 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.760
 warring. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.020
 'Developer Diary' 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.760
 If we compare «World of Warships» with "tanks" 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.120
 at first it seems that this is like a power game. 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 But it is only at first glance, in the beginning of the battle. 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.640
 When she started the fight, the player unexpectedly realizes at that moment that everything happens too quickly, 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.960
 that he should instantly shoot, switch to see, do not go on it torpedoes, 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.160
 check where its reconnaissance plane, do not go at it the enemy planes. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.880
 Imagine a dozen warships, armed with guns to sixteen inches, 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.600
 Add to this mix the destroyers with deadly torpedoes. 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.800
 Now, add the amount of: 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.640
 look up - and you will see that you are attacked by bombers and torpedo bombers. 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.520
 Even higher in the sky fighting planes: 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.400
 fighter against the other fighter planes and bombers. 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.080
 And as soon as you imagine all this great, grand picture, 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.040
 you will understand that «World of Warships» - is not just flip the mouse and shoot: 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.760
 here you need to think strategically and make the right tactical moves. 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.900

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.120
 The game will be four classes of ships: aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and destroyers. 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.680
 Each class has its own characteristics. 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.840
 The very simple - with aircraft carriers. From the title it is clear that their main weapon - deck-based aircraft. 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.320
 The aircraft carrier is to bomb and torpedo hit its aircraft. 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.760
 Located on an aircraft carrier fighter, 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.040
 which he can attack enemy aircraft carriers and other ships scouts. 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.960
 The main class will, of course, the battleship. 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.720
 Everyone knows him: it is almost a symbol of the Second World War. 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 Now we are one of them. 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.000
 We can not say that this is the most important vehicle, but that is what first comes to mind. 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.960
 Erik Lincar (battleship) - is «Maus», which put the guns, and he had to go on the map. 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.560
 Cruiser - perhaps tactically very important class of ships: 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.040
 they have good value braniravanastsi and speed. 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.360
 Cruisers can be compared with medium tanks: 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.640
 they can gryzanuts Erik Lincar, they destroy the destroyers, aircraft carriers, and prowl around the battlefield. 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.640
 In our case - on the waters. 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.040
 Destroyer - a small, high-spirited ship. 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.560
 The main strategic advantage destroyer - agility and quickness. 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.760
 Imagine in the "tank" Fireflies: small, nimble, agile - and it Quad gun on the KV-2. 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.000
 Here it's about and will be our destroyer - fast, maneuverable, armed with torpedo tubes. 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.240
 The game will not be submarines. 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.720
 Believe me, we have considered the idea. 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.560
 But this tiny objects that are almost impossible to expose - only sonar, but he is not so powerful. 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.040
 Firepower submarines impressive, but as soon as they appear on the surface, they will grind to a sour apple. 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.480
 It is impossible to introduce them to the game, because in order to preserve the quality of the game ... 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.280
 We understand the importance of the war at sea had a German submarine forces and the American submarine fleet. 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.580
 But the game is not fit - and therefore they will not be in the game. 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.740

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.200
 A project like «World of Warships», it is impossible to establish, if based only on the figure. 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.200
 Perhaps it was not fair to even, 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.080
 so our team has twice visited warships museums in the United States. 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.480
 Trips to these ships and their studies give very much, 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.040
 allow to collect a lot of information that you can not get anywhere else. 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.840
 If we see firsthand how to actually look real ships, 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.440
 This significantly helps to achieve veracity graphics and closer to realism. 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.520
 I think the players is very important. 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.920
 When you see the ship alive, not in the picture, you realize that this is not an abstract image, 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.200
 and a huge iron machine that move, shoot - you know, in general, how everything happened. 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.400
 It transformed a sense of how you need to pass it in the game. 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.320
