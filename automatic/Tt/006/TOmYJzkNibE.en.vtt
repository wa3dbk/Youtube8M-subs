00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:15.120
 hello friends with you katya how exactly 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:20.189
 structure fine but let's hope that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.289
 you have such issue will be devoted to 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.289
 it came I don't like sports and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.580
 contacts 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.820
 we wait 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.930
 this is a sports bike is necessary on 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.930
 track crafts 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.840
 faith came up 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.300
 adaptation 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.910
 u burn ivanovo grohe concetto for 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.910
 cities specially made for cottage cheese 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.770
 other 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.539
 yes if 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.539
 care or 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.990
 that's the opposite 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.120
 but 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.210
 theme 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.830
 there is no question of it arguing it 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.420
 The science cycle group also has its own 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.880
 benefits from traffic light to traffic light 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.220
 can accelerate to infection and get 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.080
 lightning 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.510
 motorcycle weeks are faster 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.160
 vehicle in the city not 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.030
 just because of traffic jams 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.080
 moving fast but also because 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.690
 fast elders traffic light before traffic light 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.730
 allows us to get exactly on the green 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.660
 wave of traffic lights can quickly them 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.660
 so drove 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.100
 if you think that sport is exactly 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.290
 to the track, and all things that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.569
 length of like 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.420
 export and also for 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.840
 fit absolutely normal 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.530
 the only thing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.599
 sparta really came from 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.670
 motorcycles which are therefore sporting 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.260
 track they have a distinct advantage in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.930
 maneuverability 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.540
 and received footpegs and in order to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.200
 lay stronger 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.480
 this is all 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.269
 the presence of this factor is in no way and 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.879
 that's what this is still a motorcycle for roads 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:41.819
 general use why don't i personally 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.890
 like with ports but it turned out on 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.240
 really not just not visually not 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.110
 like and 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.110
 like the cruiser and 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.860
 know why 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.860
 I don't like the aegis 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.810
 i like 1 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.810
 help comes 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.210
 amazing he brought 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.420
 technically very unique motorcycle 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.750
 but I always take who exactly looks 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.890
 paraphernalia because i have a smartphone 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.890
 precisely by the external attribute 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.790
 the hornet 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.480
 r600 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.480
 deus court 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.210
 master we now invert it 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.239
 Well 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.690
 9 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.690
 rx1 walls 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.790
 i.e. any two cycles that fits 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.970
 under 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.910
 street fighter category ship 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.200
 don't really like 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.739
 my question is to 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.739
 inline engine 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.480
 like to use 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.770
 jack i like the worlds me 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.950
 like the way they ride and unfortunately 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.510
 that's it that's mine 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.510
 let's say well and not 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.030
 wine 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.659
 makes very limited my choices 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.659
 motorcycle 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.600
 in total and if 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.720
 let's conditionally take if i want 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.470
 change your bike and on some 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.190
 oh options 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.050
 but very but 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.720
 without how I liked the rows of the motorcycle 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.640
 there should have been another option 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.720
 I only get out of the options 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.039
 those that I called 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.809
 and everything is in principle 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:44.649
 Well, still varick only redo 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:47.740
 anything like there btp take liter 

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:50.219
 to remake but as if one thing is ready 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.349
 two cycles another thing is to redo it 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:55.599
 very different things that's why i don't 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.999
 subscribed to the street rider channel and although in 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.419
 Basically the guy is very cool 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:06.099
 interesting and loda comic oleg exactly 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:08.800
 Ukrainians are funny fishhechki sorry he 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:14.490
 will recently got into an accident therefore 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.490
 quick recovery here 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.569
 so it is by these criteria that I donâ€™t 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.569
 fit sparta 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.039
 for have friends on sportbikes and not one 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.520
 and I rode on with pulp like 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.789
 and for many enough 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.440
 1 port tourists yes cool go but 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.979
 as if not mine 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.379
 just not mine so I will not 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:45.180
 to say that now sport is so worth it 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:47.830
 affairs and yes i'm saying sparta drocher it 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.360
 not bad in my understanding of the word that is 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.520
 don't call it 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.520
 I'm just the same object he sportop 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.740
 that's why if you heard from me there 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.819
 sports jerking off don't have to be offended by this 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.819
 none sent 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.400
 a j 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.400
 so human 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.349
 question when I talk about elephants 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.349
 which spa 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.729
 such things were up to my attitude to 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:36.879
 sport bike 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:39.120
 Thanks for watching, I hope you have been 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:39.120
 interesting 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.349
 go to my channel can be found 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.680
 still something interesting for yourself 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.680
 until
