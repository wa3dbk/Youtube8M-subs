I<00:00:01.460> couldn't<00:00:02.460> help<00:00:02.610> myself<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:03.389> promised<00:00:03.899> I

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
I couldn't help myself I promised I

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.690 
I couldn't help myself I promised I
wasn't<00:00:04.259> going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.560> touch<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:05.040> engine<00:00:05.460> again

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
wasn't going to touch this engine again

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.540 
wasn't going to touch this engine again
today<00:00:06.120> but<00:00:06.589> well<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:08.040> know<00:00:09.349> this<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
today but well you know this is the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.369 
today but well you know this is the
magneto<00:00:14.089> for<00:00:15.089> leads<00:00:15.420> coming<00:00:15.870> up<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> back<00:00:16.350> of

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
magneto for leads coming up the back of

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.519 
magneto for leads coming up the back of
her<00:00:16.910> you<00:00:17.910> can<00:00:17.940> see<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.080> Lukas<00:00:21.020> it<00:00:22.020> tells

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
her you can see it's a Lukas it tells

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.250 
her you can see it's a Lukas it tells
you<00:00:23.000> this<00:00:24.000> an<00:00:24.210> SR<00:00:24.689> magneto<00:00:26.630> these<00:00:27.630> are

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
you this an SR magneto these are

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.139 
you this an SR magneto these are
generally<00:00:31.260> incredibly<00:00:32.009> reliable<00:00:32.340> pieces<00:00:33.059> of

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
generally incredibly reliable pieces of

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.520 
generally incredibly reliable pieces of
kit<00:00:33.620> but<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.770> suspect<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.329> little<00:00:37.320> bit

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
kit but I suspect it like a little bit

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:47.750 
kit but I suspect it like a little bit
of<00:00:40.520> Duffing<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:42.350> cleaning<00:00:43.350> certainly<00:00:46.760> turn

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
of Duffing up cleaning certainly turn

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.189 
of Duffing up cleaning certainly turn
around<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.550> she<00:00:51.170> she's<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
around we can see what is she she's a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.310 
around we can see what is she she's a
model<00:00:52.559> sr<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:54.020> mark<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:58.020> got<00:00:58.199> an

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
model sr for mark to a and it's got an

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740 
model sr for mark to a and it's got an
arrow<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.010> tells<00:00:59.070> us<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.180> goes<00:01:00.359> that

as<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.119> light<00:02:10.270> going<00:02:10.630> yep<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:12.010> see<00:02:12.310> where

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
as the light going yep you can see where

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.660 
as the light going yep you can see where
the<00:02:12.670> rotor<00:02:12.910> arm<00:02:13.300> touches<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:15.100> effect<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
off too far the plugs well it's a shame

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.570 
off too far the plugs well it's a shame
it's<00:02:27.190> broken<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.680> look<00:02:29.890> an<00:02:30.130> austin<00:02:31.090> spanner
