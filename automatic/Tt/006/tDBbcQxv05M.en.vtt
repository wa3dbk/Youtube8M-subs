00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
can do a search for your programs

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.300 
can do a search for your programs
instead<00:04:53.660> of<00:04:53.750> having<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.080> all<00:04:54.380> programs<00:04:54.980> and

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
instead of having to all programs and

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.760 
instead of having to all programs and
the<00:04:56.030> like<00:04:56.270> in<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:56.600> normal<00:04:56.900> thing<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.530> you

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
the like in the normal thing and you

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.590 
the like in the normal thing and you
have<00:04:57.890> to<00:04:58.010> go<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.340> find<00:04:58.640> them<00:04:58.910> and<00:04:59.090> stuff<00:04:59.330> yeah

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
folders so it's not that useful but in a

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.970 
folders so it's not that useful but in a
folders<00:06:39.980> like<00:06:40.900> windows<00:06:41.900> where<00:06:42.320> you<00:06:42.410> have<00:06:42.530> tons

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
folders like windows where you have tons

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.400 
like some files and stuff it's really
annoying<00:06:46.940> and<00:06:47.240> you<00:06:47.300> can<00:06:47.450> what<00:06:47.990> you<00:06:48.020> can<00:06:48.170> do<00:06:48.290> is

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
annoying and you can what you can do is

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.620 
annoying and you can what you can do is
just<00:06:48.590> like<00:06:48.770> click<00:06:49.550> here<00:06:49.880> and<00:06:50.060> you'll<00:06:50.150> have<00:06:50.330> re

all your files in alphabetical order

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.480 
all your files in alphabetical order
much<00:06:53.480> easier<00:06:54.080> to<00:06:54.260> find<00:06:54.530> what<00:06:54.920> you're<00:06:55.100> looking

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.050 
for
so<00:06:56.270> I<00:06:56.330> thought<00:06:56.480> that<00:06:56.540> was<00:06:56.750> pretty<00:06:57.020> cool<00:06:58.000> so<00:06:59.000> far

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
so I thought that was pretty cool so far

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.120 
so I thought that was pretty cool so far
I<00:06:59.240> haven't<00:06:59.450> been<00:06:59.630> able<00:06:59.840> to<00:07:00.020> make<00:07:00.320> it<00:07:00.500> work

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
I haven't been able to make it work

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.900 
I haven't been able to make it work
forever

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
forever

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.760 
forever
thing<00:07:02.060> I<00:07:02.150> say<00:07:02.300> is<00:07:02.420> my<00:07:02.570> default<00:07:02.750> file<00:07:03.320> manager

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
thing I say is my default file manager

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.580 
thing I say is my default file manager
but<00:07:04.160> if<00:07:04.250> I<00:07:04.400> go<00:07:04.520> to<00:07:04.580> the<00:07:05.120> V<00:07:05.300> or<00:07:05.330> click<00:07:06.050> computer

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
but if I go to the V or click computer

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.460 
but if I go to the V or click computer
it<00:07:07.490> comes<00:07:07.700> up<00:07:07.850> as<00:07:07.970> a<00:07:08.000> normal<00:07:08.390> one<00:07:08.540> so<00:07:08.570> I<00:07:08.990> haven't

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
it comes up as a normal one so I haven't

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.750 
it comes up as a normal one so I haven't
found<00:07:09.770> out<00:07:09.920> how<00:07:10.040> to<00:07:10.100> do<00:07:10.190> that<00:07:10.310> maybe<00:07:10.490> it's<00:07:10.670> a

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760 
found out how to do that maybe it's a

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.330 
found out how to do that maybe it's a
bug<00:07:10.970> of<00:07:11.090> the<00:07:11.150> program<00:07:11.510> I'll<00:07:12.320> contact<00:07:12.920> the

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
bug of the program I'll contact the

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.510 
bug of the program I'll contact the
lease<00:07:14.150> oft<00:07:14.480> person<00:07:15.020> and<00:07:15.260> see<00:07:15.470> if<00:07:15.620> he<00:07:16.040> can<00:07:16.190> fix

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
lease oft person and see if he can fix

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.660 
lease oft person and see if he can fix
that<00:07:16.700> maybe<00:07:16.880> for<00:07:17.210> us<00:07:18.310> so<00:07:19.310> yeah<00:07:19.490> that's

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:19.670 
that maybe for us so yeah that's

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.070 
that maybe for us so yeah that's
basically<00:07:19.820> it<00:07:20.150> that's<00:07:20.300> what<00:07:20.480> I<00:07:20.510> want<00:07:20.690> to<00:07:20.930> show
