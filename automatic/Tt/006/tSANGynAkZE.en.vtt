because<00:05:21.320> having<00:05:22.190> long<00:05:22.370> hair<00:05:22.400> if<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:23.030> wind

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
because having long hair if the wind

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.120 
because having long hair if the wind
blows<00:05:23.450> it<00:05:23.870> stuck<00:05:24.230> to<00:05:24.350> your<00:05:24.440> lips<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:24.890> that's

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
blows it stuck to your lips and that's

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
just no fun at all

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:37.050 
just no fun at all
so<00:05:26.920> yes

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.930 

and<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.840> over<00:05:38.139> lots<00:05:38.350> of<00:05:38.650> sheep<00:05:39.340> since<00:05:39.669> off<00:05:39.820> my

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
and and over lots of sheep since off my

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.050 
and and over lots of sheep since off my
lips<00:05:40.120> where<00:05:40.570> I've<00:05:40.720> just<00:05:40.750> drawn<00:05:41.200> every<00:05:41.680> day

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
lips where I've just drawn every day

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.920 
lips where I've just drawn every day
it's<00:05:43.060> pretty<00:05:43.300> much<00:05:43.389> straight<00:05:43.660> across

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
it's pretty much straight across

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:55.220 
it's pretty much straight across
naturally

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.600 

so<00:05:56.230> let's<00:05:56.380> use<00:05:56.500> it<00:05:56.590> later<00:05:56.680> coming<00:05:57.100> first<00:05:57.310> and

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
so let's use it later coming first and

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.790 
so let's use it later coming first and
then<00:05:58.210> I<00:05:58.240> go<00:05:58.480> over<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:58.780> top<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:58.960> it<00:05:59.200> with<00:05:59.770> a

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
then I go over the top of it with a

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.550 
then I go over the top of it with a
darker<00:06:00.130> color<00:06:00.630> people<00:06:01.630> always<00:06:01.840> ask<00:06:02.020> what<00:06:02.290> so

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
darker color people always ask what so

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.860 
darker color people always ask what so
keyword<00:06:03.030> density<00:06:04.030> I'm<00:06:04.330> probably<00:06:04.540> running<00:06:04.750> a

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
keyword density I'm probably running a

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.000 
keyword density I'm probably running a
few<00:06:05.050> different<00:06:05.290> ones<00:06:05.350> to<00:06:05.470> exhibit<00:06:05.890> two

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
few different ones to exhibit two

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.220 
few different ones to exhibit two
different<00:06:06.280> layers<00:06:06.520> so<00:06:06.930> there's<00:06:07.930> quite<00:06:08.080> a<00:06:08.140> few

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230
