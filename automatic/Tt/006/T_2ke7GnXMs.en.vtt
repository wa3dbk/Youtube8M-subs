 hello friends with you project firm 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.950
 com and i'm Sergey mikhailov today we will 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.260
 look at galaxy j1 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.150
 samsung anti-crisis solution 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.250
 designed to strengthen the position 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.350
 manufacturer in the segment available 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.170
 smartphones let's get acquainted 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.000
 let's start as usual with the exterior of the body 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.810
 device is completely made of 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.090
 plastic 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.550
 the only exception is glass 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.679
 front panel of the polymer from which 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.800
 all other parts of the device are cast 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:41.409
 turned out and not glossy or matte it 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.489
 and the sun shines pleasantly from the palm 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.979
 does not slip out 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.229
 to the word in the hand apparatus feels 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.719
 Excellent ergonomic performance not 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:52.780
 cause no questions to use 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.539
 smartphone on the go is also convenient to build and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.969
 fitting components at level no neither 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.879
 squeaks are not crunchy even at very 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.940
 squeeze the gadget go to 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.060
 galaxy j1 crane is equipped with relatively 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.689
 quite good 43 inch tft matrix with 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.439
 a resolution of 800 by 480 pixels 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:17.020
 pixels per inch 217 units in principle 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.000
 performance is not very impressive but on 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.060
 in practice it was not already 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.609
 sad grit of course there is but 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.600
 notice it can only picky 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.549
 users 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.369
 those who have never seen full hd 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.799
 or lay displays most likely to be 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.479
 completely satisfied with this screen because 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.939
 look at it without pain in the eyes 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.189
 quite possibly closing the question 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.560
 grains say that even small 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.659
 smartphone interface elements here 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.329
 Appearing very appetizing demon 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.850
 torn uneven contour displayed 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.200
 colors close natural familiar 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.719
 Samsung mom in summer 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.640
 glut there is no range 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.310
 brightness can be described as 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.259
 enough and it seems to me minimal and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.749
 maximum threshold could be 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.179
 make wider though that 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.999
 there is enough for almost all viewing angles 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.380
 screen very good distortion 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.720
 the displayed pictures are minimal 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.790
 even with severe slopes in general 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.190
 the screen here is quite good especially 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.110
 considering the budget class of the device is not 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.290
 pleases except that the lack of sensor 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.660
 lighting meets tomorrow adjustment 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.900
 brightness talk about the camera device 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.280
 galaxy j1 is equipped with a 5 megapixel 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.040
 sensor capable of creating very 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.040
 quite good photos especially provided 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.500
 good lighting to the word flash here 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.900
 there is so squeeze at least some 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.630
 footage from this camera will turn out even in 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.520
 twilight the maximum size we write 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.410
 their video is 720p 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.900
 quality is inferior often 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.480
 slips out of flight because of what 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.240
 the picture turns out to be jerky 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.910
 By illogicality of a smartphone through headphones, I 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.250
 I was pleased with the volume is also quite good 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.900
 but still a small stock for all sorts 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.390
 firemen are missing here 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.090
 as for the multimedia speaker 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.400
 the picture is when the smartphone tries 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.650
 make a sound at medium volume then 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.570
 his melody is quite good as 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.540
 only it comes to the maximum 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.730
 wheezing appears to the word j1 yelling 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.520
 relatively loud if competently 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.670
 pick up the ringtone you probably once 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.700
 you hear it even in a noisy place 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.020
 next in line are issues of iron and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.460
 performance heart device 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.810
 is a dual core processor 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:35.990
 spreadtrum sc9830 frequency controlled 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.600
 1 and 2 gigahertz video accelerator 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.150
 mali-400 ram floor 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.910
 4GB built-in 4 support 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.560
 plug-in cards are present if 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.720
 in short words in everyday 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.600
 using the system shows itself 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.270
 not bad but no more than the freshest 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.730
 games here slow down or don't go 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.610
 In general, the shell slightly tupit when 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.010
 scrolling through desktops last to 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.240
 the word happens extremely rarely but the fact 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.459
 there is a place to be 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.440
 probably cause this all 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.320
 troubles become very small 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.510
 amount of RAM in general 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.610
 You can play on this smartphone but 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.359
 count on something more than 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.460
 games like old Engry birds or 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.959
 2048 I do not recommend although of course 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.120
 there are exceptions for example 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.100
 notorious and very beautiful battle 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.780
 and it works fine here 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.569
 results in synthetic tests 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.520
 expect and low however for 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.590
 state employee average 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.020
 indicator also of features 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.930
 the hardware parts of the device are highlighted and 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.970
 support of this device 2 micro sim cards 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.789
 radio module 1 so when 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.280
 activating one sim card 2 will 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.310
 inaccessible in general, we are quite 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.849
 standard solution powered by smartphone from 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.400
 1850 milliamp removable battery 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.380
 hours on average this stock smart phone 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.270
 lasts about two and a half days 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.479
 work at medium loads 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.030
 again quite familiar picture 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.490
 programmatically from the new device is 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.979
 operating system android 4 4 4 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.650
 kitkat proprietary interface 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.780
 touchwiz as it should be 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.330
 the manufacturer decided its shell 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.460
 most branded voracious buns 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.620
 and additions that as for me in this 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.710
 even a good case 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.509
 the manufacturer turned out almost 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.180
 standard green robot but with branded 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.159
 design samsung almost the only 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.530
 software which company 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.440
 decided to leave is mode 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.240
 maximum energy savings 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.580
 thanks to him, the smartphone turns into 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.889
 little functional not that capable 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.440
 live more than 10 days from completely 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.750
 charged battery it's time 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.199
 sum up today in Ukraine for 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.360
 samsung galaxy j1 asking about 110 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.250
 not countable us dollars 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.199
 productive hardware 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.430
 device such a price tag creates him 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.810
 quite a large number 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.150
 competitors 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.880
 most of them are solutions from 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.310
 Chinese manufacturers in that case 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.680
 if you don't want to experiment and 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.870
 want to get an affordable smartphone 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.690

 galaxy j1 starts to look quite like 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.400
 probable bidder because in 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.949
 this plane worthy alternatives 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.090

 will not disappoint people who do not expect 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.700
 from budget performance model and 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:37.640
 the power of current flagships 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.980
