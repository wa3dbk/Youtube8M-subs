00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.160 
neon glowing type effect on this object
I'm<00:00:29.910> gonna<00:00:30.060> go<00:00:30.180> ahead<00:00:30.270> and<00:00:30.360> go<00:00:30.540> with<00:00:30.570> standard

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
I'm gonna go ahead and go with standard

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.410 
I'm gonna go ahead and go with standard
I<00:00:31.290> don't<00:00:31.440> need<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.740> many<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.610> don't<00:00:33.120> need<00:00:33.300> as

I don't need as many I don't need as
much<00:00:33.540> detail<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.530> curve<00:00:34.860> as<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.700> would<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.030> I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
much detail in my curve as I would if I

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.970 
much detail in my curve as I would if I
was<00:00:36.210> creating<00:00:36.629> a<00:00:36.690> 3d<00:00:36.960> logo<00:00:37.170> where<00:00:37.410> I'd<00:00:37.499> usually

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
was creating a 3d logo where I'd usually

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560 
was creating a 3d logo where I'd usually
go<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.190> something<00:00:38.519> like<00:00:38.550> fine<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.149> superfine

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
go with something like fine or superfine

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.319 
go with something like fine or superfine
and<00:00:39.929> for<00:00:40.559> convert<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.160> instead<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> closed

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and for convert to instead of closed

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.569 
and for convert to instead of closed
Poly's<00:00:42.870> let's<00:00:43.230> use<00:00:43.440> polylines<00:00:44.249> we're<00:00:44.460> just

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
Poly's let's use polylines we're just

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.180 
Poly's let's use polylines we're just
going<00:00:44.699> to<00:00:44.730> create<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:45.449> point<00:00:45.809> polygons<00:00:46.379> which

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
going to create two point polygons which

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.709 
going to create two point polygons which
will<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.550> create<00:00:47.789> lines<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.480> then<00:00:48.600> we're

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
will just create lines but then we're

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.090 
will just create lines but then we're
gonna<00:00:48.809> take<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.199> step<00:00:49.379> further<00:00:49.589> and<00:00:49.769> make

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
gonna take it a step further and make

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.099 
gonna take it a step further and make
them<00:00:50.339> more<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.670> neon<00:00:50.999> tubes<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.019> gonna

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
them more like neon tubes so I'm gonna

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.529 
them more like neon tubes so I'm gonna
go<00:00:52.230> ahead<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.379> click<00:00:52.620> OK<00:00:53.159> and<00:00:53.699> we've<00:00:54.210> got<00:00:54.390> this

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
go ahead and click OK and we've got this

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.069 
go ahead and click OK and we've got this

mountain pew logo created by John
Telford<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.800> I'm<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.069> going<00:00:59.339> to<00:00:59.539> delete

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
Telford and I'm just going to delete

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.139 
Telford and I'm just going to delete
some<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.929> the<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.859> elements<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.789> really

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
some of the the elements that I I really

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.530 
some of the the elements that I I really
don't<00:01:03.359> need<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.330> bare

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
don't need and just go for the bare

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.950 
don't need and just go for the bare
minimum<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.560> okay<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.220> that'll<00:01:08.759> work<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.600> as

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
minimum here okay so that'll work so as

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.139 
minimum here okay so that'll work so as
you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.259> see<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:11.009> bunch<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.369> two

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
you can see it's just a bunch of two

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.539 
you can see it's just a bunch of two
point<00:01:12.360> Polly's<00:01:12.719> if<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.930> go<00:01:13.079> into<00:01:13.520> wireframe<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
point Polly's if I go into wireframe and

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.389 
point Polly's if I go into wireframe and
select<00:01:15.149> you'll<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.930> nothing<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.469> two<00:01:17.159> point

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
select you'll see nothing but two point

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.459 
select you'll see nothing but two point
Polly's<00:01:17.759> there's<00:01:18.030> no<00:01:18.240> faces<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
Polly's there's no faces on it so if I

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.889 
Polly's there's no faces on it so if I
go<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.729> texture<00:01:20.729> you'll<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.539> there's<00:01:21.719> no

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
go to texture you'll see there's no

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.010 
go to texture you'll see there's no
faces<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:23.939> thin<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.600> neon

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
faces and it's a little thin for neon

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
faces and it's a little thin for neon
tubing<00:01:25.469> but<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.100> need<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.310> waste

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
tubing but we don't need to waste

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
tubing but we don't need to waste
geometry<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.990> neon<00:01:28.200> tubing<00:01:28.469> when<00:01:28.649> we<00:01:28.770> can

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
geometry on the neon tubing when we can

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.550 
geometry on the neon tubing when we can
give<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> nice<00:01:29.430> glow<00:01:29.820> effect<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.420> layout<00:01:30.930> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
give it a nice glow effect in layout so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
give it a nice glow effect in layout so
I'm<00:01:31.619> gonna<00:01:31.740> go<00:01:31.860> ahead<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.009> save<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.610> let's

camera get a nice little angle on there
okay<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.609> of<00:01:51.270> course<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.719> once<00:01:52.289> we<00:01:52.439> get<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
okay and of course we can once we get it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.289 
okay and of course we can once we get it
set<00:01:52.859> up<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.189> change<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.909> angle<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
set up we can change the angle to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.029 
set up we can change the angle to
anything<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.780> want<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.649> gonna<00:01:55.770> go<00:01:55.890> over<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
anything we want I'm gonna go over to

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.999 
anything we want I'm gonna go over to
the<00:01:56.219> surface<00:01:56.549> editor<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.439> surface

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the surface editor and for that surface

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.300 
the surface editor and for that surface
let's<00:01:59.789> change<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.630> color<00:02:00.869> let's<00:02:01.380> use<00:02:01.649> blue

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
let's change the color let's use blue

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.719 
let's change the color let's use blue
and<00:02:03.109> then<00:02:04.109> let's<00:02:04.409> add<00:02:04.649> some<00:02:04.950> luminosity<00:02:05.579> we

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and then let's add some luminosity we

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.099 
and then let's add some luminosity we
want<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.999> brighten<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.539> surface<00:02:06.990> I'm

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
want to brighten up the surface I'm

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.380 
want to brighten up the surface I'm
gonna<00:02:07.229> crank<00:02:07.499> it<00:02:07.649> up<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.920> 125<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:09.119> something

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
gonna crank it up to 125 just something

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.790 
gonna crank it up to 125 just something
bright<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:10.110> an<00:02:10.170> open<00:02:10.410> GL<00:02:10.619> it's

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
bright and you can see an open GL it's

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.460 
bright and you can see an open GL it's
it's<00:02:11.100> much<00:02:11.310> brighter<00:02:11.670> now

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
it's much brighter now

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.650 
it's much brighter now
when<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:12.980> go<00:02:13.100> over<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.460> advance<00:02:13.880> tab<00:02:14.270> and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
when I go over to the advance tab and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.500 
when I go over to the advance tab and
under<00:02:15.200> glow<00:02:15.740> intensity<00:02:16.400> I'm<00:02:16.910> gonna<00:02:17.090> up<00:02:17.270> that

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
under glow intensity I'm gonna up that

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.740 
under glow intensity I'm gonna up that
to<00:02:17.720> 100%<00:02:18.080> as<00:02:18.740> well<00:02:19.100> now<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.910> thing<00:02:20.330> about<00:02:20.360> glow

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
to 100% as well now the thing about glow

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.060 
to 100% as well now the thing about glow
intensity<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.320> it's<00:02:21.470> not<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.890> take<00:02:22.040> it

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
intensity is it's not going to take it

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.400 
intensity is it's not going to take it
it's<00:02:23.030> not<00:02:23.180> going<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.360> take<00:02:23.480> effect<00:02:23.570> until<00:02:24.110> we

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's not going to take effect until we

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.710 
it's not going to take effect until we
tell<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.220> control<00:02:25.730> f8<00:02:26.150> which<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.570> our

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
tell it to in control f8 which is our

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.560 
tell it to in control f8 which is our
processing<00:02:27.350> time<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:28.040> I'm<00:02:28.820> going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.180> enable

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
processing time and I'm going to enable

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.380 
processing time and I'm going to enable
glow<00:02:29.990> it's<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.380> post<00:02:30.650> process<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.910> we<00:02:32.120> need<00:02:32.270> to

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
glow it's a post process so we need to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.870 
glow it's a post process so we need to
we<00:02:32.660> need<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.900> tell<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:34.100> go<00:02:34.220> ahead<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.610> take

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
we need to tell it to go ahead and take

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.180 
we need to tell it to go ahead and take
advantage<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.900> setting<00:02:36.290> let's<00:02:37.010> do<00:02:37.160> a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
advantage of that setting let's do a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.140 
advantage of that setting let's do a
render<00:02:38.320> okay<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.530> as<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.310> can<00:02:40.550> see<00:02:40.760> we're

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
render okay and as you can see we're

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.670 
render okay and as you can see we're
starting<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.570> get<00:02:41.690> some<00:02:41.870> glow<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.230> there<00:02:42.410> let's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
starting to get some glow in there let's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.320 
starting to get some glow in there let's
up<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.160> glow<00:02:43.400> I'm<00:02:43.640> gonna<00:02:43.790> do<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> hundred

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
up that glow I'm gonna do a hundred

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.460 
up that glow I'm gonna do a hundred
percent<00:02:44.450> on<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.110> glow<00:02:45.320> on<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:46.580> intensity

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
percent on the glow on the intensity

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.170 
percent on the glow on the intensity
okay<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:49.310> start<00:02:49.520> getting<00:02:49.580> much<00:02:49.880> brighter

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
okay so we start getting much brighter

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.610 
okay so we start getting much brighter
there<00:02:50.390> I'm<00:02:50.480> gonna<00:02:50.570> tone<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.080> down<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.290> bit

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
there I'm gonna tone that down a bit

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.480 
there I'm gonna tone that down a bit
let's<00:02:51.980> try<00:02:52.280> 80<00:02:52.910> percent<00:02:53.590> okay<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.160> let's<00:02:55.400> go

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
let's try 80 percent okay and let's go

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.280 
let's try 80 percent okay and let's go
ahead<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.700> go<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.790> camera<00:02:56.180> properties<00:02:56.990> and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
ahead and go to camera properties and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.230 
ahead and go to camera properties and
let's<00:02:57.440> add<00:02:57.680> some<00:02:58.040> anti-aliasing<00:02:58.880> I'm<00:02:59.120> gonna

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
let's add some anti-aliasing I'm gonna

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.120 
let's add some anti-aliasing I'm gonna
add<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.740> level<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:00.800> six<00:03:01.190> six<00:03:01.670> passes<00:03:02.530> okay<00:03:03.530> and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
add a level of six six passes okay and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.040 
add a level of six six passes okay and
we<00:03:04.250> start<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.610> see<00:03:04.820> some<00:03:05.060> nice<00:03:05.480> little<00:03:05.900> neon

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
we start to see some nice little neon

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.530 
we start to see some nice little neon
going<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.650> now<00:03:07.250> with<00:03:07.430> anti-aliasing<00:03:07.910> I've

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
going on now with anti-aliasing I've

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.390 
going on now with anti-aliasing I've
decided<00:03:08.990> that<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.290> do<00:03:09.380> want<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.740> crank<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.160> up

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
decided that I do want to crank this up

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.620 
decided that I do want to crank this up
let's<00:03:11.120> say<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.270> hundred<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:11.720> twenty<00:03:13.270> okay<00:03:14.270> I

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
let's say a hundred and twenty okay I

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.630 
let's say a hundred and twenty okay I
like<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:15.170> better<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.160> now<00:03:16.190> we've<00:03:16.430> got<00:03:16.610> some

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
like that better so now we've got some

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.699 
like that better so now we've got some
neon<00:03:17.150> text<00:03:17.450> going<00:03:17.750> on<00:03:17.959> here<00:03:18.140> but<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.470> want<00:03:18.620> to

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
neon text going on here but I want to

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.040 
neon text going on here but I want to
just<00:03:18.860> spice<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.400> up<00:03:19.489> just<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:20.000> little<00:03:20.030> bit<00:03:20.270> so

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.270 
use a point light and we're just gonna
call<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.040> glow<00:03:38.170> I'm<00:03:39.170> gonna<00:03:39.320> raise<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.650> up<00:03:39.980> to

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
call it glow I'm gonna raise it up to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.020 
call it glow I'm gonna raise it up to
right<00:03:41.060> about<00:03:41.090> here<00:03:41.500> now<00:03:42.790> let's<00:03:43.790> see<00:03:43.910> what

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
happens when we do the render okay we're

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.140 
happens when we do the render okay we're
not<00:03:47.959> really<00:03:48.200> seeing<00:03:48.530> anything<00:03:48.950> okay<00:03:49.880> so<00:03:50.030> what

that light right here so I'm gonna go
over<00:03:54.800> to<00:03:54.950> light<00:03:55.519> properties<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.690> I'm<00:03:56.750> gonna

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
over to light properties and I'm gonna

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.530 
over to light properties and I'm gonna
turn<00:03:57.050> on<00:03:57.110> lens<00:03:57.530> flare<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.550> let's<00:03:58.700> go<00:03:58.850> over<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.060> D

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
turn on lens flare so let's go over to D

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.690 
turn on lens flare so let's go over to D
for<00:03:59.810> display<00:04:00.170> options<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.890> I'm<00:04:01.430> gonna<00:04:01.519> go

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
for display options and I'm gonna go

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.759 
for display options and I'm gonna go
over<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:02.000> open<00:04:02.420> GL<00:04:02.690> lens<00:04:02.930> flares<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.470> turn

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
over to open GL lens flares and turn

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.699 
over to open GL lens flares and turn
them<00:04:03.950> on<00:04:04.120> okay<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.360> I<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:05.690> see<00:04:05.870> back<00:04:06.050> here<00:04:06.350> we

them on okay and I can see back here we

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.670 
them on okay and I can see back here we
got<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.920> Open<00:04:07.880> GL<00:04:08.060> lens<00:04:08.360> flare<00:04:08.600> going<00:04:08.870> on<00:04:09.050> it's

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
got a Open GL lens flare going on it's

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.650 
got a Open GL lens flare going on it's
not<00:04:09.769> really<00:04:09.890> what<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.340> want<00:04:10.700> though<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.570> I'm

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
not really what I want though so I'm

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.759 
not really what I want though so I'm
gonna<00:04:11.750> go<00:04:11.840> ahead<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.019> change<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.560> light

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
gonna go ahead and change the light

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.130 
gonna go ahead and change the light
color<00:04:13.100> it's<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:13.940> same<00:04:14.239> color<00:04:14.480> blue<00:04:14.690> we<00:04:14.930> used

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
color it's the same color blue we used

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.500 
color it's the same color blue we used
earlier<00:04:15.500> but<00:04:16.220> there's<00:04:16.370> still<00:04:16.609> this<00:04:16.730> red<00:04:17.090> outer

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
earlier but there's still this red outer

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.330 
earlier but there's still this red outer
glow<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:18.140> I'm<00:04:18.260> not<00:04:18.440> excited<00:04:18.709> about<00:04:18.919> somebody

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
glow that I'm not excited about somebody

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.430 
glow that I'm not excited about somebody
go<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.489> lens<00:04:19.730> flare<00:04:20.030> options<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.900> I'm<00:04:21.320> going

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
go to lens flare options and I'm going

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.280 
go to lens flare options and I'm going
to<00:04:21.500> turn<00:04:21.680> on<00:04:21.979> I'm<00:04:22.789> going<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.000> turn<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.330> ring

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
to turn on I'm going to turn that ring

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.980 
to turn on I'm going to turn that ring
and<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:25.160> red<00:04:25.310> outer<00:04:25.580> glow<00:04:25.880> off<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.630> let's<00:04:26.840> do

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
and the red outer glow off and let's do

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.210 
and the red outer glow off and let's do
a<00:04:27.020> render<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.880> now<00:04:29.600> we<00:04:29.660> can<00:04:30.050> see<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.980> looks

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
a render and now we can see it looks

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.650 
a render and now we can see it looks
like<00:04:31.280> that's<00:04:31.520> almost<00:04:31.970> like<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:32.120> light<00:04:32.390> source

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
like that's almost like a light source

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.820 
like that's almost like a light source
in<00:04:32.840> there<00:04:32.930> we<00:04:33.050> could<00:04:33.110> have<00:04:33.260> as<00:04:33.380> many<00:04:33.530> as<00:04:33.650> we

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
in there we could have as many as we

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.310 
in there we could have as many as we
want<00:04:34.010> we<00:04:34.100> could<00:04:34.190> also<00:04:34.510> animate<00:04:35.510> that<00:04:35.990> light

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
want we could also animate that light

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.470 
want we could also animate that light
moving<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:37.010> if<00:04:37.190> it's<00:04:37.430> light<00:04:37.700> pulsing<00:04:38.240> through

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
moving is if it's light pulsing through

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.140 
moving is if it's light pulsing through
there<00:04:38.660> let's<00:04:39.380> let's<00:04:39.980> intensify<00:04:40.640> this<00:04:40.700> a<00:04:40.850> bit

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
there let's let's intensify this a bit

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.930 
there let's let's intensify this a bit
let's<00:04:41.390> try<00:04:41.600> a<00:04:41.630> hundred<00:04:42.460> okay<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.520> can<00:04:43.700> see<00:04:43.850> it

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
let's try a hundred okay you can see it

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.490 
let's try a hundred okay you can see it
in<00:04:44.030> since<00:04:44.180> if<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.420> in<00:04:44.480> OpenGL<00:04:45.020> which<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:45.290> kind<00:04:45.470> of

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
in since if I in OpenGL which is kind of

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.710 
in since if I in OpenGL which is kind of
a<00:04:45.590> nice<00:04:45.770> little<00:04:46.040> touch<00:04:46.280> there<00:04:46.520> okay<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.300> so

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
a nice little touch there okay and so

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.540 
a nice little touch there okay and so
there<00:04:47.930> we<00:04:48.020> go<00:04:48.050> it's<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.710> little<00:04:48.950> it's<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.370> bit

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
there we go it's a little it's a bit

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.510 
there we go it's a little it's a bit
much<00:04:49.700> so<00:04:49.970> I'm<00:04:50.060> gonna<00:04:50.210> lower<00:04:50.450> that<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.980> seventy

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.050 

and<00:04:55.520> there<00:04:55.640> we<00:04:55.730> go

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
and there we go

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.840 
and there we go
so<00:04:56.450> one<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.110> things<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.590> that<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.550> good

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
so one of the things that that is good

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.350 
so one of the things that that is good
to<00:04:59.000> know<00:04:59.180> when<00:04:59.690> working<00:04:59.960> with<00:05:00.320> glow<00:05:00.860> or<00:05:01.360> lens

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
to know when working with glow or lens

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.690 
to know when working with glow or lens
flares<00:05:02.660> is<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.680> they're<00:05:04.100> not<00:05:04.280> going<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.490> show

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
flares is that they're not going to show

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.800 
flares is that they're not going to show
up<00:05:04.910> in<00:05:05.150> your<00:05:06.400> alpha<00:05:07.400> scene<00:05:08.240> now<00:05:08.390> I<00:05:08.420> just<00:05:08.540> get

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
up in your alpha scene now I just get

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.220 
up in your alpha scene now I just get
the<00:05:09.400> line<00:05:10.400> there<00:05:10.820> and<00:05:11.060> it's<00:05:11.300> it's<00:05:11.600> nothing

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
the line there and it's it's nothing

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.140 
the line there and it's it's nothing
like<00:05:12.470> what<00:05:12.680> we're<00:05:12.830> seeing<00:05:12.860> here<00:05:13.310> so<00:05:13.910> what<00:05:14.060> you

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
like what we're seeing here so what you

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.110 
like what we're seeing here so what you
need<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.390> do<00:05:14.540> is<00:05:14.780> go<00:05:14.960> over<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.170> control<00:05:15.590> f8<00:05:16.120> come

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
need to do is go over to control f8 come

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.960 
need to do is go over to control f8 come
to<00:05:17.300> add<00:05:17.570> image<00:05:18.110> filter<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.710> choose<00:05:19.040> flare<00:05:19.610> to

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
to add image filter and choose flare to

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.480 
to add image filter and choose flare to
alpha<00:05:20.450> okay<00:05:21.110> it's<00:05:21.320> not<00:05:21.530> just<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:21.980> lens<00:05:22.190> flares

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
alpha okay it's not just for lens flares

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.310 
alpha okay it's not just for lens flares
it's<00:05:22.790> also<00:05:22.940> going<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.180> work<00:05:23.240> with<00:05:23.360> glow<00:05:23.810> so<00:05:24.200> if

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
it's also going to work with glow so if

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.820 
it's also going to work with glow so if
I<00:05:25.120> go<00:05:26.120> ahead<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:26.360> do<00:05:26.450> a<00:05:26.480> render<00:05:26.870> we<00:05:27.500> can<00:05:27.650> see

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
I go ahead and do a render we can see

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.740 
I go ahead and do a render we can see
our<00:05:27.950> render<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.490> if<00:05:28.580> I<00:05:28.670> come<00:05:28.850> over<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.240> alpha

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
our render and if I come over to alpha

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.340 
our render and if I come over to alpha
we're<00:05:30.320> able<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:31.010> save<00:05:31.940> out<00:05:32.150> this<00:05:32.390> alpha<00:05:32.840> of<00:05:33.020> the

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
we're able to save out this alpha of the

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.490 
we're able to save out this alpha of the
glow<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:34.460> lens<00:05:35.360> flare<00:05:35.630> as<00:05:35.750> well<00:05:35.960> so

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
glow and the lens flare as well so

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.110 
glow and the lens flare as well so
that's<00:05:36.620> a<00:05:36.740> handy<00:05:36.980> little<00:05:37.250> tip<00:05:37.520> for<00:05:37.760> working

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
that's a handy little tip for working

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.380 
that's a handy little tip for working
with<00:05:38.330> lens<00:05:39.260> flares<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:39.710> glow<00:05:39.920> if<00:05:40.760> you<00:05:40.910> want<00:05:41.180> to

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
with lens flares and glow if you want to

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.210 
with lens flares and glow if you want to
take<00:05:41.600> advantage<00:05:41.720> of<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.170> Alpha<00:05:42.500> so<00:05:43.070> that's

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
take advantage of the Alpha so that's

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.880 
take advantage of the Alpha so that's
just<00:05:43.280> a<00:05:43.430> quick<00:05:43.610> look<00:05:43.940> at<00:05:44.210> taking<00:05:44.840> an<00:05:45.170> EPS<00:05:45.620> file

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
just a quick look at taking an EPS file

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.300 
just a quick look at taking an EPS file
or<00:05:46.070> an<00:05:46.130> illustrator<00:05:46.520> file<00:05:46.790> loading<00:05:47.720> it<00:05:47.810> up<00:05:47.930> and

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
or an illustrator file loading it up and

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.070 
or an illustrator file loading it up and
converting<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.430> into<00:05:49.690> two-point<00:05:50.690> Polly's

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
converting it into two-point Polly's

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.680 
converting it into two-point Polly's
that<00:05:51.350> we<00:05:51.440> can<00:05:51.560> later<00:05:51.770> go<00:05:51.920> into<00:05:52.520> layout<00:05:53.270> and

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
that we can later go into layout and

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.610 
that we can later go into layout and
turn<00:05:54.350> into<00:05:54.530> neon<00:05:55.280> lights
