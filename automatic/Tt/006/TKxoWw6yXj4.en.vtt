00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.140
 and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.800
 hello everyone is light I hope that 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.210
 you're fine today we get 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.730
 found for a new video on 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.169
 call of duty modern warfare 2 we 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.029
 are in melee general on the map 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.659
 highrise with a class with bars 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.040
 the has all the assets and the accessories 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.230
 I do not remember very well of 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.550
 show a classic class for for 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.520
 sniper indeed made with the bar is 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.960
 so that's so with regard to the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.090
 gameplay it's an excellent gameplay that 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.220
 I realized and if I allow myself to 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.900
 propose to co2 qg as you could the 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.900
 see in the intro at the beginning of the video 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.670
 it's simply because when 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.750
 My last 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.150
 finally at the last video that 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.500
 I had proposed a qg code I have everything 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.420
 simply realized a nuclear to 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.980
 intervention but obviously with the 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.720
 titles and like all the actual necks 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.239
 but despite everything there are some 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.590
 people who moaned saying that a 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.650
 too many of it had been 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.060
 done with lakers cheat and even though 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.580
 all nuclear are done like that at 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.230
 the present time, despite everything, it's not 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.510
 fake I still did a lot of 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.920
 kiel with his famous who is strict 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.480
 that's why today I'm 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.400
 allow you to offer gameplay in 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.710
 general melee very good gameplay with 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.870
 a big score certainly will be a small 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.300
 little money but no hitching helicopter or 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.670
 or two that is strict as powerful 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.780
 who make them do everything for me you 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.400
 see that he's still realized 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.820
 a very big part of the frags me 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.900
 even with my fear style so here's in 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.310
 regards the gameplay I think 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.870
 you have pretty much everything said 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.430
 now it's up to you to watch a 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.330
 simply and so since 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.920
 I'm about halfway through 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.220
 gameplay like the gameplay is going very very 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.780
 quick 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.280
 I'm just going to talk to you very 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.170
 quickly from a subject that holds me 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.119
 a lot to heart and that makes me limit 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.580
 rather badly at the moment 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.510
 it's just the patch of doing 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.400
 the update 2 1 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.590
 bulls and jigga on call of duty advanced 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.820
 warfighter because as you may have the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 notice i'm just a 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.810
 player snipe for those who do not 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.370
 do not know that's surprise I'm 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.290
 a player style and so I fidh 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.750
 enormously as well as trip toilets so 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.340
 for trick shots nothing to do but in this 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.530
 concerning the fidh you are not 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.450
 without knowing that fidh on call of duty 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.760
 and sport lighthouse was enormously 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.110
 accelerated much more than the on the 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.000
 old co the offer what does it all 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.370
 simply that now if we do a 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.110
 blow by blow to the snipe ie 4 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.450
 that they have shot by blow so a kill 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.230
 finally a ball until a ball until 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.550
 four times in a row 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.570
 we just do not have the cua of 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.460
 feed because the witness patch accelerated the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.440
 fidh that now the girl disappears 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.490
 too quickly and so here I would 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.690
 that you give me your opinion by 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.420
 report to that if you too find yourself 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.550
 that it's really just being abused 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.170
 because certainly fidh was really 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.730
 too long and so at the level of 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.140
 standards its part that poses a little 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.850
 problem for some sniper what I 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.650
 totally understand but now 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.450
 it's really anything the fidh 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.840
 is extremely fast and it's really 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.400
 pity 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.959
 I think it spoils that waste 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.070
 enormously the pleasure of playing and I 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.360
 I'm not alone in thinking this given 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.100
 that we are still several waves 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.750
 returned to the old codes following 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.360
 this match and I find that really 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.709
 pity so in any case I leave you 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.750
 interact with me in the comments 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.220
 I hope you enjoyed this gameplay because 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.180
 it ends right away and me I you 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.180
 say to the next chip
