and they frightened me like they do a
lot<00:03:17.269> of<00:03:17.299> us<00:03:17.510> but<00:03:18.290> once<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.590> started<00:03:18.799> learning<00:03:18.980> a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
lot of us but once I started learning a

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.310 
lot of us but once I started learning a
couple<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.760> basics<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.690> big<00:03:20.930> piece

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
couple of the basics of this big piece

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.710 
couple of the basics of this big piece
of<00:03:21.590> metal<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.250> plastic<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.060> rubber<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.570> is

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
of metal and plastic and rubber that is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.080 
of metal and plastic and rubber that is
our<00:03:23.840> cars<00:03:24.110> breaking<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.280> down<00:03:25.310> into<00:03:25.430> systems

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
our cars breaking it down into systems

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.729 
our cars breaking it down into systems
and<00:03:26.329> finding<00:03:26.660> ways<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.019> could<00:03:27.110> relate<00:03:27.560> it

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
and finding ways that I could relate it

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.680 
and finding ways that I could relate it
to<00:03:27.769> other<00:03:28.160> things<00:03:28.519> that<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:28.700> did<00:03:28.940> know<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.329> that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
to other things that I did know and that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.780 
to other things that I did know and that
I<00:03:29.720> wasn't<00:03:30.019> afraid<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:31.160> fear<00:03:31.400> started

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
I wasn't afraid of that fear started

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.699 
I wasn't afraid of that fear started
melting<00:03:31.910> away<00:03:32.209> maybe<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.320> wasn't<00:03:33.470> so

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
melting away maybe it wasn't so

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.620 
melting away maybe it wasn't so
frightening<00:03:33.980> after<00:03:34.430> all<00:03:34.549> somebody<00:03:35.390> put<00:03:35.540> it

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
frightening after all somebody put it

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.600 
frightening after all somebody put it
together<00:03:35.750> which<00:03:36.170> meant<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.500> maybe<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.430> could

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
together which meant that maybe I could

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.100 
together which meant that maybe I could
take<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:37.970> apart<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:38.480> put<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:38.810> back<00:03:38.900> together

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
take it apart and put it back together

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.920 
take it apart and put it back together
again<00:03:39.640> next<00:03:40.640> was<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.880> find<00:03:41.090> my<00:03:41.269> strength<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.780> was

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
again next was to find my strength I was

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.229 
again next was to find my strength I was
in<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.049> man's<00:03:42.320> world<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.340> couldn't<00:03:43.880> always<00:03:44.000> do

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
in a man's world so I couldn't always do

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.600 
in a man's world so I couldn't always do
things<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.690> way<00:03:44.720> that<00:03:44.810> men<00:03:45.079> did

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
things the way that men did

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.920 
things the way that men did
my<00:03:45.760> strength<00:03:46.030> was<00:03:46.150> different<00:03:46.570> it's<00:03:46.720> down<00:03:46.900> here

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
my strength was different it's down here

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.350 
my strength was different it's down here
instead<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.590> here<00:03:47.920> me<00:03:48.490> would<00:03:48.640> often<00:03:48.940> stop<00:03:49.150> and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
instead of here me would often stop and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.940 
instead of here me would often stop and
stare<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.720> look<00:03:49.870> at<00:03:49.960> me<00:03:50.020> why<00:03:50.260> is<00:03:50.410> she<00:03:50.560> doing<00:03:50.740> it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
stare and look at me why is she doing it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.370 
stare and look at me why is she doing it
like<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.510> but<00:03:52.510> what<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:52.720> learned<00:03:53.050> was<00:03:53.350> that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
like that but what I learned was that

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.020 
like that but what I learned was that
there's<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.680> solution<00:03:54.220> or<00:03:54.310> multiple<00:03:54.760> solutions

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
there's a solution or multiple solutions

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.880 
there's a solution or multiple solutions
to<00:03:55.450> every<00:03:55.660> problem<00:03:55.690> if<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.440> can't<00:03:56.620> lift<00:03:56.770> a

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
to every problem if you can't lift a

tire with your arms roll it up your leg

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.530 
tire with your arms roll it up your leg
you've<00:03:58.840> got<00:03:58.960> a<00:03:58.990> built-in<00:03:59.320> ramp<00:03:59.620> there<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.640> even

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
you've got a built-in ramp there so even

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.820 
you've got a built-in ramp there so even
though<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.780> doesn't<00:04:01.990> always<00:04:02.290> look<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.710> way

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
though it doesn't always look the way

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
everybody else is doing it doesn't mean

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.310 
everybody else is doing it doesn't mean
it's<00:04:04.210> wrong<00:04:04.360> as<00:04:04.660> long<00:04:04.810> as<00:04:04.960> you<00:04:05.050> get<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.230> the
