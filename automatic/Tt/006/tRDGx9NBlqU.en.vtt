00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.080
 good afternoon starting at each wheel 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.730
 of press please remember a 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.410
 question by intervention and before by 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.240
 please identify yourself with your name 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:20.050
 and the middle question if the robot 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.050
 present we begin 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.140
 show them Mr. Jaime Rodriguez from 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.669
 world to tell you what he has told you 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.189
 the players at rest because they 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.169
 has noticed a change in attitude in all 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.220
 the minutes and also that they left us to 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.220
 pay on karim benzema match 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.020
 within the first part 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.870
 as it has already happened other times we have not 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.710
 started well in the embedded 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.930
 I have passed the same 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.340
 against Cordoba I have passed the same 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.340
 against athletic in the cup 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.970
 there we have to improve after I do not think 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.640
 that we have defended well we have not 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.070
 pressed up as we have done 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.610
 very well in the second part we have 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.250
 arranged this before it's worth the party has 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.530
 been grab me in the second part of 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.530
 Karim has played a fantastic match 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.670
 as I think all the forwards have 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.409
 played very well 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.590
 with a lot of quality with a lot 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.039
 effective 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.340
 in the then we have finished many times 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.340
 the goal 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.200
 had very good opportunities 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.920
 good afternoon mister mario torrejón 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.690
 the chain be wanted to ask him what 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.070
 it has seemed the tool acting 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.930
 and how have you seen it as a starter in the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.590
 midfield and finally 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.370
 has been left out of the call 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.280
 lucas silva 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.460
 clearly as all the team has 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.460
 started 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:01.320
 Regular 30 minutes later with the team 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.600
 has left when well match playing 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.270
 a very good second part of the match 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.130
 lucas silva was not him all actors 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.560
 because only one week needed 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.890
 get used n if you need to train 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.319
 to look at your condition 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.480
 that is not the level of the others I think that 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.480
 It will be available very soon 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.950
 to be visiting gonzález 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.380
 martín and sometimes wants to say what a shame 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.530
 benzema that you have directly you are 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.720
 embraced him is also based on the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.370
 getafe you have a talent 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.290
 special to score those goals for 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.350
 find those goals when when black 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.910
 wait in which has scored goal 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.410
 of quality a striker who has a 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.160
 fantastic finish in all 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.290
 field positions after 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.600
 we have to value it also for the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.820
 then 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.790
 how to help the team in the game because 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.670
 is not a penalty area forward or 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.710
 a forward that moves very well in 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.510
 all positions have a lot of quality 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.510
 on all the plays 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.220
 according to Mr. Rubén García de Antena3 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.870
 what will the party of bail look like 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.400
 has had a couple of times hands to 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.890
 hands has been seen despair to 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.050
 james in the end has bitten him a little 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.930
 of the bernabéu again 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.739
 I got 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.540
 nothing else the party that has said I've 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.719
 done very well it is true that it has failed 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.579
 two opportunities also true that has 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.980
 given fantastic assistance for the 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.319
 third goal to benzema that has formed the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.329
 party then for me it's not 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.329
 important that a striker scores how much 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.250
 who works with the team for 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.310
 alipay fellow has done very 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.310
 all right 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.740
 it's true that you had to give him fair 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.890
 just after 11 a touch to james 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.590
 respect to the 4 3 3 when you were going 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.230
 attacking while while you were going 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.850
 defending was a 4-4-2 he did not respect the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.520
 right part of the field 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.550
 I think that in addition 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.160
 what I am going to say to the players in 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.560
 facing is quite not as accurate 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.789
 I have to have a position he had 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.389
 have a position 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:28.460
 I think I said the touch in the touches 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.230
 will remain only for the defensive part 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.200
 as given to him also to the media 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.370
 to the back ones because the pressure was not 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:43.390
 so good defensive positioning 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.490
 the first time was not it was not good 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.650
 or the sight the ruiz frame of the newspaper 'as' 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.200
 I was going to ask him it seemed like it was a 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.180
 4-4-2 start both in attack and in 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.430
 defense and I 'm going to ask him if he would see 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.380
 just to open the debate again 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.960
 since Madrid had also played 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.400
 if really with the 442 has more 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.090
 balance and vélez was playing in 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.090
 tip with benzema 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.330
 if he 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.569
 I also do not know if it was 44 from the equator 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.650
 of stress 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.830
 clearly 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.270
 as I said we try to defend with 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.210
 two lines of four 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.720
 we try to attack with the field more 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.550
 open after every now and then I think 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.030
 that the first part 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.860
 not only that we have enjoyed it very much then 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:35.930
 by left band with marcelo with 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:39.290
 disc every time a few times benzema 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.590
 the reference to have the two extremes 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.050
 more open when defending in this 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.680
 in this party dance was the player who 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.150
 had to approach benzema in the 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.150
 line of the forwards 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:57.229
 hello mister are going to be of elena roger 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.989
 saw the country wanted me to value the 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.719
 performance of marcelo that today has been 

00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:05.929
 in all important plays and that 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:08.190
 he seems the only one who does not have relief there 

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:10.140
 to rotate and 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.240
 and how to assess your performance in the 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.069
 last month and a half month 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.009
 I think it's growing how it is 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:21.220
 growing the team until December has 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.080
 made a fantastic period like all the 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.840
 test equipment has had some straw 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.090
 but now it's improving very fast 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.960
 I have a lot of confidence with him too 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.820
 because this season is very different from 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.600
 last year where he has had more 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.150
 problems and now I have more confidence 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.830
 I also have a lot of confidence in him as 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.340
 the last two questions the questions 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.660
 very good to see I'm going to ask 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.100
 because during the week there is a game with 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.590
 Sevilla and given that some players 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.360
 ready to be sanctioned with the derby 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.490
 face to the weekend it is proposed to give 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.620
 some rest players like james and 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.240
 marcelo and try with gs for the first time 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.810
 this season as cultural can be 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.850
 it may be because we have to evaluate the 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.710
 effort that we have made in this match 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.290
 we have three days we know very well that 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.190
 it's a very important game that gives us 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:16.100
 the opportunity 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:18.390
 have the barcelona-athletic away 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.420
 it may be that something is going to change because 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.490
 we need a fresh team 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.050
 ask the tour to the meat lucas 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.640
 Mareque corduroy and I wanted madrid 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.990
 ask him not just because of the condition 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.360
 of lucas silva but for a tactical theme 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.970
 we see it as a replacement for let's say 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.650
 Modric album now on this since 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.560
 madrid fell injured more like cross in 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.870
 the pivot 4-3-3 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.750
 he is a player with characteristics 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.720
 defensive also if you have a very good 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.940
 finish a very good pass and I think he 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.740
 he has a habit of playing 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.440
 here I have always had the habit of 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.870
 play as double or double pivot in your 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.910
 team can play 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.910
 in the position of d 

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:05.210
 cross naturally you can also 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.860
 accustom to playing as a lawyer today and 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:12.130
 now mind for the part of cross 

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.130
 thank you
