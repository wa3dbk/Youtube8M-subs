00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.400 
about this in my sleep makeup collection
so<00:04:59.060> I<00:04:59.090> have<00:04:59.509> one<00:04:59.750> like<00:04:59.870> I<00:04:59.900> said<00:05:00.050> this<00:05:00.139> one<00:05:00.320> is

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
so I have one like I said this one is

so I have one like I said this one is
all<00:05:00.560> sealed<00:05:00.770> but<00:05:01.039> I<00:05:01.099> have<00:05:01.250> one<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.460> love<00:05:01.880> and

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
all sealed but I have one I love and

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.360 
all sealed but I have one I love and
it's<00:05:02.810> really<00:05:03.110> good<00:05:03.320> as<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.530> lipstick<00:05:03.949> base<00:05:04.160> as

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
it's really good as a lipstick base as

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.740 
it's really good as a lipstick base as
well<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.669> just<00:05:04.789> put<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:04.970> gloss<00:05:05.150> on<00:05:05.330> top<00:05:05.389> of<00:05:05.630> it

well and just put a gloss on top of it

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.469 
well and just put a gloss on top of it
so<00:05:05.780> I<00:05:05.930> did<00:05:06.139> think<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.620> will<00:05:07.070> be<00:05:07.250> great<00:05:07.400> with<00:05:07.880> any

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:09.909 
so I did think it will be great with any
one<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:08.840> these<00:05:09.050> lip<00:05:09.259> gloss<00:05:09.470> it's<00:05:09.620> probably
