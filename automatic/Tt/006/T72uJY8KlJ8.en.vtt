00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
brownie otherwise I use true team but

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.920 
brownie otherwise I use true team but
before<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> browning<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.359> has<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.750> this

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
before the browning it has to be this

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.990 
before the browning it has to be this
it's<00:00:25.230> kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.650> trial<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.130> error<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
it's kind of trial and error with the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.999 
it's kind of trial and error with the
water<00:00:27.269> because<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.289> want<00:00:28.500> your<00:00:28.680> consistency

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
water because you want your consistency

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.240 
water because you want your consistency
no<00:00:32.420> you<00:00:33.420> want<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> consistency<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.620> pasty

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
no you want the consistency to be pasty

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
no you want the consistency to be pasty
so<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:36.690> there's<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.260> enough<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so as you can see there's not enough to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
so as you can see there's not enough to
quite<00:00:37.860> yet<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> here<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.329> gonna<00:00:39.450> pour<00:00:39.719> a

liquidy<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.200> know<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.770> add<00:01:49.890> less

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.429 
liquidy you know and you can add less
but<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.390> way<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.290> do

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
but I like it this way because what I do

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
but I like it this way because what I do
is<00:01:52.829> after<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.210> nice<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.720> mixed<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:55.850> because

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
is after it's nice and mixed up because

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.170 
is after it's nice and mixed up because
it<00:01:57.149> gives<00:01:57.329> me<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.509> lot<00:01:57.719> more<00:01:57.860> I'm<00:01:58.860> able<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.310> then

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it gives me a lot more I'm able to then

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.459 
it gives me a lot more I'm able to then
just<00:02:00.689> pour<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.159> brownie<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.469> then

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
just pour it over the brownie and then

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.280 
just pour it over the brownie and then
