string away cotton weather

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.710 
string away cotton weather
and<00:02:29.079> then<00:02:30.070> you've<00:02:30.400> got<00:02:30.430> your<00:02:30.850> beads<00:02:31.120> onto<00:02:31.420> your

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
and then you've got your beads onto your

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.000 
and then you've got your beads onto your
hair<00:02:31.900> now<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:32.920> take<00:02:33.190> an<00:02:33.489> elastic<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:36.040> just

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
hair now you take an elastic and just

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.449 
hair now you take an elastic and just
write<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:40.570> as<00:02:40.630> simple<00:02:41.170> as<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.769> it's

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
write it as simple as that and it's

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.949 
write it as simple as that and it's
quite<00:02:42.670> funky<00:02:43.090> as<00:02:43.180> well<00:02:43.360> like<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:43.930> just

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
quite funky as well like you can just

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.800 
quite funky as well like you can just
mess<00:02:44.709> around<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:45.070> your<00:02:45.190> hair<00:02:45.340> I've<00:02:46.120> done<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
mess around of your hair I've done the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.770 
mess around of your hair I've done the
green<00:02:47.049> so<00:02:47.440> it's<00:02:47.650> like<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.120> good<00:02:49.299> contrast

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
green so it's like it's a good contrast

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.780 
green so it's like it's a good contrast
with<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.140> red<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:50.590> whatever<00:02:50.950> color<00:02:51.340> paint

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
with the red and whatever color paint

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.470 
with the red and whatever color paint
red<00:02:52.440> my<00:02:53.440> hair<00:02:53.709> is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.350 

and<00:02:59.480> it's<00:03:00.470> also<00:03:00.650> good<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.700> using<00:03:02.120> Pony

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
and it's also good so you using Pony

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.000 
and it's also good so you using Pony
bees<00:03:02.599> like<00:03:02.870> I've<00:03:03.079> done<00:03:03.200> with<00:03:03.379> the<00:03:03.500> ones<00:03:03.680> on<00:03:03.860> my

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
bees like I've done with the ones on my

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.039 
bees like I've done with the ones on my
overhead<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:05.930> my<00:03:06.200> other<00:03:06.349> set<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.280> beads<00:03:07.549> and

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
overhead on my other set of beads and

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.390 
overhead on my other set of beads and
remember<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.290> maybe<00:03:09.799> it's<00:03:10.129> good<00:03:10.280> idea

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
remember that maybe it's good idea

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.970 
remember that maybe it's good idea
actually<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:11.060> think<00:03:11.440> if<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.620> use<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.769> little

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
actually I think if you use a little

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.309 
actually I think if you use a little
bead<00:03:13.280> at<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.579> bottom<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.420> stops<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.140> big

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
bead at the bottom it stops the big

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.369 
bead at the bottom it stops the big
beads<00:03:15.530> falling<00:03:15.950> off<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.420> black<00:03:17.420> bubble<00:03:18.049> like

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
beads falling off the black bubble like

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.470 
beads falling off the black bubble like
the<00:03:18.530> elastic<00:03:19.010> because<00:03:19.700> obviously<00:03:20.030> we'll<00:03:20.299> just

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
the elastic because obviously we'll just

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.640 
the elastic because obviously we'll just
slip<00:03:20.659> through<00:03:20.840> because<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.260> don't<00:03:21.440> want<00:03:21.590> a

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
slip through because you don't want a

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.099 
slip through because you don't want a
big<00:03:21.859> bubble<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:23.359> just<00:03:23.540> because<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:23.930> think

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
big bubble that just because you think

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.479 
big bubble that just because you think
that<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:24.470> can<00:03:24.650> stay<00:03:24.829> there<00:03:25.040> for<00:03:25.250> like<00:03:25.340> I've

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
that this can stay there for like I've

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.069 
that this can stay there for like I've
think<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.239> longest<00:03:26.480> I've<00:03:26.629> had<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.870> was<00:03:26.989> like

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
think the longest I've had it was like

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.470 
think the longest I've had it was like
three<00:03:27.470> weeks<00:03:27.620> while<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> was<00:03:28.159> on<00:03:28.220> holiday<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:29.450> I

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
three weeks while I was on holiday so I

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.099 
three weeks while I was on holiday so I
got<00:03:29.659> quite<00:03:29.870> cool<00:03:30.790> okay<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:32.030> need<00:03:32.599> you<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.959> and
