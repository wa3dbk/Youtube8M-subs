00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.550
 Greetings from the enjoyment without us 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.830
 make today a stuffed pork fillet 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.560
 of which we have the following things 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.840
 basil pork tenderloin ham and 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.640
 sheep's cheese is the first thing we take care of 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.360
 the pork fillet we have to first 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.790
 from the white sap and the lakes 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:39.000
 to free 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.000
 it simply cut off at the 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.670
 if they are then tasted nice clean 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.060
 it was cut to the half 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.060
 on 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.280
 u 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.920
 also 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.450
 and then you can go around with us again 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.450
 the chances 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.180
 roam the cut-called 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.920
 and then we put it in the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.920
 pork tenderloin 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.600
 now basilikum comes on it 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:14.500
 then we have to sometimes even a 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:19.290
 add a little salt pepper and then squeeze 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.290
 we're together again 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.810
 so 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.810
 then we will send it in china 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.349
 And that was one more thing 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:54.170
 can wait fine, I declare the 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:57.099
 different because that is very long now 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.239
 want to do with the others 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.769
 Here I have a follow up firmly 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.530
 to catch 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.530
 I put some oil in it 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.630
 the pork fillet 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.050
 then of course you have to do the whole thing too 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.050
 to agents 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.230
 and if the other side then too 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.810
 The whole thing was just in one 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.840
 casserole and then comes at 180 Â° 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.840
 baked 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:05.950
 and after about 20 minutes the country looks like this 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.950
 that still nice and then it says 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.950
 appetite
