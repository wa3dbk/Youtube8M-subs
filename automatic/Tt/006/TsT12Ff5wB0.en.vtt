we can devise and see how this can take

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.940 
we can devise and see how this can take
a<00:00:44.600> lickin<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.170> keep<00:00:45.350> on<00:00:45.470> tickin<00:00:45.530> as<00:00:45.800> you<00:00:45.860> can

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
a lickin and keep on tickin as you can
