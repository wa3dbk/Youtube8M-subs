I guess our co-op partner just above us

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.309 
I guess our co-op partner just above us
the<00:02:29.730> game<00:02:29.910> mode<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.269> obviously<00:02:30.720> round<00:02:31.049> based

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
the game mode is obviously round based

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.350

don't play a lot of advance warfare I'm

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.520 
don't play a lot of advance warfare I'm
not<00:02:42.209> sure<00:02:42.390> exactly<00:02:42.810> what<00:02:43.019> type<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.200> grenades

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
not sure exactly what type of grenades

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.770 
not sure exactly what type of grenades
those<00:02:43.739> are<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.489> future<00:02:44.880> clip<00:02:45.150> there<00:02:45.630> are

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
those are and in a future clip there are

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.890 
those are and in a future clip there are
a<00:02:45.810> couple<00:02:46.109> of<00:02:46.380> different<00:02:47.060> grenades<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
a couple of different grenades that the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.229 
a couple of different grenades that the
player<00:02:49.140> has<00:02:49.380> okay<00:02:49.799> okay<00:02:50.459> now<00:02:50.609> bear<00:02:50.819> with<00:02:50.850> me<00:02:51.150> on

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
player has okay okay now bear with me on

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.090 
player has okay okay now bear with me on
this<00:02:51.329> part<00:02:51.569> because<00:02:51.780> I'm<00:02:51.900> unsure<00:02:52.079> but<00:02:52.680> we<00:02:52.889> have

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
this part because I'm unsure but we have

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.309 
this part because I'm unsure but we have
the<00:02:53.280> word<00:02:53.400> XO<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.239> have<00:02:54.389> a<00:02:54.420> little<00:02:54.780> circle

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
the word XO and we have a little circle

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.830 
the word XO and we have a little circle
above<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.040> word<00:02:56.190> XO<00:02:56.639> now<00:02:57.120> what<00:02:57.359> I'm<00:02:57.450> thinking

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
above the word XO now what I'm thinking

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.870 
above the word XO now what I'm thinking
and<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.049> saw<00:02:58.260> another<00:02:58.620> clip<00:02:59.010> where<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.639> player

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
and I saw another clip where the player

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.940 
and I saw another clip where the player
doesn't<00:03:00.299> have<00:03:00.660> XO<00:03:01.170> doesn't<00:03:01.380> have<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.739> word

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
doesn't have XO doesn't have that word

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.340 
doesn't have XO doesn't have that word
so<00:03:02.100> I'm<00:03:02.160> thinking<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.569> exosuit<00:03:04.170> is

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
so I'm thinking that the exosuit is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.590 
so I'm thinking that the exosuit is
something<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.220> get<00:03:05.639> or<00:03:05.850> unlock

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
something that you have to get or unlock

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.420 
something that you have to get or unlock
in-game<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.530> don't<00:03:07.799> start<00:03:08.160> with<00:03:08.310> an

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
in-game so you don't start with an

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.729 
in-game so you don't start with an
exosuit<00:03:08.850> possibly<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.630> if<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:09.930> saw<00:03:10.200> from<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
exosuit possibly and if we saw from the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.800 
exosuit possibly and if we saw from the
cutscenes<00:03:11.280> on<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.760> trailer<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.420> didn't

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
cutscenes on the trailer it didn't

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.780 
cutscenes on the trailer it didn't
appear<00:03:13.049> that<00:03:13.109> initially<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.130> characters<00:03:14.549> had

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
appear that initially the characters had

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.729 
appear that initially the characters had
an<00:03:15.030> exosuit<00:03:15.510> on<00:03:15.660> right<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.319> maybe<00:03:16.530> there's

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
an exosuit on right so maybe there's

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.440 
an exosuit on right so maybe there's
something<00:03:16.799> is<00:03:17.100> something<00:03:17.670> they<00:03:17.760> equip<00:03:18.090> after

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
something is something they equip after

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.289 
something is something they equip after
the<00:03:18.569> fact<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.680> circle<00:03:20.190> indicates<00:03:20.519> the

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
the fact and that circle indicates the

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.210 
the fact and that circle indicates the
XO<00:03:21.660> ability<00:03:22.170> maybe<00:03:22.410> they're<00:03:22.590> different

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
XO ability maybe they're different

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.710 
XO ability maybe they're different
abilities<00:03:23.579> just<00:03:23.819> like<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.060> multiplayer<00:03:24.420> and

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
abilities just like in multiplayer and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.870 
abilities just like in multiplayer and
that<00:03:25.230> circle<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.829> one<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.280> them<00:03:26.400> I'm<00:03:26.549> not<00:03:26.700> sure

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
that circle is one of them I'm not sure

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.330 
that circle is one of them I'm not sure
which<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:28.200> last<00:03:28.380> important<00:03:29.130> piece<00:03:29.310> of

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
which and the last important piece of

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.460 
which and the last important piece of
the<00:03:29.579> puzzle<00:03:30.060> looks<00:03:30.600> like<00:03:30.750> we<00:03:30.900> have<00:03:31.019> perks

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
the puzzle looks like we have perks

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.740 
the puzzle looks like we have perks
confirmed<00:03:32.069> I'm<00:03:32.370> thinking<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.269> some<00:03:33.450> sort

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
confirmed I'm thinking this is some sort

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.509 
confirmed I'm thinking this is some sort
of<00:03:33.810> sleight<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.079> hand<00:03:34.349> perk<00:03:34.620> with<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.310> hand

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
of sleight of hand perk with the hand

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.270 
of sleight of hand perk with the hand
symbol<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.269> we're<00:03:36.900> going<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.109> see<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:38.040> perk

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
symbol and we're going to see the perk

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.610 
symbol and we're going to see the perk
machine<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.450> background<00:03:40.019> of<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.410> clip

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
machine in the background of the clip

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.640 
machine in the background of the clip
here<00:03:40.889> look<00:03:41.099> at<00:03:41.160> this<00:03:41.359> speed<00:03:42.359> Cola<00:03:42.750> speeds<00:03:43.410> up

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
here look at this speed Cola speeds up

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.879 
here look at this speed Cola speeds up
your<00:03:43.680> life<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.180> yeah<00:03:45.329> park<00:03:45.600> machines<00:03:45.930> now<00:03:46.380> I'm

your life so yeah park machines now I'm

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.379 
your life so yeah park machines now I'm
not<00:03:47.280> sure<00:03:47.519> though<00:03:47.759> it<00:03:47.970> might<00:03:48.180> be<00:03:48.359> a

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
not sure though it might be a

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.819 
not sure though it might be a
possibility<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:49.169> you<00:03:49.259> have<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.739> your

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
possibility that you have to get your

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.000 
possibility that you have to get your
exosuit<00:03:50.340> unlocked

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
exosuit unlocked

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.259 
exosuit unlocked
where<00:03:51.099> you<00:03:51.189> can<00:03:51.310> get<00:03:51.849> these<00:03:52.000> abilities

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
where you can get these abilities

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.089 
where you can get these abilities
perhaps<00:03:52.810> maybe<00:03:53.290> that's<00:03:53.500> kind<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.769> like<00:03:53.920> the

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
perhaps maybe that's kind of like the

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.030 
perhaps maybe that's kind of like the
power<00:03:54.340> then<00:03:54.760> then<00:03:55.390> by<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.079> /<00:03:56.439> combination

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
power then then by the / combination

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.160 
power then then by the / combination
something<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.670> sort<00:03:58.000> either<00:03:58.540> way<00:03:58.689> pretty

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
something of that sort either way pretty

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.130 
something of that sort either way pretty
cool<00:03:59.379> stuff<00:03:59.709> let's<00:04:00.400> carry<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:00.790> here<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:01.959> what

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.020 
least one of a clip from this trailer

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
i'm not sure like is there some sort of

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.229 
i'm not sure like is there some sort of
electrified<00:04:16.539> zombie<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.199> he<00:04:17.859> being<00:04:18.669> affected

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
electrified zombie is he being affected

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.750 
electrified zombie is he being affected
by<00:04:19.269> something<00:04:19.919> some<00:04:20.919> sort<00:04:21.160> of<00:04:21.220> weapon<00:04:21.400> of

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
by something some sort of weapon of

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.250 
by something some sort of weapon of
sorts<00:04:22.150> not<00:04:22.419> sure<00:04:22.600> i<00:04:22.630> just<00:04:22.870> wanted<00:04:23.139> to<00:04:23.169> point

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
sorts not sure i just wanted to point

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.080 
sorts not sure i just wanted to point
that<00:04:23.440> out<00:04:23.530> because<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.949> just<00:04:24.070> seemed<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.610> little

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
that out because it just seemed a little

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.689 
that out because it just seemed a little
bit<00:04:25.270> odd<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.750> then<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.710> seen<00:04:26.919> this<00:04:27.039> last<00:04:27.310> clip

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
bit odd and then you seen this last clip

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.240 
bit odd and then you seen this last clip
a<00:04:27.850> few<00:04:28.180> things<00:04:28.449> okay<00:04:28.990> so<00:04:29.199> first<00:04:29.740> off<00:04:30.039> at<00:04:30.160> the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
a few things okay so first off at the

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.340 
a few things okay so first off at the
beginning<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.639> clip<00:04:30.930> you're<00:04:31.930> on<00:04:32.080> round

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
beginning of the clip you're on round

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.590 
beginning of the clip you're on round
seven<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.220> don't<00:04:33.430> have<00:04:33.580> X<00:04:33.850> 0<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.570> it

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
seven and you don't have X 0 so it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.450 
seven and you don't have X 0 so it
appears<00:04:35.139> that<00:04:35.199> we<00:04:35.470> don't<00:04:35.590> have<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.889> exosuit

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
appears that we don't have the exosuit

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.189 
appears that we don't have the exosuit
yet<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:36.940> then<00:04:37.330> we<00:04:37.479> skip<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.930> bunch<00:04:38.080> of

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
yet and then we skip to a bunch of

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.629 
yet and then we skip to a bunch of
zombies<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:38.949> are<00:04:39.010> just<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.550> know

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
zombies that are just you know

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.400 
zombies that are just you know
gallivanting<00:04:40.389> around<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.720> map<00:04:40.900> or<00:04:41.110> outside

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
gallivanting around the map or outside

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.260 
gallivanting around the map or outside
or<00:04:41.800> whatever<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.250> then<00:04:42.370> we<00:04:42.520> round<00:04:42.760> round<00:04:42.970> nine

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
or whatever and then we round round nine

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.850 
or whatever and then we round round nine
and<00:04:43.630> all<00:04:43.720> of<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.810> sudden<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.110> have<00:04:44.260> x<00:04:44.440> 0<00:04:44.650> and

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
and all of a sudden you have x 0 and

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.159 
and all of a sudden you have x 0 and
there<00:04:45.310> are<00:04:45.430> those<00:04:45.550> those<00:04:46.300> hexagonal

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
there are those those hexagonal

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.469 
there are those those hexagonal
indicators<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.250> appears<00:04:48.610> those<00:04:48.880> might<00:04:49.270> be

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
indicators and appears those might be

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.240 
indicators and appears those might be
sort<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.050> like<00:04:50.229> killstreak<00:04:50.740> rewards<00:04:51.130> or

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
sort of like killstreak rewards or

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.600 
sort of like killstreak rewards or
unlocked<00:04:51.669> rewards<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:53.650> can<00:04:53.949> get<00:04:54.340> in

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
unlocked rewards that you can get in

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.659 
unlocked rewards that you can get in
game<00:04:55.030> if<00:04:55.660> we<00:04:55.720> saw<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:55.990> first<00:04:56.530> clip<00:04:56.889> there<00:04:57.430> was

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
game if we saw the first clip there was

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.339 
game if we saw the first clip there was
a<00:04:57.699> hexagonal<00:04:58.300> indicator<00:04:58.780> didn't<00:04:58.990> appear<00:04:59.260> to

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
a hexagonal indicator didn't appear to

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.770 
a hexagonal indicator didn't appear to
be<00:04:59.410> part<00:04:59.830> of<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.280> player<00:05:00.550> it<00:05:00.880> was<00:05:01.270> just<00:05:01.479> on<00:05:01.630> the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
be part of the player it was just on the

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.689 
be part of the player it was just on the
map<00:05:01.960> so<00:05:02.169> if<00:05:02.260> you<00:05:02.349> place<00:05:02.590> something<00:05:03.340> down<00:05:03.669> on

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
map so if you place something down on

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.520 
map so if you place something down on
the<00:05:03.880> map<00:05:04.180> then<00:05:04.690> it's<00:05:04.870> indicated<00:05:05.289> by<00:05:05.380> that

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
the map then it's indicated by that

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.460 
the map then it's indicated by that
hexagon<00:05:05.889> symbol<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:06.669> we<00:05:07.000> see<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.240> it's<00:05:07.960> we

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
hexagon symbol and we see that it's we

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.500 
hexagon symbol and we see that it's we
do<00:05:08.680> have<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.979> d-pad<00:05:09.400> indicator<00:05:09.880> beside<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.360> so

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
do have the d-pad indicator beside it so

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.900 
do have the d-pad indicator beside it so
there's<00:05:10.840> kind<00:05:11.080> of<00:05:11.169> a<00:05:11.289> selection<00:05:11.680> system<00:05:12.460> going

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
there's kind of a selection system going

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.230 
there's kind of a selection system going
on<00:05:13.060> here<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.840> think<00:05:14.620> for<00:05:15.070> killstreak<00:05:15.820> rewards

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
on here I think for killstreak rewards

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.450 
on here I think for killstreak rewards
or<00:05:16.449> packages<00:05:17.410> care<00:05:17.620> packages<00:05:18.130> or<00:05:18.310> whatever

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
or packages care packages or whatever

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.350 
or packages care packages or whatever
kind<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:18.940> what<00:05:19.090> we<00:05:19.210> saw<00:05:19.449> in<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:20.530> regular<00:05:21.360> EXO

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
kind of what we saw in the regular EXO

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.900 
kind of what we saw in the regular EXO
survival<00:05:22.570> game<00:05:23.440> mode<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.889> then<00:05:24.580> really<00:05:24.880> the

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
survival game mode and then really the

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.310 
survival game mode and then really the
last<00:05:25.150> thing<00:05:25.389> I<00:05:25.449> want<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.660> point<00:05:25.720> out<00:05:25.960> I'm<00:05:26.139> sure

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
last thing I want to point out I'm sure

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.540 
last thing I want to point out I'm sure
we're<00:05:26.440> going<00:05:26.530> to<00:05:26.620> miss<00:05:26.740> stuff<00:05:26.979> but<00:05:27.220> that's

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
we're going to miss stuff but that's

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.159 
we're going to miss stuff but that's
fine<00:05:27.820> we're<00:05:28.060> going<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.240> get<00:05:28.330> it<00:05:28.479> all<00:05:28.630> in<00:05:28.900> on<00:05:29.080> the

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
fine we're going to get it all in on the

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.230 
fine we're going to get it all in on the
27<00:05:29.800> so<00:05:30.160> last<00:05:30.400> thing<00:05:30.610> check<00:05:30.849> out<00:05:31.000> that

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
27 so last thing check out that

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.300 
27 so last thing check out that
indicator<00:05:31.660> bottom<00:05:32.110> middle<00:05:32.320> it<00:05:32.620> appears<00:05:33.010> that

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
indicator bottom middle it appears that

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.240 
indicator bottom middle it appears that
is<00:05:33.880> a<00:05:34.419> dropper<00:05:35.260> board<00:05:35.500> right<00:05:35.800> kind<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.099> like

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
is a dropper board right kind of like

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.250 
is a dropper board right kind of like
insta<00:05:36.610> kill<00:05:36.820> or<00:05:37.180> double<00:05:37.720> points<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.199> it

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
insta kill or double points and it

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.870 
insta kill or double points and it
almost<00:05:38.380> looks<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.830> me<00:05:38.949> like<00:05:38.979> it's<00:05:39.460> some<00:05:39.669> sort

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
almost looks to me like it's some sort
