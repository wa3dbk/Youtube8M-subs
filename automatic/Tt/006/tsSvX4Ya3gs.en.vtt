00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.629
 funk from the episode played today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.150
 like it around the second part of gta 5 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.250
 who my first 35 minutes not 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.370
 who is supposed to be on this now 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.529
 stately click after a few weeks 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.539
 live much done things gta 5 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.289
 found and I want you today 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.630
 imagine 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.449
 I have three more myths this time 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.730
 and we start with this success 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.830
 the first at first myth an ufo 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.050
 fly 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.860
 It is only after a place 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.489
 but so it is not in gta 5 you can 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.920
 actually an ufo fly around that too 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.079
 you have to do 50 lost spaceship 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.480
 Find parts in Los Santos 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.030
 they are hidden everywhere and the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.059
 already count in 100 percent 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.250
 if you do not wonder all parts are not 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.629
 only a success displayed but also 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.000
 a special reward a ufo it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.489
 does not look quite like an ufo but 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.790
 is a means of movement somehow 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.250
 alien looks like I'm blind now 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.040
 here the map of my place of the 50th 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 spaceship if any of you 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.000
 who actually wondered 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.000
 then it will help you here now 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.590
 second with out spirit of mount gordo in 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.549
 this myth was about one 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.119
 to find the mount godot is the spirit 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:46.060
 Spirit is between 23 and 0 o'clock on the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.130
 mound godel to find the spirit 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.740
 was about a woman or a girl 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.069
 if one spirit to the approaches 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.369
 he disappears 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:01.060
 and where he was was the word york 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.459
 written with blood york means 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.440
 english jock and that is one 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.580
 allusion to rockstar on the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.170
 developer of gta 5 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.930
 the head office is in scotland but 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.540
 now what is really good if you are 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.790
 The word york on the internet so typing 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.160
 In the game on the crowd there will be 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.650
 stand that the spirit around the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.440
 deceased wife of york runne lee 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.810
 this is the man who is a candidate 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.200
 for a pale governor in gta 50 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.660
 trade concerns 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:43.560
 The woman is Lehmann's third myth 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.230
 rehab island there is a poster with 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.910
 the name rehab island it is it 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.069
 probably an allusion to dead 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.620
 Iceland unfortunately in Germany 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.480
 especially the palm was indexed 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.580
 bassist in the logo of germany 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.280
 Even the small island is in the background 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.480
 To recognize this poster, you can recognize him 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.480
 turn to emergency 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.690
 yes, that was the second 35 minutes 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.310
 Although short but I hope you found that 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.310
 also really interesting so my 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.049
 Opinion to where you can fly an ufo 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.090
 So that was really crazy so first 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.880
 There are also many rumors in San AndrÃ©s 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.590
 about this what this modification where 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.750
 you can fly that and then it has become 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.090
 Just rockstar then just out 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.069
 thought okay if the players then with 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.829
 the modification of our andreas da 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.200
 work in the foot and so on 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.910
 then not a ufo now such a 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.130
 grid 5 games 1 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.120
 So I think that's really cool 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.319
 by rockstar games 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.430
 who understand their craft warns and that 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.549
 So in the mind of mauro it is so well 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.600
 there was also a myth of san andreas 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.950
 there is a second part of 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.830
 sanders would 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.010
 there was also a myth in san andreas 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.920
 the inbound shield or something screaming 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.319
 were heard and alleged foundries 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:15.010
 you know vox probably acted 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:16.419
 that too from intrigen and then as 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.650
 have found an article that 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.210
 if you put the word york on the internet 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.530
 you can enter this cellphone 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.240
 I have that article in Berlin at all 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.810
 unaware is really crazy and about 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.130
 the third with austria paulenz so 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.660
 well this poster you can not 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.150
 right 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.479
 say some really describe it 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.940
 say that in lausanne tas there are these 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.810
 island this hidden somewhere but you 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.300
 never knows where and almost reality 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.919
 tas hidden somewhere in lausanne 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.630
 then the commentary appears where it is 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.580
 At least and then I will too 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.850
 even a probable third part 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.340
 make fit again 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.500
 yes, what decorate me the 35 episode 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.419
 I hope you liked it when it was 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.280
 you liked to subscribe then 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.110
 also comments my videos schott 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.770
 mainz place and gives me one again 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.930
 thumbs up 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:17.020
 that would make me very happy then 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:22.080
 I say we'll see each other 36 36 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.080
 played and have a nice day
