00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
some natural material it helps them

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.560 
some natural material it helps them
regulate<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.840> temperature<00:02:50.830> of<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.760> hive<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
the inside of a tree so it's Square and

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.710 
the inside of a tree so it's Square and
about<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.810> size<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.860> good<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.580> know<00:03:00.720> 60

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
about the size of a good you know 60

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.900 
about the size of a good you know 60
year<00:03:01.900> old<00:03:02.050> oak<00:03:02.200> tree<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.680> got<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:03.160> Colin<00:03:03.670> space
