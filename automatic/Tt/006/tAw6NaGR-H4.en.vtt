00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
this way and that the opposite way I

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.690 
this way and that the opposite way I
don't<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> wide<00:00:30.150> enough<00:00:30.390> piece<00:00:31.460> just<00:00:32.460> make

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
don't have a wide enough piece just make

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.520 
don't have a wide enough piece just make
sure<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.180> enough<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.780> overlap<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
sure you have enough to overlap on the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190 
sure you have enough to overlap on the
sides<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.300> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> let<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.570> fall<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
sides just kind of let it fall in the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:53.189 
sides just kind of let it fall in the
center<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:41.030> push<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.600> edges

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.139 

and<00:00:53.289> then<00:00:54.070> we're<00:00:54.280> going<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.489> use<00:00:54.550> someone

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
and then we're going to use someone

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.049 
and then we're going to use someone
plastic<00:00:55.690> wrap<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:56.109> form<00:00:56.530> our<00:00:57.059> strawberry

plastic wrap to form our strawberry

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.529 
plastic wrap to form our strawberry
outer<00:00:58.440> layer<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.760> important<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.210> your<00:01:01.390> ice

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
outer layer it's important that your ice

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.679 
outer layer it's important that your ice
cream<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:02.019> nice<00:01:02.229> and<00:01:02.440> soft<00:01:03.059> which<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.210> have<00:01:04.420> some

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
cream is nice and soft which I have some

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.670 
cream is nice and soft which I have some
softened<00:01:05.409> strawberry<00:01:05.920> ice<00:01:06.070> cream

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:19.660 

you<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.370> want<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.520> too<00:01:11.760> soft<00:01:12.030> though

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.170 

and<00:01:20.180> like<00:01:20.360> I<00:01:20.510> said<00:01:20.690> before<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.170> can<00:01:21.200> um<00:01:21.680> you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
and like I said before you can um you

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.480 
and like I said before you can um you
could<00:01:23.180> just<00:01:23.390> use<00:01:23.690> one<00:01:24.110> kind<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:24.920> ice<00:01:25.070> cream<00:01:25.100> and

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
could just use one kind of ice cream and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.130 
could just use one kind of ice cream and
fill<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:25.850> up<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.210> top<00:01:26.420> but<00:01:26.659> I<00:01:26.720> wanted<00:01:27.080> to

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
fill it up to the top but I wanted to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.410 
fill it up to the top but I wanted to
make<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.650> two<00:01:28.369> different<00:01:28.729> ice<00:01:28.850> creams<00:01:28.880> just

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
make it two different ice creams just

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.700 
make it two different ice creams just
because<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:29.690> looks<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.960> lot<00:01:30.110> prettier<00:01:30.140> when<00:01:30.590> you

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
because it looks a lot prettier when you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.649 
because it looks a lot prettier when you
cut<00:01:30.890> into<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.700> gives<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.510> two

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
cut into it and it gives you two

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.730 
cut into it and it gives you two
different<00:01:32.990> flavors<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.409> ice<00:01:33.500> cream<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:35.240> then

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
different flavors of ice cream and then

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.870 
different flavors of ice cream and then
we<00:01:36.740> use<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.100> point<00:01:37.430> is<00:01:40.119> if<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:41.270> shape<00:01:41.660> going

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
we use this point is if this shape going

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.130 
we use this point is if this shape going
just<00:01:43.880> basically<00:01:44.360> want<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.570> make<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.960> same

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
just basically want to make it the same

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.020 
just basically want to make it the same
shape<00:01:45.440> it's<00:01:45.650> a<00:01:45.770> bowl<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.550> you're<00:01:46.670> just<00:01:46.850> pushing

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
shape it's a bowl so you're just pushing

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.370 
shape it's a bowl so you're just pushing
it<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.390> sides<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.050> on<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.200> bottom<00:01:53.380> I'm

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380
