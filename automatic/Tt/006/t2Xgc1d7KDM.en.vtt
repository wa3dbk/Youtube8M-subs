100 or 80 well we weren't too bright
about<00:01:58.300> that<00:01:58.480> last<00:01:58.659> week<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.110> we<00:01:59.200> actually<00:01:59.560> set

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
about that last week and we actually set

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.820 
about that last week and we actually set
it<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.100> one<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.370> them<00:02:00.610> was<00:02:01.030> cut<00:02:01.450> off<00:02:01.650> here<00:02:02.650> and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
it so one of them was cut off here and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.740 
it so one of them was cut off here and
the<00:02:02.920> other<00:02:03.040> one<00:02:03.159> was<00:02:03.280> cut<00:02:03.460> off<00:02:03.490> down<00:02:03.909> here<00:02:03.940> so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
the other one was cut off down here so

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.030 
the other one was cut off down here so
basically<00:02:05.229> we<00:02:05.380> were<00:02:05.470> missing<00:02:05.740> some<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
basically we were missing some of the

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.380 
basically we were missing some of the
frequencies<00:02:06.580> for<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.880> while<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.330> was

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
frequencies for a while and that was

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.109 
frequencies for a while and that was
kind<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.659> silly<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:08.050> us<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.879> got<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.060> be

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
kind of silly of us so you got to be

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.729

smarter<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.899> have<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.109> actually<00:02:11.349> read

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
smarter and you have to actually read

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.140 
smarter and you have to actually read
that<00:02:11.980> book<00:02:12.159> that<00:02:12.219> they<00:02:12.459> sent<00:02:12.700> out<00:02:12.819> I<00:02:12.849> mean<00:02:13.030> it's

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150
