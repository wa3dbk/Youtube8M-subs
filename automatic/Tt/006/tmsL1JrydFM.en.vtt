00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
it's the idea that it is this higher

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.950 
it's the idea that it is this higher
class<00:00:57.220> type<00:00:57.760> thing<00:00:58.059> and<00:00:58.149> it<00:00:58.270> really<00:00:58.660> isn't

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
class type thing and it really isn't

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.639

and you know the atmosphere the theaters

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.370 
and you know the atmosphere the theaters
create<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.820> all<00:01:40.030> around<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.689> it's<00:01:40.960> just

create is all around you it's just
something<00:01:43.080> like<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.259> avoid<00:01:44.530> using<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:45.070> word

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
something like to avoid using the word

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.359 
something like to avoid using the word
magical<00:01:45.820> but<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:47.049> think<00:01:47.350> that's<00:01:47.710> kind<00:01:48.040> of<00:01:48.159> a

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
magical but I think that's kind of a

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.320 
magical but I think that's kind of a
very<00:01:48.759> good<00:01:49.000> word<00:01:49.240> for<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:49.869> can't<00:01:50.170> think<00:01:50.380> of

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
very good word for it I can't think of

of<00:03:33.579> close<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.150> home<00:03:34.510> I'm<00:03:34.840> sure<00:03:35.229> the<00:03:35.590> characters

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
of close to home I'm sure the characters

the music I think anyways like the
costumes<00:03:41.379> I<00:03:41.680> think<00:03:41.979> Mitchell<00:03:42.340> would<00:03:42.519> like

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699
