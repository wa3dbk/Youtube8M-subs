00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
parts from from the scissor low and that

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.060 
parts from from the scissor low and that
eliminates<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.289> lot<00:01:05.320> of<00:01:05.470> serviceable

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
eliminates a lot of serviceable

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.040 
eliminates a lot of serviceable
components<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.789> lot<00:01:06.970> of<00:01:07.000> new<00:01:07.180> service<00:01:07.750> call

a<00:01:34.509> large<00:01:34.720> hydraulic<00:01:35.140> area<00:01:35.890> you'll<00:01:36.159> notice<00:01:36.250> the

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
a large hydraulic area you'll notice the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.340 
a large hydraulic area you'll notice the
difference<00:01:36.850> from<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.150> es<00:01:37.509> series<00:01:37.960> as<00:01:38.140> this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
difference from the es series as this

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.050 
difference from the es series as this
was<00:01:38.560> integrated<00:01:39.159> into<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.400> ground<00:01:39.670> control

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
was integrated into the ground control

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.300 
was integrated into the ground control
box<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:40.570> this<00:01:41.350> was<00:01:41.530> integrated<00:01:42.009> in<00:01:42.130> dual

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
box and this was integrated in dual

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.069 
box and this was integrated in dual
cylinder<00:01:42.850> so<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:43.150> is<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.299> very<00:01:43.540> easy<00:01:43.869> to

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
cylinder so this is a very easy to
