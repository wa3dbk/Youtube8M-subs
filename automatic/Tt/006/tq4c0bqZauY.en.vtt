00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
brush were actually gonna apply that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.259 
brush were actually gonna apply that
orange<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.520> reason<00:03:16.850> why<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.000> because<00:03:17.060> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
orange and the reason why is because the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.670 
orange and the reason why is because the
orange<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.660> really<00:03:17.780> going<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.049> bounce<00:03:18.260> off<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
orange is really going to bounce off the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.680 
orange is really going to bounce off the
blue<00:03:18.799> here<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.370> give<00:03:19.519> us<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.760> nice<00:03:19.940> shade<00:03:20.660> of

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.539 
blue here and give us a nice shade of
color<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:21.620> we're<00:03:21.739> gonna<00:03:21.830> use<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.190> orange

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
color so we're gonna use this orange
