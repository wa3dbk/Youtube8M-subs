 a mix between them 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.760
 the passion of the image and the passion of 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.430
 the music whose first place where 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.350

 this room only unique 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.220
 exceptional so initially I was doing 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.890
 photos a little like that in 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.409
 smuggling to seize that world 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.290
 at the time it was still in silver 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.990
 so I'm hiding is the SLR in a 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.460
 pocket and then the goal in another 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.979
 page then I was going to take photos 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.050
 like that makes it smuggled it's 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.120
 like that I became a photographer 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.960
 official moment 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.260

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.930
 renowned artists 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.820
 and then and then a day of wire in 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.540
 needle I applied for accreditation 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.960

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.010
 it was in 2004 successful pilager 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.260
 we get to the old plows the 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.970
 success I was at home I know that 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.100
 I had arrived home with my brothers 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.310
 I knew that I was part of the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.010
 family that was the beginning of a great 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.550
 great big adventure that is 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.390
 happened at one point that crossed the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.390
 nikon path 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.170
 this picture is a counter 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.530
 maintenance late matt bastard singer 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.360
 skip the use that makes a job know 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.380
 that the jump is a net job out cat 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.020
 it's really something rare 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.970
 and he did a very very very good 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:50.600
 counter is actually if we have to if we 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.930
 must do if we have to define what 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.750
 does what differs what what 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.960
 makes a shot of Seine a good customer 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.760
 or an excellent shots first me 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.190
 that 's the first thing that's 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.980
 that he is very pure extremely 9% 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.750
 come true performances too 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.200
 well in whoever took a picture of 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.220
 whoever was on stage I believe 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.080
 especially that 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.290
 the important parameter for me in everything 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.150
 case it is the ability to hear the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.519
 music hear music 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.920
 hear the music or bolero seeing 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.189
 the image that I think it's really 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.189
 the essential 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:41.159
 if you have to prioritize by train between 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.409
 a reflex of good quality or very 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.269
 good quality and an optics of very 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.530
 good quality 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.319
 do not hesitate a second know a 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.109
 very good optics 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.749
 even if the case is a little 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.480
 underneath if you can break your 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:58.739
 piggy bank 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.680
 I would advise today to a 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.609
 young photographer who wants to do 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.769
 photos of monkeys 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.049
 if I had to advise him on soul 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.719
 really in icon since I know 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:14.000
 relatively well there the range 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.000
