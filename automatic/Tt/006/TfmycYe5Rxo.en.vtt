00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.620
 on air the most indicative among 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.660
 rotational and the most rotational among 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.170
 exemplary rubrics galileo program 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.900
 which is called experiment and friends 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.390
 Today 2 questions I will study which 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.050
 still torment me 1 that the earth 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:28.640
 round 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 1 and the second question is that the earth rotates 2 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.739
 the fact is that to understand what the earth is 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.270
 round you need to either take a ticket to space 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.969
 only twenty million dollars 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 pay and fly and make sure that she 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.450
 round looking at her from afar 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.579
 either peshkodralom bypass it all around 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.129
 only in this way can you prove yourself 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.430
 that the earth is round, but this is what it is 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.160
 rotates it can be proved without leaving 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.039
 places with the help of what with the help of this 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.070
 wonderful device is a model 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.580
 Foucault pendulum scale to one to ten 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.270
 which gathered our great lefty alexey 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.450
 Ivanchenko 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.820
 one-handed friends what's the point 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.659
 if we are you ordinary sand 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 see the sand from under the seal here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.460
 ordinary pendulum pendulum on 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 ordinary rope at the end of the pendulum 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.049
 a small edge that draws therefore 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.619
 the sand then how the pendulum moves if 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:36.180
 pendulum we just gently run 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.299
 then we see that the plane of oscillation 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.670
 pendulum invariably 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.409
 the pendulum quietly oscillates on it not 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.930
 no forces act except forces 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.600
 gravity and so we see a straight 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.159
 which draw the point of this very 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:57.140
 pendulum but if the system on which 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.140
 fixed pendulum will rotate 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.740
 what happens pendulum begins 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.720
 drawing beautiful shapes is like 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.820
 flower-like 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.920
 Now thanks to these figures seem 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.340
 on the flower we can determine what 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.830
 the system rotates and here these are the dimensions 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.660
 petals say angular velocity 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.140
 rotation of this system in 1851 in 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:32.490
 Paris is this bitch and his name was jean 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:34.980
 wins jean jean his name here he is shorter 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.900
 saying the same way make a long 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.540
 long thread for what period 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.760
 the fluctuations were bigger yes and that's the same 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.330
 way on the sand there were drawn 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.780
 beautiful figures and people through several 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.900
 o'clock 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.070
 saw that the plane of the pendulum rotates 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.410
 actually the plane of the pendulum 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.420
 remained in place and the earth rotated 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.150
 under the pendulum and so they 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.700
 make sure that the earth rotates but friends 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.780
 here is an interesting point this effect with 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.780
 pendulum fuco 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.500
 can see for example being on 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.090
 the pole 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.630
 of our land because then how are you 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.820
 understand under it we see the rotation under 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.380
 pendulum will rotate the earth and if 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.980
 we will be at the equator 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.270
 then the earth will not rotate below us 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.739
 do you understand this rotation 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.430
 there is no land quadra only 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.310
 such rotation 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.560
 so if fuku was conducting his experience 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.650
 at the equator he would have nothing 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.480
 it turned out but Foucault was not a fool and his 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.610
 Experiments were carried out correctly where in Paris and 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.560
 Paris as we know far from 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.780
 equator beauty beauty 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.060
 Incidentally, the rotation of the earth can 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.400
 use and for your own good as 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.540
 for example, use all who run 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.489
 rockets into space and we launch for some reason 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.400
 rockets closer to the equator from baikonur though 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.690
 this is not our territory and even 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.570
 Americans and start for some reason their 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.640
 rocket from cape canaveral asks what 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.410
 they have no other places no friends cape 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.720
 canaveral is closest to 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.850
 equator why do i need to run equator 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.010
 rocket the fact is that the rocket is launched and 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.780
 from the equator already has the necessary 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.720
 speed that's tangential 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.850
 which the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.470
 she will continue to recruit recruit 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.230
 recruit and bring to first 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.510
 cosmic velocity that is launching 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.090
 rocket with the equator and how to save 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.340
 fuel to accelerate this rocket 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.020
 on a tangent, so here it is possible 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.880
 use earth rotation for 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.800
 space rockets and once and secondly 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.840
 you can just admire the beautiful 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.510
 experiences that in 1851 made 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.210
 well-known physicist bitch 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.550
 and who is the well-known physicist Alexey 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.610
 Ivanchenko repeated after a huge 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.800
 number of years but how beautiful and how 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.960
 our experience looks spectacular and so 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:58.440
 admire again and watch the program 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:58.440
 Galileo and the more mesmerizing
