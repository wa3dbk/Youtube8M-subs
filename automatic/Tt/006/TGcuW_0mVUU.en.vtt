00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.899
 the neck 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.899

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.710
 and the writing at last to the financial speculation that we 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.259
 let's shout when they write 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.409
 but the texts finally does not come out he in 3d 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.550
 then here 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.760
 we have yesterday 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.380
 paris what is written that ale tourism alerts 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.560

 madrid reuters - before to be presented during the tests 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280
 remember that it reads from restless right 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.010
 this is the mental vale is the example that they had said and this is the letter 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.899
 italics 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.899
 according to remember that each one is almost nine meters 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.680
 usually in order the stroke this right of who partisan wale between 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.780
 some variations but usually yes 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.549
 here we have other ways of writing d alert in this cursive scheme 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.210
 they identify sacyl search itself 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.510
 and all the others are different en bloc because with some will be the 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.920
 first traces more secularized this stretch according to official reports but he 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.170
 the learned nation 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.200
 on the next page we have put is to dispense with the woman worth and the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.290
 aesthetic is worth trying so my stage presence the order 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.260
 we started doing this path and we do this theme 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.480
 the loops that this united tel matter to us 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.950
 madrid this impunity 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980
 in our sector 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.340
 and then it is undoing 1 2 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.420
 2 madrid 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.700
 about 200 writing released and panties to tie 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.759
 below you have some examples for na 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.409
 barillas I will put a list like cape analysis of the moment those structures 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:19.950
 seen this 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.159
 we went to the next phase of all of them is that the artist 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.889
 the 4th 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.880
 we remember the center right 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.139
 operate 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.739
 first job 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.009
 according to another 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:34.419
 at work 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.149
 in Europe 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.479
 while the second metapÃ¡n work 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.229
 the camera a little drunk sorry 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.810
 by closing with bouquets that these beings 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.089
 is transcribed as father 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.619
 First letter of the Hebrew alphabet works 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:54.789
 and it also corresponds to the number 1, but the letter dominated 1 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:01.559
 seen this we go to the next phase we will try to identify in a text 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:02.579
 the letter 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.069
 We have no tape 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.519
 let's try bernales no no no no ackermann 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.040
 I also understand that they are accompanied by a symbol before a 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.949
 mestalla point 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.979
 these points were very important to be admitted 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:24.930
 and if the survey indicates how they can pronounce some constants, remember that 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.149
 in this case 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:27.579
 we have to be 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.859
 balestrini 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.329
 remember in the afternoon 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.789
 where the Spanish technician is carried out 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:39.519
 here we have certain points and the line is like we had in a text 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.429
 Palestinians try local intensity where the Italian box is the vocal 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.139
 or the consonant they're still looking for 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.999
 And below 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:53.359
 i as to tell us how it occurs therefore two points narrated 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.579
 as we have seen previously it is pronounced as ana 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.529
 i have some examples there 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:06.549
 to paul cheesemaking here the first example here corresponds to the first 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.949
 from here because this is our reader reading clues between 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.529
 there they were 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:14.799
 this rally 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.269
 day this 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.269
 madrid this committee and is that with this 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.049
 so 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.699
 We have seen 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.360
 that this occurs 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.409
 concretely does not mean me 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.229
 filmus also criticize 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.309
 another law 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:34.479
 Alejandro fails col 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.120
 here they come in 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.580
 here is another way out 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.759
 we send you have all points 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:49.009
 i the dortmund 150 thousand 200 and 500 points between both we will see how it feels 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.559
 with trust 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:53.240
 we will be in a club 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.240
 we identify that symbol here we have it 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.730
 two points and is that here 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.730
 they made a 5 1 efe 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.639
 seven of the last examples that are good 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.310
 bekele profile 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.279
 we keep all these percent loans 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:14.279
 the three points are the elections with a common plan 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.870
 we have here another example of this film cycle jordi 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.449
 his debut of the young 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.810
 let's see then so would be allowed communal 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:36.529
 in a tile 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:38.930
 the police chief or what 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.020
 we are going to listen to percent of the text we try to identify the 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.020
 sinaloenses we have seen the former striker also 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.059
 in mind 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.099
 - 4 pm 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.099
 what is in parentheses does not say it because 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:18.469
 between them is the end of the initiative is worth it is agent 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:20.150
 ministerial stock 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.700
 Balearic is the masculine and this is finished therefore saying that this is 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.180
 I was going to jump directly 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.550
 concentration min
