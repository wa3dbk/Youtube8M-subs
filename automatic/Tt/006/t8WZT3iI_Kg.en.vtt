00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.740
 conclusion of ipo fight with china 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.460
 snorting was the thrilling was well 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.859
 I really thought I was going to lose and he 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.490
 ended up winning by a technical detail 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.810
 his will power to overcome the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.740
 any interesting way that all 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.230
 that move the fisherman's Duel 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 son of a fisherman to demonstrate the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.570
 ipo ability to show that it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.250
 he is actually a true boxer who 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.160
 his full potential as a boxer 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.300
 then his opponent entered the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.510
 head 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.430
 like her from fishermen, then 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.620
 opponent he entered the fight with the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.930
 head of some 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.789
 fact she on the bottom of the sea but actually 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 is that I was a boxing match that was 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.829
 a struggle of will power the ipo 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.649
 while attacking the house down 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.840
 and managed to survive and went 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.700
 interesting that it showed a little fatigue 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.790
 physique of the two fighters the two 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.159
 fought bravely only that ipo ended up 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.200
 winning but had emotion even before 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.299
 I thought he would have if I had lost the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.400
 hates the totally different sea on which 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.890
 he would have to hone his voice and ye 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.700
 Leave it to that we just found it cool. 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.600
 that they will follow this line d 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.700
 and overcoming you only with 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.289
 new opponents in fact that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.740
 character was to demonstrate the 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.740
 weakness of the ipo of the coup and that even in 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.170
 episode of the following episode 3 that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.720
 It's very funny and having a conversation 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.420
 what the coach had and is talked about here 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.670
 now everyone knows the weak point must 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.850
 be the counter attack that is why 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.030
 back in the coach he did not leave 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.450
 I also remembered a lot of walking 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.849
 but I thought it was cool, the series is to tie 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.259
 these tips are not that of other seasons 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:10.640
 and show that nothing is for nothing is the series I 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.370
 I found it very cool. 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.650
 the episode because it is extremely 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.840
 from the beginning of the duel of 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.780
 girls dispute my pole actually 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.390
 I found it silly there but after that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.390
 wrapped up the part of the back-up hocks 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 and he called more lean more group will have 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.870
 It was very funny he cut the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.880
 attention of the first two episodes and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.760
 This was purposeful because 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.489
 this whole clown of the second episode 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.760
 will conflict with the rival is the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.400
 opponent apologizes for the doc that he is a 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.190
 Totally serious guy face that dedicated the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.829
 life to boxing and that soon everything is a 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.549
 woman took me all to dedicate to the 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:58.489
 boxing cef his complicated career and what 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.430
 It's this fun being that enjoys life in 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:09.019
 that even so he does not speak in search of his 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:11.510
 objective is good is the cearÃ¡ and the beginning 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.660
 training was very funny even has 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.230
 until the 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.990
 one thing is this industry curiosity 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.410
 this conflict is not the beginning's attention 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.050
 Okay, the pot is to relieve this 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.830
 debut in a very masculine way 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:33.630
 and even funny way of speaking that the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.850
 doing this typing spending 1 is a 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.120
 a vitality necessary for the 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.840
 another that even in the movie doc robot plays is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.140
 who in the state can not do this is me 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.210
 I'll introduce you, there's a side scene in the 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.870
 third episode in the fourth episode of 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.720
 listen that he's there he got wet 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.330
 everything for toy is aaa the dynamics of the two 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.060
 before the very funny fight the same 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.870
 music has enough of that part of 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.510
 comedy from episode 3 and 14 only you 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.820
 realizes that it is a legitimate tension between 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.140
 the two fighters because ok he's a 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:16.799
 outside the media is a guy who wants to 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:20.280
 lot he wants to make him want to 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.770
 to be champion he wants to be the name 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.930
 in the history of that world, that the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.590
 opportunity is his big fight not 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.520
 achieved the victory he had hoped for 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.650
 this is not demerit of it is the question that 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.250
 he still has not got the great 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.200
 his motivation and that's the episode 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.040
 the board says that it is the great motivation 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.130
 his god 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.590
 his victory is Tomiko then it will 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.600
 show why his market that he 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.180
 He lost the right the goddess of victory 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 opponent and with him for having someone 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.290
 to motivate you to win this fight this 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:02.010
 will be the great moral intention of the fight 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.550
 of the two because the tower was the conflict 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.800
 of fishermen's children that was 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.260
 tension of I'll drag you deep down 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.860
 the attention of who is the best at 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.350
 neighborhood and in the end the conclusion is 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.000
 in fact here is not the fine at sea that 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.460
 it's a fight on the link you're the one 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.220
 Enhancer I'm going to see my life at sea. 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.120
 that I like big day has to be 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.860
 The moral of the ok fight is to abandon or not 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.000
 never your life your dreams of yours 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.370
 likes boxing for boxing's passion 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.620
 It must be the one you need to know 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.170
 so much so to get anything 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.820
 then see what the work will conclude that 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.920
 the series will put on top of that because 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.080
 and I'm good to think about what goes 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.240
 to win without a comment is 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.490
 know that I will not read if you speak 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.240
 which is to win or not but I think he 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.880
 earns from the lesson of 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.730
 moral that will be that open thing 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.110
 the goddess of victory made me win back 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.270
 and it promises to be very interesting 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.850
 because ok he has several techniques 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.350
 and the beginning of the wave already 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.590
 demonstrated that his opponent should 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.900
 centered mystery - centered it goes 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.000
 a very difficult difficulty and I 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.920
 I have a place because the episode I 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.930
 now your comments and that 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.570
 did you find 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.310
 It's also going to be a lot of talk. 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.560
 here in this video that helps 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.270
 enough is our channel 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.770
 if you do not know the videocast here 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.970
 time that I have terror conditions if 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.300
 There are lots of videos here. 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.250
 interesting and I want to see the 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.630
 fifth episode I'm going to stay here 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.630
 a hug to all and went
