00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.859
 and clutch for racing cars 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 and why is it done 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:13.949
 clutch not for family hearth 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:15.949
 ship racing car with 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.070
 800 horsepower engine 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.119
 forces 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.279
 instead of this powerful snot would not be 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.429
 it's impossible to transfer all this energy to 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.509
 wheels and hospitals could not develop 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.989
 such high speed 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.270
 to 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.750
 P 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.980
 for example in racing cars manual 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.560
 power transmissions 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.640
 wheels 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.000
 so for every victory of their good 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.200
 clutch for production 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.700
 starts with a flywheel connecting 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.590
 engine clutch 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.130
 into computerized cutting tools 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.830
 Shaped aluminum parts 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.670
 then cut out the supporting disk for 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.680
 clutch 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.640
 the creation cut it off around the perimeter to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.630
 ask him the right time to reduce them 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.630
 weight 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.620
 of documents 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.140
 then with a diamond bolt 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.770
 tip aligned 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.220
 order from the iron horse solo disc 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.670
 this will get either contacts with others 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.390
 clutch parts are usually in 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.390
 two three such drive clutch 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.329
 clutch discs will move to buck with 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:32.600
 this steel insert 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.790
 installable and housewives 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.160
 master puts on a stick blocking 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.200
 element 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.070
 and then screw day flywheel bet 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 upts 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.750
 where is the master dragging the balts to 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.749
 accurate torque 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.700
 prince 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.119
 during the war 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.709
 two houses for better contact with the disks 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.700
 clutch it with the help of a child 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.920
 stones level the surface 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.049
 the rest of the insert walk the bolts and 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.359
 securely connects grip to the mainland 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.609
 until beams are called their holders 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.439
 only six cues points 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.729
 and here will make titanium cylinder 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.129
 who will stick stick 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.249
 in Moscow river of pounds 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.999
 titanium is durable and lightweight material is 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.219
 very important because the clutch transmits 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.219
 huge amount of energy 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.689
 such cylinders is worn on each 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.769
 goal then but the flywheel puts cathedral wheels 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.769
 and records float 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.390
 Burjanadze is now being installed 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.330
 preliminary height of the holders 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.910
 then prepared 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.230
 pressure plate 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.120
 narcopriton aluminum outer 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.129
 rings are pressed accordingly 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.950
 covers yakunin zbk on these streets will be 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.940
 keep the spring through which will 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.190
 change the pressure under this off but yourself 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.249
 springs do not cope yet 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.389
 first installed on the lid 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.989
 several is leverage each lever 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.299
 drops to the hinge but fingers 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.510
 they will be the same match inter same match 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.409
 option package 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.329
 l 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.360
 money 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.430
 tgk 1 5 clutch springs 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.770
 become covered with grease and then make their way 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.100
 bullets nev and cover after that they 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.100
 delivered to each ring 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.529
 where to put high strength 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:54.969
 springs 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.229
 tons now from the inside 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:58.739
 Bishkek is installed 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.809
 push plates when drivers 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:02.779
 releases the clutch pedal levers 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.289
 force push 500 jammatti package 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.989
 couplings 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.049
 whereby energy is transferred from 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.369
 engine transmission 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.829
 n now on the holders of the holders 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.900
 put on pressing 500 and fixed kaida 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.979
 each holder is tightened with an end 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.409
 with a wrench and then checked them 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:28.280
 heights are measured leverage so they all 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.840
 were the same length 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.840
 and produced the necessary scum 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.610
 master lifts leverage to 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.180
 check clutch 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.850
 press ring reacts like it 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.940
 and should react creates the right 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.289
 pressure on Moscow 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.110
 and finally the certification stickers of them 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.770
 packing tape so that when 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.639
 transportation hurt nothing 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.689
 to myself 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.139
 the opening of the clutch will be checked 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.179
 before each race if it works 

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:03.779
 no-fail victory
