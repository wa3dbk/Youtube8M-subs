00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.850
 hi hello how are you doing 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.170
 evolution and in this tutorial I come to 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.410
 bring the spill marker for fifa 13 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.289
 the pc version obviously before that 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.849
 nothing just I want them I want them to be 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.180
 aware that this is not any 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:26.470
 patch is not nothing is not was not created 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:30.450
 for one person is any this 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.510
 It was made directly by and sports 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.960
 that is only available for the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.590
 North American and Latin American version 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.989
 of the game or if you're Spanish 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:52.040
 you will not be able to use it if it 's Spanish but 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.210
 if you want to do it 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.790
 How is it 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:04.110
 do these steps and he also like the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.729
 Latinos first thing to do is download 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.729
 these two assets 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:25.189
 and then 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.189
 extract the 13 and this marker 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:33.360
 extract it open and 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.240
 these 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 a folder with rare files and these 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.270
 28 good 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:48.550
 Now we have to go to the directory of the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.620
 13 that's why we're going to direct from 13 and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.670
 we give properties to verification to 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.030
 search destination and type here to me 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.340
 possibly able to not appear to them 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.100
 these files because this states 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.680
 action because they do not have the comments 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.130
 in English in like me because I have the 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.880
 renewed version of 13 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:19.580
 but the problems are copied to the 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:22.390
 here to the game folder and ready a 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.390
 Once this is done 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.120
 this folder called what they copy it 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.190
 the skin 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.530
 in the data folder 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:49.250
 because I'm going to do with this folder 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.660
 is the backup that are the files 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.330
 facts that the project for the doubts that 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.590
 they arrived is exactly the same as you 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.840
 come give you right click here 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.580
 arrive 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.820
 A) Yes 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.330
 and ready you will begin to be and give 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.140
 food to replace all 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.730
 and ready as you will see they will have all this 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.190
 so he had to keep them in his folder 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.000
 in the game folder you 're here because 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.530
 I already have it good 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.400
 once this is going to have to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.400
 rename in these two when you delete but 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.160
 delete these two files but I hope 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.570
 they find to these two as 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.030
 eliminate the two entered and as he says 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.520
 here only these names are rare 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.700
 so the art the text in European 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.970
 notes as they come up to the capital or 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.740
 eliminated 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.740
 these files are fine 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.550
 in these files and then 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.239
 and then we go now 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.390
 to what it says this is our mx 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:06.590
 Latin or Spanish import you have to 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:11.560
 go to this is select in this is and 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.560
 rename it this way 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.420
 it's expensive I copy such 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:24.150
 to this 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:28.850
 and ready and I see this is the man's goal 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.850
 name him by in a goal 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:41.610
 and that's how the capital would be like 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.610
 I had the game 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:52.100
 if later he does not open 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.000
 because i need parana 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.000
 the world 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:03.389
 then they open the 13 and select the in 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.669
 the English language that will appear 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.509
 in Spanish do not worry about 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.430
 selections 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:12.029
 English because otherwise it does not appear in 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:16.139
 the English marker and ready and what 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:18.749
 will have in Spanish and the score of my 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.990
 legs will be available for when 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:25.139
 play teams that belong to the 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.330
 english area to the bbv league to them 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.169
 you know check and yes 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.050
 if marker works it is necessary and and the 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:40.790
 ml is that the league usa at least that 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:43.820
 they say only progress and then 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.570
 If they want to talk to me, I tell them that 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.140
 when I put a league mode on a 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.280
 championship the premier I put it was read to 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.180
 bag in the installed marking and the macro 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.980
 he did not appear to me I do not know why it will be because 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.530
 I do not have the over activated or something like that 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.530
 It can not be but good 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:13.400
 you guys if you want if this happens to you 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:15.440
 see if it is activated to play here comes the 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.260
 model but good that's the important thing 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.950
 Now I hope you have served them 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.740
 and else 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.490
