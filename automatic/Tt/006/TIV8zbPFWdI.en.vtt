00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
how to make a cube today out of your

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.799 
how to make a cube today out of your
Bucky<00:00:30.470> cubes<00:00:30.939> because<00:00:31.939> I<00:00:32.119> didn't<00:00:32.360> find<00:00:32.540> any

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
Bucky cubes because I didn't find any

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.229 
Bucky cubes because I didn't find any
Bucky<00:00:33.080> cube<00:00:33.320> videos<00:00:33.470> on<00:00:34.100> YouTube<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:34.820> I<00:00:34.970> pull

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
Bucky cube videos on YouTube and I pull

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.390 
Bucky cube videos on YouTube and I pull
in<00:00:35.330> the<00:00:35.420> MiG<00:00:35.600> one<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.050> here<00:00:36.739> we<00:00:36.800> go<00:00:36.949> so<00:00:37.220> first

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
in the MiG one so here we go so first

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.439 
in the MiG one so here we go so first
what<00:00:37.519> you<00:00:37.550> want<00:00:37.730> to<00:00:37.790> do<00:00:37.879> is<00:00:37.970> make<00:00:38.120> this<00:00:38.239> into

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
what you want to do is make this into

what you want to do is make this into
one<00:00:38.570> big<00:00:38.719> long<00:00:38.870> string<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:39.380> that's<00:00:40.100> not<00:00:40.520> too

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
one big long string and that's not too

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.959 
one big long string and that's not too
hard<00:00:41.149> because<00:00:42.130> they<00:00:43.130> slide<00:00:43.610> pretty<00:00:44.450> darn<00:00:44.809> easy

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
hard because they slide pretty darn easy

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:53.200 
hard because they slide pretty darn easy
so<00:00:46.969> much<00:00:47.649> oh<00:00:50.140> oh

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210

this into a Q which is not very hard I'm

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.859 
this into a Q which is not very hard I'm
also<00:02:07.560> making<00:02:07.800> another<00:02:08.220> Bucky<00:02:09.119> Cube<00:02:09.420> video<00:02:09.690> on

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
also making another Bucky Cube video on

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.230 
also making another Bucky Cube video on
how<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.020> make<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> Cyclops<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.190> baby<00:02:11.820> Cyclops

I it's my favorite creation that I've
ever<00:02:17.010> invented<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:18.470> also<00:02:19.470> learned<00:02:19.709> how<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.830> make

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
ever invented I also learned how to make

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.610 
ever invented I also learned how to make
it<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.280> also<00:02:20.520> invented<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.239> Tintin<00:02:21.780> if<00:02:22.410> you've

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it I also invented a Tintin if you've

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.560 
it I also invented a Tintin if you've
seen<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.920> movie<00:02:22.950> out<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.640> buckyballs<00:02:24.239> but<00:02:24.540> I

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
seen the movie out of buckyballs but I

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.140 
seen the movie out of buckyballs but I
can't<00:02:24.780> remember<00:02:24.900> how<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> did<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.489> I'll<00:02:26.970> post

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
can't remember how I did it so I'll post

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.270 
can't remember how I did it so I'll post
a<00:02:27.300> video<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.810> figure<00:02:28.050> out<00:02:28.170> all<00:02:28.800> right<00:02:28.860> so

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
a video for figure out all right so

a video for figure out all right so
here's<00:02:29.640> our<00:02:29.820> Bucky<00:02:30.180> Cube<00:02:30.540> rectangle<00:02:31.320> right

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
here's our Bucky Cube rectangle right
