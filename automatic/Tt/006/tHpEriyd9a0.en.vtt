go to clean our sensors is we can't see
what<00:00:26.230> we're<00:00:26.410> doing<00:00:26.859> we<00:00:27.699> stumble<00:00:28.210> around

sensor without actually knowing did we

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.500 
sensor without actually knowing did we
get<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.570> piece<00:00:34.750> of<00:00:34.780> dust<00:00:35.140> or<00:00:35.379> not<00:00:35.710> get<00:00:35.980> it<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
get the piece of dust or not get it the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.209 
get the piece of dust or not get it the
idea<00:00:37.899> of<00:00:37.960> a<00:00:38.320> sensor<00:00:38.800> clear<00:00:39.370> loop<00:00:39.760> is<00:00:40.180> that<00:00:41.219> you

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
idea of a sensor clear loop is that you

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.979 
idea of a sensor clear loop is that you
turn<00:00:42.520> on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.989> LED<00:00:44.079> lights<00:00:45.570> position<00:00:46.570> the

turn on the LED lights position the

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.060 
turn on the LED lights position the

sensor loop on the lens mounting ring

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.180 
sensor loop on the lens mounting ring
and<00:00:51.420> allowing<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.809> them<00:00:53.399> inspect<00:00:54.399> all<00:00:56.190> of

and allowing you to them inspect all of

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.479 
and allowing you to them inspect all of
the<00:00:57.309> sensor<00:00:57.609> surface<00:00:58.800> after<00:00:59.800> inspecting<00:01:00.039> the

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
the sensor surface after inspecting the

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.240 
the sensor surface after inspecting the
sensor<00:01:00.850> surface<00:01:01.059> if<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:02.109> have<00:01:02.350> determined

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
sensor surface if you have determined

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.810 
sensor surface if you have determined
that<00:01:03.340> there<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.760> some<00:01:04.120> dust<00:01:04.720> on<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.170> surface

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that there is some dust on the surface

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.740 
that there is some dust on the surface
your<00:01:06.820> first<00:01:07.210> step<00:01:07.330> will<00:01:08.049> be<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.670> use<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.970> simple

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
your first step will be to use a simple

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.999 
your first step will be to use a simple
handheld<00:01:11.380> blower<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:13.299> remove<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:14.350> dry<00:01:14.680> dust

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
handheld blower to remove the dry dust

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.920 
handheld blower to remove the dry dust
that<00:01:15.520> was<00:01:15.729> on<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.030> sensor<00:01:16.390> surface<00:01:18.930> then

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
that was on the sensor surface then

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.770 
that was on the sensor surface then
using<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.040> sensor<00:01:21.430> loop<00:01:21.610> again<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:22.689> will

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
using the sensor loop again you will

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
using the sensor loop again you will
inspect<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.530> unit

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.649 

if<00:01:27.320> there<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.350> no<00:01:28.500> dust<00:01:28.950> visible<00:01:29.789> now<00:01:29.939> then<00:01:30.539> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
if there is no dust visible now then you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.090 
if there is no dust visible now then you
are<00:01:30.689> finished<00:01:31.079> cleaning<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.590> close<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:31.829> your

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
are finished cleaning and close up your

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580 
are finished cleaning and close up your
camera<00:01:32.399> if<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:33.359> is<00:01:33.509> some<00:01:33.810> dust<00:01:34.049> visible

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
camera if there is some dust visible

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.510 
camera if there is some dust visible
then<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.670> called<00:01:35.939> sticky<00:01:36.390> dust<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
then that is called sticky dust the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
then that is called sticky dust the
objective<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.210> dealing<00:01:39.569> with<00:01:39.600> sticky<00:01:40.079> dust<00:01:40.259> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
objective of dealing with sticky dust is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.889 
objective of dealing with sticky dust is
very<00:01:40.860> simple<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> sticky

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
very simple we want to make the sticky

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.749 
very simple we want to make the sticky
dust<00:01:43.200> stop<00:01:44.069> being<00:01:44.729> sticky<00:01:45.530> we<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.039> by

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
dust stop being sticky we do that by

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.100 
dust stop being sticky we do that by
simply<00:01:48.060> pushing<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:50.399> piece<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.670> dust<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.869> only

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
simply pushing the piece of dust it only

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.100 
simply pushing the piece of dust it only
has<00:01:52.350> two<00:01:52.590> choices<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.789> adhere<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> sensor

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
has two choices to adhere to the sensor

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.319 
has two choices to adhere to the sensor
clear<00:01:55.380> tip<00:01:55.649> surface<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.610> pull<00:01:56.819> it<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
clear tip surface and we pull it out and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.020 
clear tip surface and we pull it out and
we<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.319> notice<00:01:58.709> that<00:01:58.950> when<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.880> this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
we will notice that when we see this

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.559 
we will notice that when we see this
with<00:02:00.209> the<00:02:00.329> loop<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.739> will<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.579> still<00:02:03.239> again

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
with the loop or it will be still again

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.550 
with the loop or it will be still again
on<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.470> loop<00:02:04.679> on<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:06.060> sensor<00:02:06.420> surface<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.020> we

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
on the loop on the sensor surface and we

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
on the loop on the sensor surface and we
will<00:02:07.770> pull<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> out<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.880> will<00:02:09.030> put<00:02:09.179> up<00:02:09.299> with<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
will pull it out we will put up with a

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.009 
will pull it out we will put up with a
blower<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.560> next<00:02:10.799> cleaning<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.630> simply

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
blower on the next cleaning so we simply

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.500 
blower on the next cleaning so we simply
take<00:02:13.230> our<00:02:13.560> sensor<00:02:14.130> clear<00:02:14.370> pan<00:02:14.610> insert<00:02:15.360> it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
take our sensor clear pan insert it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.640 
take our sensor clear pan insert it
through<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.810> access<00:02:16.200> window<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.730> we<00:02:20.730> see

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
through the access window and we see

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.900 
through the access window and we see
exactly<00:02:22.650> what<00:02:23.610> we're<00:02:23.790> cleaning<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:25.910> this

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910
