00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello girls welcome I am silvana today 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.970
 let's learn how to knit French point 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.769
 with two needles I have 24 mounted points 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.769
 at this point it is multiple to 4 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.270
 let's start knitting the first 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.270
 row 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.759
 the first point is not knitted and we are going to 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:31.210
 knit two stitches to the right but first 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.900
 let's weave the second point 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.900
 from here to back 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.860
 and now let's knit the first point 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.860
 also to the right 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.449
 and that's where we get these two points of 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.449
 the left needle because already the tissues 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.120
 two points upside down 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.210
 and we repeat again 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.100
 to weave two stitches to the right first 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.100
 we knit the second point 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.649
 after the first point 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.840
 2 points 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.840
 upside down 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.590
 two right spots first we weave the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.090
 second 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.090
 after the first 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.399
 and so on until the entire row is finished 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.009
 now let's start knitting the second 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.009
 row 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.220
 the points that are presented to us in reverse 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.110
 we weave them backwards and the points that are 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.130
 they present us 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.290
 these are rights we leave it to the right 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.590
 first two stitches we knit them upside down 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:25.730
 but first we knit the second point 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.730
 thus 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.650
 and then we knit the first point 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.650
 also upside down 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.620
 two points to the right 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.070
 normally not and two points upside down 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.070
 first we knit the second point 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.240
 and then we knit upside down 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.240
 the first point 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.590
 right 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.640

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.959
 First 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:40.500
 and so until the last row is finished the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.019
 last for this row and we go back to 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.439
 repeat the first the third row 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.930

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.000
 straight 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.880
 and this is the reverse 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.740
