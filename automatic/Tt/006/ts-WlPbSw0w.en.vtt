00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
Bible that someone wants to read into it

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.819 
Bible that someone wants to read into it
that<00:02:55.790> says<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.780> fact<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.319> book<00:02:57.560> says

that says that in fact this book says
that<00:02:57.859> the<00:02:58.280> blacks<00:02:58.579> are<00:02:58.940> half<00:02:59.599> beast<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:01.099> that

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
that the blacks are half beast and that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.910 
that the blacks are half beast and that
you<00:03:01.459> should<00:03:01.670> be<00:03:01.790> treated<00:03:02.180> well<00:03:02.420> not<00:03:03.409> poorly

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
you should be treated well not poorly

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.309 
you should be treated well not poorly
because<00:03:04.310> no<00:03:04.489> man<00:03:04.700> treats<00:03:05.000> his<00:03:05.180> mules<00:03:05.510> poorly

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
because no man treats his mules poorly

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.740 
because no man treats his mules poorly
he<00:03:06.470> feeds<00:03:06.739> them<00:03:06.980> takes<00:03:07.340> care<00:03:07.609> of<00:03:07.639> them<00:03:07.819> so<00:03:08.690> he

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
he feeds them takes care of them so he

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.360 
he feeds them takes care of them so he
can<00:03:08.870> utilize<00:03:09.290> them<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.739> field<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.250> that's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
can utilize them in the field and that's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.949 
can utilize them in the field and that's
the<00:03:10.489> way<00:03:10.609> black<00:03:10.819> people<00:03:11.150> need<00:03:11.299> to<00:03:11.480> be<00:03:11.599> treated

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
the way black people need to be treated

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.180 
the way black people need to be treated
since<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:13.370> blacks<00:03:13.609> are<00:03:14.109> byproduct<00:03:15.109> of<00:03:15.379> Eve

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
since the blacks are byproduct of Eve

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.680 
since the blacks are byproduct of Eve
copulating<00:03:16.849> with<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.060> devil<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.540> devil

that and so therefore the the offspring

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.030 
that and so therefore the the offspring
was<00:03:23.419> half<00:03:24.109> beast<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.650> only<00:03:24.859> thing<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:27.040> few

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
but the djinn of the when the Bible says

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.099 
but the djinn of the when the Bible says
these<00:03:55.280> are<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.519> generations<00:03:55.879> of<00:03:56.269> Adam<00:03:56.569> and
