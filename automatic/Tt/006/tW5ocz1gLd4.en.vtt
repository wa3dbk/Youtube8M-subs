00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
pretty much exactly what smokin tells

you<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.930> should<00:01:13.110> run<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:14.070> probably<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you you should run that's probably the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
best you could run because since you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.810 
best you could run because since you
have<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> Hastur<00:01:17.340> armor<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.759> to
