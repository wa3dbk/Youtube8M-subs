00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
delicious but also it's because of the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.509 
delicious but also it's because of the
way<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.080> cut<00:00:22.380> them<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.769> cut<00:00:23.160> them<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.400> way

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
way that I cut them I cut them one way

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.730 
way that I cut them I cut them one way
that<00:00:23.699> he<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.060> open<00:00:24.449> them<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.590> eat
