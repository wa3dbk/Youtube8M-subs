represents driving enthusiasm in Europe

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.750 
represents driving enthusiasm in Europe
I<00:00:50.469> think<00:00:50.499> if<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.010> have<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.249> view<00:00:51.309> it's<00:00:51.489> a<00:00:51.550> sort

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
I think if you have a view it's a sort

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.020 
I think if you have a view it's a sort
of<00:00:51.820> site<00:00:52.659> of<00:00:52.929> a<00:00:53.620> site<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.280> religious<00:00:54.640> interest

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
of site of a site of religious interest

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.579 
of site of a site of religious interest
or<00:00:55.239> something<00:00:55.570> for<00:00:55.749> motorists<00:00:56.260> in<00:00:56.320> Europe

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
or something for motorists in Europe

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.700 
or something for motorists in Europe
this<00:00:56.679> would<00:00:56.859> be<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.129> and<00:00:58.319> rightly<00:00:59.319> so<00:00:59.440> because

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
this would be it and rightly so because

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.259 
this would be it and rightly so because
it<00:00:59.890> is<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.159> most<00:01:00.339> interesting<00:01:00.819> track<00:01:01.059> and

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
it is the most interesting track and

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.719 
it is the most interesting track and
it's<00:01:01.359> I<00:01:01.569> think<00:01:02.140> it's<00:01:02.469> fascination<00:01:03.100> lies<00:01:03.249> in<00:01:03.489> in

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
it's I think it's fascination lies in in

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.070 
it's I think it's fascination lies in in
the<00:01:03.909> in<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.330> fact<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.659> none<00:01:04.809> of<00:01:04.900> us<00:01:04.960> can

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
the in the fact that none of us can

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.390 
the in the fact that none of us can
quite<00:01:05.290> has<00:01:05.409> done<00:01:05.530> how<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.860> happened

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
quite has done how it happened

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.790 
quite has done how it happened
now<00:01:07.030> who<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.960> course<00:01:08.140> its<00:01:08.409> history<00:01:08.710> is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
now who and of course its history is

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.020 
now who and of course its history is
that<00:01:08.860> it<00:01:08.979> was<00:01:09.070> an<00:01:09.130> infrastructure<00:01:09.490> project<00:01:09.700> it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
that it was an infrastructure project it

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.150 
that it was an infrastructure project it
was<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:10.360> was<00:01:10.510> built<00:01:10.810> here<00:01:11.080> because<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
was it was built here because the

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.430 
was it was built here because the
Germans<00:01:12.490> wanted<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:12.940> bring<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:14.080> source<00:01:14.350> of

the things that we don't understand and
it's<00:01:28.720> amazing<00:01:29.350> because<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.800> remains<00:01:30.310> the

ultimate challenge for a street driver

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.020 
ultimate challenge for a street driver
it<00:01:33.010> means<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.280> ultimate<00:01:33.610> challenge<00:01:33.790> I<00:01:33.970> think

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
it means the ultimate challenge I think

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.220 
it means the ultimate challenge I think
for<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.420> racing<00:01:34.630> driver<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.690> you<00:01:37.690> can<00:01:37.870> try<00:01:38.080> and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
for a racing driver and you can try and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.230 
for a racing driver and you can try and
toy<00:01:38.410> with<00:01:38.650> it<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.890> think<00:01:39.010> it's<00:01:39.400> I<00:01:39.610> do<00:01:39.790> think<00:01:40.120> it's

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
toy with it I think it's I do think it's

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.700 
toy with it I think it's I do think it's
in<00:01:40.360> Malta<00:01:40.570> why<00:01:40.660> don't<00:01:40.870> people<00:01:41.080> talk<00:01:41.380> about<00:01:41.500> it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
in Malta why don't people talk about it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.130 
in Malta why don't people talk about it
dying<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.670> it's<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.360> Mark<00:01:43.660> Twain<00:01:43.870> in<00:01:44.020> that

dying and it's it is Mark Twain in that

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.540 
dying and it's it is Mark Twain in that
respect<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.560> think<00:01:44.590> people<00:01:44.980> talk<00:01:45.130> about<00:01:45.250> that

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
respect I think people talk about that

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.420 
respect I think people talk about that
too<00:01:45.730> quickly<00:01:46.230> it<00:01:47.230> will<00:01:47.440> survive<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:48.040> probably

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
too quickly it will survive it probably

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.610 
too quickly it will survive it probably

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
so much you can do with it it's so

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.030 
so much you can do with it it's so
outrageous<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.020> can't<00:01:53.410> kind<00:01:53.920> of

outrageous that you can't kind of

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.560

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
it will it will survive but but it might

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.920 
it will it will survive but but it might
need<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> change<00:02:53.609> a<00:02:53.760> bit<00:02:53.849> that's<00:02:54.060> all<00:02:54.209> there's

but to do the setup they use the roads
around<00:03:15.870> here<00:03:16.109> because<00:03:16.439> the<00:03:16.530> roads<00:03:16.709> are<00:03:16.829> better

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
