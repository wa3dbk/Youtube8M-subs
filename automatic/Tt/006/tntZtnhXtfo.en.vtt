00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.590
 and as always exaggerate and I'm really not the only one 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.999
 knows what tonight will be 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:16.869
 or what this term HUF 25 means, it's not about one 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.210
 Party with a certain age limit or something like that 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.880
 is also modern 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 but it is about riders who 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.060
 are successful as juniors and young riders 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.689
 but just 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.289
 the leap into the very heavy class that is so in the adult says 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.720
 Michel 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.620
 should have gotten more relieved we have that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.460
 that means the German Equestrian Federation already has some 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.750
 Years in dressage performed with the chief advancement prize Internet 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.420
 they are experienced 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.500
 2 25 are just that 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 in the rider is 25 years 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.300
 Demanding exams that really needs to be said so the obstacles are 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.750
 until mid-50 on some that with the 55 high that's what ours 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.750
 international stars too 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.480
 she rules 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.480
 over the years have to complete over the year 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.880
 great 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.710
 Possibility to encourage the boys and girls to take the leap 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.300
 the big classes 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.670
 and we have one of these tests today 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.440
 he unnaturally acts Kazior victories and placings he placed 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.660
 and l how happy it is next to it is called 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.900
 National jumping competition of the heavy class 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.910
 Warsaw RPO Munich 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.210
 and it won 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.210
 with zero points 54 grief 5 9 seconds 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.010
 on the Holstein stallion Colucci 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.430
 choice 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 Hendrik so what 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.050
 Heinrich is cheap as it is in elderly patients 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.839
 a typical product 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.259
 from the guidance of the parents 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.359
 In this case, Obama nobles his fears 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.479
 because without parents it's not on the other hand, but also on the hand 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.129
 by the German Equestrian Federation 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.670
 the best exams of junior and young riders 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.769

 Kerner saddle not won 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.649
 but also here 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.939
 HGW quite by then very interesting that this good 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.759
 APA a worthy winner 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.090
 it will be Mathijsen again 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.379
 to have 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.079
 Ortenberg and SK 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.179

 in second place with zero points 54 dollars 9 5 seconds 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.439

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.569
 Florian Lammers and Robert Duvall were praised only in the fall 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:14.479
 Freiberg 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:19.149
 that he does for one or the other role in the film the wrestler of Ref 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.899
 Does she leave it so lovingly prepared is important that the houses belong 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.339
 the Silver Server is 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:37.619
 Winner only clue 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.139
 the 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:46.059
 The interesting one has been achieved meanwhile as a girls sport 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.369
 Brazil 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.269
 but against the Lions are completely complete so is also on the third 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.539
 Place a core 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:53.729
 in the water 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.849
 With zero points they lost but again probably on the Kappelberg 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:58.939
 moor 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.040
 Obama he wanted when Felix Schneider 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:13.069
 customer-oriented 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.049
 To believe in distrust on the 14th is to be a young Mason 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.189
 it had to come 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:25.979
 with zero points 98 90 seconds on voluntary red 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.689
 Lanxess is at some point because we had to rebuild it now 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:40.099
 we must 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:45.539
 Haase on the 5,000-point mark and recorded at 7 7 seconds 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.229

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.059
 Switzerland is an international movement 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.289

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.289
 started in this season 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.960

 more 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:48.009
 I do not think in the normal framework of a three-master pipeline 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.349
 c 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:52.020
