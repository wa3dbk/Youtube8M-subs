than others there isn't a single thing
on<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.830> case<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.430> makes<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.759> difficult<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
on this case that makes it difficult to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.600 
on this case that makes it difficult to
do<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:22.140> example<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> I've<00:01:23.189> actually

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
do for example is that I've actually

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.219 
do for example is that I've actually
cracked<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.180> screen<00:01:24.299> protector<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.990> this

cracked the screen protector on this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.410 
cracked the screen protector on this
case<00:01:25.560> I've<00:01:25.799> put<00:01:26.250> two<00:01:26.400> layers<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.790> packing<00:01:27.299> tape

case I've put two layers of packing tape

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.910 
case I've put two layers of packing tape
to<00:01:27.479> make<00:01:27.689> sure<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.020> I'll<00:01:28.140> cut<00:01:28.350> myself<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
to make sure that I'll cut myself and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.440 
to make sure that I'll cut myself and
that<00:01:29.189> still<00:01:29.460> offers<00:01:29.850> better<00:01:30.030> screen

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that still offers better screen

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.940 
usability then your incipio atlas ID
also<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.360> screen<00:01:33.630> protector<00:01:33.780> again<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.799> don't

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
also the screen protector again I don't

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
of this case is and it's actually not

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.650 
of this case is and it's actually not
physically<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.950> case<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.760> do<00:02:29.970> stay<00:02:30.030> tuned<00:02:30.450> for

that<00:02:30.690> now<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.290> case<00:02:31.500> comes<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:31.860> three<00:02:31.980> parts

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
that now the case comes in three parts

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.860 
that now the case comes in three parts
there's<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> front<00:02:32.670> there's<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.300> back<00:02:33.540> and

pieces are made out of metal which is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.330 
pieces are made out of metal which is
what<00:02:36.720> gives<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.050> most<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.410> its<00:02:37.560> weight<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
what gives it most of its weight the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.430 
what gives it most of its weight the
entire<00:02:38.580> case<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.060> put<00:02:39.239> together<00:02:39.390> by<00:02:39.660> screws

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
entire case is put together by screws

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.380 
entire case is put together by screws
and<00:02:40.830> these<00:02:41.340> screws<00:02:41.610> are<00:02:41.730> not<00:02:41.819> as<00:02:42.000> long<00:02:42.209> as

and these screws are not as long as
one's<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.870> lunatic<00:02:43.290> tactic<00:02:43.650> extreme

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
one's for the lunatic tactic extreme

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.500 
one's for the lunatic tactic extreme
there<00:02:44.519> is<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> glass<00:02:44.910> screen<00:02:45.180> protector<00:02:45.480> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
there is a glass screen protector that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.390 
there is a glass screen protector that
covers<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.989> entire<00:02:46.080> front<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.830> case<00:02:47.160> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
covers the entire front of the case and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.830 
covers the entire front of the case and
now<00:02:47.489> again<00:02:47.640> ours<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.090> crack<00:02:48.299> as<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.569> took<00:02:48.720> an

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
now again ours is crack as we took an

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.750 
now again ours is crack as we took an
axe<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.530> there<00:02:49.799> is<00:02:49.890> an<00:02:50.010> impact<00:02:50.340> trust

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
axe to it there is an impact trust

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.979 
axe to it there is an impact trust
though<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> doesn't<00:02:51.480> seem<00:02:51.630> like<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.900> would

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
though it doesn't seem like it would

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.660 
though it doesn't seem like it would
take<00:02:52.290> much<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.470> an<00:02:52.650> impact<00:02:52.920> because<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.430> very

around<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:47.040> bunch<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.400> then<00:03:47.609> we<00:03:47.730> took<00:03:47.850> an<00:03:47.970> axe

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
around a bunch and then we took an axe
