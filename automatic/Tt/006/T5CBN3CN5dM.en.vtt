00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.950
 It is a community for me 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.450
 faith community in the mine believe 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.039
 flattened that I received here 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.529
 I will be that I really 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.029
 I have to imagine and that would be me too 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.250
 accepted as I am 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.809
 I do not know anything about the team where 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.640
 simply the friends are me 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.890
 I can understand everything 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.030
 do another object and then I want there 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.030
 I just like it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.280
 yes you can be but is then 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.710
 will be recorded in any case because 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.710
 this is a kind of family for me 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.859
 the rays we have are fun 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.890
 detached what is the special belief 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:58.100
 me that you yourself yes you can do that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.100
 do 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.540
 Yes 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.730
 you can sing together just like that 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.130
 in the form in the community in the 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.130
 I am not related to myself elsewhere 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.860
 I feel what I usually do 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.090
 I can say that out loud now 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.640
 unsubscribe world 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.420
 I can call that out loud and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.610
 scream 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.610
 that is always missing totally 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.479
 Really realize that they are enough that 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.579
 they are exactly what we can experience in 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.450
 a group and therefore really too 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.450
 yes beyond yourself 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.900
