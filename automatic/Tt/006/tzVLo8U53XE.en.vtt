00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
sentry gun they're both possible but the

sentry gun they're both possible but the
grenade<00:00:44.120> launcher<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.600> little<00:00:45.050> bit<00:00:45.140> easier

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
grenade launcher is a little bit easier

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.080 
grenade launcher is a little bit easier
for<00:00:45.500> this<00:00:45.710> glitch<00:00:45.920> but<00:00:46.460> if<00:00:46.550> you<00:00:46.640> guys<00:00:46.730> want<00:00:47.030> to

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
for this glitch but if you guys want to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.240 
for this glitch but if you guys want to
save<00:00:47.300> money<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.690> century<00:00:48.140> guns<00:00:48.350> can<00:00:48.829> do<00:00:49.010> it<00:00:49.130> so

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
save money a century guns can do it so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.920 
save money a century guns can do it so
they<00:00:49.370> are<00:00:49.489> both<00:00:49.670> possible<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:50.600> you're<00:00:50.840> just

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
they are both possible so you're just

why<00:01:16.640> c4<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.150> really<00:01:17.540> good<00:01:17.659> on<00:01:17.690> this<00:01:17.840> glitch

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
why c4 is really good on this glitch

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.039 
why c4 is really good on this glitch
just<00:01:18.380> throw<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.040> out<00:01:19.130> at<00:01:19.430> them<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.060> blow<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.960> up

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
just throw it out at them and blow it up

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.140 
just throw it out at them and blow it up
every<00:01:21.320> round<00:01:21.500> it's<00:01:21.830> really<00:01:22.310> sick<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:22.820> since

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
every round it's really sick and since

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.880 
every round it's really sick and since
this<00:01:23.299> glitch<00:01:23.540> is<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:23.930> easy<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.350> get<00:01:24.440> into<00:01:24.619> you

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
this glitch is so easy to get into you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.890 
this glitch is so easy to get into you
can<00:01:25.010> easily<00:01:25.400> get<00:01:25.549> into<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:25.850> every<00:01:26.030> round<00:01:26.180> just

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
can easily get into it every round just

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.539 
can easily get into it every round just
like<00:01:27.110> you'll<00:01:27.290> make<00:01:27.440> so<00:01:27.799> much<00:01:27.920> money<00:01:28.100> up<00:01:28.369> here

you so you'll have easily enough for a
sentry<00:01:32.600> gun<00:01:32.750> every<00:01:32.990> round<00:01:33.260> so<00:01:33.860> that'll<00:01:34.130> be

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
sentry gun every round so that'll be

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.039 
sentry gun every round so that'll be
