00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.610
 in the last two days 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.350
 believe it or not I don't care 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.570
 to convince you but the truth is this I do not 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.000
 I know if I made a deal or not 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.229

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.160
 success and if companies start 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.950
 really listening to what happens 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.830
 on the net at these levels and therefore ad 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.110
 have a perception of the extent 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.630
 that may have certain things in my opinion 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.209
 it is a sign that something is changing e 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.890
