00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.509
 Hey, people from New York Harbor. 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.460
 Beauty, people have a place here that I 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.369
 I want to show you how cool it is. 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:23.180
 very different things I ascend 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.180
 When it snows, it happens here. 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.720
 Look at that lot of hurt. 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.770
 stalactite that speaks nÃ© x that forms 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.400
 here o 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.400
 look there 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:51.670
 It's all that's because I 'm not even 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.400
 only snow but kind up there you see 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.100
 who suffers and does not have anything else then 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.000
 the water that flows and you are to see 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.890
 right there on the top that has a drop here 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.650
 then all the water that flows because of 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.450
 the cold is obviously we are in the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.950
 when one temperature negative to 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.870
 people talk in degrees centigrade and there 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.660
 going accumulating goes forming this 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.960
 ice because probably not only 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.180
 cold temperature but the stones also in the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.040
 call you 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.350
 It was there that the fact of having taken 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:32.590
 yesterday accumulated a little more on top of 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:37.150
 and will get more and more is these 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:42.040
 frozen formations come out there in the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:47.050
 tip for you guys to see if I can get your 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:51.970
 closest to show the type is only 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:54.310
 more a curiosity that is a visual 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.590
 so unusual at this time that 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.280
 we see it here, I think it's going to stay 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.860
 It's easier for you to see how it 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.160
 that the tips down is not because 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.319
 I called stalactites I think it is 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.640
 This name but I said someone wrong. 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.250
 write in the comments correct me 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.850

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.880
 they already cleaned 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.319
 here the sipar that enriches its way 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.270
 what he probably is 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.350
 is a consumer market in the market then 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:46.480

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:46.480
 just look at him 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.270

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.680
 the look that is here in america 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.290
