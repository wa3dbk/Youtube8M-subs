roofing<00:00:05.790> here<00:00:06.779> we<00:00:06.960> go<00:00:07.849> let's<00:00:08.849> see<00:00:09.120> why<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.650> is

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
roofing here we go let's see why this is

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.499 
roofing here we go let's see why this is
leaking<00:00:13.130> water<00:00:14.130> traveling<00:00:14.910> between<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
leaking water traveling between the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.680 
leaking water traveling between the
eaves<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.590> fascia<00:00:17.390> dripping<00:00:18.390> under<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
eaves and the fascia dripping under the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.439 
eaves and the fascia dripping under the
soffit<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:21.410> conveniently<00:00:23.029> creating<00:00:24.029> water

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
soffit and conveniently creating water

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.390 
soffit and conveniently creating water
right<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.470> front<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.539> garage<00:00:28.250> causing<00:00:29.250> ice

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
right in front of the garage causing ice

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.370 
right in front of the garage causing ice
when<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> gets<00:00:29.910> cold<00:00:30.890> not<00:00:31.890> convenient<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.669> all

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
when it gets cold not convenient at all

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.970 
when it gets cold not convenient at all
so<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.530> get<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.829> above<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:36.140> look<00:00:37.140> at<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> four

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
so we get up above and look at a four

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.650 
so we get up above and look at a four
year<00:00:38.010> old<00:00:38.309> roof<00:00:39.469> or<00:00:40.469> approximately<00:00:41.250> five

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
year old roof or approximately five

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
year old roof or approximately five
years<00:00:42.660> old<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:43.980> watch<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.340> water

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
years old and we can watch the water

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.910 
years old and we can watch the water
coming<00:00:45.030> off<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.239> shingles<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:51.739> if<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
coming off the shingles and if the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.069 
coming off the shingles and if the

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
capillary action traveling up underneath

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.349 
capillary action traveling up underneath
hitting<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> roof<00:00:58.410> deck<00:00:58.680> wetting<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
water traveling between these in the

face support the reason the reason for

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.190 
face support the reason the reason for
this<00:01:15.479> leak<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.650> there's<00:01:16.950> no<00:01:17.220> drip<00:01:17.490> edge

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
this leak is that there's no drip edge

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
this leak is that there's no drip edge
there's<00:01:19.200> no<00:01:19.380> underlayment<00:01:20.180> it's<00:01:21.180> just

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
there's no underlayment it's just

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
there's no underlayment it's just
shingles<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> wood<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.970> wood<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
shingles on the wood and the wood is

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.289 
shingles on the wood and the wood is
soaking<00:01:24.659> wet<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> shingle<00:01:29.670> job<00:01:30.000> didn't

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
soaking wet this is a shingle job didn't

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.010 
soaking wet this is a shingle job didn't
even<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.170> shingles<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> outside

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
even get the shingles to the outside

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960 
even get the shingles to the outside
edge<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.470> roof<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.100> there's<00:01:35.850> no

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
edge of this roof and there's no

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.750 
edge of this roof and there's no
flashing<00:01:36.509> exposed<00:01:37.049> wood<00:01:37.320> under<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> soffit

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.440 

there's<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.480> spot<00:01:43.750> where<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:45.360> flashing<00:01:46.360> is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
there's a spot where the flashing is

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.330 
there's a spot where the flashing is
buckled<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.930> shingles<00:01:47.350> help<00:01:47.620> a<00:01:47.740> driving<00:01:48.160> rain

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
buckled the shingles help a driving rain

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.720 
buckled the shingles help a driving rain
can<00:01:48.580> get<00:01:48.730> up<00:01:48.820> underneath<00:01:49.150> there<00:01:49.480> in<00:01:49.600> Lake<00:01:50.730> and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
can get up underneath there in Lake and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.200 
can get up underneath there in Lake and
this<00:01:51.910> continued<00:01:52.480> water<00:01:52.780> flow<00:01:53.200> is<00:01:53.500> from<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.210> nice

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
this continued water flow is from a nice

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.970 
this continued water flow is from a nice
trough<00:01:55.600> draining<00:01:56.020> out<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.620> shingles

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
trough draining out on to the shingles

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.690 
trough draining out on to the shingles
so<00:01:59.980> this<00:02:00.130> would<00:02:00.310> just<00:02:00.370> be<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:02.490> continued<00:02:03.490> it

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
so this would just be a continued it

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.020 
so this would just be a continued it
constant<00:02:04.690> problem<00:02:05.280> unless<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:06.490> roof<00:02:06.760> gets

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
constant problem unless this roof gets

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.260 
constant problem unless this roof gets
done<00:02:07.240> right<00:02:07.270> with<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.170> rights<00:02:08.350> backs<00:02:09.270> which

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
done right with the rights backs which

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.790 
done right with the rights backs which
that's<00:02:10.420> what<00:02:10.540> we're<00:02:10.810> going<00:02:10.930> to<00:02:10.960> do<00:02:11.110> here<00:02:11.380> for

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
that's what we're going to do here for

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.600 
that's what we're going to do here for
hell<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:14.100> 169<00:02:15.100> stave<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.610> Richmond<00:02:15.880> hell
