 hello people i am destin a chain with 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.219
 a guest blog horizon and just got on 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.340
 channel of follow the king's ten 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.590
 say en but it is not a normal one 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.330
 guest role because at first there wasn't the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.710
 intention to put a gas for gas on it 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.119
 because actually made it that way 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.680
 just throw yourself on video about it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.680
 We finally decided that I 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.810
 made a guest for it so I do that for me 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.949
 go ourselves later 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.689
 suggest improvement proposals 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.239
 what becomes here in the background 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.559
 played the gameplay because it would be quite 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.320
 may well that you do not recognize it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.079

 to play culture 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.649
 and that's why they made this is it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.340

 it is quite difficult under so in there 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.460

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.020
 with a thing that we kind of like 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.430
 really many lessons she decided on this 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.380
 behind us see that I play on shipment 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.439
 the smallest with ever made in call or 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.490
 duty there and play with my m4a a 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.799
 new shivers and mac 43 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.430
 yes I already knew that is just very bad 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.130
 the building board mini's manager but yes 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.960
 what actually is cold your online 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.060
 is a game because of course is with you 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.580
 there and mix and through a lot in web 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.380
 but they could also take that long 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.780
 is a mix of the men's wolves series 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.890
 and a mix of the black options 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.200
 you also see the next cup that i 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.700
 play again done because you too 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.780
 very special is that then calls and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.069
 shipment is in a game 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.580
 but it is therefore a mix of those games 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:28.650
 and therefore it itself already missions in van 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.840
 ghost and soon there will just be 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.700
 woke up weapons from what catch 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.160
 latest gadget that has to come out of this 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.519
 come in that king's day so that's whole 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.170
 nice 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.610
 they really have the best aspects of it 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.920
 call or duty they have rings here 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.430
 wanted and I actually think so 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.459
 awfully fat yes for the third game in 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.890
 so there is actually they there 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.230
 here because they have zombies 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.010
 sometimes you also see new ones 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.410
 limit some gameplay on zombies here 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.950
 so they put it so now that I get there 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.450
 nice 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.030
 And sometimes they have it's cyborgs 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.340
 so sometimes robots are very fat 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.959
 zombies but welcome to sonny's van 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.299
 the word black gets in place 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.950
 string but this is also very 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.430
 special you on all new weapons and 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.950
 that is also very fat and in cold youtube 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.920
 line you also have survival 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.630
 the survival rate just what we think of him 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.340
 in three 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.280
 and yes that was actually about it 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.260
 play again if you have questions or what 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.530
 Then you also want to download it to find you 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.630

 battery in it 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.470
 10% if what you drive your followers you have 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.270
 a battery that spend and say that 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.390
 but also the money you spend on it 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.380
 you can lift your haters because you can 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.430
 do not buy weapons from the wall 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.790
 for instance 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:17.480
 and with that you can jump and boxer 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.380
 speech locally and that kind of shit the cut 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.120
