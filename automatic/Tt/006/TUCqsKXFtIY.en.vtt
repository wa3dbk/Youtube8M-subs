00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.900
 welcome to the next tutorial 2 of 3 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.570
 change the touch of a fourth ipod 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.430
 generation let's see here the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.219
 procedure we work with the 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.960
 most brands like it is a pons if there 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.929
 pot 4 ipod 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.519
 and also we have stable what our 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.009
 totally practical course here you go to 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.550
 learn many things to repair to 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.550
 disarm 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.780
 to solve procedures also 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.300
 we have tools such as the station 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.730
 of work this work station then 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.190
 we have them at 140 dollars you can 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.720
 call our office and ask for these 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.630
 work stations we send them to 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.890
 all the equator if they are air and 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.130
 good heat in the procedure here 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.200
 the same as I already explained, we took 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.989
 the screws that you see here are 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.050
 find each one of the screws and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.940
 now we are going to realize what is to raise 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.210
 each of the protections here there 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.729
 a sip protection that protects the equipment 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.630
 to put the touch and the display 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.630
 zip 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:27.780
 I will proceed to lift the lid 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.410
 which protects the plate of the ipod chip with 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.220
 very careful we will go lifting the this 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.330
 part 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.330
 by the sides 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.100
 very carefully it comes out completely 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.990
 yes 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.210
 do not forget to visit our page 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.150
 web soon to the point that soon 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.520
 puntocom if you have questions comments 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.979
 suggestions through our channel 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.360
 facebook alright as soon as it's going to 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.220
 be a little uncomfortable because you 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.220
 they realize it brings a lot of double-sided tape 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.430
 all the whole ipod brings double tape 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.980
 face 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.510
 we keep seeing here you can 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.289
 find that if the games saw 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.880
 was stuck towards advertising not here 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.220
 are our addresses in Quito and 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.740
 guayaquil we will continue doing the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.110
 procedure we go to once we have 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.930
 pulled out all the screws here is a 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.940
 more screw that is the one that protects a 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.430
 of the plate if you are the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.020
 they take out but simply raise it with 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.580
 very careful 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.040
 raise this part here disconnect the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.650
 camera although there are connected the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.880
 camera and they do the procedure to the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.400
 reverse do not put the touch on the part 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.040
 from behind is the connection that you 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.220
 can see if they see it is the collection 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.940
 that is there connected the touch I make a 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.120
 slow procedure slowly slow but 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.120
 safe 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.100
 I hold with the other hand 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.110
 it's a bit complicated because I'm not 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.640
 removing the plate from your ipod but it 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.760
 I'm putting it here and 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.340
 immediately it is already what it is 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.790
 the tactile look you can see there 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.860
 is the touch totally assembled no 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.400
 Now I'm going to do the procedure for 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.730
 put the camera taking care that 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.010
 I have other flex here on the sides zip and 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.480
 let's do the same procedure 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.180
 I'm going to connect the camera by putting a 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.130
 little pressure 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.070
 and apparently the camera is already 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.700
 it costs sip now I'm going to do the 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.670
 procedure of assembling the ipod with 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.440
 very careful I will put the parts that 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.460
 I just removed that is part of the 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.460
 from the flex 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.910
 now I'm going to connect the touch 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.630
 I remind you that this ipod is on 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.480
 it is completely on 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.580
 be connected better said the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.140
 battery is working and I'm going to 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.170
 connecting the tank is a little bit 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.400
 complicated many times this part of 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.489
 here because it takes away a little bit of 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.190
 nothing more time but the procedure is 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.660
 you have to do it very carefully if we 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.660
 let's realize that it is well placed 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.330
 many times it does not join because this 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.830
 it may be an incorrect procedure 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.220
 I'm going to look 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.160
 video hinders me ready to work 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.920
 I'm going to here I have to put in law 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.900
 your protection that is this but only 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.060
 I'm going to try it good it's recommended 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.770
 put him 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.500
 and I have to put the protection law 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.000
 I remind you that if I put the 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.870
 low protection has some legs 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.870
 where it hooks 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.980
 hooked the protection 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.020
 you heard some clicked and I'm going 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.449
 to try it now the ipod please 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.710
 before finishing the assembly or before 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.970
 put the screws 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.970
 It is advisable to always try 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.550
 in this case the arc is connected 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.060
 completely 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.060
 yes 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.380
 to the current 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.819
 let's see if it was connected in the 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:33.740
 this and then here it is already possible to give 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.740
 account will already start to slide 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:38.279
 in it because it is already connected simply 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.279
 what 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.150
 give him 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.010
 put a little more pressure on 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.110
 what happens depending on the touch if 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.760
 you realize if you pressed here 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.740
 Sometimes send image send us an image 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.350
 but simply because it is not yet 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.300
 connected if I'm going to start connecting 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.440
 well and to all parties so that 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.940
 you see it working 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.940
 completely to the iphone yes 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.990
 and you can see it there 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.880
 the act is already sending what is 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.680
 all your plants and here also 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.689
 begin to pay to learn between 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.999
 others 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:20.459
 if we are going to do this tutorial now 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:24.419
 let's put the screws so that the 

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:26.249
 iphone the ipad work completely not 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.919

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:31.229

 We have all kinds of tools 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:39.839
 We work with Chinese phones to 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:42.569
