I'm added to this v8 is a 7-speed
automatic<00:02:02.499> transmission<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.640> it's<00:02:03.999> not

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
automatic transmission and it's not

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.819 
automatic transmission and it's not
quite<00:02:04.450> doing<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.780> trick<00:02:04.990> for<00:02:05.140> me<00:02:05.259> when<00:02:05.770> you

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
quite doing the trick for me when you

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.139 
quite doing the trick for me when you
try<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.009> use<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.219> paddles<00:02:06.399> it's<00:02:06.850> more<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.090> a

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
try to use the paddles it's more of a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.660 
try to use the paddles it's more of a
suggestion<00:02:07.569> than<00:02:08.080> an<00:02:08.289> actual<00:02:08.470> shift<00:02:08.950> now<00:02:09.610> it

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
suggestion than an actual shift now it

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.070 
suggestion than an actual shift now it
works<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.970> first<00:02:10.119> several<00:02:10.390> years<00:02:10.509> but<00:02:10.960> then

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
works the first several years but then

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.420 
works the first several years but then
you<00:02:11.170> start<00:02:11.380> getting<00:02:11.470> up<00:02:11.620> into<00:02:11.740> the

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
here you get four five six seven and it

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.099 
here you get four five six seven and it
just<00:02:15.400> kind<00:02:15.579> of<00:02:15.670> uh<00:02:15.780> does<00:02:16.780> what<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:16.989> wants

practicality out of this car but the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.379 
practicality out of this car but the
fact<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.019> made<00:02:56.200> them<00:02:56.349> I'm<00:02:57.159> a<00:02:57.250> monster<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:57.879> you

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
fact you made them I'm a monster but you

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.059 
fact you made them I'm a monster but you
know<00:02:58.510> I'm<00:02:58.959> gonna<00:02:59.139> behind<00:02:59.439> Ian<00:02:59.650> right<00:02:59.799> now<00:02:59.919> this

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
I think we could fit no more than a

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.729 
I think we could fit no more than a
small<00:03:03.730> child<00:03:04.090> or<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.299> briefcase<00:03:04.599> so<00:03:05.469> that's<00:03:05.620> all
