00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
lot of the air out then that is put out

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.789 
lot of the air out then that is put out
into<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> Sun<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.840> dehydrate<00:01:46.320> even<00:01:46.560> further

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

into the Sun to dehydrate even further
then<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.189> covered<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.549> mold<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.090> sucks

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
then it's covered in mold which sucks

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.120 
then it's covered in mold which sucks
even<00:01:48.450> more<00:01:48.600> moisture<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.710> gives

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
even more moisture out and that gives

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.359 
even more moisture out and that gives
