not<00:00:25.650> increasing<00:00:26.650> your<00:00:26.980> spoilers<00:00:27.989> when<00:00:28.989> you're

turning
and<00:00:31.020> that<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.890> would<00:00:32.220> somehow<00:00:33.210> cause<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.900> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and that it would somehow cause you to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.880 
and that it would somehow cause you to
possibly<00:00:35.100> stall<00:00:35.460> spin<00:00:35.820> kind<00:00:36.150> of<00:00:36.240> a<00:00:36.300> thing

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.729 

so<00:00:49.829> all<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.700> people<00:00:50.880> are<00:00:51.140> commenting<00:00:52.140> that

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
so all these people are commenting that

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.200 
so all these people are commenting that
if<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> increase<00:00:53.340> your<00:00:53.489> spoilers<00:00:54.000> while

you're turning that is going to cause

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.130 
you're turning that is going to cause
you<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.100> stall<00:00:56.460> possibly<00:00:56.970> spin<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.020> they're

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you to stall possibly spin so they're

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.340

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
air speeds not like suddenly going crazy

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.740 
air speeds not like suddenly going crazy
okay<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.160> don't<00:03:06.730> get<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.090> guys<00:03:07.120> you're<00:03:07.690> gonna

let's do it one more time I'm going to
open<00:03:39.020> up<00:03:39.260> all<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.590> way

open up all the way
me<00:03:41.770> yeah<00:03:41.980> my<00:03:42.250> airspeed<00:03:42.910> slowly<00:03:43.420> decreases

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
me yeah my airspeed slowly decreases

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.089 
me yeah my airspeed slowly decreases
because<00:03:44.470> their<00:03:44.770> speed<00:03:45.069> brakes<00:03:45.430> new<00:03:45.700> brakes

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
thinking this thing is myth is debunked

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.100 
thinking this thing is myth is debunked
okay<00:03:55.650> maybe<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.400> other<00:03:56.430> way<00:03:56.900> not<00:03:57.900> that

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
okay maybe it's the other way not that

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
that would make any sense that was a

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.720 
that would make any sense that was a
really<00:04:00.510> bad<00:04:00.660> turn<00:04:00.959> by<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.170> way<00:04:01.370> yah<00:04:02.370> string<00:04:02.610> is

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
really bad turn by the way yah string is

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.670 
really bad turn by the way yah string is
on<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:02.910> inside<00:04:03.180> okay<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:03.959> they're<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.319> little

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:22.069 
yeah sure your air speed decreases but

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.040 
yeah sure your air speed decreases but
all<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.400> have<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.729> do<00:04:22.849> is<00:04:23.060> just<00:04:23.300> release<00:04:23.780> back

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
does put me into a stall but I or spin

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.759 
does put me into a stall but I or spin
but<00:04:53.409> I<00:04:54.099> guess<00:04:54.519> maybe<00:04:54.789> at<00:04:55.029> 45<00:04:55.629> knots<00:04:56.319> just

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:56.769 
but I guess maybe at 45 knots just

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:59.909 
but I guess maybe at 45 knots just
barely<00:04:57.339> above<00:04:57.610> stall<00:04:57.999> and<00:04:58.239> then<00:04:58.959> I<00:04:59.169> do<00:04:59.229> it<00:04:59.349> but

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
barely above stall and then I do it but

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.809 
barely above stall and then I do it but
why<00:05:00.929> I'm<00:05:01.929> already<00:05:02.649> messing<00:05:02.949> up<00:05:03.279> if<00:05:03.429> I'm<00:05:03.610> that

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
why I'm already messing up if I'm that

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.179

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 
slow and I'm turning face to final
