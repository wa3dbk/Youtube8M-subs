parts<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:32.080> would<00:03:32.950> suggest<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.520> take<00:03:33.970> a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
parts I would suggest that you take a

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.110 
parts I would suggest that you take a
picture<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:35.520> your<00:03:36.520> wiring<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.090> your

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
picture of your wiring in your

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.660 
picture of your wiring in your
connectors<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.130> especially<00:03:39.130> this<00:03:39.250> here<00:03:39.490> that

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
connectors and especially this here that

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.510 
connectors and especially this here that
you<00:03:39.820> sign<00:03:41.580> capacitor<00:03:42.580> interferes

faster<00:03:45.740> photograph<00:03:46.740> those<00:03:46.980> leads<00:03:47.310> because

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
faster photograph those leads because

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.810 
faster photograph those leads because
there's<00:03:48.900> leads<00:03:49.530> on<00:03:49.710> the<00:03:49.800> back<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.100> here<00:03:50.310> one

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
there's leads on the back of here one

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.250 
there's leads on the back of here one
two<00:03:51.090> three<00:03:51.540> four<00:03:51.810> five<00:03:52.050> leads<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:53.960> they<00:03:54.960> will

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
two three four five leads and they will

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.220 
two three four five leads and they will
go<00:03:55.410> on<00:03:55.470> any<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.250> Spade<00:03:56.490> connectors<00:03:57.230> these

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
go on any of the Spade connectors these

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.200 
go on any of the Spade connectors these
female<00:03:58.770> connectors<00:04:01.550> if<00:04:02.550> you<00:04:02.760> should<00:04:02.970> need<00:04:03.150> to

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
female connectors if you should need to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.360 
female connectors if you should need to
change<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.690> pressure<00:04:03.900> valve<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.980> simply

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
change the pressure valve you simply

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.720 
change the pressure valve you simply
squeeze<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.330> back<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:06.750> which<00:04:06.930> one<00:04:07.110> hooks

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
squeeze the back of this which one hooks

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.610 
squeeze the back of this which one hooks
these<00:04:09.020> latches<00:04:10.020> here<00:04:10.680> see<00:04:11.430> how<00:04:11.520> it<00:04:11.640> works

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
these latches here see how it works

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.890 
these latches here see how it works
what<00:04:13.620> simple<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.780> then<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.870> can

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
what simple that is and then you can

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.720 
what simple that is and then you can
undo<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:16.410> take<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.799> one<00:04:17.010> screw<00:04:17.370> out<00:04:17.400> here

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
undo this take this one screw out here

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.950 
undo this take this one screw out here
on<00:04:17.940> flip<00:04:18.270> still<00:04:18.600> here<00:04:23.420> keep<00:04:24.420> your<00:04:24.540> parts<00:04:24.870> in

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
on flip still here keep your parts in

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.510 
on flip still here keep your parts in
the<00:04:25.080> box<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.970> then<00:04:27.180> underneath<00:04:28.160> just<00:04:29.160> remove

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
the box and then underneath just remove

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.840 
the box and then underneath just remove
this<00:04:29.790> house<00:04:30.060> from<00:04:30.330> underneath<00:04:30.660> here<00:04:31.670> this<00:04:32.670> is

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
this house from underneath here this is

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:40.820 
this house from underneath here this is
simply<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.500> pull<00:04:34.500> on<00:04:36.890> pull<00:04:37.890> off<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:40.410> there<00:04:40.710> we

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
simply I pull on pull off and there we

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.100 
simply I pull on pull off and there we
are<00:04:41.240> there's<00:04:42.240> your<00:04:42.390> pressure<00:04:42.600> switch<00:04:42.900> which

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
are there's your pressure switch which

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.330 
are there's your pressure switch which
you<00:04:43.290> can<00:04:43.440> now<00:04:43.650> replace<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:46.130> you've<00:04:47.130> got<00:04:47.280> all

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
you can now replace and you've got all

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.330 
you can now replace and you've got all
the<00:04:47.430> part<00:04:47.730> numbers<00:04:48.060> written<00:04:48.180> on<00:04:48.420> it<00:04:49.160> next<00:04:50.160> we

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
the part numbers written on it next we

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.090 
the part numbers written on it next we
look<00:04:50.520> at<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.700> water<00:04:51.000> inlet<00:04:51.600> solenoids<00:04:52.100> once

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
look at the water inlet solenoids once

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.220 
look at the water inlet solenoids once
again<00:04:53.370> now<00:04:54.150> again<00:04:54.420> take<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.660> picture<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.110> these

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
again now again take a picture of these

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.960 
again now again take a picture of these
solenoids<00:04:55.620> before<00:04:56.100> we<00:04:56.160> take<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.460> connections

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
solenoids before we take the connections

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.250 
solenoids before we take the connections
off<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:58.650> can<00:04:59.390> you<00:05:00.390> can<00:05:00.420> interchange<00:05:00.810> the

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
off and you can you can interchange the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.140 
off and you can you can interchange the
coils<00:05:02.120> if<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.270> want<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.510> test<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:04.050> see

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
coils if you want to test to see

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:16.190 
coils if you want to test to see
in<00:05:05.449> fact<00:05:05.780> they<00:05:05.930> told<00:05:06.169> to<00:05:06.350> call<00:05:06.590> you've<00:05:06.800> got
