hi<00:00:00.659> guys<00:00:00.840> here's<00:00:01.110> my<00:00:01.230> striker<00:00:01.680> f27<00:00:02.520> Q<00:00:02.790> I'm

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hi guys here's my striker f27 Q I'm

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.210 
hi guys here's my striker f27 Q I'm
upgrading<00:00:03.990> it<00:00:04.080> so<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.290> can<00:00:04.440> use<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> four<00:00:04.920> cell

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
upgrading it so we can use a four cell

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.309 
upgrading it so we can use a four cell
the<00:00:05.819> motor<00:00:06.060> doesn't<00:00:06.509> seem<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.870> get<00:00:06.960> very<00:00:07.020> hot

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
the motor doesn't seem to get very hot

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.960 
the motor doesn't seem to get very hot
I'm<00:00:07.529> thinking<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:07.950> can<00:00:08.040> handle<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.460> force<00:00:08.760> all

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
I'm thinking it can handle the force all

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.509 
I'm thinking it can handle the force all
I<00:00:09.000> might<00:00:09.210> change<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.660> prop<00:00:09.900> though<00:00:10.340> but<00:00:11.340> what

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
I might change the prop though but what

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.249 
I might change the prop though but what
I've<00:00:11.610> got<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.820> do<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.030> upgrade<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.480> 40<00:00:12.900> MPs

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
I've got to do is upgrade this 40 MPs

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.140 
I've got to do is upgrade this 40 MPs
see<00:00:13.469> each<00:00:13.559> was<00:00:13.740> 60<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.700> what<00:00:14.790> I've<00:00:14.880> done<00:00:15.000> here

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
see each was 60 so what I've done here

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.740 
see each was 60 so what I've done here
is<00:00:15.210> checking<00:00:15.480> off<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:17.730> cover<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.420> just

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
is checking off the the cover is just

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.230 
is checking off the the cover is just
one<00:00:18.930> screw<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.529> then<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.279> found<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> ESC

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
one screw and then I found that the ESC

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.640 
one screw and then I found that the ESC
is<00:00:21.270> only<00:00:21.570> held<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> strip<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> velcro
