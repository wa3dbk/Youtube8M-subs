00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.460
 carrefour has invited us to a group of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.930
 mothers and bloggers that we left the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.970
 back to school and his support in the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.040
 electronics seems to me an issue that generates 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.290
 fascination and concern to parties 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.290
 the same so he has happily accepted 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.220
 to those who have small children 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.930
 It is probably a topic that affects you 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.030
 less but when children attend 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.890
 more specifically as they go 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 advancing the new courses 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
 technologies acquire certain 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.309
 prominence the chalk slates go 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.050
 giving way to electronic whiteboards and 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.730
 the students every time they use 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.730
 plus the keyboard and minus the pencil 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.150
 a somewhat controversial question is to 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.230
 how old can we let them access 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
 these technologies 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.920
 I am not in favor of the use of 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.690
 early general electronics but 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.430
 well it is true that there is amount of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.290
 applications in the market that we can 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.290
 use on tablets like this 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.409
 applications that support both 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.539
 development of fine motor skills 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.840
 as of cognitive skills makes me 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.790
 logical reasoning 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.680
 the tablets should never exercise the role 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.330
 of a babysitter but with moderate use 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.340
 can be cataloged within a 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.149
 effective learning tool and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.290
 as playful they are also a resource 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.190
 infallible for children in case of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.200
 long trips I attest to this both in 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.820
 applications like video games is vital 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.860
 look at the age for which they are 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.229
 designed we can look at the code 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.070
 pegi considering its use suitable for children 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.750
 of 3 7 18 years 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.880
 in our own experience and with the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.200
 age of aar nine years become familiar 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.390
 with computers is a requirement 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.860
 indispensable within your hours 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.450
 teaching has the subject of 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.250
 computer, we are also 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.500
 often with duties that include 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.149
 Internet management maybe opt for a 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.280
 desktop computer would be the option 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.010
 ideal counting in addition with entities now 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.290
 to print all your works 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.000
 the ideal would be to place the computer in a 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.400
 common place but in any case the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.110
 best measure is supervision control 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.030
 both the use and the times the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.910
 experts recommend that children enter 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.530
 7 and 12 years do not exceed 2 hours at 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.490
 day in front of the screens we 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.560
 we go into 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.780
 delicate stage marked adolescence 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.820
 a need for autonomy within 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.590
 electronics symbol excellence 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.050
 of mobility and freedom is the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.600
 laptop taking a look by all 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.700
 those who find this here in 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.940
 concrete has seemed a super option 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.440
 useful since it combines a PC computer 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.440
 with keyboard with a tablet 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.770
 as parents we would like their use to be 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.510
 limited to a didactic and formative purpose 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.370
 however as teenagers they go to 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.200
 make use of social networks are going to 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.750
 drive online and they will visualize 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.580
 activate movies then activate 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.110
 parental control filters is 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.730
 super simple and this way 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.740
 we will prevent them from falling into pages 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.080
 inappropriate I hope that I have 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.150
 useful result this particular return to 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.430
 cole if you want me to continue sharing 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.860
 my tips ideas about going back to 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.320
 school or on any other subject 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.420
 you can continue seeing me in carrefour or 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.680
 on my own YouTube channel until the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.250
 next 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.250
 and
