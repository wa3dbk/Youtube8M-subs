 I 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.329
 Y 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.220
 at the beginning of the month of February of each 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.610
 year occurs in the city of copiapó 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.860
 an event of great importance 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.770
 for the thousands of Catholics of this 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.870
 arid region of northern Chile- the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.500
 feast of our lady of the 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.960
 Candelaria takes place in a 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.480
 religious sanctuary of urban character 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.989
 that with time and the advance of the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.030
 population has been assimilated to the heart 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.400
 same from the capital of the region of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.280
 atacama and that congregates great 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.890
 crowds of faithful on the days when 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.790
 the party takes place that has its 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.299
 peak around February 2 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.700
 party of the presentation of the Lord 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.290
 during the celebration of the candelaria 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.350
 we can witness a 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.950
 manifestation of faith that moves us 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.440
 religious dances many times not 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.680
 we understand the profound meaning of these 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.430
 religious dances we can think that 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.970
 they just want to get attention 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.330
 a touch of folklore or perhaps preserve 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.720
 religious pagan rites that have nothing 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.620
 what to do with faith in the only god but 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.810
 it is not like that nor is it as simple as it seems 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.750
 the reality of these dance fraternities 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.750
 it has a profound meaning for us 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.630
 People of God and therefore to 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.570
 our catholic church the dance 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.750
 religious is a concrete way of praising 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.960
 give thanks and be faithful to our 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.060
 promise made to lord jesus to the virgin 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.280
 Mary or some saint or saint in fact the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.679
 dancing is one of the most 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.200
 originals of each town the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.500
 religiosity to be an inherent part 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.860
 to human nature finds a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.680
 legitimate expression in dance the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.650
 manifestation of that religiosity it 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.709
 done in multiple ways since 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.070
 many years the catholic church shows 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.850
 a special concern for the forms 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.350
 of expression 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.440
 of popular piety in the world 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.380
 in the diocese of copiapó as in many 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.390
 others have traditionally been 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.690
 samples of support from the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.000
 pastors of the church to this and other 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.540
 legitimate signs of faith of the people of 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.240

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.270
