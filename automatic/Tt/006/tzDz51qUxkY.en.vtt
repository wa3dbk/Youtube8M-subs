00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.769
 she thought again in black-red-gold 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.630
 Of course that situation anyway 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.580

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.540
 heard and believed this announcement 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.040
 of course forgotten 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.930
 but far from that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.250
 black-red-golden donuts have now been 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.260
 several times already 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.910
 but honestly that would be nonsense us 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.110
 would just the same recipe with just 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 bake other colors 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.489

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.980
 vanilla sugar quark butter fruit whey 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.040
 You can, however, on whey without fruit 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.170
 Use additive We build sugar 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.480
 butter cookies magazine also through 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.490

 raspberries wanted to prepare next to it 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.600
 mango and blueberries first we go 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.210
 The butter biscuits are a frozen bag 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.380
 to press something with your hands 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.450
 then work on it extensively with one 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.970
 dough roll until you are completely 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.890
 crumbled then we pour them 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.090
 the liquid butter and mix 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.090
 everything thoroughly together 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.590
 we prepare a baking dish by ourselves 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.690
 grease the cattle and the soil with 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.000
 Baking paper now give the biscuit 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.360
 crumb massa on it distribute this 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.440
 evenly and squeeze with the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.790
 Hold on tight to the ground for 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.590
 at least half an hour cool 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.880
 put 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.820
 we give the cream in a suitable 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.510
 vessel and hit it there for the first time 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.880
 cool place 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.780
 to the fruit whey we put a pot 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.670
 have given 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.910
 we pour the man without sugar the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.300
 sugar and then stir the agile 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.709
 1 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.170
 briefly with the whisk 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.970
 go through and then warm slightly 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.100
 then take from the stove 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.970
 Let cool liquid is then 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.709
 a little tougher 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.500
 but before she really starts to tight 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.600
 we'll put in the quark and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.130
 Listen to this powerfully until he himself 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.650
 in the liquid completely with 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.060
 has dissolved and we only give the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.580
 stiff whipped cream 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.820
 I do this in two portions and yeast 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.550
 she under and intelligent wise next 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.280
 better in bigger pot than me 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.989
 The ground is now cooled and firm 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.739
 that we now dug the prepared ones 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.230
 give to it 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.320
 We distribute these and emphasize the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.760
 Smooth then cool again and for 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.560
 at least one hour 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.260
 yes and what is still to come is actually 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.920
 diligence and yours 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.299
 Design options are not here 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.400
 set limits I start to 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.260
 Orientation so he can circle 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.239
 from blueberries you too should 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.680
 mango must use the before 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.840
 naturally peeled and cut 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.430
 just like that is going to be easy 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.950
 is there a video on me in the end 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.750
 and in the infobox perlinger also the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.400
 raspberries get their place and for 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.510
 I do not decide the outer circle 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.920
 be negotiated again 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.989
 only the dead bus after 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.030
 Prepare the package instructions and then 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.739
 Swiftly spread over the fruits 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.110
 these are completely covered 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.910
 because let's get stuck and then 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.400
 may the host and summer 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.200
 fruity bm tart to be eaten 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.600
 you will be able to tell by the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.160
 with the brand prepares Kramer stops 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.440
