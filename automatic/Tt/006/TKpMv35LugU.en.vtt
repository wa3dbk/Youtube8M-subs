but<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.290> not<00:02:04.500> did<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:05.579> sure<00:02:05.909> it

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
but I have not did this but I'm sure it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.660 
but I have not did this but I'm sure it
will<00:02:06.329> work<00:02:06.469> I'm<00:02:07.469> sure<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> will<00:02:08.129> work<00:02:08.340> if<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
will work I'm sure it will work if it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.490 
will work I'm sure it will work if it
doesn't<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.330> could<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:09.810> put<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.349> back

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
doesn't then you could just put it back

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.270 
doesn't then you could just put it back
the<00:02:10.679> way<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.640> could<00:02:12.239> try

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the way it was but you could try

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.030 
the way it was but you could try
using<00:02:13.730> what's<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.720> called<00:02:15.370> bumblebees<00:02:16.370> hands

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
using what's it called bumblebees hands

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.559 
using what's it called bumblebees hands
so<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.130> can<00:02:19.310> see<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.940> like<00:02:20.810> getting<00:02:21.709> them
