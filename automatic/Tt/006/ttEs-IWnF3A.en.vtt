will notice these ravioli have actually
flipped<00:03:01.540> upside<00:03:01.960> down<00:03:01.990> so<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:04.770> convex<00:03:05.770> part

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
flipped upside down so the convex part

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.670 
flipped upside down so the convex part
of<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.280> ravioli<00:03:06.640> is<00:03:06.700> now<00:03:06.850> facing<00:03:07.120> down<00:03:07.680> once

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.320 
it hits that hot oil now the ravioli are
going<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.340> flip<00:03:12.520> over<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.940> they're<00:03:13.210> gonna

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
going to flip over and they're gonna

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.840 
going to flip over and they're gonna
start<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.780> float<00:03:14.050> when<00:03:14.710> that<00:03:14.890> happens<00:03:15.550> you

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
start to float when that happens you

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.850 
start to float when that happens you
will<00:03:16.000> know<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.210> this<00:03:16.570> time<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.440> remove<00:03:17.740> it

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
will know that this time to remove it

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.550 
will know that this time to remove it
from<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.220> oil<00:03:18.570> what<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.600> will<00:03:19.870> do<00:03:20.110> though<00:03:20.320> right

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
from the oil what I will do though right

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.630 
from the oil what I will do though right
now<00:03:20.740> is<00:03:21.010> I'm<00:03:21.220> gonna<00:03:21.340> give<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.790> little<00:03:22.000> nudge

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
now is I'm gonna give it a little nudge

now is I'm gonna give it a little nudge
with<00:03:24.640> my<00:03:24.880> spider<00:03:25.360> because<00:03:25.930> sometimes<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.590> can

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
with my spider because sometimes it can

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.120 
with my spider because sometimes it can
stick<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.190> bottom<00:03:27.490> of<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.700> pan<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.330> have<00:03:29.140> or

use it once when I fry so that's why I

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.430
