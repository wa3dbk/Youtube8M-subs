00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
pretty average it's enough to kind of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.549 
pretty average it's enough to kind of
round<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.539> rougher<00:00:45.899> spots<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
round out the the rougher spots on the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
weapon improve the proved the poor spots

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.529 
weapon improve the proved the poor spots
but<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:49.980> enough<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> take<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> crazy

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
but not enough to take it to a crazy

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.600 
but not enough to take it to a crazy
range<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.800> are<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> ones<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
range here are the ones you get for it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.610 
range here are the ones you get for it
as<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.420> barrel<00:00:54.660> extension<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.289> good<00:00:55.469> for

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
as the barrel extension is good for

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.819 
as the barrel extension is good for
increasing<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.160> damage<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:57.270> grip<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.829> stock

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
increasing the damage for grip and stock

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.189 
increasing the damage for grip and stock
can<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.609> some<00:00:59.820> improvements<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:01.050> well

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
can get you some improvements as well

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.110 
can get you some improvements as well
that<00:01:01.410> you're<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.680> need<00:01:01.879> stability<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
that you're going to need stability is

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.149 
that you're going to need stability is
meant<00:01:03.420> at<00:01:03.660> 12<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.769> single

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
meant at 12 you can see with a single

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
meant at 12 you can see with a single
shot<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.700> put<00:01:05.850> together<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.180> pretty<00:01:06.630> good

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
shot you can put together a pretty good

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.710 
shot you can put together a pretty good
size<00:01:07.590> group<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.760> full<00:01:09.000> auto<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.450> kind<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
size group but on full auto it's kind of

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.060 
size group but on full auto it's kind of
all<00:01:09.810> over<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.110> place<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.710> got<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> really

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
all over the place so you got to really

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
all over the place so you got to really
watch<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:11.970> shots<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> weapon

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
watch your shots with this weapon

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.370 
watch your shots with this weapon
accuracy<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.600> gonna<00:01:15.810> give<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> poor

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
accuracy on it I'm gonna give it a poor

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.640 
accuracy on it I'm gonna give it a poor
that's<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.479> 10/10<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.509> usually<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> low<00:01:19.229> end<00:01:19.470> of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
that's a 10/10 is usually the low end of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.109 
that's a 10/10 is usually the low end of
all<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> assault<00:01:20.159> rifles<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> average<00:01:20.970> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
all the assault rifles the average of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.899 
all the assault rifles the average of
being<00:01:21.330> 12<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.500> higher<00:01:22.710> range<00:01:23.070> being<00:01:23.400> 14

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
being 12 and the higher range being 14

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.399 
being 12 and the higher range being 14
or<00:01:24.030> 16<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> 10<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:27.140> pretty<00:01:28.140> good

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
or 16 so at a 10 you can do pretty good

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.499 
or 16 so at a 10 you can do pretty good
anything<00:01:28.860> indoors<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.670> gonna<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.000> fine<00:01:30.210> but

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
anything indoors is gonna be fine but

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.580 
anything indoors is gonna be fine but
outdoors<00:01:30.990> you're<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.409> some

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
outdoors you're going to have some

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.039 
outdoors you're going to have some
problems<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.400> as<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> see

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
problems with it as you can see

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.319 
problems with it as you can see
eventually<00:01:34.049> got<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.500> bulb<00:01:34.909> accuracy<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.150> be

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
eventually got that bulb accuracy can be

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.399 
eventually got that bulb accuracy can be
improved<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.689> mods<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> highly

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
improved with mods and I highly

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.410 
improved with mods and I highly
recommend<00:01:37.530> taking<00:01:38.520> some<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> mods<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
recommend taking some of the mods that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
recommend taking some of the mods that
will<00:01:39.630> improve<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> accuracy<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.979> because

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
will improve the accuracy on it because

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
will improve the accuracy on it because
that'll<00:01:41.369> take<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:41.850> from<00:01:42.570> 10<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.200> into

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
that'll take it up from 10 and up into

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.740 
that'll take it up from 10 and up into
the<00:01:43.590> 12<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.399> 14<00:01:44.729> where<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.180> actually<00:01:45.570> use

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the 12 and 14 where you can actually use

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.440 
the 12 and 14 where you can actually use
it<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:46.439> reliably<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:48.000> forget<00:01:48.180> every

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it more reliably and don't forget every

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.330 
it more reliably and don't forget every
shot<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.899> missed<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.350> zero<00:01:49.619> damage<00:01:49.829> so

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
shot that you missed at zero damage so

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
shot that you missed at zero damage so
you<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.450> may<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.899> high<00:01:52.049> damage

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you know you may have a high damage

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.780 
you know you may have a high damage
weapon<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.250> will<00:01:53.369> need<00:01:53.610> those

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
weapon but you really will need those

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.149 
weapon but you really will need those
shots<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.149> hit<00:01:54.530> as<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.799> see<00:01:55.920> here<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.130> does

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
shots to hit as you can see here it does

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.280 
shots to hit as you can see here it does
a<00:01:56.280> pretty<00:01:56.399> good<00:01:56.549> job<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:57.000> opening<00:01:57.659> doors<00:01:57.689> as

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
a pretty good job with opening doors as

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.170 
a pretty good job with opening doors as
well<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.159> let's<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.520> how<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> does<00:01:59.790> on<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
well so let's see how it does on the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.770 
well so let's see how it does on the
move

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.810 

well<00:02:03.780> that's<00:02:04.500> okay<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> move<00:02:05.190> not<00:02:05.460> great

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
well that's okay on the move not great

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.590 
well that's okay on the move not great
I'm<00:02:06.420> gonna<00:02:06.570> give<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:07.520> rating<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.450> see

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
I'm gonna give it a rating you can see

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.450 
I'm gonna give it a rating you can see
here<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.960> rounds<00:02:10.290> are<00:02:10.380> kind<00:02:10.650> of<00:02:10.770> little<00:02:11.400> all

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
here the rounds are kind of little all

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.830 
here the rounds are kind of little all
over<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.730> place<00:02:11.820> they'll<00:02:12.270> hit<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> man-sized

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
over the place they'll hit a man-sized

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.810 
over the place they'll hit a man-sized
target<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.380> they<00:02:13.470> won't<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:14.160> exactly<00:02:14.700> where

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
target but they won't be exactly where

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.190 
target but they won't be exactly where
you<00:02:14.940> want<00:02:15.150> them<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.330> be<00:02:15.510> at<00:02:15.630> least<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.930> full

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
you want them to be at least on full

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.720 
you want them to be at least on full
auto<00:02:16.380> again<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.860> would<00:02:17.130> recommend<00:02:17.520> not<00:02:17.550> using

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
auto again I would recommend not using

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.240 
auto again I would recommend not using
this<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.360> full<00:02:18.600> auto<00:02:18.780> try<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.590> go<00:02:19.740> single-shot

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
this on full auto try to go single-shot

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.160 
this on full auto try to go single-shot
and<00:02:20.580> keep<00:02:20.760> your<00:02:20.910> bursts<00:02:21.240> really<00:02:21.660> really<00:02:21.900> small

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
and keep your bursts really really small

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.290 
and keep your bursts really really small

but if you've watched my reviews of the
M<00:02:38.130> 308<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.820> other<00:02:39.000> high<00:02:39.210> accuracy<00:02:39.750> weapons

M 308 and other high accuracy weapons

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.030 
M 308 and other high accuracy weapons
you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.350> see<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.680> put<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.890> lot<00:02:40.980> more

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you can see I can put a lot more

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.490 
you can see I can put a lot more
headshots<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.880> rather<00:02:42.780> than<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.320> getting

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
headshots on rather than just getting

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.460 
headshots on rather than just getting
you<00:02:44.160> know<00:02:44.280> half<00:02:44.700> head<00:02:45.030> half<00:02:45.300> body<00:02:45.600> shots<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
you know half head half body shots and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.200 
you know half head half body shots and
that<00:02:46.560> makes<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.950> big<00:02:47.520> difference<00:02:47.850> as<00:02:48.000> far<00:02:48.030> as

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
that makes a big difference as far as

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.790 
that makes a big difference as far as
how<00:02:48.450> much<00:02:48.600> damage<00:02:48.900> are<00:02:49.140> actually<00:02:49.440> doing<00:02:49.710> in

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
how much damage are actually doing in

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.330 
how much damage are actually doing in
the<00:02:49.830> end<00:02:50.840> overall<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.020> like<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.440> weapon<00:02:52.800> it's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
the end overall I like this weapon it's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.140 
the end overall I like this weapon it's
one<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.730> my<00:02:53.820> more<00:02:54.030> preferred<00:02:55.940> weapons<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
one of my more preferred weapons in the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.510 
one of my more preferred weapons in the
game<00:02:57.180> if<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.140> don't<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.710> DLC<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.430> you

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
game if you don't have the DLC and you

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.070 
game if you don't have the DLC and you
can't<00:02:59.760> get<00:02:59.910> access<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.600> Eagle<00:03:00.870> heavy

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
can't get access to the Eagle heavy

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.100 
can't get access to the Eagle heavy
which<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.530> another<00:03:01.740> high<00:03:02.010> damage<00:03:03.110> assault

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
which is another high damage assault

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.920 
which is another high damage assault
rifle<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.620> would<00:03:04.830> recommend<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.340> 760<00:03:05.880> -<00:03:06.000> it's<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
rifle I would recommend the 760 - it's a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.960 
rifle I would recommend the 760 - it's a
good<00:03:07.230> high<00:03:07.680> damage<00:03:09.590> high<00:03:10.590> threat<00:03:10.980> weapon<00:03:11.340> not

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
good high damage high threat weapon not

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.190 
good high damage high threat weapon not
something<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.330> really<00:03:12.360> want<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.780> stealthy

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
something you really want to be stealthy

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.699 
something you really want to be stealthy
with<00:03:14.570> certainly<00:03:15.570> gets<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> job<00:03:16.050> done<00:03:16.110> has

with certainly gets the job done has

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.690 
with certainly gets the job done has
enough<00:03:17.010> ammo<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:19.440> allow<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.340> miss<00:03:20.520> some

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
enough ammo to to allow you to miss some
