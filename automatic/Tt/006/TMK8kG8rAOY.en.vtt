00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello to all today we will see 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.849
 how to make a brioche stressed so 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:18.150
 we start by dissolving the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.840
 yeast in a little warm milk in the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.000
 robot bowl 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:29.550
 I put the flour powdered sugar on 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.470
 vanilla sugar and salt I mix all 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 these dry ingredients then I make a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.280
 well in the middle to have 9 2 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.879
 tablespoons of flower water 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.610
 orange 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.899
 can also be perfumed with zest 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.899
 lemon or orange my measure and east 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.949
 we will mix all that and then we will knead 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.420
 either by hand or by robot until 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.420
 we have a very flexible reach 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.799
 now we will add the butter 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.290
 must be either bounced and then have 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:13.509
 continued kneading to incorporate it into the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:16.180
 dough as you can see in the end 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.960
 you get a pianism paw that is 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.539
 a bit sticky 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.640
 we will cover her and she left him up 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.509
 for an hour until she 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.220
 double volume 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.640
 it will have to be placed in a place 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.649
 warm away from drafts so 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.119
 there the leg has risen well I'm going to 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.360
 cast off to chase nerves that there 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.360
 in 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.270
 the workshop I place the dough in a dish 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.520
 I will cover it with a movie 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.560
 food and I'm going to put it to 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.530
 fresh you can year it's at 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.820
 least two hours to where everything 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.010
 united if it's possible 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.570
 letting the dough cool but 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.440
 gives strength and therefore the brioche 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.440
 will be better 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.310
 arrange the dough on a work plan 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 which is lightly floured then 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.270
 start to the euro is to form a 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.790
 boudin that is at home that we will 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.230
 divide into three sticks we will try 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.230
 to be about the same size 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.190
 look each morning to form three 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.190
 boudin that measures 60 to 70 cm in length 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.220
 solder the ends of the three buddhas 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.550
 together before starting to form a 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.550
 creche 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.410
 arrange the press on the oven plate 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.570
 in parchment paper and then you 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.540
 basting 1 2 egg yolks 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:47.290
 we'll let her up for 40 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.200
 minutes to an hour after we go 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.450
 preheat the oven to 180 degrees then 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.570
 once again smeared the press 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.370
 with the egg yolk 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.180
 then we can decorate with either 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.340
 grains on top or sesame seeds 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.700
 so we'll bake and let it cook 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.860
 for 25 to 30 minutes depending on and oven 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.040
 until the brioche is well 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.590
 after being allowed to cool on a 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.600
 grid before going to tasting 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.040
 it's a grid in turkey and well 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.330
 scented with neither streaking and hating and 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.610
 that we can taste for a good little 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.150
 lunch or a drop 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.150
 Now it's your turn
