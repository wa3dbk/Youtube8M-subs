00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
very small holes that that produces the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.339 
very small holes that that produces the

getting shiny just helps a lot and I've

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.039 
getting shiny just helps a lot and I've
gone<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.980> month<00:02:36.340> without<00:02:36.670> using<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.720> toner

moisturizer so I tried this and I've
been<00:03:52.959> using<00:03:53.109> this<00:03:53.470> um<00:03:53.829> every<00:03:54.639> day<00:03:54.819> in<00:03:55.120> the

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
been using this um every day in the

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.620 
been using this um every day in the
morning<00:03:55.419> not<00:03:56.019> at<00:03:56.230> night<00:03:56.380> because<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:57.599> feel<00:03:58.599> like

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
morning not at night because I feel like

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.589 
morning not at night because I feel like
this<00:03:59.079> acts<00:03:59.349> more<00:03:59.889> like<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.370> sunblock<00:04:01.000> or<00:04:01.389> like<00:04:01.569> a

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
this acts more like a sunblock or like a

sun protected rather than a moisturizer

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.809 
sun protected rather than a moisturizer
because<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:05.500> doesn't<00:04:05.889> actually<00:04:06.010> moisturize

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819
