00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.200
 we are in a new studio class fishing 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.610
 31 where we will remove the continuation of our 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.540
 practical lessons on how to work with 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.549
 studio lighting 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.619
 this new big studio have cyclorams 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.300
 11 and a half meters long as well 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.340
 several locations for shooting with different 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.439
 The backgrounds also have various kg visits 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.080
 cheerful administrator as well as tea coffee 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.869
 and free wifi and in today's 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.890
 shooting we will help model Natasha 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.660
 Now we will work with two 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.180
 light sources one of which 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.219
 draw and the second fill to start 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:43.110
 we insert the source of the drawing light in 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:44.460
 random order to begin with we 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.200
 let's make a couple of shots with just one 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.820
 light source so that they can 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.820
 further evaluate the cut-off pattern 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.140
 in order to soften the shadow on the face 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.820
 models we will use the second 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.770
 the source of which will be with us 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.510
 filler sources filler 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.140
 lights most often protrude large 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.750
 soft box 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:44.620
 but in this case it must be oktaboks 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:46.390
 put behind the photographer 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.010
 do if for example you do not have big 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.900
 soft box can use 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.990
 improvised means in this case 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.840
 white wall just rented light 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.210
 modifier neatly direct 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.240
 device into the wall and you customize 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.930
 power and now a couple of test 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.930
 photos 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.030
 from 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.740
 true this option can fill 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.740
 give you a hard shadow behind the model 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.140
 source location 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.970
 light is very important because it can 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:42.060
 significantly affect the beauty of glare 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:43.380
 eyes of your model filling 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.210
 used to soften 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.860
 shadows and on your model or highlight 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.360
 removes some details with two 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.070
 light sources are almost as easy 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.210
 as with one main little bit 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.210
 practice up
