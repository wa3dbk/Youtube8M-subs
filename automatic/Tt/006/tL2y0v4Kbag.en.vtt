that's<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.760> most<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.240> us<00:01:09.330> used<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.760> so

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

we<00:01:11.909> were<00:01:12.060> doing<00:01:12.299> an<00:01:12.420> experimental<00:01:13.080> looking<00:01:13.530> at

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
we were doing an experimental looking at

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.880 
we were doing an experimental looking at
where<00:01:14.580> sap<00:01:15.060> comes<00:01:15.600> from<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.530> tree

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
particularly under vacuum we we

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
particularly under vacuum we we
understand<00:01:19.470> quite<00:01:19.680> well<00:01:19.920> how<00:01:20.700> sap<00:01:21.030> moves<00:01:21.270> in

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
understand quite well how sap moves in

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.260 
understand quite well how sap moves in
trees<00:01:21.750> normally<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.520> vacuum<00:01:23.759> we're

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
trees normally but with vacuum we're

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
trees normally but with vacuum we're
moving<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> sap<00:01:25.170> around<00:01:25.619> quite<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> bit<00:01:26.159> more

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
moving the sap around quite a bit more

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.130 
moving the sap around quite a bit more
so<00:01:26.729> during<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> course<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so during the course of that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.280 
so during the course of that
investigation<00:01:28.970> we<00:01:29.970> found<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.229> least

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
investigation we found that for at least

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.980 
investigation we found that for at least
part<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> flow<00:01:32.430> period<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.479> were<00:01:33.659> pulling

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
part of the flow period we were pulling

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.170 
part of the flow period we were pulling
water<00:01:34.409> right<00:01:34.799> out<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> ground<00:01:35.460> through

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
water right out of the ground through

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.660 
water right out of the ground through
the<00:01:36.360> roots<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:37.320> through<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> stem<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the roots up through the stem and out of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.600 
the roots up through the stem and out of
the<00:01:38.759> tap<00:01:39.000> hole<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:40.500> doing<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> we

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the tap hole and in doing that we

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.609 
the tap hole and in doing that we
decided<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.659> were<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.020> fact<00:01:43.229> true

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
decided that if that were in fact true

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.660 
decided that if that were in fact true
that<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> top<00:01:44.790> became<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.750> material<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that the top became a material and so to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.060 
that the top became a material and so to
test<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.570> went<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.960> cut<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> top<00:01:49.530> off<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
test that we went and cut the top off a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.880 
test that we went and cut the top off a
small<00:01:50.369> tree<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.030> started<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.049> pull<00:01:52.259> vacuum<00:01:52.770> on

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
small tree and started to pull vacuum on

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.980 
small tree and started to pull vacuum on
it<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.250> collect<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> sap<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> found<00:01:54.750> out

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
it to collect the sap and and found out

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.010 
it to collect the sap and and found out
that<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.259> could<00:01:55.430> in<00:01:56.430> fact<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.969> quite<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> good

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
that we could in fact get quite a good

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.569 
that we could in fact get quite a good

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
final say over time I think the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.180 
final say over time I think the
plantation<00:04:40.990> method<00:04:41.320> is<00:04:41.410> probably<00:04:41.860> going<00:04:42.070> to

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
plantation method is probably going to

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.690 
plantation method is probably going to
become<00:04:42.460> more<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:42.760> more<00:04:43.710> commonplace<00:04:44.710> it's

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
become more and more commonplace it's

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.220 
become more and more commonplace it's
going<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.000> take<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.150> long<00:04:46.360> period<00:04:46.630> of<00:04:46.810> time<00:04:46.960> it's

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
going to take a long period of time it's

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.080 
going to take a long period of time it's
not<00:04:47.350> going<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.650> happen<00:04:47.800> overnight<00:04:48.190> it's

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
not going to happen overnight it's

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.360 
not going to happen overnight it's
similar<00:04:49.750> in<00:04:49.900> many<00:04:50.020> ways<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.320> lots<00:04:51.010> of<00:04:51.250> other

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
similar in many ways to lots of other

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.850 
similar in many ways to lots of other
crops<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:51.970> if<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.150> look<00:04:52.300> at<00:04:52.450> vineyards<00:04:52.870> very

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
crops so if you look at vineyards very

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.290 
crops so if you look at vineyards very
very<00:04:54.130> different<00:04:54.460> than<00:04:54.580> they<00:04:54.670> were<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.880> long

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
very different than they were a long

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.880

different<00:04:58.360> new<00:04:58.540> technology<00:04:59.140> changing<00:04:59.710> all

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
different new technology changing all

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.560 
different new technology changing all
the<00:04:59.950> time<00:05:01.980> Christmas<00:05:02.980> tree<00:05:03.310> plantations<00:05:03.940> if

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
the time Christmas tree plantations if

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.210 
the time Christmas tree plantations if
you<00:05:04.720> would<00:05:04.810> ask<00:05:04.930> your<00:05:05.170> grandfather<00:05:05.650> about

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
you would ask your grandfather about

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.340 
you would ask your grandfather about
going<00:05:07.090> kind<00:05:07.390> of<00:05:07.450> Christmas<00:05:07.810> tree<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.140> would

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
going kind of Christmas tree you would

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.050 
going kind of Christmas tree you would
not<00:05:08.530> have<00:05:08.680> gone<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:08.860> a<00:05:09.010> plantation<00:05:09.640> there<00:05:09.790> they

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
not have gone to a plantation there they

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.990 
not have gone to a plantation there they
just<00:05:10.090> didn't<00:05:10.540> exist<00:05:10.690> back<00:05:11.170> then<00:05:11.230> and<00:05:11.710> now<00:05:12.160> it's

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
just didn't exist back then and now it's

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.330 
just didn't exist back then and now it's
a<00:05:13.150> very<00:05:13.390> strong<00:05:14.260> tradition<00:05:14.500> for<00:05:14.950> people<00:05:14.980> to<00:05:15.250> go

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
a very strong tradition for people to go

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.070 
a very strong tradition for people to go
out<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:15.580> cut<00:05:15.760> their<00:05:15.910> Christmas<00:05:16.270> trees<00:05:16.510> in<00:05:16.930> a

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
out and cut their Christmas trees in a

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.500 
out and cut their Christmas trees in a
plantation<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:18.340> so<00:05:18.580> just<00:05:18.790> over<00:05:19.060> a<00:05:19.090> couple<00:05:19.300> of

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
plantation and so just over a couple of

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.470 
plantation and so just over a couple of
generations<00:05:19.840> things<00:05:20.410> change<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:22.210> we<00:05:22.300> don't

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
generations things change and we don't

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.850 
generations things change and we don't
really<00:05:22.630> perceive<00:05:23.140> them<00:05:23.380> because<00:05:23.710> they're

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
really perceive them because they're

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.350 
really perceive them because they're
happening<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.520> over<00:05:24.880> that<00:05:25.030> kind<00:05:25.240> of

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
happening and over that kind of

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.430 
happening and over that kind of
timeframe<00:05:25.600> but<00:05:26.080> they<00:05:26.200> do<00:05:26.260> change<00:05:26.860> quite<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.730> lot

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
timeframe but they do change quite a lot

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.130 
timeframe but they do change quite a lot
