major<00:02:08.860> parts<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.459> dig<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:10.209> first<00:02:10.479> is

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
major parts of a dig the first is

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.500 
major parts of a dig the first is
prospecting<00:02:11.709> Hey<00:02:12.430> look<00:02:12.670> at<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.970> I've<00:02:13.209> gotten

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
prospecting Hey look at that I've gotten

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.570 
prospecting Hey look at that I've gotten
these<00:02:13.599> look<00:02:13.870> angled<00:02:14.200> prospecting<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.160> looking

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
these look angled prospecting is looking

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.790 
these look angled prospecting is looking
around<00:02:15.670> or<00:02:16.240> carefully<00:02:16.750> observing<00:02:17.140> your<00:02:17.380> area

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
around or carefully observing your area

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.130 
around or carefully observing your area
for<00:02:18.099> bone<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.550> objects<00:02:19.060> walking<00:02:19.810> around<00:02:20.050> the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
for bone like objects walking around the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.050 
for bone like objects walking around the
hillside<00:02:20.620> we<00:02:20.980> look<00:02:21.190> for<00:02:21.400> scattered<00:02:21.880> or

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
hillside we look for scattered or

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.420 
hillside we look for scattered or
possibly<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.870> single<00:02:23.260> bone<00:02:23.560> or<00:02:23.890> fractus

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
possibly just a single bone or fractus

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.510 
possibly just a single bone or fractus
is<00:02:24.580> what<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:25.090> consider<00:02:25.959> scatter<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.739> what<00:02:27.400> we

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
is what I consider scatter and what we

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.790 
is what I consider scatter and what we
do<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:27.849> follow<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.360> up<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.750> there's<00:02:29.620> more

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
do is we follow it up and there's more

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.680 
do is we follow it up and there's more
bone<00:02:30.010> up<00:02:30.160> there<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.760> who<00:02:31.150> knows<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.540> may

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
bone up there so who knows it may

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.220 
bone up there so who knows it may
continue<00:02:32.050> further<00:02:32.590> up<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.690> find<00:02:34.989> something

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
continue further up if we find something

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.500 
continue further up if we find something
of<00:02:35.500> interest<00:02:35.650> we<00:02:36.610> look<00:02:36.849> at<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.120> more<00:02:37.330> closely

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
of interest we look at it more closely

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.190 
of interest we look at it more closely
we<00:02:38.500> carefully<00:02:38.800> dig<00:02:39.280> around<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.700> object

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
we carefully dig around the object

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.630 
we carefully dig around the object
exposing<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.349> without<00:02:41.920> harming<00:02:42.430> or

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
exposing it without harming or

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.000 
exposing it without harming or
disturbing<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.300> that's<00:02:43.900> right<00:02:44.170> yeah

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
disturbing it that's right yeah

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.660 
disturbing it that's right yeah
sandstone<00:02:46.560> that's<00:02:47.560> right<00:02:47.890> well<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.340> might<00:02:48.640> have

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
sandstone that's right well I might have

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.180 
sandstone that's right well I might have
found<00:02:48.879> something<00:02:49.299> else<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:50.620> looks<00:02:50.950> exactly

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
found something else it looks exactly

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.170 
found something else it looks exactly
the<00:02:51.610> same<00:02:51.720> usually<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:53.709> growth<00:02:54.489> won't<00:02:54.909> be

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
the same usually this growth won't be

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.600 
the same usually this growth won't be
hanging<00:02:55.629> on<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.250> rock

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
hanging on to a rock

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.809 
hanging on to a rock
it'll<00:02:57.909> be<00:02:58.000> hanging<00:02:58.330> on<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.599> bone<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.190> I'm<00:03:00.610> not

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
it'll be hanging on to a bone so I'm not

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.300 
it'll be hanging on to a bone so I'm not
sure<00:03:00.879> I<00:03:01.390> think<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.780> should<00:03:01.959> ask<00:03:02.140> Eric<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.129> come

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
sure I think I should ask Eric to come

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.640 
sure I think I should ask Eric to come
over<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.640> take<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.299> look<00:03:04.569> at<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:09.000> yes<00:03:10.650> maybe

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
over and take a look at this yes maybe

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.699 
over and take a look at this yes maybe
yeah<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.220> think<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.110> usually<00:03:17.319> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
yeah I think so this is usually the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.130 
yeah I think so this is usually the
indication<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.430> me<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:19.269> growth<00:03:19.569> on<00:03:19.599> air

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
indication to me is this growth on air

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.229 
indication to me is this growth on air
yeah<00:03:20.769> that's<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.340> spell<00:03:21.610> it's<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.819> piece<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.000> bone

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
yeah that's a spell it's a piece of bone

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.660 
yeah that's a spell it's a piece of bone
it's<00:03:23.109> definitely<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> piece<00:03:23.650> of<00:03:23.799> bone<00:03:23.920> once

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
it's definitely a piece of bone once

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.849 
it's definitely a piece of bone once
something<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.209> identified<00:03:25.780> as<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.959> bone<00:03:26.260> we

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
something is identified as a bone we

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.640 
something is identified as a bone we
start<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.250> process<00:03:27.489> called<00:03:28.060> quarry<00:03:28.629> Corrine<00:03:29.440> is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
start a process called quarry Corrine is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.190 
start a process called quarry Corrine is
digging<00:03:30.459> around<00:03:30.579> the<00:03:30.790> fossil<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.450> expose<00:03:31.959> it

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
digging around the fossil to expose it

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.110 
digging around the fossil to expose it
and<00:03:32.319> to<00:03:32.829> see<00:03:33.040> if<00:03:33.160> there<00:03:33.340> are<00:03:33.370> other<00:03:33.459> bones

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
and to see if there are other bones

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.869 
and to see if there are other bones
around<00:03:34.829> there<00:03:35.829> are<00:03:35.950> very<00:03:36.160> important<00:03:36.549> parts<00:03:36.819> of

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
around there are very important parts of

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.809 
around there are very important parts of
this<00:03:36.940> process<00:03:37.349> including<00:03:38.349> first<00:03:39.310> marking<00:03:39.730> the

this process including first marking the

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.509 
this process including first marking the
object's<00:03:40.299> exact<00:03:40.750> location<00:03:41.379> we<00:03:41.920> do<00:03:42.099> this<00:03:42.250> using

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
object's exact location we do this using

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.750 
object's exact location we do this using
GPS<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:44.109> ensures<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.799> we<00:03:45.069> always<00:03:45.340> know

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
GPS this ensures that we always know

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
GPS this ensures that we always know
precisely<00:03:46.299> where<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.170> bone<00:03:47.379> was<00:03:47.590> found<00:03:48.780> then

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
precisely where the bone was found then

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.170 
precisely where the bone was found then

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
as much dirt as possible needs to be

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.680 
as much dirt as possible needs to be
removed<00:03:52.480> without<00:03:52.780> disturbing<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.590> bone<00:03:57.690> we

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
removed without disturbing the bone we

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.659 
removed without disturbing the bone we
then<00:03:58.900> apply<00:03:59.230> coats<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.859> liquid<00:04:00.220> plastic

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
then apply coats of a liquid plastic

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.520 
then apply coats of a liquid plastic
called<00:04:00.910> vine<00:04:01.239> ACK<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.989> stabilize<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.829> fossil
