00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
the privy instructions I cut out a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.770 
the privy instructions I cut out a
little<00:02:33.650> bit<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.070> little<00:02:34.550> tab<00:02:34.820> on<00:02:35.090> each<00:02:35.630> of

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
little bit of a little tab on each of

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.010 
little bit of a little tab on each of
the<00:02:35.870> guards<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:37.580> then<00:02:37.820> made<00:02:38.210> out<00:02:38.570> one<00:02:38.870> or<00:02:38.990> two

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
the guards and then made out one or two

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.370 
the guards and then made out one or two
inch<00:02:39.290> overlap<00:02:39.620> between<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:40.040> two<00:02:40.070> just<00:02:40.610> to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
inch overlap between the two just to

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.470 
inch overlap between the two just to
create<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.410> good<00:02:42.560> seal<00:02:42.860> between<00:02:43.250> between<00:02:43.970> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
create a good seal between between the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.450 
create a good seal between between the
interlocking<00:02:45.200> parts<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:46.100> work<00:02:46.250> right

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
interlocking parts and that work right

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.220 
interlocking parts and that work right
so<00:02:46.970> very<00:02:47.480> very<00:02:47.600> happy<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:50.540> is<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.810> second

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
found it they're just a little bit of a

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.630 
found it they're just a little bit of a
little<00:02:59.330> bit<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.450> dried<00:03:00.440> mud<00:03:00.770> built<00:03:01.190> up<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.610> be

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
little bit of dried mud built up to be

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.100 
little bit of dried mud built up to be
expected

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
expected

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.990 
expected
so<00:03:03.890> I'll<00:03:04.010> just<00:03:04.130> lift<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.400> up<00:03:04.520> throw<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.850> out

so I'll just lift that up throw it out
but<00:03:05.180> otherwise<00:03:07.120> again<00:03:08.120> very<00:03:08.420> very<00:03:08.630> pleased

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.360 
but otherwise again very very pleased
I'm<00:03:09.080> gonna<00:03:09.440> stop<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.860> there<00:03:10.010> because<00:03:10.100> there's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
I'm gonna stop it there because there's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.970 
I'm gonna stop it there because there's
nothing<00:03:10.640> else<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.880> really<00:03:11.030> talk<00:03:11.270> about<00:03:11.980> we

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
nothing else to really talk about we

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.330 
nothing else to really talk about we
live<00:03:13.190> in<00:03:13.370> Vancouver<00:03:13.550> BC<00:03:14.060> Pacific<00:03:14.660> Northwest

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
live in Vancouver BC Pacific Northwest

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.710 
live in Vancouver BC Pacific Northwest
where<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.430> doesn't<00:03:16.580> really<00:03:16.910> snow<00:03:17.300> heavy<00:03:17.510> and

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
where it doesn't really snow heavy and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.840 
where it doesn't really snow heavy and
the<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.320> temperature<00:03:18.739> change<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.280> not<00:03:19.430> great

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
the the temperature change is not great

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.550 
the the temperature change is not great
so<00:03:20.209> that's<00:03:20.690> all<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:20.959> would<00:03:21.080> say<00:03:21.320> I<00:03:21.350> think

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
so that's all I would say I think

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.600 
so that's all I would say I think
there's<00:03:21.769> been<00:03:21.920> some<00:03:21.950> trouble<00:03:22.250> with<00:03:22.459> these

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
there's been some trouble with these

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.780 
there's been some trouble with these
gutter<00:03:23.390> guards<00:03:23.750> in<00:03:23.870> other<00:03:24.019> markets<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.830> suspect

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
gutter guards in other markets I suspect

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.790 
gutter guards in other markets I suspect
that<00:03:25.880> would<00:03:26.030> be<00:03:26.180> because<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:27.200> know<00:03:27.230> heavy

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
that would be because you know heavy

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.960 
that would be because you know heavy
snow<00:03:28.160> heavy<00:03:28.430> ice<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:30.100> affects<00:03:31.100> the

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
snow heavy ice and it affects the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.120 
snow heavy ice and it affects the
quality<00:03:32.420> of<00:03:32.540> these<00:03:32.630> guards<00:03:32.989> they<00:03:33.260> crack<00:03:33.860> and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
quality of these guards they crack and

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.240 
quality of these guards they crack and
whatnot<00:03:34.400> but<00:03:34.550> before<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.030> City<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.239> Northwest

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
whatnot but before the City of Northwest

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.020 
whatnot but before the City of Northwest
or<00:03:37.250> doesn't<00:03:37.580> really<00:03:38.330> freeze<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.200> snow<00:03:39.440> hard

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
or doesn't really freeze and snow hard

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.860 
or doesn't really freeze and snow hard
I<00:03:41.060> really<00:03:41.810> recommend<00:03:41.959> these<00:03:42.350> alright<00:03:43.870> one

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.980 
here so there's a I've got a lot of our
bridges<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:53.170> hips<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.410> guess<00:03:54.590> on<00:03:54.800> my

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
bridges and hips I guess on my

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.100 
bridges and hips I guess on my
my<00:03:56.410> house<00:03:56.590> in<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.160> valley<00:03:57.610> so<00:03:57.850> there's<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.120> valley

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
my house in a valley so there's a valley

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.130 
my house in a valley so there's a valley
that<00:03:59.530> comes<00:03:59.710> down<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.670> delivers<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.690> lot<00:04:01.960> of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
that comes down and it delivers a lot of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.960 
that comes down and it delivers a lot of
gunk<00:04:02.350> so<00:04:02.560> what's<00:04:02.710> happened<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.370> gutter

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
gunk so what's happened is the gutter

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.360 
gunk so what's happened is the gutter
guards<00:04:04.270> have<00:04:04.960> it's<00:04:05.470> collapsed<00:04:05.950> on<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.100> corner

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
guards have it's collapsed on the corner

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.620 
guards have it's collapsed on the corner
here<00:04:06.520> and<00:04:06.940> I'm<00:04:07.030> going<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.240> have<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.450> look

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
here and I'm going to have a look

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.430 
here and I'm going to have a look
underneath<00:04:07.900> now<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.350> just<00:04:08.470> see<00:04:08.680> if<00:04:10.170> if<00:04:11.170> it's

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
underneath now and just see if if it's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.770 
underneath now and just see if if it's
covered<00:04:11.920> up<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:13.150> downspout

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.480 

sign<00:04:17.560> here<00:04:17.859> who's<00:04:18.040> gonna<00:04:18.190> throw<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:18.640> away

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.189 

so<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.090> think<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.419> downspout<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:25.930> just

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
so I think the downspout is just

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:36.779 
so I think the downspout is just
underneath<00:04:26.470> this

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.740 

yeah<00:04:37.789> okay<00:04:38.419> good<00:04:38.600> it's<00:04:38.840> in<00:04:39.050> good<00:04:39.139> shape<00:04:39.350> so

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
yeah okay good it's in good shape so

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.969 
yeah okay good it's in good shape so
perfectly<00:04:41.750> clean<00:04:42.110> as<00:04:42.199> a<00:04:42.289> whistle<00:04:42.319> that<00:04:42.740> worked

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
perfectly clean as a whistle that worked

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.320 
perfectly clean as a whistle that worked
great<00:04:43.130> okay

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.110 

I<00:04:46.360> had<00:04:47.020> one<00:04:47.169> commenter<00:04:47.710> asking<00:04:48.129> actually<00:04:48.580> how

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
I had one commenter asking actually how

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.279 
I had one commenter asking actually how
to<00:04:49.180> install<00:04:49.870> these<00:04:50.080> things<00:04:50.379> so<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:52.169> could<00:04:53.169> do

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
to install these things so I could do

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.869 
to install these things so I could do
better<00:04:53.409> job<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.740> guess<00:04:53.919> so<00:04:54.069> I<00:04:54.099> bought<00:04:54.490> two

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
better job I guess so I bought two

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.430 
better job I guess so I bought two
different<00:04:55.270> types<00:04:55.479> of<00:04:55.629> these<00:04:55.750> gutter<00:04:56.080> guards

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
different types of these gutter guards

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.070 
different types of these gutter guards
from<00:04:57.099> Home<00:04:57.699> Depot<00:04:57.729> last<00:04:58.120> year<00:04:58.330> so<00:04:58.479> this<00:04:58.690> one<00:04:58.900> on

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
from Home Depot last year so this one on

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.499 
from Home Depot last year so this one on
the<00:04:59.199> left<00:04:59.379> you<00:04:59.530> can<00:04:59.620> see<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:01.090> doesn't<00:05:01.389> have<00:05:01.479> a

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
the left you can see it doesn't have a

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.110 
the left you can see it doesn't have a
filter<00:05:01.810> this<00:05:02.349> one<00:05:02.590> has<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.800> filter<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:03.460> think<00:05:04.030> you

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
filter this one has a filter I think you

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.800 
filter this one has a filter I think you
can<00:05:04.270> see<00:05:04.449> it<00:05:04.539> so<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:04.990> put<00:05:05.289> these<00:05:05.650> filter<00:05:06.430> ones<00:05:06.810> on

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
can see it so I put these filter ones on

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.499 
can see it so I put these filter ones on
this<00:05:08.680> side<00:05:08.949> of<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.129> house<00:05:09.280> because<00:05:10.270> that's

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
this side of the house because that's

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.540 
this side of the house because that's
where<00:05:10.720> all<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.990> trees<00:05:11.289> are<00:05:11.560> right<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.069> then

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
where all the trees are right and then

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.629 
where all the trees are right and then
this<00:05:12.729> side<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.150> house<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:14.129> have<00:05:15.129> trees<00:05:15.430> but

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
this side of the house I have trees but

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.580 
this side of the house I have trees but
they're<00:05:15.759> quite<00:05:15.940> far<00:05:16.150> away<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.629> it's<00:05:17.409> pretty

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
they're quite far away and it's pretty

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.320 
they're quite far away and it's pretty
clear<00:05:17.919> over<00:05:18.190> here<00:05:18.220> so<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:18.669> you<00:05:18.759> can<00:05:18.849> see<00:05:19.090> well

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
clear over here so and you can see well

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.700 
clear over here so and you can see well
there's<00:05:19.509> a<00:05:19.539> lot<00:05:19.659> of<00:05:19.750> junk<00:05:20.080> I<00:05:20.199> guess<00:05:20.379> over<00:05:20.560> there

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
there's a lot of junk I guess over there

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.779 
there's a lot of junk I guess over there
I<00:05:20.740> could<00:05:20.949> have<00:05:21.009> gone<00:05:21.099> with<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.520> flying

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
I could have gone with the flying

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.930 
I could have gone with the flying
filters<00:05:22.210> I<00:05:22.360> didn't<00:05:22.960> okay<00:05:23.139> so<00:05:23.979> maybe<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:24.789> would

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
filters I didn't okay so maybe I would

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.480 
filters I didn't okay so maybe I would
put<00:05:25.090> five<00:05:25.270> filters<00:05:25.509> all<00:05:25.810> where<00:05:25.990> on<00:05:26.110> your<00:05:26.229> house

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
put five filters all where on your house

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.619 
put five filters all where on your house
um<00:05:27.520> and<00:05:27.729> then<00:05:27.909> what<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:28.900> did<00:05:29.020> was<00:05:30.479> pictured<00:05:31.479> a

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
science behind it and you take the

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:52.439 
science behind it and you take the
gutter<00:05:46.840> guard<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:48.840> cut<00:05:49.840> them<00:05:50.729> to<00:05:51.729> size<00:05:51.759> and

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
gutter guard and cut them to size and

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.689 
gutter guard and cut them to size and
really<00:05:52.990> just<00:05:53.289> just<00:05:53.590> kind<00:05:54.009> of<00:05:54.099> go<00:05:54.219> from<00:05:54.400> from

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
really just just kind of go from from

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.279 
really just just kind of go from from
end<00:05:54.819> to<00:05:54.880> end<00:05:54.940> and<00:05:55.360> put<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:55.630> longest<00:05:55.960> one<00:05:56.139> ends

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
end to end and put the longest one ends

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.870 
end to end and put the longest one ends
until<00:05:56.650> they<00:05:56.770> don't<00:05:56.919> fit<00:05:57.219> and<00:05:57.250> then<00:05:57.430> think<00:05:57.669> cut

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
until they don't fit and then think cut

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.550 
until they don't fit and then think cut
one<00:05:58.060> to<00:05:58.150> size<00:05:58.360> and<00:05:58.569> that<00:05:58.930> what<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.139> do<00:05:59.289> is<00:05:59.440> you

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
one to size and that what you do is you

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.459 
one to size and that what you do is you
trim<00:05:59.949> an<00:06:00.190> edge<00:06:00.639> like<00:06:01.060> that<00:06:01.270> so<00:06:01.930> that<00:06:02.020> it<00:06:02.139> fits

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469
