00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.880
 welcome to the second 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.460
 participation 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.250
 videos in this i want to show you 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.790
 as you stitch the stitch with left 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.610
 After all, those are the ones that can be seen 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.140
 Most knitting patterns not only from 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.670
 knitted right stitched but just 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.420
 alternating between right and left 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.720
 mesh 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.310
 and if you want, you too, like her left 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.820
 mesh with the wash stitch sewing 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.500
 then you can open this amazing 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.480
 many possibilities different 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 knitting pattern invisible together 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.290
 sew 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.260
 I'll show you that again by means of one 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.630
 mini loops because i like the technique 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.120
 scary happy just use it out 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.590
 a scarf to make a look so that 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 you do not get the seam at all afterwards 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.010
 able to see 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.670
 you need it again, I 'll do it again 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.370
 with a contrast thread you need 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.579
 so again a needle and a needle 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.190
 Just a little sign that you with 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.280
 a makeshift stitch stop 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.560
 We started putting it that way again 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.859
 in front of us the bottom ten stitches and 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.789
 above are the new ones and now 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:19.749
 let's start 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:23.409
 It starts at the beginning from the left 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:33.850
 pierce right into the first mesh 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:38.219
 and then at the upper mesh from below 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.499
 up a sting 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.700
 But that is only at the beginning so only 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:47.139
 the first stitch 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.310
 Now we start the right rhythm 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:53.279
 prick 1 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.829
 from bottom to top in the bottom stitch 

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:59.770
 Do not watch the threads 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:07.119
 mess up so from below 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:11.910
 above and then from left to 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.910
 right into the first in the second stitch 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.580
 I hope you can see that well 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.800
 now you can both these 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.760
 mesh here also already from the needle 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.760
 slide 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.690
 happy to knot in it must be here 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:38.520
 out girl so now it is true 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.000
 below it was from the bottom to the top of 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.630
 left to top right we still have to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.370
 in the first stitch also from below 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:55.230
 up and into the second stitch of 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.330
 right to left a sting 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.140
 and we can therefore also from the same 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.140
 lift the needle 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.560
 Now it's down to the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.600
 last needle we have already sewn 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.250
 how to stab again 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.830
 from the bottom up 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:21.600
 down there is a bottom up 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:28.830
 sting and then from left to right 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:31.380
 in the second stitch and also in the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:39.750
 pry the upper stitch back from 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:43.730
 bottom up and into the second stitch 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.730
 from right to left 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.670
 this is always going on again 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.270
 a stitch comes in dijon stitched mesh 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.730
 and a stitch in a mesh still 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.270
 is on the needle and we sting 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:05.040
 always from bottom to top in the 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:11.070
 already sewn and from left to right 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:14.910
 at the bottom second stitch and 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.010
 let the needle slip and 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.959
 even at the top already sewn 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.170
 We stab one from below 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.170
 above 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:33.180
 find the right input and from 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.500
 right to left in the second then 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.020
 you can get it right back from the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.570
 Drop needle 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.960
 mine that lays before you now and 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.000
 the threads pulling reasonably strand see 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.830
 you already the pattern what with the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.860
 I form left-hand left-hand stitches 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:57.290
 show you again from below 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.290
 at the top in dijon sewn mesh 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.700
 and from left to right in the on the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.750
 needle 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:13.450
 You can also do this from the needle 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:18.880
 drop down and back down 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:21.310
 up in the already sewn up and 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.060
 from right to left in the on the 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.060
 suggests 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:37.860
 and so does the left stitching 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:41.930
 pattern me as you could still high then 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.930
 had better make it the left 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:46.789
 I wish you much success 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.789
 imitate
