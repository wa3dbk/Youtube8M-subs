board is too wide you will simply need
to<00:04:43.560> use<00:04:43.830> your<00:04:44.010> tape<00:04:44.220> measure<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.790> determine

the board's waist width now that you

the board's waist width now that you

know what board width you need you're

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.520 
know what board width you need you're
