00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.560
 hello to all friends never dispenses like 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.840
 let's say as lg two mini that the preview 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.030
 live commerce then 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.400
 terminal model nice way to keep in 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.400
 nice hand compact even though display 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.230
 close to the well-known turn instead lies 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.230
 and a little size 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.029
 resignation 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.029
 if it's bigger 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.710
 excellent organization like on TV 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.170
 here too the release has been implemented 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.480
 which can be done in four touches 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.640
 the activity is really excellent 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.329
 technical features are processor 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.210
 is a 1.2 gigahertz qualcomm 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.440
 42 inch qhd with did not understand the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.629
 unfortunately but I repeat that the definition is 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.640
 enough the 2,400 square battery 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.270
 milan pergola of the supporting actors a blow 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.850
 my 13 megapixels and one back without 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.299
 the doctor who previously should 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.299
 to be 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.720
 so the born is I say anyway 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.090
 European anything else 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.520
 lt all ag also depends on the market 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.360
 android 4.4 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.270
 in short, it is still not certain 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.410
 but if also the 1.1.2 gb processors that 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.410
 the second auction in the market 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.710
 all for this purpose 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.710
 two nicer when we have textures 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.010
 but as you see 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.120
 in any case I must say that I like the 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.310
 conditions of the two but they are anyway 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.680
 many 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.670
 pine you felt the mole these colors 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.909
 white a beautiful way perhaps more than black 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.670
 remember 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.659
 gold and bronze 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.350
 both very beautifully 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.350
 this time but everything can be invented 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.350
