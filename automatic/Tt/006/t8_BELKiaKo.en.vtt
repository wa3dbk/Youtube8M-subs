 to hear about it what am I doing 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.970
 had to on this video there is about 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.140
 already a week or even a week and a half 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.760
 unable to make the following small 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.130
 compromise that would have remained with 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.960
 gta5 videos that I applauded instead 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.849

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 galaxy s 4 so is there already 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.630
 a great novelty extract is when 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.340
 a camp actually is when its date 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.809

 during the month during this month of April a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.440
 coffee a 2013 of course I give you 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 all descriptions 1 offers 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.829
 so this samsung galaxy s 4 the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.780
 most important information 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.480
 necessary and whether one of the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.280
 new compared to samsung galaxy s iii 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.680
 of course competition is going to do 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.210
 competition with the iphone 5 pieces between 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.980
 quotation marks one is not totally sure 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.449
 again if it's going to be called like that but 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.399
 where they came to be the iphone 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.719
 5 is a large island or even 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.149
 big crops again years that are going 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.650
 exist between samsung and apple then in 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.990
 big if you want so that's going to be a 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.780
 screen 5 of a super crowd an amoled mode 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.189
 so the 1080p so it's a good 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.060
 picture quality a very good quality 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.729
 image is what we find 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.530
 now easy easy let's say it's 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.150
 pure hd that's his dadas very 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.400
 big picture quality for people who 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.140
 do not know each other but 80 p 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.100
 that's enough 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.360
 frankly after a little worry it's 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.619
 that it is a plastic shell we 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.689
 call in himself so if you have to 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.909
 to know if now the phones 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.100
 starts to be aluminum aluminum 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.759
 from advanced to our anodized choices or something 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.409
 like that 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.049
 short aluminum then it's true that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.150
 there with a kind of plastic shell 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.380
 these are critics who are going in 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.090
 guard phone in ten years people 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.040
 say here they make a shell in 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.570
 plastic while that of the dead 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.159
 in aluminum and its lyrics to super 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.560
 light and then there it is true that 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.450
 it's a little exaggerated then the ram so 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.050
 it's 2 gigas on a phone whose 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.700
 we can not confuse it or 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.230
 to present it in front of a computer is 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.210
 not possible this 2 gigas on a 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.620
 computer it's nothing but good 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.790
 it's a phone that's great I 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.180
 tell me 2 gigas of ram that's enough 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.370
 amply 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.990
 so the versions so but jigawa on 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.910
 can find on this kind of on this 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.060
 that went from 16.4 that is to say that there is 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.670
 the 16 giga the 32 singles 66 64 gigas 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.140
 that one and me the only siegel is enough by 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.190
 example of doing more that we go by if 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.750
 you want to put movies and that's 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.150
 with these lands on maybe the 30 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.620
 June 32 gigas will be enough for you anyway 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.450
 64 giga I think we do not pay in 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.560
 abuse too after that depends frankly 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.240
 do what you want if you say that 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.640
 in function because of course 64 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.950
 gigabits will cost much more than the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.450
 16 gigabyte version so here are made 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.400
 you want but frankly if you 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.830
 want to normal use you 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.780
 know game apps etc etc 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.430
 take this gigabyte or if you want 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.520
 put some movies some major movies 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.930
 5 5/10 movie you put that of 32 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.060
 gigabits or if it's even more of that 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.980
 so you buy the 64 gigabit version 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 replace not given to confess 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.000
 so there is of course a micro slot sd 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.110
 wi-fi purpose everything done ie 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.910
 important things too is that a 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.690
 3 megapixel camera that is 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.400
 Just huge 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.900
 so actually see for me actually 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.830
 ultimately makes transmedia too 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.450
 to be because you can take a 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.580
 photo with 13 megapixels 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.230
 it takes up the image quality 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.959
 is so good forgets that the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.670
 file size do not do that 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.830
 is heavy and that is to say that you 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.320
 just do some photos with and 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.820
 then finally you actually go 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.980
 fill your memory card sir 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.570
 zoom that's true it's so pretty 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.040
 painful or frankly 13 megapixel 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.120
 for me it's not necessary 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.459
 so that's for sure you'll do some 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.450
 quality photos then the second I 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.850
 you do not say the opposite with a 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.840
 webcam and that makes the 720 pixels that 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.970
 is super good besides the iphone 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.680
 buy a pass tina 25 pieces we will see 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.390
 we will see if all this will be presented 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.430
 will you say all that so the weight my 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.080
 necessarily not very interesting 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.930
 but I still wanted with a weight 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.510
 of 130 grams and a thickness of 7 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.400
 life m what to know also this 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.290
 that apparently then that I do not have very 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.390
 well understood is that to oneself it is to 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.680
 a care in the box to its sides you 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.599
 buy in additional mode 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.000
 and then you have some kind of bracelets 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.950
 which will allow to analyze your rhythm 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.959
 cardiac during a sleep so what is it 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.760
 it serves I do not see too much but good in 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.680
 creating a bracelet that will allow you 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.959
 to do that and we like didier did it 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.069
 felt in April then at the price level 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.180
 all this I have no information yet 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.480
 I will give you soon 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.159
 yeah so finally if you want the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.510
 samsung galaxy s 4 savard he goes a lot 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.879
 looks right west at his game does 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.500
 display pictures and a lot of people 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.239
 are still we are still people 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.829
 disappointed let's say like that people are 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.900
 disappointed in time that sounds like a little 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.729
 too much so it's kind of s3 mode 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.430
 improve we'll say that like that 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.229
 a super good image quality device 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.910
 perfect photo its rises of luxury because 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.009
 that I do not think the 5th is going to do this 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.810
 the same picture quality is that these 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.889
 stars are frankly not that 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.780
 tell me if you are more I shit 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.150
 samsung and rouch and blind then me 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.650
 I went to samsung samsung wave and 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.500
 then I went to apple's house with 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.870
 the iphone 3gs but the iphone 4 but in 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.830
 big frankly if the tool my ma 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.270
 little description I find that 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.099
 terms of image quality and in terms 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.289
 of cameras sam sound is well at 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.610
 above that apple is against it's 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.050
 true only at the application level and 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.449
 it would have been more trendy 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.440
 apple but frankly samsung 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.880
 I think we want level of 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.860
 picture quality of people that's really 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.330
 a thing of ouf so thank you again 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.310
 for all you have a try of 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.500
 the asu call 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.790
 and his club their lab the break and the 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.450
 less in the comments or on the 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.750
 Facebook page 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.340
 all that brief that on my dd does not do the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.630
 people at age 25 smoke our anti date 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.070
 never video is always fun 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.630
 and especially in the south his facebook page 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.040
 personal that you said if you have 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.330
 questions you ask me anything 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.280
 surely come as Thursday in the 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.210
 description whenever it is 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.410
 lately and champions a 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.730
 little biting time I will not answer the 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.370
 questions then excuse me people 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.540
 j700 question finally 700 messages in the 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.310
 youtube inbox 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.560
 knowing that people were eating more than 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.940
 several hundred also on my gmail 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.260
 and several hundred also surf life 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.670
 you see that that accumulates 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.710
 I can not answer everyone 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.940
 so the only solution is survived 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.290
 like this one already has a lot less 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.520
 world on facebook is more of that on 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.410
 a minor of which the world is capable 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.150
 that was talking about my wall after 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.780
 it makes you are displayed but we 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.190
 is sorry thank you to all the people who
