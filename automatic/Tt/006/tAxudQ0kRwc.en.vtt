00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.780 
just going to try it now my impression
of<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.799> I<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:23.680> think<00:02:24.040> my<00:02:24.160> hair<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.400> ok<00:02:24.790> today<00:02:25.090> um<00:02:25.500> I

of it I I think my hair is ok today um I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.500 
of it I I think my hair is ok today um I
like<00:02:27.790> my<00:02:28.030> hair<00:02:28.060> big<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:31.060> think<00:02:31.360> that

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
like my hair big and I like I think that

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.640 
like my hair big and I like I think that
the<00:02:31.630> curls<00:02:31.989> are<00:02:32.260> kind<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:33.100> defined<00:02:34.650> actually

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
the curls are kind of defined actually

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.640 
the curls are kind of defined actually
now<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.769> think<00:02:35.950> they're<00:02:36.280> pretty<00:02:36.430> defined<00:02:36.790> um

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
now I think they're pretty defined um

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.280 
now I think they're pretty defined um
what<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.680> would<00:02:39.010> say<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.150> my<00:02:40.810> hair<00:02:41.049> feels

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
what I would say is that my hair feels

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.690 
what I would say is that my hair feels
dry<00:02:41.620> I'll<00:02:42.430> say<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.709> would<00:02:44.709> prefer<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.220> i

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
dry I'll say that I would prefer that i

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.509 
dry I'll say that I would prefer that i
had<00:02:46.120> more<00:02:46.420> moisture<00:02:47.049> but<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.340> mean<00:02:48.370> they

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
had more moisture but like I mean they

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.099 
had more moisture but like I mean they
gave<00:02:48.790> some<00:02:49.000> instructions<00:02:49.540> they<00:02:49.660> said<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.989> use

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
gave some instructions they said to use

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.840 
gave some instructions they said to use
that<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.440> er<00:02:50.470> rip<00:02:50.650> curl<00:02:50.950> cream<00:02:51.100> so<00:02:51.340> maybe<00:02:51.579> if<00:02:51.730> I

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
that but er rip curl cream so maybe if I

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.280 
that but er rip curl cream so maybe if I
would<00:02:52.060> have<00:02:52.180> used<00:02:52.359> that<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.630> would<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.109> had

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
would have used that I would have had

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.390 
would have used that I would have had
more<00:02:53.530> moisture<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:55.390> i<00:02:55.450> would<00:02:55.720> say<00:02:55.900> overall

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
more moisture but i would say overall

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.440 
more moisture but i would say overall
i'm<00:02:57.400> not<00:02:57.640> going<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:57.850> take<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.180> back<00:02:58.420> to

not going to take this back it was

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
not going to take this back it was
always<00:03:04.810> six<00:03:05.079> dollars<00:03:05.380> I'm<00:03:05.560> going<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.739> keep<00:03:05.859> it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
always six dollars I'm going to keep it

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.060 
always six dollars I'm going to keep it
because<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.910> think<00:03:07.120> my<00:03:07.209> hair<00:03:07.329> looks<00:03:07.359> okay<00:03:07.840> um<00:03:08.230> I

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
because I think my hair looks okay um I

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.520 
because I think my hair looks okay um I
don't<00:03:09.730> think<00:03:09.970> it's<00:03:10.239> going<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.450> last<00:03:10.690> five<00:03:11.260> days

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
don't think it's going to last five days

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.559 
don't think it's going to last five days
my<00:03:11.920> wash<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.370> gos<00:03:12.459> usually<00:03:12.819> last<00:03:13.060> five<00:03:13.329> days

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
my wash and gos usually last five days

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.620 
my wash and gos usually last five days
sometimes<00:03:14.380> seven<00:03:14.709> days<00:03:14.859> with<00:03:15.760> kinky<00:03:16.090> curly<00:03:16.450> I

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
sometimes seven days with kinky curly I

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.380 
sometimes seven days with kinky curly I
think<00:03:17.140> this<00:03:17.260> might<00:03:17.319> last<00:03:17.790> two<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.940> three<00:03:19.090> and

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
think this might last two to three and

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.809 
think this might last two to three and
then<00:03:19.450> i'll<00:03:20.350> probably<00:03:20.590> put<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.010> up<00:03:21.220> i'm

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
then i'll probably put it up i'm

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.520 
then i'll probably put it up i'm
actually<00:03:22.030> going<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.690> be<00:03:22.720> outside<00:03:23.079> today<00:03:23.350> so

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
i'll probably put it up

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.589
