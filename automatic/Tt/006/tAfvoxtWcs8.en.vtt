on<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.140> bun<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.769> making<00:03:16.129> it<00:03:16.250> look<00:03:16.370> good<00:03:16.450> if

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
on the bun and making it look good if

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.970 
on the bun and making it look good if
that<00:03:17.510> makes<00:03:17.810> any<00:03:17.900> sense<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.440> again<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.859> just

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
that makes any sense and again I just

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.190 
that makes any sense and again I just
pull<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.579> down<00:03:19.609> all<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.359> front<00:03:20.599> pieces<00:03:20.810> and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
pull it down all the front pieces and

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.780 
pull it down all the front pieces and
kind<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:21.650> mess<00:03:21.950> up<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.280> bun<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.489> little

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
kind of just mess up the bun a little

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.490 
kind of just mess up the bun a little
bit<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.150> adjust<00:03:23.329> it<00:03:23.720> however<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.260> like

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
bit and adjust it however you like

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.170 
bit and adjust it however you like
there's<00:03:24.859> really<00:03:25.069> no<00:03:25.340> right<00:03:25.549> or<00:03:25.579> wrong<00:03:25.700> way<00:03:25.879> to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
there's really no right or wrong way to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.030 
there's really no right or wrong way to
wear<00:03:26.450> this<00:03:26.599> hairstyle<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.290> just<00:03:27.530> go<00:03:27.620> ahead<00:03:27.709> and

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
wear this hairstyle so just go ahead and

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.780 
wear this hairstyle so just go ahead and
do<00:03:28.370> what<00:03:28.579> you<00:03:28.609> like<00:03:28.849> best

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.220 

this<00:03:34.790> last<00:03:35.030> style<00:03:35.270> is<00:03:35.450> definitely<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.110> most

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
this last style is definitely the most

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.810 
this last style is definitely the most
complicated<00:03:36.650> out<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.340> three<00:03:37.580> however

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
complicated out of the three however

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.970 
complicated out of the three however
it's<00:03:38.120> not<00:03:38.360> complicated<00:03:38.750> at<00:03:39.230> all<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:39.950> can

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
it's not complicated at all and you can

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.440 
it's not complicated at all and you can
probably<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.550> this<00:03:40.700> within<00:03:40.910> like<00:03:41.180> three

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
probably do this within like three

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.640 
probably do this within like three
minutes<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:41.960> the<00:03:42.080> first<00:03:42.260> step<00:03:42.440> you're<00:03:42.590> gonna

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
minutes so the first step you're gonna

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.740 
minutes so the first step you're gonna
want<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:42.980> do<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.250> put<00:03:43.790> your<00:03:43.910> hair<00:03:44.120> into<00:03:44.270> a<00:03:44.420> very

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
want to do is put your hair into a very

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.750 
want to do is put your hair into a very
high<00:03:44.990> ponytail<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:45.980> then<00:03:46.100> section<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.670> off

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
high ponytail and then section it off

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.850 
high ponytail and then section it off
into<00:03:47.120> two<00:03:47.330> sides<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:48.080> clipped<00:03:48.350> one<00:03:48.470> side<00:03:48.680> just

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
into two sides I clipped one side just

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.050 
into two sides I clipped one side just
to<00:03:48.980> make<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.220> little<00:03:49.340> bit<00:03:49.520> easier<00:03:49.910> for

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
to make it a little bit easier for

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.360

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
then go ahead and repeat the same thing

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.840 
then go ahead and repeat the same thing
on<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.150> other<00:04:14.180> side<00:04:14.770> as<00:04:15.770> you<00:04:15.980> can<00:04:16.190> see<00:04:16.430> me

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.199 
on the other side as you can see me
doing<00:04:17.030> here<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.320> just<00:04:18.700> sorry<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:19.760> held<00:04:20.060> off

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
doing here and I just sorry I held off

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.030 
doing here and I just sorry I held off
the<00:04:20.420> other<00:04:20.540> side<00:04:20.750> with<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:21.109> bobby<00:04:21.500> pin<00:04:21.739> just<00:04:21.769> to

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
the other side with a bobby pin just to

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.200 
the other side with a bobby pin just to
make<00:04:22.190> it<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.370> little<00:04:22.460> bit<00:04:22.670> easier<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:23.090> it

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
make it a little bit easier so it

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.520 
make it a little bit easier so it
wouldn't<00:04:23.390> fall<00:04:23.540> out<00:04:23.780> but<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.140> didn't<00:04:24.350> want<00:04:24.470> to

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
wouldn't fall out but I didn't want to

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.800 
wouldn't fall out but I didn't want to
deal<00:04:24.650> full<00:04:24.919> elastic<00:04:25.220> but<00:04:25.970> I<00:04:26.000> am<00:04:26.210> on<00:04:26.419> this<00:04:26.600> side

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
deal full elastic but I am on this side

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.560 
deal full elastic but I am on this side
so<00:04:27.050> just<00:04:27.110> take<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.620> small<00:04:28.090> clear<00:04:29.090> elastic<00:04:29.450> would

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
so just take a small clear elastic would

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.000 
so just take a small clear elastic would
probably<00:04:29.840> be<00:04:29.990> best<00:04:30.200> but<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:30.410> just<00:04:30.650> had<00:04:30.770> little

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
probably be best but I just had little

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.320 
probably be best but I just had little
black<00:04:31.220> lines<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.640> then<00:04:31.760> taking<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.180> two

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
black lines and then taking the two

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.540 
black lines and then taking the two
sides<00:04:32.600> go<00:04:32.960> ahead<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.470> start<00:04:33.800> twisting<00:04:34.340> them

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
sides go ahead and start twisting them

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.570 
sides go ahead and start twisting them
together<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.600> there's<00:04:36.260> really<00:04:36.440> no<00:04:36.650> wrong<00:04:37.310> way

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
together and there's really no wrong way

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.760 
together and there's really no wrong way
to<00:04:37.640> do<00:04:37.880> with<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.390> just<00:04:39.290> suggested

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
to do with this I just suggested

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.020 
to do with this I just suggested
twisting<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.280> quite<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.490> bit<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.850> make<00:04:41.000> sure

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
twisting it quite a bit and make sure

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.790 
twisting it quite a bit and make sure
it's<00:04:41.480> really<00:04:41.690> tight<00:04:41.810> because<00:04:42.260> if<00:04:42.410> it's<00:04:42.560> too

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
it's really tight because if it's too

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.620 
it's really tight because if it's too
loose<00:04:42.980> you're<00:04:43.190> gonna<00:04:43.310> find<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.180> it's<00:04:44.480> gonna

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
loose you're gonna find that it's gonna
