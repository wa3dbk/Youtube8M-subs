flakes<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:47.969> salty<00:00:48.420> than<00:00:48.450> table<00:00:48.750> salt<00:00:48.930> so

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
flakes are more salty than table salt so

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.049 
flakes are more salty than table salt so
they<00:00:49.230> don't<00:00:49.440> need<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.710> much<00:00:49.890> great<00:00:50.850> that

yeasty water's bubbling I love this bit
so<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.570> slowly<00:00:55.170> work<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.770> dry<00:00:56.070> ingredients

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
into the wet this is where a dough

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.979 
into the wet this is where a dough
scraper<00:00:58.980> comes<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.520> super<00:00:59.879> useful<00:01:00.030> otherwise

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
scraper comes in super useful otherwise

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.770

I'll<00:01:01.230> end<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.500> wearing<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> dough<00:01:02.629> I'm<00:01:03.629> going

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I'll end up wearing the dough I'm going

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.740 
I'll end up wearing the dough I'm going
to<00:01:03.840> add<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.290> oil<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.400> use<00:01:05.430> any<00:01:05.640> fat<00:01:06.090> I'm

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to add some oil you can use any fat I'm

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
to add some oil you can use any fat I'm
going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> use<00:01:07.200> rapeseed<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.700> much<00:01:08.850> easier

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
going to use rapeseed it's much easier

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.910 
going to use rapeseed it's much easier
to<00:01:09.210> mix<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.659> than<00:01:09.840> hard<00:01:10.049> fats<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.470> butter<00:01:10.740> or

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
to mix in than hard fats like butter or

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.929 
to mix in than hard fats like butter or
lard<00:01:11.270> about<00:01:12.270> 20<00:01:12.780> milliliters<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.580> generous

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
lard about 20 milliliters or be generous

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.929 
lard about 20 milliliters or be generous
that<00:01:15.119> should<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.640> great<00:01:17.640> thing<00:01:17.850> about

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that should do the great thing about

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.330 
that should do the great thing about
adding<00:01:18.840> fat<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.259> your<00:01:19.350> bread<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
adding fat to your bread is that it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
adding fat to your bread is that it
modifies<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.240> dough<00:01:21.420> locking<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.110> moisture

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
modifies the dough locking in moisture

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.380 
modifies the dough locking in moisture
so<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.890> fresher<00:01:23.159> bread<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.670> longer<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
so you have fresher bread for longer and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
so you have fresher bread for longer and
then<00:01:25.080> using<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.560> hand<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.070> always

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
then using one hand because it's always

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.219 
then using one hand because it's always
useful<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.670> keep<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.000> hand<00:01:27.299> free<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.720> case

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
useful to keep this hand free in case

shouldn't<00:01:48.479> wash<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:50.189> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
shouldn't wash out now because if you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
shouldn't wash out now because if you

don't stretch them work they don't off

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.800 
don't stretch them work they don't off
you'll<00:01:52.439> end<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> brick<00:01:53.630> but<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you'll end up with a brick but if you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.139 
you'll end up with a brick but if you
work<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.229> dough<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:56.549> long<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.939> can

work this dough for as long as you can

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.780 
work this dough for as long as you can
then<00:01:57.689> give<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.110> extra<00:01:58.290> 5<00:01:58.770> minutes<00:01:58.799> then

you're<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> get<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> loaf<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.049> rise

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
you're going to get a loaf that can rise

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.069 
you're going to get a loaf that can rise
and<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.640> really<00:02:02.969> beautiful<00:02:03.149> soft<00:02:03.869> and

to<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.330> its<00:02:20.450> first<00:02:20.720> rise<00:02:21.020> which<00:02:21.380> I'll<00:02:21.860> give

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
to have its first rise which I'll give

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.190 
to have its first rise which I'll give
it<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.459> bowl<00:02:22.780> but<00:02:23.780> being<00:02:23.959> there<00:02:24.050> for

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
it in this bowl but being there for

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.870 
it in this bowl but being there for
about<00:02:24.290> an<00:02:24.560> hour<00:02:24.680> we're<00:02:24.920> really<00:02:25.250> develop<00:02:25.730> its

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
about an hour we're really develop its

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.490 
about an hour we're really develop its
strength<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.480> flavor<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:27.290> really

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
strength and flavor it's really

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.839 
strength and flavor it's really
important<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.920> keep<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.160> dough<00:02:28.310> covered<00:02:28.730> so

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
important to keep the dough covered so

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.490 
important to keep the dough covered so
it<00:02:28.910> doesn't<00:02:29.180> dry<00:02:29.360> out<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.840> like<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.380> use<00:02:30.470> a

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
it doesn't dry out I like to use a

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.589 
it doesn't dry out I like to use a
shower<00:02:30.709> cap<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.489> elastic<00:02:31.880> holds<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.209> on<00:02:32.360> and

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
shower cap the elastic holds it on and

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.059 
shower cap the elastic holds it on and
there's<00:02:32.840> plenty<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.260> room<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.530> there<00:02:33.739> for<00:02:33.800> it

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
there's plenty of room in there for it

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.740 
there's plenty of room in there for it
to<00:02:34.190> rise<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.790> could<00:02:35.150> do<00:02:35.239> with<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.450> rest<00:02:35.630> in

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
to rise I could do with the rest in

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.390 
to rise I could do with the rest in
there<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.050> about<00:02:36.110> an<00:02:36.290> hour<00:02:36.380> then<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.190> could<00:02:37.370> i

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
there for about an hour then so could i

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.610 
there for about an hour then so could i
well<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.610> yeasts<00:02:40.970> done<00:02:41.269> its<00:02:41.420> thing<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.900> it's

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
well the yeasts done its thing and it's

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.979 
well the yeasts done its thing and it's
doubled<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.069> size<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.300> need<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.600> shape<00:02:44.840> this

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
doubled in size but I need to shape this

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.309 
doubled in size but I need to shape this
dough<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.500> fits<00:02:45.769> this<00:02:45.980> loaf<00:02:46.220> tin<00:02:47.170> tilt<00:02:48.170> that

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
dough so it fits this loaf tin tilt that

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.840 
dough so it fits this loaf tin tilt that
out<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:50.630> work<00:02:50.840> this<00:02:50.989> dough<00:02:51.230> out<00:02:51.760> when<00:02:52.760> I

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
out and then work this dough out when I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.090 
out and then work this dough out when I
folded<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.390> twice<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.470> I'm<00:02:54.830> going<00:02:55.040> to

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
folded it twice like that I'm going to

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.220 
folded it twice like that I'm going to
knuckle<00:02:55.310> down<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.610> seam<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.930> will<00:02:57.019> help

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
knuckle down a seam and that will help

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.479 
knuckle down a seam and that will help
hold<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.590> whole<00:02:57.739> thing<00:02:57.769> together

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
hold the whole thing together

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.860 
hold the whole thing together
and<00:02:58.580> then<00:02:58.760> starting<00:02:59.180> from<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.420> top<00:02:59.599> just

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
and then starting from the top just

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.870 
and then starting from the top just
rolling<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.410> towards<00:03:00.440> me<00:03:00.950> sticking<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.849> down

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
rolling it towards me sticking it down

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.630 
rolling it towards me sticking it down
with<00:03:02.180> my<00:03:02.269> thumbs<00:03:02.599> so<00:03:03.530> create<00:03:04.069> a<00:03:04.130> nice<00:03:04.370> tight

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
with my thumbs so create a nice tight

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.479 
with my thumbs so create a nice tight
mold<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.569> underneath<00:03:06.500> here<00:03:06.799> we've<00:03:07.310> got<00:03:07.430> a

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
mold and underneath here we've got a

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.640 
mold and underneath here we've got a
seam<00:03:07.819> and<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:08.840> really<00:03:09.019> important<00:03:09.349> that<00:03:09.380> goes

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
seam and it's really important that goes

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.470 
seam and it's really important that goes
in<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.890> bottom<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.430> tin<00:03:10.670> there's<00:03:11.299> not

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
in the bottom of the tin there's not

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.570 
in the bottom of the tin there's not
only<00:03:11.630> hides<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.140> unseemly<00:03:12.500> seam<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:13.430> also

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
only hides the unseemly seam it also

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.940 
only hides the unseemly seam it also
helps<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:13.940> bread<00:03:14.120> keep<00:03:14.299> its<00:03:14.480> shape<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.769> it's

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
helps the bread keep its shape and it's

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.770 
helps the bread keep its shape and it's
in<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.160> tin<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:16.820> has<00:03:17.000> its<00:03:17.180> second<00:03:17.570> rise

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
in the tin that this has its second rise

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.170 
in the tin that this has its second rise
the<00:03:18.200> proof<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.799> call<00:03:19.070> it<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:19.940> where<00:03:20.090> it

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
the proof we call it this is where it

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.180 
the proof we call it this is where it
becomes<00:03:20.269> loaf<00:03:20.750> shape<00:03:20.890> but<00:03:21.890> it's<00:03:22.010> really

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
becomes loaf shape but it's really

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.259 
becomes loaf shape but it's really
important<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.549> doesn't<00:03:22.790> dry<00:03:22.970> out<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.150> we're

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
important it doesn't dry out so we're

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.330 
important it doesn't dry out so we're
