00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:23.939 
was also a study in the land set and

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.020 
was also a study in the land set and
there<00:03:24.750> are<00:03:24.930> other<00:03:25.139> studies<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:26.579> show<00:03:27.000> that

there are other studies that show that

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.530 
there are other studies that show that

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150

case<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.520> best<00:05:10.880> approach<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:12.440> we<00:05:12.620> combine<00:05:13.070> the

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430
