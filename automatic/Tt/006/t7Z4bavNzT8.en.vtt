00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.119
 turns of the tracks go to make 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.989
 itineraries a little bit far from 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:53.030
 marked trails 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.369

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.229
 initiation speed riding so the speed 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.960
 riding is a mixture of paragliding and 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.549
 ski so that's reassuring on a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.130
