our to Ma helmet for deaf Punk and I
just<00:00:11.639> wanted<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.969> take<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> moment<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.320> talk

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
just wanted to take a moment to talk

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.640 
just wanted to take a moment to talk
about<00:00:13.549> fiberglassing<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.849> general<00:00:15.379> first<00:00:16.379> up

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
about fiberglassing in general first up

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.000 
about fiberglassing in general first up
is<00:00:16.800> safety<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.880> always<00:00:18.660> want<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> take<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
is safety you always want to take the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.800 
is safety you always want to take the
best<00:00:20.160> precautions<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.180> breathing<00:00:21.630> this

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
best precautions and breathing this

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.200 
best precautions and breathing this
stuff<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.740> that's<00:00:22.980> why<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:24.060> recommend

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
stuff in so that's why we recommend

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.950 
stuff in so that's why we recommend
picking<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.289> respirator<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.570> being

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
picking up a respirator with and being

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.769 
picking up a respirator with and being
making<00:00:28.529> sure<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.340> filters<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.179> new<00:00:30.480> or

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
making sure that the filters are new or

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.490 
making sure that the filters are new or
clean<00:00:33.559> we<00:00:34.559> work<00:00:34.739> outside<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.050> maximum

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
clean we work outside so we have maximum

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
clean we work outside so we have maximum
ventilation<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.730> you're<00:00:38.850> working<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
ventilation but if you're working in a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.830 
ventilation but if you're working in a
garage<00:00:40.250> try<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.760> garage<00:00:42.030> door<00:00:42.360> open

garage try to have the garage door open

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.880 
garage try to have the garage door open
or<00:00:43.190> have<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.430> kind<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.670> fume<00:00:45.090> hood<00:00:45.829> if<00:00:46.829> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
or have some kind of fume hood if you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.889 
or have some kind of fume hood if you
don't<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.730> respirator<00:00:50.629> buy<00:00:51.629> one

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
don't have a respirator buy one

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.500 
don't have a respirator buy one
obviously<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.489> dust<00:00:54.300> mask<00:00:54.860> will<00:00:56.510> prevent

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
obviously but a dust mask will prevent

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.170 
obviously but a dust mask will prevent
some<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.260> fumes<00:00:58.649> from<00:00:58.829> coming<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.609> it's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
some of the fumes from coming in it's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.219 
some of the fumes from coming in it's
got<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:03.229> filter

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
got this little you know little filter

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.740 
got this little you know little filter
here<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.090> intended

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
here but it's not this is not intended

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.740 
here but it's not this is not intended
for<00:01:07.580> chemical<00:01:08.580> use<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.270> intended<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
for chemical use this is intended to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.410 
for chemical use this is intended to
prevent<00:01:10.260> dust<00:01:10.590> from<00:01:10.890> entering<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.400> lungs<00:01:11.640> so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
prevent dust from entering your lungs so

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.440 
prevent dust from entering your lungs so
that's<00:01:12.600> why<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.619> know<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:14.430> yourself<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.000> good

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
that's why you know get yourself a good

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.649 
that's why you know get yourself a good
respirator<00:01:16.640> make<00:01:17.640> sure<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.909> seals<00:01:18.180> tight<00:01:18.509> up

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
respirator make sure it seals tight up

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
respirator make sure it seals tight up
against<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.140> face<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.619> typically<00:01:23.189> use

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
against your face now we typically use

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.240 
against your face now we typically use
fiberglass<00:01:24.030> cloth<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:26.040> two<00:01:26.220> types

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
fiberglass cloth and there are two types

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.060 
fiberglass cloth and there are two types
of<00:01:26.670> fiberglass<00:01:28.549> at<00:01:29.549> least<00:01:30.740> two<00:01:31.740> types<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
fiberglass at least for general use

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.700 
fiberglass at least for general use
there's<00:01:34.979> fiberglass<00:01:35.579> mat<00:01:36.290> which<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
there's fiberglass mat which is this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.660 
there's fiberglass mat which is this
random<00:01:38.390> array<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.750> fiberglass<00:01:40.409> fibers<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
random array of fiberglass fibers and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.230 
random array of fiberglass fibers and
this<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:43.200> stronger<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:44.880> because

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
this is actually stronger to use because

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.340 
this is actually stronger to use because
it<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.869> random<00:01:46.970> array<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.180> fibers<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it is a random array of fibers in it it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.980 
it is a random array of fibers in it it
does<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.619> allow<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.310> any<00:01:50.759> any<00:01:51.630> kind<00:01:51.869> of

does not allow for any any kind of

does not allow for any any kind of

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
patterning to happen

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.970 
patterning to happen
but<00:01:56.270> we<00:01:56.480> typically<00:01:56.870> use<00:01:57.020> fiberglass<00:01:57.530> cloth

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
but we typically use fiberglass cloth

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.150 
but we typically use fiberglass cloth
which<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.670> woven<00:01:59.920> more<00:02:00.920> flexible<00:02:03.160> cloth

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
which is a woven more flexible cloth

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.200 
which is a woven more flexible cloth
this<00:02:05.120> can<00:02:05.390> bend<00:02:05.720> but<00:02:06.650> it<00:02:06.890> has<00:02:07.070> very<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:08.179> know

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
this can bend but it has very you know

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.419 
this can bend but it has very you know
has<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.630> lot<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.590> trouble<00:02:10.070> getting<00:02:10.340> over

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
has a lot of trouble getting over

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.350 
has a lot of trouble getting over
complex<00:02:11.090> curves<00:02:12.370> fiberglass<00:02:13.370> cloth<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:14.209> get

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
complex curves fiberglass cloth can get

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.110 
complex curves fiberglass cloth can get
over<00:02:14.600> complex<00:02:15.110> curves<00:02:15.560> if<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.070> if<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.850> you

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
over complex curves if you if you you

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.540 
over complex curves if you if you you
know<00:02:17.240> pad<00:02:17.600> at<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.170> brush<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.650> enough<00:02:18.920> it

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
know pad at it and brush it enough it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.150 
know pad at it and brush it enough it
will<00:02:19.850> curve<00:02:20.540> over<00:02:20.870> very<00:02:21.260> complex<00:02:22.330> parts<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
will curve over very complex parts the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.010 
will curve over very complex parts the
downside<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.940> using<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.870> is

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
downside to using this is that it is

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.310 
downside to using this is that it is
weaker<00:02:27.560> than<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.550> fiberglass<00:02:29.030> mat<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.690> that

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
weaker than the fiberglass mat and that

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.560 
weaker than the fiberglass mat and that
is<00:02:30.470> because<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.040> has<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.220> regular<00:02:31.820> weave<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
is because it has a regular weave and

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.790 
is because it has a regular weave and
thus<00:02:33.230> allows<00:02:33.709> for<00:02:34.400> flexing<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:36.170> when<00:02:36.590> we're

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
thus allows for flexing so when we're

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.400 
thus allows for flexing so when we're
using<00:02:37.010> fiberglass<00:02:37.760> mat<00:02:38.270> we<00:02:38.660> typically<00:02:39.020> do<00:02:39.290> it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
using fiberglass mat we typically do it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.260 
using fiberglass mat we typically do it
in<00:02:39.500> layers<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:41.500> when<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.620> layer<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.270> instead

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
in layers and when you layer it instead

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.510 
in layers and when you layer it instead
of<00:02:44.420> doing<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.489> along<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.880> weave<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.750> typically

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
of doing it along the weave we typically

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.699 
of doing it along the weave we typically
rotate<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:49.670> about<00:02:50.150> 45<00:02:50.600> degrees<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.560> way

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
rotate it about 45 degrees and that way

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.080 
rotate it about 45 degrees and that way
you<00:02:51.770> have<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:53.480> more<00:02:54.380> random<00:02:54.890> it's<00:02:55.820> not

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
you have a a more random it's not

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.470 
you have a a more random it's not
actually<00:02:56.690> random<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:57.500> it's<00:02:58.010> closer<00:02:58.480> to

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
actually random but it's it's closer to

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.710 
actually random but it's it's closer to
how<00:02:59.690> this<00:03:00.049> works<00:03:00.430> than<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:01.880> how<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.450> works

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
how this works than just how this works

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.320 
how this works than just how this works
so<00:03:02.920> if<00:03:03.920> you're<00:03:04.070> doing<00:03:04.280> two<00:03:04.489> layers<00:03:04.910> or

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
so if you're doing two layers or

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.759 
so if you're doing two layers or
multiple<00:03:05.780> layers<00:03:06.220> do<00:03:07.220> rotate<00:03:07.670> your<00:03:07.790> pieces

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
multiple layers do rotate your pieces

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.520 
multiple layers do rotate your pieces
and<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:11.330> way<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:11.600> can<00:03:11.840> maximize<00:03:12.170> your

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
and that way you can maximize your

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.710 
and that way you can maximize your
strength<00:03:14.500> when<00:03:15.500> using<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.980> fiberglass<00:03:16.430> cloth

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
strength when using a fiberglass cloth

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.110 
strength when using a fiberglass cloth
now<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.260> way<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.590> typically<00:03:19.310> do<00:03:19.610> fiberglass

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
now the way I typically do fiberglass

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.750 
now the way I typically do fiberglass
cloth<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.350> pieces<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:21.860> cut<00:03:22.100> end<00:03:22.370> up<00:03:22.549> being

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
cloth is the pieces I cut end up being

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.170 
cloth is the pieces I cut end up being
about<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.209> size<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.600> my<00:03:23.780> hand<00:03:24.250> if<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.459> are

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.160 
following along the tutorial on the blog
you'll<00:03:29.390> see<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.750> picture<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:31.989> piece<00:03:32.989> of

card size card on it and I thought

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.000 
card size card on it and I thought
that's<00:03:38.450> about<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.900> size<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.350> work<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.739> sometimes

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
that's about the size I work I sometimes

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.949 
that's about the size I work I sometimes
I'll<00:03:40.400> make<00:03:40.579> bigger<00:03:40.910> pieces<00:03:41.390> more<00:03:41.570> square

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
I'll make bigger pieces more square

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.430 
I'll make bigger pieces more square
pieces<00:03:42.380> but<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:46.130> know<00:03:46.280> for<00:03:46.970> beginning

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
purposes you know this is a good size to

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.390 
purposes you know this is a good size to
use<00:03:50.450> it's<00:03:50.750> probably<00:03:51.170> about<00:03:51.290> four<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.370> half

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
use it's probably about four and a half

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.539 
use it's probably about four and a half
inches<00:03:52.970> by<00:03:53.269> three<00:03:53.959> inches<00:03:54.260> or<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:57.070> now<00:03:58.070> when

inches by three inches or so now when

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.060 
inches by three inches or so now when
you<00:03:58.760> are<00:03:59.090> actually<00:03:59.660> fiberglassing<00:04:00.560> when

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
you are actually fiberglassing when

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.520 
you are actually fiberglassing when
you're<00:04:01.190> actually<00:04:01.840> pressing<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.959> resin<00:04:03.349> into

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
you're actually pressing the resin into

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.830 
you're actually pressing the resin into
the<00:04:03.770> piece

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.580 

you<00:04:09.840> can<00:04:10.340> brush<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.730> resin<00:04:12.150> on<00:04:12.329> like<00:04:13.079> this<00:04:13.319> but

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
you can brush the resin on like this but

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.800 
you can brush the resin on like this but
it's<00:04:13.739> not<00:04:13.890> going<00:04:14.129> to<00:04:14.220> penetrate<00:04:14.549> all<00:04:15.120> the

it's not going to penetrate all the
fibers<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:17.449> for<00:04:18.449> fiberglassing<00:04:19.049> it's<00:04:19.470> it's

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
fibers and for fiberglassing it's it's

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.670 
fibers and for fiberglassing it's it's
critical<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:21.539> make<00:04:21.570> sure<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.380> piece<00:04:22.650> is

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
critical to make sure that the piece is

can see I'm pushing it into my fingers I
can't<00:04:54.449> really<00:04:54.570> do<00:04:54.810> that<00:04:54.840> when<00:04:55.110> you're

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
can't really do that when you're

brushing into it now sometimes you can

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.200 
brushing into it now sometimes you can
kind<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.389> press<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:02.010> resin<00:05:02.460> into<00:05:02.699> it<00:05:03.060> like

kind of press the resin into it like

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.490 
kind of press the resin into it like
this<00:05:03.770> if<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:04.979> have<00:05:05.190> multiple<00:05:05.880> dry<00:05:06.780> layers<00:05:07.139> of
