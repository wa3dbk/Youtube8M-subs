00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
normal ball would roll away so this ball

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030 
normal ball would roll away so this ball
can<00:01:24.060> bounce<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.080> actually<00:01:25.290> roll<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
can bounce and it can actually roll and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.300 
can bounce and it can actually roll and
that<00:01:26.640> they<00:01:27.180> won't<00:01:27.360> roll<00:01:27.600> away<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:29.130> very

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that they won't roll away it's very

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.539 
that they won't roll away it's very
lightweight<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.930> material<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
lightweight it has material in here that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.380 
lightweight it has material in here that
makes<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.150> noise<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:34.350> has<00:01:34.590> these<00:01:35.130> handles<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
makes a noise it has these handles on it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
makes a noise it has these handles on it
so<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> child<00:01:37.590> has<00:01:38.570> limited<00:01:39.979> mobility

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
so that if a child has limited mobility

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.170 
so that if a child has limited mobility
or<00:01:41.780> fine<00:01:42.780> motor<00:01:43.020> skills<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.530> missing<00:01:44.180> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
or fine motor skills are missing and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.120 
or fine motor skills are missing and
that<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.049> gross<00:01:46.320> motor<00:01:46.530> skills<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that that with gross motor skills a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.679 
that that with gross motor skills a
child<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.610> still<00:01:47.880> hold<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> ball<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.600> play

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
child can still hold the ball and play

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.050 
child can still hold the ball and play
with<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> ball<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> buddy<00:01:50.250> dog<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
with the ball so this is a buddy dog and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.260 
with the ball so this is a buddy dog and
it<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:51.990> suggested<00:01:52.170> by<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:53.180> therapist<00:01:54.180> that

to think about older children and so

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.580 
to think about older children and so
this<00:03:17.699> is<00:03:17.910> called<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.329> brain<00:03:18.540> gear<00:03:18.840> it's<00:03:19.410> a

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
this is called a brain gear it's a

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.589 
this is called a brain gear it's a
public<00:03:20.099> domain<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.790> probably<00:03:21.329> find<00:03:21.449> this

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
public domain you can probably find this

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.740 
public domain you can probably find this
on<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.959> on<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.530> internet<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.790> google<00:03:24.629> in

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
on the on the internet if you google in

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.960 
on the on the internet if you google in
I<00:03:25.079> think<00:03:25.349> its<00:03:25.440> brain<00:03:25.680> gear<00:03:25.980> what<00:03:26.639> I've<00:03:26.760> done<00:03:26.790> is

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
I think its brain gear what I've done is

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.330 
I think its brain gear what I've done is
modify<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.750> put<00:03:28.199> some<00:03:28.379> finger<00:03:28.680> pads<00:03:28.919> on<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
modify it put some finger pads on it

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.159 
modify it put some finger pads on it
like<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:29.699> so<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.120> can<00:03:30.269> be<00:03:30.389> held<00:03:30.629> in<00:03:30.840> one

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
like this so that it can be held in one

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.080 
like this so that it can be held in one
hand<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.069> gears<00:03:32.370> can<00:03:32.609> turn<00:03:32.849> with<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
hand and the gears can turn with the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.930 
hand and the gears can turn with the
other<00:03:33.269> hand<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:34.579> therapist<00:03:35.579> told<00:03:35.699> me<00:03:35.819> they

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
other hand and therapist told me they

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.900 
other hand and therapist told me they
would<00:03:36.060> call<00:03:36.239> us<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.419> fidget<00:03:37.280> all<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.519> toys<00:03:38.790> that
