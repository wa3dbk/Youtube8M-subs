Eureka that's correct yes they're all
Eureka<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.180> say<00:01:54.479> yes<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.080> name<00:01:55.260> Eureka<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.220> very

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
Eureka I say yes the name Eureka is very

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.010 
Eureka I say yes the name Eureka is very
historical<00:01:57.450> isn't<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
historical isn't it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.599 
historical isn't it
you<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.289> that<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.619> mind<00:01:58.829> when<00:01:59.039> you<00:01:59.130> named<00:01:59.369> it

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
you have that in mind when you named it

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.779 
you have that in mind when you named it
well<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.539> did<00:02:00.840> yes<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:02.039> low<00:02:02.189> volume

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
well we did yes the the low volume

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.690 
well we did yes the the low volume
industry<00:02:03.359> as<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.469> such<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.189> under<00:02:05.429> a<00:02:05.460> lot<00:02:05.520> of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
industry as as such was under a lot of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.469 
industry as as such was under a lot of
pressure<00:02:05.789> from<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:07.849> legal<00:02:08.849> system<00:02:09.179> shall<00:02:09.390> we

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
pressure from the legal system shall we

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.690 
pressure from the legal system shall we
say<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.869> was<00:02:10.019> becoming<00:02:10.440> almost<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.979> dying<00:02:11.430> art

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
say it was becoming almost a dying art

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.530 
say it was becoming almost a dying art
and<00:02:13.099> distinct<00:02:14.099> parallel<00:02:14.310> between<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.940> Eureka

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and distinct parallel between the Eureka

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.770 
and distinct parallel between the Eureka
rebellion<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.610> what<00:02:17.610> we're<00:02:17.760> about<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.629> was<00:02:18.720> a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
rebellion and what we're about it was a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.850 
rebellion and what we're about it was a
bit<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.049> statement<00:02:19.440> yes

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
bit of a statement yes

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.860 
bit of a statement yes
so<00:02:20.310> when<00:02:20.459> many<00:02:20.670> people<00:02:20.760> actually<00:02:21.090> buy<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> car

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
so when many people actually buy the car

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.770 
so when many people actually buy the car
do<00:02:21.989> they<00:02:22.140> say<00:02:22.349> Eureka<00:02:23.069> oh<00:02:23.280> are<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.239> asked<00:02:24.599> a

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
do they say Eureka oh are you asked a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.470 
do they say Eureka oh are you asked a
question<00:02:24.930> well<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.470> think<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.040> yes<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:27.120> guess

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
question well I think so yes I guess

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.869 
question well I think so yes I guess
that<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:28.440> once<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.799> person<00:02:29.160> bought<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.640> kit

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
that when once a person bought the kit

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.680 
that when once a person bought the kit
how<00:02:30.690> do<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.900> go<00:02:31.019> about<00:02:31.140> putting<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.739> together

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
how do you go about putting it together

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.030 
how do you go about putting it together
well<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.720> think<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.230> question<00:02:34.799> of<00:02:34.829> just

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
well I think it's a question of just

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.280 
well I think it's a question of just
simply<00:02:35.310> starting<00:02:35.730> with<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.000> VW<00:02:36.870> chassis

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
simply starting with the VW chassis

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.289 
simply starting with the VW chassis
which<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.099> owner<00:02:38.340> obviously<00:02:38.760> purchases

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
which the owner obviously purchases

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.330 
which the owner obviously purchases
whilst<00:02:39.599> we're<00:02:40.200> doing<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.620> actual<00:02:40.920> build<00:02:41.220> on

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
whilst we're doing the actual build on

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.380 
whilst we're doing the actual build on
the<00:02:41.459> kids<00:02:41.640> side<00:02:41.819> here<00:02:42.030> at<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.209> factory

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the kids side here at the factory

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.630 
the kids side here at the factory
they're<00:02:43.110> actually<00:02:43.380> Road<00:02:43.620> within<00:02:44.040> their<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
they're actually Road within their the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.080 
they're actually Road within their the
VW<00:02:45.030> chassis<00:02:45.239> which<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.950> basically<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.069> VW<00:02:47.849> earth

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
VW chassis which is basically a VW earth

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.809 
VW chassis which is basically a VW earth
of<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.599> body<00:02:48.810> removed<00:02:49.200> which<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.430> lot<00:02:50.760> of

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
of the body removed which a lot of

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.460 
of the body removed which a lot of
people<00:02:51.030> don't<00:02:51.120> realize<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.840> VW<00:02:52.230> chassis

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
people don't realize but the VW chassis

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.410 
people don't realize but the VW chassis
is<00:02:52.620> totally<00:02:52.980> self-sufficient<00:02:53.370> with<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> body

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
is totally self-sufficient with the body

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.940 
is totally self-sufficient with the body
removed<00:02:54.810> you've<00:02:55.049> still<00:02:55.230> got<00:02:55.380> things<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.799> the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
removed you've still got things like the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.550 
removed you've still got things like the
hand<00:02:56.940> brake<00:02:57.180> gear<00:02:57.450> stick<00:02:57.660> pedal<00:02:58.049> cluster<00:02:58.379> or

Ikea<00:02:59.010> still<00:02:59.519> in<00:02:59.640> its<00:02:59.760> normal<00:03:00.060> position<00:03:00.209> it's

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
Ikea still in its normal position it's

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.199 
Ikea still in its normal position it's
just<00:03:01.260> simply<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> matter<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.940> possibly<00:03:02.940> doing<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
just simply a matter of possibly doing a

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.780 
just simply a matter of possibly doing a
bit<00:03:03.329> of<00:03:03.359> basic<00:03:03.660> rewiring<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.760> of

be<00:03:07.829> driven<00:03:08.010> around<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.639> in<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.819> basic<00:03:09.510> shape

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
be driven around just in a basic shape

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.539 
be driven around just in a basic shape
the<00:03:10.230> speed<00:03:10.910> how<00:03:11.910> how<00:03:12.660> fast<00:03:13.019> would<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.350> go<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:14.040> I

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
the speed how how fast would I go if I

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.470 
the speed how how fast would I go if I
really<00:03:14.910> put<00:03:15.090> my<00:03:15.209> foot<00:03:15.420> down

really put my foot down

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.780 
really put my foot down
well<00:03:16.629> it<00:03:16.750> depends<00:03:17.080> largely<00:03:17.349> upon<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.069> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
well it depends largely upon the the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.150 
well it depends largely upon the the
