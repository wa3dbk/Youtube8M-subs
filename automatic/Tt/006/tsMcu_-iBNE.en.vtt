table<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.799> swipe

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
table you can see you can just swipe

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.590 
table you can see you can just swipe
through<00:01:23.189> them<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.570> any

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
through them like you would on any

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.100 
through them like you would on any
different<00:01:25.320> camera<00:01:26.509> let's<00:01:27.509> put<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.810> into

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
different camera let's put this into

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.830 
different camera let's put this into
horizontal<00:01:29.040> mode<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> larger

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
horizontal mode you can see get a larger

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.190 
horizontal mode you can see get a larger
image<00:01:31.280> just<00:01:32.280> swipe<00:01:32.549> through<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.000> well<00:01:33.200> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
image just swipe through it as well and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.280 
image just swipe through it as well and
I'm<00:01:34.439> pretty<00:01:34.619> sure<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:36.780> pinch

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
I'm pretty sure you can actually pinch

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.520 
I'm pretty sure you can actually pinch
in<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:38.189> zoom<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.689> shot<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.259> sharp

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
in to zoom and see if your shot is sharp

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.170 
in to zoom and see if your shot is sharp
so<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:41.280> another<00:01:41.520> pretty<00:01:41.729> cool<00:01:41.939> feature

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.249 

there<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> number<00:01:45.299> other<00:01:45.600> options<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
there are a number other options that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.600 
there are a number other options that
you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.890> delete<00:01:47.130> your<00:01:47.250> photo<00:01:47.490> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you can do you can delete your photo you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.149 
you can do you can delete your photo you
can<00:01:47.909> favorite<00:01:48.119> your<00:01:48.390> photo<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.040> also

can favorite your photo you can also
look<00:01:50.490> at<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.880> depth<00:01:51.810> information<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:53.369> can

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
look at the depth information you can

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.980 
look at the depth information you can
see<00:01:53.700> right<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.329> was<00:01:54.509> taken<00:01:54.810> at

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
see right here that this was taken at

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.609 
see right here that this was taken at
one<00:01:55.290> sixtieth<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.070> second<00:01:56.460> at<00:01:56.990> 3.3.5<00:01:57.990> with

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
one sixtieth of a second at 3.3.5 with

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.459 
one sixtieth of a second at 3.3.5 with
an<00:01:58.710> ISO<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.130> 800<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.840> quite<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> nice<00:02:01.229> way

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
an ISO of 800 so it's quite a nice way

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
an ISO of 800 so it's quite a nice way
to<00:02:01.500> actually<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.490> things<00:02:02.549> all<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
to actually see all these things all the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.880 
to actually see all these things all the
images<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.020> you've<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.350> taken<00:02:04.799> on

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
images that you've actually taken on

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.700 
images that you've actually taken on
your<00:02:05.610> camera<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.149> your<00:02:06.210> phone<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> next

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
your camera on your phone so the next

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.869 
your camera on your phone so the next
thing<00:02:07.860> we're<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.129> look<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
thing we're going to look at is the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.699 
thing we're going to look at is the
camera<00:02:09.209> settings<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> little<00:02:10.530> bit

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
camera settings now this is a little bit

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.110 
camera settings now this is a little bit
confusing<00:02:10.830> because<00:02:11.280> when<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.520> first<00:02:11.790> saw<00:02:11.970> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
confusing because when I first saw this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.340 
confusing because when I first saw this
I<00:02:12.330> was<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.629> okay<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.140> is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
I was like okay this is

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.140 
I was like okay this is
be<00:02:13.560> allowing<00:02:14.220> me<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.490> change<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> shutter

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
be allowing me to change the shutter

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.090 
be allowing me to change the shutter
speed<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.540> ISO<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.380> aperture<00:02:16.710> things<00:02:16.980> like

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
speed the ISO the aperture things like

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.160 
speed the ISO the aperture things like
that<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.910> actually<00:02:18.180> not<00:02:18.330> all<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:18.960> is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
that it's actually not all it is is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.220 
that it's actually not all it is is
allowing<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.280> change<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.700> date<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:20.910> time

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
allowing you to change the date and time

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.320 
allowing you to change the date and time
and<00:02:22.230> pretty<00:02:23.070> much<00:02:23.190> changing<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> area<00:02:24.120> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and pretty much changing the area and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.790 
and pretty much changing the area and
whether<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.140> daylight<00:02:25.470> savings

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
whether or not it's on daylight savings

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.310 
whether or not it's on daylight savings
time<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.600> useful<00:02:27.990> it's<00:02:28.200> not

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
time so it's kind of useful it's not

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.660 
time so it's kind of useful it's not
super<00:02:28.650> useful<00:02:28.680> sometimes<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.460> can<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.640> a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
super useful sometimes it can be a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.950 
super useful sometimes it can be a
little<00:02:29.790> bit<00:02:29.940> tricky<00:02:30.180> doing<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.630> camera

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
little bit tricky doing it in the camera

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.050 
little bit tricky doing it in the camera
but<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.760> actually<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
but as you can see this is actually the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.280 
but as you can see this is actually the
wrong<00:02:33.240> date<00:02:33.480> right<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.050> might<00:02:34.080> even

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
wrong date right now so it might even

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.560 
wrong date right now so it might even
change<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.740> but<00:02:35.550> essentially<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.270> can<00:02:36.390> change

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
change it but essentially you can change

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.050 
change it but essentially you can change
your<00:02:36.750> date<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.200> time<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.920> camera<00:02:38.250> hey

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
your date and time on the camera hey

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.430 
your date and time on the camera hey
guys<00:02:39.270> as<00:02:39.480> always<00:02:39.780> if<00:02:39.900> you're<00:02:40.020> enjoying<00:02:40.230> this

anyway<00:02:43.680> let's<00:02:43.860> check<00:02:44.010> out<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.190> few<00:02:44.430> more<00:02:44.550> Wi-Fi

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
anyway let's check out a few more Wi-Fi

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
anyway let's check out a few more Wi-Fi
features<00:02:45.330> on<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.540> camera<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.800> last

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
features on this camera so the last

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.500 
features on this camera so the last
thing<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.280> probably<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.640> most<00:02:47.910> useful<00:02:48.300> part

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
thing and probably the most useful part

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.390 
thing and probably the most useful part
of<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:48.930> app<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.620> remote<00:02:49.890> shooting<00:02:50.130> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
of this app is the remote shooting and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.310 
of this app is the remote shooting and
it's<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.550> really<00:02:50.730> cool<00:02:50.970> feature<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.270> have<00:02:51.450> so

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
it's a really cool feature to have so

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.510 
it's a really cool feature to have so
essentially<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:53.010> you're<00:02:53.100> seeing<00:02:53.310> right

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
essentially what you're seeing right

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.700 
essentially what you're seeing right
here<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:54.000> what<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.630> being<00:02:54.840> filmed<00:02:55.320> on<00:02:55.530> this

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
here is what is being filmed on this

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.100 
here is what is being filmed on this
camera<00:02:55.920> right<00:02:56.130> here<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:57.600> can<00:02:57.750> see<00:02:57.930> right

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
camera right here so you can see right

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.450 
camera right here so you can see right
now<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.500> camera<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:58.920> pointing<00:02:59.340> at

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
now that this camera is pointing at

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.850 
now that this camera is pointing at
these<00:02:59.670> vintage<00:03:00.360> cameras<00:03:00.690> behind<00:03:00.990> me<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.710> have

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
these vintage cameras behind me we have

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.230 
these vintage cameras behind me we have
a<00:03:01.890> lot<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.160> information<00:03:02.460> right<00:03:02.880> here<00:03:02.910> we've

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
a lot of information right here we've

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.570 
a lot of information right here we've
got<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:04.020> white<00:03:04.590> balance<00:03:04.800> we've<00:03:05.190> got<00:03:05.340> them<00:03:05.460> if

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
got the white balance we've got them if

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.360 
got the white balance we've got them if
it's<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:05.940> manual<00:03:06.390> focus<00:03:06.420> we've<00:03:06.990> got<00:03:07.230> how<00:03:08.130> large

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
it's on manual focus we've got how large

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.370 
it's on manual focus we've got how large
the<00:03:08.610> imager<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.150> we've<00:03:09.780> got<00:03:09.930> how<00:03:10.050> many<00:03:10.230> shots

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
the imager is we've got how many shots

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.560 
the imager is we've got how many shots
we<00:03:10.530> can<00:03:10.650> take<00:03:10.800> left<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.370> battery<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.210> eye<00:03:12.240> so

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
we can take left the battery the eye so

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.180 
we can take left the battery the eye so
pretty<00:03:13.110> much<00:03:13.200> everything<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.770> come<00:03:14.040> to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
pretty much everything you come to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.330 
pretty much everything you come to
expect<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.420> normal<00:03:15.960> camera<00:03:16.500> screen<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.040> now

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
expect on a normal camera screen is now

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.310 
expect on a normal camera screen is now
on<00:03:17.610> here<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:19.380> course<00:03:19.650> we<00:03:19.830> can<00:03:19.980> take<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.190> photo

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
on here of course we can take a photo

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.600 
on here of course we can take a photo
which<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.470> pretty<00:03:22.650> cool<00:03:22.860> just<00:03:23.220> by<00:03:23.310> hitting<00:03:23.460> the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
which is pretty cool just by hitting the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.910 
which is pretty cool just by hitting the
shutter<00:03:23.850> button<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:25.200> can<00:03:25.350> also<00:03:25.470> press<00:03:25.740> this

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
shutter button you can also press this

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.740 
shutter button you can also press this
button<00:03:26.130> here<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:26.790> it's<00:03:27.300> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.510> allow<00:03:27.690> you

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
button here and it's going to allow you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.210 
button here and it's going to allow you
to<00:03:27.960> change<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.320> settings<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:28.710> we<00:03:28.950> can<00:03:29.070> change

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
to change the settings so we can change

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.860 
to change the settings so we can change
our<00:03:29.400> shutter<00:03:29.580> speed<00:03:29.670> we<00:03:30.420> can<00:03:30.540> change<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
our shutter speed we can change the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.600 
our shutter speed we can change the
aperture<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.410> we<00:03:31.560> can<00:03:31.680> change<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.010> ISO<00:03:32.430> so

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
aperture and we can change the ISO so

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.780 
aperture and we can change the ISO so
let's<00:03:32.760> change<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.090> shutter<00:03:33.300> speed<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:34.790> started

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
let's change the shutter speed I started

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.940 
let's change the shutter speed I started
this<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.330> aperture<00:03:36.650> let's<00:03:37.650> change

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
this this is the aperture let's change

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.680 
this this is the aperture let's change
that<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.370> f/8<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.690> then<00:03:40.440> press<00:03:40.830> back<00:03:41.600> but<00:03:42.600> of

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
that to f/8 and then press back but of

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.880 
that to f/8 and then press back but of
course<00:03:42.870> we're<00:03:42.990> gonna<00:03:43.050> have<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.260> jump<00:03:43.440> up<00:03:43.530> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
course we're gonna have to jump up the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.250 
course we're gonna have to jump up the
ISO<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:44.940> we're<00:03:45.030> going<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.180> go<00:03:45.360> up<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.780> let's<00:03:46.170> say

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
ISO so we're going to go up to let's say

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.440 
ISO so we're going to go up to let's say
6400<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:48.200> then<00:03:49.200> why<00:03:49.650> not<00:03:49.800> change<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:53.450> shutter

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
6400 and then why not change the shutter

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.050 
6400 and then why not change the shutter
speed<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:56.990> one<00:03:57.990> thirtieth<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.650> second<00:03:59.060> so

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
speed to one thirtieth of a second so

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.100 
speed to one thirtieth of a second so
right<00:04:00.270> now<00:04:00.390> I'm<00:04:00.540> pretty<00:04:00.750> happy<00:04:00.900> with<00:04:01.050> that

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
right now I'm pretty happy with that

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.740 
right now I'm pretty happy with that
shot<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.560> what<00:04:01.680> I'm<00:04:01.740> going<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.890> do<00:04:02.600> let's<00:04:03.600> take

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
shot so what I'm going to do let's take

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.930 
shot so what I'm going to do let's take
a<00:04:03.780> shot<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.920> that's<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.130> really<00:04:05.370> cool<00:04:05.520> way<00:04:05.700> of

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
a shot so that's a really cool way of

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.450 
a shot so that's a really cool way of
having<00:04:06.210> a<00:04:06.540> remote<00:04:07.080> way<00:04:07.830> of<00:04:07.950> shooting<00:04:08.310> with

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
having a remote way of shooting with

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.740 
having a remote way of shooting with
your<00:04:08.550> camera<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.330> don't<00:04:09.480> need<00:04:09.600> an

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
your camera you don't need an

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.830 
your camera you don't need an
intervalometer<00:04:10.200> or<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> remote<00:04:11.360> an<00:04:12.360> actual

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
intervalometer or a remote an actual

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.510 
intervalometer or a remote an actual
remote<00:04:13.170> so<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.770> a<00:04:13.800> really<00:04:13.980> nice<00:04:14.100> way<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.430> it

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
remote so it's a really nice way and it

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.710 
remote so it's a really nice way and it
seems<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.760> be<00:04:14.850> working<00:04:14.940> really<00:04:15.150> quite<00:04:15.540> well

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
seems to be working really quite well

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.360 
seems to be working really quite well
there's<00:04:15.900> not<00:04:15.960> a<00:04:16.020> lot<00:04:16.080> of<00:04:16.200> lag<00:04:16.470> which<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.130> really

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
there's not a lot of lag which is really

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.180 
there's not a lot of lag which is really
quite<00:04:17.580> good<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:18.270> as<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.450> can<00:04:18.570> see<00:04:18.630> as<00:04:19.080> I<00:04:20.010> move

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
quite good so as you can see as I move

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.219 
quite good so as you can see as I move
this

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
this

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.560 
this
it's<00:04:22.229> really<00:04:22.500> quite<00:04:22.710> responsive<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.520> mean<00:04:24.510> I

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
it's really quite responsive I mean I

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.210 
it's really quite responsive I mean I
know<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.990> camera<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.590> very<00:04:25.710> close<00:04:26.190> to

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
know that the camera is very close to

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.200 
know that the camera is very close to
the<00:04:26.430> phone

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
the phone

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.939 
the phone
but<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.449> is<00:04:27.570> working<00:04:27.780> really<00:04:28.380> really<00:04:28.500> quite

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
but it is working really really quite

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.740 
but it is working really really quite
well<00:04:29.190> what<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:30.000> do<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.300> put<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:30.570> into

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
well what I do is put this into

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.540 
well what I do is put this into
autofocus<00:04:31.350> mode<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.830> we'll<00:04:32.100> see<00:04:32.250> just<00:04:32.280> how

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
autofocus mode and we'll see just how

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.240 
autofocus mode and we'll see just how
well<00:04:32.759> it<00:04:32.940> can<00:04:33.120> actually<00:04:33.270> autofocus<00:04:34.130> just<00:04:35.130> by

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
well it can actually autofocus just by

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.550 
well it can actually autofocus just by
using<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.580> touchscreen<00:04:36.229> so<00:04:37.229> you<00:04:37.289> can<00:04:37.410> see

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
using the touchscreen so you can see

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.990 
using the touchscreen so you can see
right<00:04:37.680> there<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.949> that's<00:04:38.370> come<00:04:38.639> into<00:04:38.850> focus

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
right there that that's come into focus

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.050 
right there that that's come into focus
right<00:04:39.389> there<00:04:40.520> essentially<00:04:41.520> all<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.789> need<00:04:41.940> to

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
right there essentially all you need to

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.590 
right there essentially all you need to
do<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:43.440> tap<00:04:43.800> on<00:04:44.120> wherever<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.210> want<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.509> be

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
do is tap on wherever you want it to be

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.499 
do is tap on wherever you want it to be
in<00:04:45.660> focus<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:47.460> actually<00:04:47.639> will<00:04:48.030> work<00:04:48.060> like

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
in focus and it actually will work like

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.360 
in focus and it actually will work like
that<00:04:48.570> now<00:04:49.380> one<00:04:49.590> thing<00:04:49.740> I<00:04:49.860> do<00:04:49.919> want<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.220> point

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
that now one thing I do want to point

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.370 
that now one thing I do want to point
out<00:04:50.580> is<00:04:50.729> that<00:04:50.759> this<00:04:51.090> doesn't<00:04:51.720> work<00:04:51.900> in<00:04:52.110> video

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
out is that this doesn't work in video

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.350 
out is that this doesn't work in video
mode<00:04:52.620> still<00:04:52.949> which<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.340> real<00:04:53.639> letdown<00:04:53.970> on

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
mode still which is a real letdown on

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.779 
mode still which is a real letdown on
the<00:04:54.780> Canon<00:04:55.050> 70d<00:04:55.350> it<00:04:55.680> didn't<00:04:55.949> work<00:04:56.070> either<00:04:56.310> but

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
the Canon 70d it didn't work either but

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.340 
the Canon 70d it didn't work either but
the<00:04:56.880> T<00:04:57.030> success<00:04:57.360> they<00:04:57.539> haven't<00:04:57.810> changed<00:04:58.259> this

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
the T success they haven't changed this

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.350 
the T success they haven't changed this
as<00:04:58.500> well<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:58.889> it's<00:04:59.009> only<00:04:59.190> good<00:04:59.580> for<00:04:59.789> stills

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
as well so it's only good for stills

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.330 
as well so it's only good for stills
shooting<00:05:00.780> mode<00:05:00.960> which<00:05:01.169> is<00:05:01.380> definitely<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:02.190> bit

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
shooting mode which is definitely a bit

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.860 
shooting mode which is definitely a bit
of<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.490> pity<00:05:02.669> but<00:05:03.210> I'm<00:05:03.300> sure<00:05:03.479> that<00:05:03.509> there's<00:05:03.810> a

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
of a pity but I'm sure that there's a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.760 
of a pity but I'm sure that there's a
reason<00:05:04.229> for<00:05:04.440> it

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
reason for it

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.950 
reason for it
so<00:05:05.490> pretty<00:05:05.699> much<00:05:05.789> guys<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.360> is<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.570> a

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
so pretty much guys that is the a

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.650 
so pretty much guys that is the a
general<00:05:07.440> overview<00:05:07.680> of<00:05:07.860> all<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.910> Wi-Fi

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
general overview of all of the Wi-Fi

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.529 
general overview of all of the Wi-Fi
features<00:05:10.050> of<00:05:10.259> course<00:05:10.860> you<00:05:11.430> can<00:05:11.699> actually<00:05:11.970> jump

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
features of course you can actually jump

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.330 
features of course you can actually jump
back<00:05:12.750> over<00:05:12.870> here<00:05:13.229> and<00:05:13.470> check<00:05:13.800> out<00:05:13.949> your<00:05:13.979> images

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
back over here and check out your images

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.310 
back over here and check out your images
and<00:05:14.460> once<00:05:14.639> you're<00:05:14.759> happy<00:05:14.849> with<00:05:15.030> them<00:05:15.330> you<00:05:16.169> can

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
and once you're happy with them you can

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.589 
and once you're happy with them you can
save<00:05:16.560> them<00:05:16.740> just<00:05:16.949> by<00:05:17.250> hitting<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.880> save<00:05:18.300> the

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
save them just by hitting the save the

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.029 
save them just by hitting the save the
image<00:05:18.900> button<00:05:19.229> and<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.530> will<00:05:19.650> work<00:05:19.680> as<00:05:20.009> well

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
image button and that will work as well

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.999 
image button and that will work as well
so<00:05:20.520> I<00:05:20.729> mean<00:05:21.150> you<00:05:21.270> can<00:05:21.590> do<00:05:22.590> some<00:05:22.740> remote

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
so I mean you can do some remote

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.499 
so I mean you can do some remote
shooting<00:05:23.220> see<00:05:23.580> what<00:05:23.759> you<00:05:23.849> want<00:05:24.060> change<00:05:24.270> your
