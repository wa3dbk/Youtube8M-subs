a really nice tight channel should whip

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.740 
a really nice tight channel should whip
a<00:02:01.770> little<00:02:02.219> bit<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:03.090> certainly<00:02:03.509> still

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
a little bit but certainly still

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.550 
a little bit but certainly still
manageable<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.420> head<00:02:06.630> this

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
manageable so really like this head this

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.930 
manageable so really like this head this
is<00:02:07.680> something<00:02:07.950> i<00:02:07.979> could<00:02:08.069> easily<00:02:08.340> pick<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.819> and
