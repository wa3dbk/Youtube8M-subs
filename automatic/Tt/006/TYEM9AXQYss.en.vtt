mineralization<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:01:00.270> gonna<00:01:00.390> take<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
mineralization I'm gonna take the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.399 
mineralization I'm gonna take the
sensitivity<00:01:01.230> down<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.680> about<00:01:01.859> five<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.199> we've

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
sensitivity down to about five and we've

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.719 
sensitivity down to about five and we've
got<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.680> third<00:01:04.860> signal<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.430> we're<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.640> to

got our third signal that we're going to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.010 
got our third signal that we're going to
dig<00:01:06.170> as<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> solid<00:01:08.400> 62<00:01:09.030> but

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
dig as you can see it's a solid 62 but

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.960 
dig as you can see it's a solid 62 but
techniques<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.010> also<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> pinpoint

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
techniques this also has a pinpoint

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.420 
techniques this also has a pinpoint
button<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.630> switch<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.500> got<00:01:14.340> to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.130 
was coming up as a 56 57 quite solid so
if<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.860> was<00:03:30.040> using<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.400> detector<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.330> would

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
if I was using this detector I would

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.420 
if I was using this detector I would
like<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.440> just<00:03:32.590> keep<00:03:32.739> an<00:03:32.860> eye<00:03:32.950> out<00:03:32.980> for<00:03:33.130> that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
like to just keep an eye out for that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.280 
like to just keep an eye out for that
because<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:34.030> did<00:03:34.180> test<00:03:34.390> call<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.840> home<00:03:34.989> that's

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
because I did test call the home that's

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.789 
because I did test call the home that's
coming<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.680> about<00:03:35.920> 47<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.620> gold

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
coming in about 47 so it is in the gold

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.570 
coming in about 47 so it is in the gold
range<00:03:39.220> but<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.970> think<00:03:40.570> after<00:03:40.980> enough<00:03:41.980> practice

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
range but I think after enough practice

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:53.290 
range but I think after enough practice
I<00:03:42.820> will<00:03:43.660> know<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> full<00:03:44.830> tab

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.590 

can<00:03:54.300> you<00:03:54.390> see<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:58.100> that's<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.310> telltale<00:04:00.180> sign

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
can you see that that's a telltale sign

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:17.410 
can you see that that's a telltale sign
of<00:04:00.930> iron<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.670> coin<00:04:06.860> ten<00:04:07.860> cents<00:04:13.220> on

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.810 

because<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.570> iron<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:19.019> there<00:04:19.549> so<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.610> generally

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
because the iron in there so I generally

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.060 
because the iron in there so I generally
I<00:04:21.120> don't<00:04:21.239> dig<00:04:21.660> those<00:04:21.870> I'll<00:04:22.410> go<00:04:22.620> for<00:04:22.770> silver

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
I don't dig those I'll go for silver

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.910 
I don't dig those I'll go for silver

your attack power picks up that ten

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.100

I don't think it's gonna be fall senior
but<00:05:22.950> we'll<00:05:23.100> see<00:05:24.440> discrimination<00:05:25.440> when<00:05:25.710> I

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
but we'll see discrimination when I

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.710 
but we'll see discrimination when I
leave<00:05:25.950> it<00:05:26.070> at<00:05:26.160> zero<00:05:26.460> I'm<00:05:27.180> just<00:05:27.419> going<00:05:27.540> to<00:05:27.570> try

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
surprised I think this is a great

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.320 
surprised I think this is a great
entry-level<00:06:25.770> machine<00:06:26.160> and<00:06:26.610> if<00:06:27.210> you're
