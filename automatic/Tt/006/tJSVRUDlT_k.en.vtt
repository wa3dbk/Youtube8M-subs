00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.440 
tech today i recently bought the 1300
Allah<00:00:04.680> gaming<00:00:05.069> pc<00:00:05.400> build<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.180> thought<00:00:06.390> he

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
Allah gaming pc build and I thought he

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.059 
Allah gaming pc build and I thought he
might<00:00:06.569> share<00:00:06.810> with<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.080> guys<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
might share with you guys and this is a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.430 
might share with you guys and this is a
very<00:00:08.280> very<00:00:08.490> nice<00:00:08.700> white<00:00:09.179> gaming<00:00:09.599> pc<00:00:10.019> build<00:00:10.230> and

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
very very nice white gaming pc build and

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.129 
very very nice white gaming pc build and
it<00:00:10.920> also<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.400> optimized<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:11.880> silence<00:00:12.509> so

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
it also is optimized for silence so

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.169 
it also is optimized for silence so
let's<00:00:13.530> not<00:00:13.679> waste<00:00:13.740> any<00:00:14.070> time<00:00:14.160> let's<00:00:14.849> jump

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
let's not waste any time let's jump

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.010 
let's not waste any time let's jump
right<00:00:15.269> in

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.020 

so<00:00:23.710> we're<00:00:23.860> the<00:00:23.920> CPU<00:00:24.280> in<00:00:24.370> this<00:00:24.520> bill<00:00:24.700> I've<00:00:24.910> gone

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
so we're the CPU in this bill I've gone

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.900 
so we're the CPU in this bill I've gone
with<00:00:25.210> the<00:00:25.300> intel<00:00:25.570> core<00:00:25.780> i5<00:00:26.040> 4690<00:00:27.040> k<00:00:27.220> this<00:00:27.760> is<00:00:27.880> a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
with the intel core i5 4690 k this is a

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.090 
with the intel core i5 4690 k this is a
3.5<00:00:28.570> year<00:00:28.840> it's<00:00:28.990> clock<00:00:29.230> speed<00:00:29.500> paired<00:00:29.950> with

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
3.5 year it's clock speed paired with

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.250 
3.5 year it's clock speed paired with
for<00:00:30.340> intel<00:00:30.790> cores<00:00:31.150> and<00:00:31.510> those<00:00:31.630> are<00:00:31.750> very<00:00:31.990> nice

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260 
for intel cores and those are very nice

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.620 
for intel cores and those are very nice
scores<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:32.920> also<00:00:33.730> would<00:00:33.910> not<00:00:34.060> make<00:00:34.180> any<00:00:34.390> sense

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
scores and also would not make any sense

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.420 
scores and also would not make any sense
to<00:00:34.720> step<00:00:34.960> up<00:00:35.080> to<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.260> 47<00:00:35.800> IDK<00:00:36.190> in<00:00:36.280> this

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
to step up to the 47 IDK in this

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.130 
to step up to the 47 IDK in this
situation<00:00:36.730> because<00:00:37.239> you<00:00:37.600> really<00:00:37.840> would<00:00:37.989> not

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
situation because you really would not

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.350 
situation because you really would not
be<00:00:38.320> gaining<00:00:38.560> any<00:00:38.860> FPS<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.640> especially<00:00:40.090> not

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
be gaining any FPS and especially not

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.000 
be gaining any FPS and especially not
for<00:00:40.480> your<00:00:40.629> additional<00:00:41.020> hundred<00:00:41.170> dollars<00:00:41.620> so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
for your additional hundred dollars so

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.770 
for your additional hundred dollars so
this<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.280> great<00:00:42.489> CPU<00:00:42.730> for<00:00:43.059> this<00:00:43.180> bill<00:00:43.360> so

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
this is a great CPU for this bill so

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.180 
this is a great CPU for this bill so
I've<00:00:43.900> decided<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.350> go<00:00:44.530> with<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.739> corsair

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
I've decided to go with the corsair

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.690 
I've decided to go with the corsair
h100i<00:00:45.970> liquid<00:00:46.480> cooler<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.110> this<00:00:47.800> is<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:47.920> 240

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
h100i liquid cooler and this is a 240

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.430 
h100i liquid cooler and this is a 240
millimeter<00:00:49.059> radiator<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:49.870> it<00:00:50.110> really<00:00:50.290> is<00:00:50.410> a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
millimeter radiator and it really is a

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.590 
millimeter radiator and it really is a
very<00:00:50.770> nice<00:00:50.980> cpu<00:00:51.430> cooler<00:00:51.790> it<00:00:52.090> will<00:00:52.239> keep<00:00:52.449> our

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
very nice cpu cooler it will keep our

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.689 
very nice cpu cooler it will keep our
cpu<00:00:53.199> nice<00:00:53.410> and<00:00:53.680> cool<00:00:53.920> even<00:00:54.489> if<00:00:54.580> it's

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
cpu nice and cool even if it's

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.490 
cpu nice and cool even if it's
overclocked<00:00:55.210> so<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:55.960> should<00:00:56.140> do<00:00:56.260> really

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
overclocked so it should do really

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.190 
overclocked so it should do really
nicely<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.910> for<00:00:58.120> this<00:00:58.239> build<00:00:58.480> I<00:00:58.600> decided<00:00:58.630> to<00:00:59.110> go

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
nicely so for this build I decided to go

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.729 
nicely so for this build I decided to go
with<00:00:59.290> an<00:00:59.410> MSI<00:00:59.800> z97<00:01:00.310> s<00:01:00.730> SLI<00:01:01.420> great<00:01:01.870> addition<00:01:02.350> and

really just a lot of features for that
price<00:01:24.160> point<00:01:24.220> so<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:24.820> do<00:01:24.940> recommend<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.479> for

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
price point so I do recommend that for

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.270 
price point so I do recommend that for
this<00:01:25.720> build<00:01:25.960> so<00:01:26.380> for<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.619> RAM<00:01:26.770> in<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.039> build

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
this build so for the RAM in this build

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.130 
this build so for the RAM in this build
I<00:01:27.490> decided<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:28.000> go<00:01:28.149> with<00:01:28.270> 8<00:01:28.509> gigabytes<00:01:28.569> of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
I decided to go with 8 gigabytes of

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.199 
I decided to go with 8 gigabytes of
Kingston<00:01:29.619> fury<00:01:29.890> white<00:01:30.250> series<00:01:30.670> memory<00:01:31.030> and

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209 
Kingston fury white series memory and

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.900 
Kingston fury white series memory and
this<00:01:31.569> is<00:01:31.720> clocked<00:01:31.929> in<00:01:32.080> 1866<00:01:32.830> megahertz<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.490> it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
this is clocked in 1866 megahertz and it

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.850 
this is clocked in 1866 megahertz and it
has<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.030> cast<00:01:34.270> latency<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:34.750> 10<00:01:35.050> that's<00:01:35.619> pretty

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
has a cast latency of 10 that's pretty

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.889 
has a cast latency of 10 that's pretty
good<00:01:36.069> for<00:01:36.130> memory<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:36.819> also<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.300> has<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.420> really

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.280 
storage I mean really don't need three
terabytes<00:02:18.970> but<00:02:19.239> he<00:02:19.330> wanted<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.660> have<00:02:19.780> plenty

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
terabytes but he wanted to have plenty

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.960 
terabytes but he wanted to have plenty
of<00:02:20.319> storage<00:02:20.650> for<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.980> future<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.670> that's<00:02:21.790> when

power supply shroud and that's what
those<00:03:18.760> SSDs<00:03:19.239> lay<00:03:19.450> on<00:03:19.540> top<00:03:19.569> of<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.349> won't

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
those SSDs lay on top of so you won't

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.140

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
eyes so this is a really really awesome

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.810 
eyes so this is a really really awesome
case<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.930> there<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.500> no<00:03:34.010> room<00:03:34.250> for<00:03:34.310> five<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:34.760> a

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
case and there is no room for five and a

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.730 
case and there is no room for five and a
quarter<00:03:34.970> inch<00:03:35.180> base<00:03:35.390> but<00:03:35.900> really<00:03:36.080> who<00:03:36.440> uses

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
quarter inch base but really who uses

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.770 
quarter inch base but really who uses
optical<00:03:37.070> drives<00:03:37.610> anymore<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:38.330> don't<00:03:38.570> really

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
optical drives anymore I don't really

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.830 
optical drives anymore I don't really
think<00:03:38.990> anyone<00:03:39.410> does<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.150> should<00:03:41.420> be<00:03:41.540> just

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
think anyone does so you should be just

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.840 
think anyone does so you should be just
fine<00:03:42.050> just<00:03:42.560> keep<00:03:42.740> in<00:03:42.920> mind<00:03:43.160> that<00:03:43.340> there<00:03:43.700> is

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
fine just keep in mind that there is

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.200 
fine just keep in mind that there is
none<00:03:44.060> when<00:03:44.270> you<00:03:44.360> do<00:03:44.480> purchase<00:03:44.750> this<00:03:45.050> case<00:03:46.210> so

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
none when you do purchase this case so

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.700 
none when you do purchase this case so
for<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.480> power<00:03:47.660> supply<00:03:47.960> in<00:03:48.020> this<00:03:48.200> build<00:03:48.410> we've

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
for the power supply in this build we've

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.560 
for the power supply in this build we've
decided<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.160> go<00:03:49.310> with<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.520> EVGA<00:03:49.850> supernova

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
decided to go with the EVGA supernova

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.010 
decided to go with the EVGA supernova
NEX<00:03:51.380> 650<00:03:52.250> watt<00:03:52.430> power<00:03:52.640> supply<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.330> this<00:03:53.900> is

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
NEX 650 watt power supply and this is

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.410 
NEX 650 watt power supply and this is
650<00:03:54.740> watts<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.130> course<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.550> it's<00:03:55.940> also<00:03:56.120> 80

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
650 watts of course and it's also 80

650 watts of course and it's also 80
plus<00:03:56.660> gold<00:03:56.780> certified<00:03:57.440> which<00:03:57.710> is<00:03:57.860> really<00:03:58.070> nice

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
plus gold certified which is really nice

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.940 
plus gold certified which is really nice
in<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.580> power<00:03:58.790> bill<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.330> also<00:04:00.290> which<00:04:00.800> is

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
in the power bill and also which is

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.250 
in the power bill and also which is
really<00:04:01.190> nice<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.610> is<00:04:02.000> fully<00:04:02.480> modular<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.200> you

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
really nice it is fully modular so you

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.450 
really nice it is fully modular so you
don't<00:04:03.410> have<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.620> deal<00:04:03.770> with<00:04:03.860> all<00:04:03.950> this<00:04:04.040> excess

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
don't have to deal with all this excess

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.250 
don't have to deal with all this excess
cables<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:05.060> really<00:04:05.270> do<00:04:05.450> not<00:04:05.570> need<00:04:05.930> and

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
cables that you really do not need and

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.500 
cables that you really do not need and
also<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.520> comes<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:07.820> at<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:07.970> very<00:04:08.270> reasonable

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
also it comes in at a very reasonable

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.960 
also it comes in at a very reasonable
price<00:04:08.810> about<00:04:09.320> sixty<00:04:09.710> five<00:04:09.860> dollars<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.820> this

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
price about sixty five dollars so this

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.760

is<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.090> very<00:04:11.450> very<00:04:11.750> good<00:04:11.990> power<00:04:12.230> supply<00:04:12.530> for<00:04:12.740> the

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
is a very very good power supply for the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.710 
is a very very good power supply for the
price<00:04:12.980> point<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.880> with<00:04:14.030> this<00:04:14.180> build<00:04:14.480> I've

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
price point so with this build I've

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.229 
price point so with this build I've
decided<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.200> throw<00:04:15.440> in<00:04:15.590> Windows<00:04:15.830> 8.1<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.670> this

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
decided to throw in Windows 8.1 and this

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.090 
decided to throw in Windows 8.1 and this
is<00:04:17.510> really<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.080> operating<00:04:18.709> system<00:04:18.950> that<00:04:19.070> i

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
is really the operating system that i

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.680 
is really the operating system that i
recommend<00:04:19.520> i<00:04:19.790> mean<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.150> can<00:04:20.239> go<00:04:20.330> with<00:04:20.450> windows

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
recommend i mean you can go with windows

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.390 
recommend i mean you can go with windows
seven<00:04:20.989> if<00:04:21.109> you'd<00:04:21.260> like<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.500> but<00:04:22.070> i<00:04:22.100> think

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
seven if you'd like to but i think

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.070 
seven if you'd like to but i think
windows<00:04:22.520> 8<00:04:22.820> is<00:04:22.970> really<00:04:23.270> nice<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:23.660> easy<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:24.050> use

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
windows 8 is really nice and easy to use

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.900 
windows 8 is really nice and easy to use
and<00:04:24.530> also<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:24.950> will<00:04:25.040> get<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.340> free<00:04:25.610> upgrade

and also you will get that free upgrade
to<00:04:26.030> Windows<00:04:26.300> 10<00:04:26.510> when<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:26.750> comes<00:04:26.960> around<00:04:27.080> and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
to Windows 10 when it comes around and

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.780 
to Windows 10 when it comes around and
you<00:04:27.770> can<00:04:27.890> always<00:04:28.070> get<00:04:28.220> rid<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.490> Start<00:04:28.730> menu

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.409 
decided to change out all the fans in
this<00:04:39.320> build<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:39.800> we've<00:04:40.370> gone<00:04:40.640> with<00:04:40.940> three

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
this build and we've gone with three

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.080 
this build and we've gone with three
coarser<00:04:42.110> AF<00:04:42.500> one<00:04:42.800> forty<00:04:43.190> millimeter<00:04:43.520> fans<00:04:43.820> and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
coarser AF one forty millimeter fans and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.210 
coarser AF one forty millimeter fans and
these<00:04:44.480> are<00:04:44.630> 140<00:04:45.320> mm<00:04:45.440> in<00:04:45.620> your<00:04:45.710> fans<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.070> their

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
these are 140 mm in your fans and their

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.950 
these are 140 mm in your fans and their
airflow<00:04:46.640> optimized<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:47.570> they'll<00:04:47.690> give<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:47.930> a

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
airflow optimized so they'll give you a

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.570 
airflow optimized so they'll give you a
really<00:04:48.260> nice<00:04:48.440> even<00:04:48.950> air<00:04:49.070> flow<00:04:49.310> throughout

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
really nice even air flow throughout

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.490 
really nice even air flow throughout
your<00:04:49.640> whole<00:04:49.940> case<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.480> that<00:04:51.020> means<00:04:51.230> there'd

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
your whole case and that means there'd

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.030 
your whole case and that means there'd
be<00:04:51.650> two<00:04:51.980> front<00:04:52.490> 140<00:04:53.120> miles<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.660> then<00:04:54.050> 1<00:04:54.410> 140

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
be two front 140 miles and then 1 140

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.340 
be two front 140 miles and then 1 140
exhaust<00:04:55.460> fan<00:04:55.790> so<00:04:56.300> that's<00:04:56.480> how<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.660> airflow

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
exhaust fan so that's how the airflow

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.590 
exhaust fan so that's how the airflow
we've<00:04:57.620> configured<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.340> way<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.700> on<00:04:59.300> the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
we've configured that way and on the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.600 
we've configured that way and on the
corsair<00:05:00.110> h100i<00:05:00.650> since<00:05:00.980> those<00:05:01.100> are<00:05:01.130> very<00:05:01.400> very

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
corsair h100i since those are very very

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.920 
corsair h100i since those are very very
loud<00:05:01.880> fans<00:05:02.270> most<00:05:02.660> of<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.840> are<00:05:02.900> probably

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
loud fans most of you are probably

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.600 
loud fans most of you are probably
familiar<00:05:03.200> with<00:05:03.500> that<00:05:03.590> we've<00:05:04.130> decided<00:05:04.430> to

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
familiar with that we've decided to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.750 
familiar with that we've decided to
change<00:05:04.820> those<00:05:04.970> out<00:05:05.180> for<00:05:05.510> two<00:05:05.800> corsair<00:05:06.800> sp120

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
change those out for two corsair sp120

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.670 
change those out for two corsair sp120
millimeter<00:05:08.300> fans<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.870> those<00:05:09.169> are<00:05:09.200> static

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
pressure fans those are really good with

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.270 
pressure fans those are really good with
radiators<00:05:12.230> so<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:12.800> should<00:05:12.980> do<00:05:13.040> really

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
radiators so that should do really

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.770 
radiators so that should do really
