law react to this week so hopefully the

law react to this week so hopefully the
one<00:02:12.870> drop

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
one drop

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.990 
one drop
again<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.670> nekom

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
again so I can get it and the nekom

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.570 
again so I can get it and the nekom
using<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.330> Acorn<00:02:16.750> of<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.900> dollar<00:02:17.080> tree

using the Acorn of the dollar tree

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.080 
using the Acorn of the dollar tree
because<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.670> can't<00:02:18.850> find<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.450> boe<00:02:20.110> one<00:02:20.410> for<00:02:20.740> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
because I can't find the boe one for a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.200 
because I can't find the boe one for a
reasonable<00:02:22.090> price<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:24.640> about<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.030> from

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
reasonable price and it's about it from

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.070 
reasonable price and it's about it from
my<00:02:25.420> gearing<00:02:26.260> part<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.100> this<00:02:27.190> video<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:29.050> I

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
my gearing part of this video so I

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.330 
my gearing part of this video so I
already<00:02:29.260> informed<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.010> four-piece

PvP<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.720> be<00:02:31.870> basically<00:02:32.770> destroyed

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
PvP is going to be basically destroyed

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.630 
PvP is going to be basically destroyed
for<00:02:33.700> hunters<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.210> PvE<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:35.310> definitely<00:02:36.310> you're

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
for hunters in PvE so definitely you're

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.830 
for hunters in PvE so definitely you're
going<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.820> have<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.060> try<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.330> get<00:02:37.480> your<00:02:37.660> tier

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
going to have to try and get your tier

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.000 
going to have to try and get your tier
now<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.210> another<00:02:40.210> thing<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.960> they<00:02:41.470> made<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:41.860> so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
now and another thing is they made it so

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.860 
now and another thing is they made it so
that<00:02:42.040> auto<00:02:42.550> shot<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.180> going<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.360> be<00:02:43.420> cast<00:02:43.630> on

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
that auto shot is going to be cast on

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.260 
that auto shot is going to be cast on
when<00:02:44.260> you're<00:02:44.380> moving<00:02:44.500> now<00:02:44.830> but<00:02:45.580> yeah<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.090> can

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
when you're moving now but yeah it can

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.720 
when you're moving now but yeah it can
be<00:02:46.300> like<00:02:46.810> use<00:02:47.050> when<00:02:47.290> you're<00:02:47.440> moving<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:48.190> you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
be like use when you're moving so you

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.190 
be like use when you're moving so you
don't<00:02:48.880> have<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.090> stutter<00:02:49.360> stuff<00:02:49.660> anymore<00:02:49.960> in

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
don't have to stutter stuff anymore in

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.640 
don't have to stutter stuff anymore in
PvE<00:02:50.530> which<00:02:50.860> makes<00:02:51.459> DPS<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:52.120> little<00:02:52.300> easier

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
PvE which makes DPS and a little easier

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.350 
PvE which makes DPS and a little easier
and<00:02:53.650> they<00:02:53.800> also<00:02:53.950> fixed<00:02:54.520> they<00:02:54.880> made<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:55.330> that

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
and they also fixed they made it so that

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.100 
and they also fixed they made it so that
trap<00:02:55.780> one<00:02:56.020> for<00:02:56.260> distracting<00:02:57.040> shot<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.110> I

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
trap one for distracting shot and I

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.510 
trap one for distracting shot and I
think<00:02:59.860> one<00:03:00.459> other<00:03:00.610> PvP<00:03:01.570> ability<00:03:02.310> they<00:03:03.310> make<00:03:03.490> it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
think one other PvP ability they make it

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.949 
think one other PvP ability they make it
so<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.880> your<00:03:04.420> auto<00:03:04.600> shot<00:03:04.990> doesn't<00:03:05.290> basically

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
so that your auto shot doesn't basically

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.080 
so that your auto shot doesn't basically
negate<00:03:07.959> what<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.410> did<00:03:08.640> because<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.880> it

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
negate what you just did because it it

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.449 
negate what you just did because it it
casts<00:03:10.630> while<00:03:10.810> moving<00:03:11.110> now<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.980> basically<00:03:12.280> you

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
casts while moving now so basically you

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.980 
casts while moving now so basically you
can't<00:03:12.670> come<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:12.970> control<00:03:13.360> when<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:13.780> going<00:03:13.900> to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
can't come to control when it's going to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.780 
can't come to control when it's going to
it's<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:14.200> going<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.470> happen<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:15.459> they<00:03:15.610> made

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
it's just going to happen so they made

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.580 
it's just going to happen so they made
it<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.360> can't<00:03:16.600> like<00:03:16.780> break<00:03:17.170> your<00:03:17.350> CC

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
it so that you can't like break your CC

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.170 
it so that you can't like break your CC
year<00:03:17.890> something<00:03:18.280> like<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.550> because<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:19.060> it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
year something like that because of it

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.720 
year something like that because of it
so<00:03:19.750> that's<00:03:19.930> pretty<00:03:20.140> nice<00:03:21.660> we<00:03:22.660> did<00:03:22.810> californian

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
so that's pretty nice we did californian

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.680 
so that's pretty nice we did californian
a<00:03:24.730> server<00:03:25.330> first<00:03:26.040> we<00:03:27.040> want<00:03:27.550> actually<00:03:28.090> spent<00:03:28.660> a

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
a server first we want actually spent a

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.670 
a server first we want actually spent a
lot<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.810> work<00:03:29.019> on<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.470> then<00:03:29.560> we've

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
lot of work on it and then we've

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.759 
lot of work on it and then we've
one-shotted<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.480> at<00:03:31.480> two<00:03:31.750> days<00:03:31.900> ago<00:03:32.110> so<00:03:32.650> that

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
one-shotted it at two days ago so that

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.340 
one-shotted it at two days ago so that
was<00:03:32.890> pretty<00:03:33.610> nice<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.720> hay<00:03:34.870> string<00:03:35.200> could

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
was pretty nice the hay string could

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.150 
was pretty nice the hay string could
dropped<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.010> went<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.340> our<00:03:36.489> road<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.950> I

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
dropped and that went to our road and I

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.449 
dropped and that went to our road and I
guess<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:39.670> give<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:39.880> guys<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> little<00:03:41.459> some

things aspect to the wild if you don't
have<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:56.019> resistance<00:03:56.560> for<00:03:56.980> because<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.459> the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
have the resistance for because of the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.070 
have the resistance for because of the
lightning<00:03:59.130> discharges<00:04:00.130> our<00:04:00.310> nature<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.630> if

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
lightning discharges our nature so if

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.110 
lightning discharges our nature so if
you<00:04:02.320> pop<00:04:02.950> wild<00:04:03.250> right<00:04:03.580> before<00:04:03.850> they<00:04:03.940> go<00:04:04.090> off

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
you pop wild right before they go off

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.509 
you pop wild right before they go off
you<00:04:05.050> know<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.200> can<00:04:05.470> definitely<00:04:05.980> be<00:04:06.130> saving

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
you know you can definitely be saving

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.220 
you know you can definitely be saving
your<00:04:06.700> aid<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.239> know<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.390> lot<00:04:07.720> of<00:04:07.750> damage<00:04:08.050> that

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
your aid you know a lot of damage that

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.600 
your aid you know a lot of damage that
the<00:04:08.560> healers<00:04:08.830> would<00:04:08.950> have<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.190> heal<00:04:09.340> through

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
the healers would have to heal through

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.850 
the healers would have to heal through
which<00:04:10.450> no<00:04:10.690> healers<00:04:11.170> are<00:04:11.200> going<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.410> go<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:11.680> on

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
which no healers are going to go in on

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.250 
which no healers are going to go in on
that<00:04:11.980> flight<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:12.730> definitely<00:04:13.630> if<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.110> don't

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
that flight so definitely if you don't

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.259 
that flight so definitely if you don't
have<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.500> resistance<00:04:15.070> use<00:04:15.400> use<00:04:15.820> aspect<00:04:16.209> to

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
have the resistance use use aspect to

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.030 
have the resistance use use aspect to
the<00:04:16.359> wild<00:04:16.690> even<00:04:16.959> if<00:04:17.049> it's<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.320> note<00:04:17.440> with<00:04:17.620> TPS

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
the wild even if it's a note with TPS

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.030 
the wild even if it's a note with TPS
balls<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:19.109> another<00:04:20.109> thing<00:04:20.380> is<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.859> want<00:04:21.010> to

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
balls and another thing is you want to

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.880 
balls and another thing is you want to
glyph<00:04:21.280> after<00:04:21.700> strike<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.500> can<00:04:23.680> wrap

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
glyph after strike so that you can wrap

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.190 
glyph after strike so that you can wrap
the<00:04:24.039> strike<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:25.360> may<00:04:25.539> lay<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.810> ball<00:04:25.930> straight

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
the strike you may lay the ball straight

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.510 
the strike you may lay the ball straight
before

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
before

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.300 
before
about<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.849> do<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.770> dell<00:04:28.770> lightning<00:04:29.099> charge

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
about to do is the dell lightning charge

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.159 
about to do is the dell lightning charge
and<00:04:29.580> then<00:04:29.819> when<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.449> take<00:04:30.629> twenty<00:04:30.870> percent

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
and then when you take twenty percent

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.700 
and then when you take twenty percent
less<00:04:31.349> damage<00:04:31.770> for<00:04:32.840> five<00:04:33.840> seconds<00:04:34.289> so<00:04:34.410> i<00:04:34.440> think

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
less damage for five seconds so i think

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.040 
less damage for five seconds so i think
i<00:04:35.069> probably<00:04:35.430> use<00:04:35.729> raptor<00:04:36.060> strike<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.930> I'm

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
i probably use raptor strike so I'm

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.119 
i probably use raptor strike so I'm
watch<00:04:37.169> on<00:04:37.349> that<00:04:37.470> fight<00:04:37.650> because<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:37.949> can<00:04:38.069> do

watch on that fight because you can do
it<00:04:38.220> on<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.400> platforms<00:04:38.849> to<00:04:38.940> makes<00:04:39.900> it<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.110> whole

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
it on the platforms to makes it a whole

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.490 
it on the platforms to makes it a whole
lot<00:04:40.379> easier<00:04:40.800> on<00:04:41.370> your<00:04:41.639> healers<00:04:42.180> it's<00:04:43.110> for<00:04:43.319> sure

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
lot easier on your healers it's for sure

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.129 
lot easier on your healers it's for sure
yeah<00:04:44.340> it's<00:04:44.789> good<00:04:45.030> for<00:04:45.180> Rattlers<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.629> reduce<00:04:45.990> the

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
yeah it's good for Rattlers I reduce the

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.629 
yeah it's good for Rattlers I reduce the
damage<00:04:46.229> taken<00:04:46.530> by<00:04:46.710> twenty<00:04:46.979> percent<00:04:47.250> for<00:04:47.460> five

damage taken by twenty percent for five

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.390 
damage taken by twenty percent for five
seconds<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.590> basically<00:04:49.590> it's<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:49.979> it's<00:04:50.280> only

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
seconds and basically it's on it's only

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.589 
seconds and basically it's on it's only
make<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.580> five<00:04:50.729> second<00:04:51.000> cooldown<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.389> you<00:04:51.479> can

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
make a five second cooldown so you can

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.300 
make a five second cooldown so you can
spam<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.960> on<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.139> platforms<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.800> phase<00:04:52.949> 2<00:04:53.159> as
