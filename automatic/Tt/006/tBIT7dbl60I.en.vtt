00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.290 
Jack what I have is from bucket PC text
is<00:04:42.289> an<00:04:42.830> additional<00:04:43.370> splitter<00:04:43.819> so<00:04:44.120> you've<00:04:44.270> got

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
is an additional splitter so you've got

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.420 
is an additional splitter so you've got
one<00:04:44.719> splitter<00:04:45.409> that<00:04:45.499> came<00:04:45.860> with<00:04:46.099> the<00:04:46.219> phone

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
one splitter that came with the phone

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.239 
one splitter that came with the phone
and<00:04:46.789> then<00:04:47.419> I<00:04:47.840> actually<00:04:48.680> have<00:04:49.039> another

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:49.249 
and then I actually have another

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:52.029 
and then I actually have another
splitter<00:04:49.729> that<00:04:49.789> splits<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.539> headset<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.319> the

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
splitter that splits the headset and the

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.260 
splitter that splits the headset and the
headphone<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.759> this<00:04:52.969> has<00:04:53.240> a

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
headphone and this has a

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.219 
headphone and this has a
three-and-a-half<00:04:53.990> millimeter<00:04:54.289> jack<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:56.229> that

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
three-and-a-half millimeter jack so that

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.219 
three-and-a-half millimeter jack so that
ends<00:04:57.590> up<00:04:57.680> being<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:59.120> way<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.599> have<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.080> use

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
ends up being the way I have to use

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.200 
ends up being the way I have to use
headphones<00:05:00.710> with<00:05:01.009> this<00:05:01.249> but<00:05:01.550> obviously<00:05:01.969> with

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
headphones with this but obviously with

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.999 
headphones with this but obviously with
its<00:05:02.389> Bluetooth<00:05:02.840> capability<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:05.240> phone

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
its Bluetooth capability the phone

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.490 
its Bluetooth capability the phone
doesn't<00:05:07.009> really<00:05:07.310> need<00:05:07.580> wired<00:05:07.939> headsets<00:05:08.569> so

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
doesn't really need wired headsets so

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.429 
doesn't really need wired headsets so
this<00:05:09.770> is<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:09.949> nice<00:05:10.219> thought<00:05:10.639> but<00:05:11.509> they<00:05:12.199> didn't

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:12.439 
this is a nice thought but they didn't
