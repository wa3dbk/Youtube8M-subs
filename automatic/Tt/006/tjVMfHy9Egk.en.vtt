00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.480
 welcome to the metabolism tv your source 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.890
 of correct information about the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.930
 metabolism and health coconut sugar and 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 fran suÃ¡rez specialist in obesity and 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.740
 metabolism 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.980
 we want to talk today about 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.210
 a question that a person asks us and 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.150
 other people have also made us a 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.940
 similar question concerning something that 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.710
 called coconut sugar they know that in many 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.900
 occasions we have spoken in the book 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.610
 power of metabolism and metabolism tb 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.680
 we talked about the benefits of oil 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.930
 coconut coconut oil is explained a lot 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.879
 in the book around here I have a bottle of 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.100
 coconut oil this is a special that 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.140
 we use that the coconut temples that 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.730
 comes mixed with a special enzyme 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.199
 Japanese and all that 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.760
 Coconut oil is very beneficial for 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.290
 raise the metabolism and we've talked it 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.070
 on different occasions besides the book 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.250
 now the coconut plant also produces 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.380
 a sugar and that sugar there are people who 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.630
 they ask us if it's good if it's bad if 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.659
 fattening has a goal from and not you 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.700
 I want to explain that topic at once 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.080
 answer another similar subject that is the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.270
 subject of the questions people that we 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.979
 they ask about the agave especially 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.470
 in Mexico they ask us about the agave 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.030
 which is also another type of sugar that 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.970
 comes from the plants 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.969
 I'm going for a little while, because I want 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.070
 that they understand and really do not go to 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.760
 fall into the error of thinking that because 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.250
 something comes 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.290
 certain sites suit you when you 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.940
 the truth is that I'm not a fan of 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.180
 coconut of coconut oil because because 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.140
 I see the results but 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.670
 Coconut sugar is not going to help you 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.200
 will help you apply it because now 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.000
 look 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.790
 There are different types of sugars 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.690
 the common table sugar that we 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.500
 we eat is composed of a molecule 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.569
 which has two parts 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.909
 one part is fructose 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.569
 what is fructose is called fructose because 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:16.280
 comes from fruits and another part is 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.389
 glucose is a different type of sugar 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.290
 which is the one that runs in the blood of 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:24.999
 we join you fructose and glucose 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.999
 and you have sugar 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.670
 of which you use to pour coffee 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.260
 of which is on the tables in the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.630
 restaurants and other common sugar and 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.550
 white crystalline current that we 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.660
 we know is always composed in half 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.030
 of fructose half glucose now the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.070
 sugar that runs through our blood with 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.450
 the one that our body feeds and the 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:50.420
 brain cells and all is the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.670
 glucose this is the one that when it goes up a lot 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.880
 diabetic diabetes is out of control 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.930
 this is the one that when it goes up a lot 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.030
 combined with insulin 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.450
 what is produced in the pancreas here is 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.790
 the body and here is the stomach and 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.430
 over here is the pancreas and the pancreas 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.189
 which is here produces a hormone 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.859
 which is called insulin and insulin 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:17.530
 combined to glucose will produce 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.329
 fat as we've seen in the book the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.889
 power of the metabolism that is that you 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.069
 combines a lot of glucose with a lot of insulin 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.450
 and have guaranteed you will get fat 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.359
 because that's the way the body 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.810
 create the fat then all that 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.440
 increases glucose 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.700
 or increase insulin and both at the same time 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.830
 it's definitely going to cause fat so 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.750
 both the strategy to lose weight for 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.840
 lose weight to control diabetes 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.420
 is to reduce insulin and reduce 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.060
 glucose if you reduce these two from 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.380
 Surely you will lose weight and go to 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.640
 control diabetes is going to feel 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.890
 much better and you will see much less 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.690
 inflammation and sleep better and its state 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.450
 emotional is better the disease all 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.060
 it is controlled by controlling being 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.730
 let's say the chaos that exists in the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.910
 whole planet the obesity epidemic 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.920
 in adult children and others the lack of control 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.530
 of the diabetes epidemic comes by 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.110
 excess glucose that is produced by 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.210
 excess of these types of sugars 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.220
 but going back to the question this 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.130
 person asks us about sugar is 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.510
 flame sugar 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.700
 of cobo 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.370
 good the coconut palm 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.250
 It's a little bad here done 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.260
 have I starve to death by drawing the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.340
 coconut palm has a fruit that is 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.880
 called the coconut that its fruit that coconut 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:45.740
 inside has the coconut oil has a 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.210
 cremita a telita and if that is squeezed and 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.040
 the coconut oil is extracted from the oil 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.080
 Coconut is very beneficial 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.850
 we've seen in other episodes it's fine 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.160
 beneficial because it is a triglycerides 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.260
 medium chain is a saturated fat 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.390
 but it's not a saturated fat equal to the 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.120
 of pork is a very saturated fat 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.710
 healthy is a very small molecule 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.960
 that the body uses it to lift 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.610
 metabolism helps you lose weight 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.550
 helps to kill fungus help kills 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.980
 parasite this is antiviral sake kills 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.330
 virus and others like herpes and so on 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.479
 that coconut oil is very good now 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.120
 this plant at a certain time of the year 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.180
 It also has a flower and flowers 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.220
 A) Yes 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.350
 it does not look like a flower like that 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:34.930
 as pointy that flower if one the 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:40.800
 squeeze the moment it is flowered 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:43.169
 then a sap comes out and that sap is a 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.240
 form of 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:51.139
 fructose is a sugar 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.740
 it's sugar people who have palms that 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.530
 they have these sites of many palms that 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.410
 develop in the coconut plantations for 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:04.190
 take out the coconut oil they have also 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.139
 taken advantage of the coconut flower and the 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.900
 coconut flower they get that fructose that 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.190
 sap in fact one of the ways that 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.730
 they take it out is that they give it like a cut 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:19.120
 cut and that starts to go down when you go to 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.190
 be collecting and collecting that liquid that 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.050
 is full of fructose that book that 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.990
 is full of fructose is very sweet 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.170
 because it's fructose and goes through a 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.140
 process where it basically evaporates and 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.330
 it turns into crystals crystals that 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.210
 it looks like sugar 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.819
 sugar as crystalline are crystals of 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.349
 fructose some people think that 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:44.560
 by the fact that coconut oil is 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:46.389
 very healthy then think of a story 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.509
 it must also be that the sugar of 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:52.930
 coconut is very healthy let me tell you that 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:54.849
 I have bad news, it is not everything 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.599
 make it sugar, especially if it's 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:00.039
 fructose is extremely harmful 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.300
 I know that there are people out there who 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:03.340
 they are hearing me that maybe they are 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.840
 naturist media and have heard of their 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.889
 naturopathic doctor or some other 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.629
 person that fructose is better or have 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.490
 even heard from your doctor that the 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:14.319
 fructose is better fructose is nothing 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.330
 Maybe it's the worst thing that can happen to 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.650
 human body this in fact we're going to 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.690
 make an episode apart from nothing more than 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.669
 to explain the damages that the 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.259
 fructose in the body but at the moment it is 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.110
 important that you know that sugar 

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:28.750
 of coconut is not good for you because 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.520
 because it's fructose and fructose though 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.349
 Do not get too high glucose causes a 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.930
 effect that you do not want what 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:36.249
 they call insulin resistance makes 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.499
 your body 

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:40.779
 resist insulin and resist 

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:44.139
 to insulin cause obesity so 

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:48.009
 be careful with the coconut sugar we put in 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:50.559
 the same package the agave the agave that 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:53.139
 It is also a fructose produced by 

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:56.679
 there a lot in Mexico is also fructose 

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:58.539
 so coconut sugar or fructose or not 

00:07:56.679 --> 00:08:02.579
 I recommend it and I do not recommend it 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:02.579
 because the truth always triumphs
