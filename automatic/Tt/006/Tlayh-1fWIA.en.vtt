00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and it's pretty convenient just to grab

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.979 
and it's pretty convenient just to grab
it<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.969> make<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:47.100> natural<00:00:47.399> way<00:00:47.840> is<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it and make it the natural way is a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.260 
it and make it the natural way is a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
little more bland in flavor so I find

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.720 
little more bland in flavor so I find
mixing<00:00:52.079> some<00:00:52.230> berries<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> makes<00:00:53.610> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
