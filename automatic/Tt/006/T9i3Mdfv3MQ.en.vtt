 off the coast of Morocco my mother is distinguished by a subtropical climate that 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.649
 it is worthwhile to benefit throughout the year the clemency temperature 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:13.519

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.759
 long exercised on this island yes they always loved coming to rest 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.349
 and then let's not forget the local traditions 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.869
 starting with that of Madeira wine a fortified wine to consume 

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:47.860
 with moderation so for us interrupts the fermentation in him 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.820
 adding alcohol 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.680
 it will be divided into four categories 5 2007 2012 many 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.770
 its essential particularity is not its mode of maturation 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.020
 which is done in oak barrel in the echo sealier to love his material 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.110
 it seems to me when we have the same constraints as others 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.379
 all year but it's worth it to sign in Lyon to make a very beautiful 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.809
 way effort 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.879
 for the moment that one thing to surpass you artificial pancreas indicates 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.969
 this study 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.760
 a study in the form of large wooden vats 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.930
 where the wine is heated at 40 degrees for three months which equates to 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.930
 three years in oak barrels 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:30.599
 but if the Madeira wine plays an important role in the economy of the island there 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.939
 should not be neglected the other great tradition of Madeira the 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:34.900
 embroidery 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.880
 it has long been considered the most beautiful and the finest at 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.779
 world 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.120
 we always plan on the best quality of shots 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.110
 for example 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.569
 the 3d by one of their discussions 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:46.809
 cameras 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:48.730
 the cliché of the two giants quality 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.289
 several employees 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.419
 it's also the job that's fine it knows something 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.639
 a big step forward 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.380
 hecquet lasts a very long time 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.780
 his part how 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.880
 a job that I stick to dark skin this event just one 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.690
 did for example could be 45 years old still going well 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.740
 and to come up with this amazing level of secret video quality 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.030
 if the embroidery designs are designed in the workshops by 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.120
 specialists who are at the top of their art 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.080
 they know how magnified the work of the workers the embroiderers herself 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.039
 work at home they are paid to the point 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.210
 once their work completed they finished retouched in the premises of 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.599
 the factory before being washed and ironed with the utmost care 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.039
 because an embroidery of Madeira 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.939
 it must last a lifetime 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:35.819
 another historically important tradition even though it's done 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:37.500
 rarer today basketry 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.979

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:49.559
 mid-2010 he also had in mountain relations his fighters 

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:52.360
 do not step on the feet in the dish for the future 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.740
 the end of the year said m thanks to a leap in the index we say however 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.490
 confident 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.490
 to leave their home they consider as businesses 

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:06.089
 but to fully find the madeleine do not hesitate to take advantage 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:08.820
 of the wooden niche we use body to ride 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.270
 in the suburbs of the capital 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.440

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.479
 Guaranteed emotions 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:18.169
 finally if the beautiful is an everlasting flower island 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:18.930
