00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.320
 Hi, I'm the vine and it's a little talk 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.180
 of shift lenses or also 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.180
 known as central swingarms 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.050
 specifically these two 24 millimeters of 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.650
 canon 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.369
 the model plus 2 canon also manufactures a 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.410
 17 mm model another 45 and another 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.800
 of 90 and you also have them available 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.050
 in houses brands ni con or sneijder that 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.110
 they have to make mounts for so much canon 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.500
 as unique and if in case it does not 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.020
 you have a unique canon you can always 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.110
 buy adapters for sounds fugees 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.140
 etcetera that will allow you to use these 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.090
 lenses in said cameras these lenses 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.360
 they have two movements one of 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.340
 muscle and other displacement that 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.260
 we'll see later it's exactly 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.730
 what they are and on the other hand a 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.710
 very important characteristic of them 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.360
 is that apart from being quite more 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.240
 complicated to use well 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.070
 are the approach is manual do not have 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.340
 autofocus no these lenses 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.840
 confirm in focus when more or less 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.070
 has the focus you appear the point that 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.840
 is confirmed but the approach is 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 manual that is not a lens that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.870
 you must use for a wedding and so on 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.820
 what is the advantage of these lenses 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.080
 we are saying that we are complicated 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.450
 to use 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.730
 that the focus is manual you can not use 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.950
 autofocus what is the benefit which which 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.470
 is the attractiveness of having a lens 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.920
 you are using an atypical of a normal and 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.040
 current 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.200
 good usually these glasses are usually 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.510
 associate with people who do photography 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.940
 architecture because they will allow you 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.770
 when you photograph a building after 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.910
 when that photo depends on how you have the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.110
 camera usually seems that the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.940
 building is thrown back or that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.200
 is that not forward with these 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.120
 lenses you're going to get not receive 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.890
 correct that effect the camera does not 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.100
 then it is necessary to process it 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.009
 photoshop lightroom 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.110
 while depending on what 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.759
 we want to do we can get change 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.520
 the focus plane of the camera 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.959
 usually this is our sensor 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.239
 from our camera up here the sensor or 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.370
 movie or whatever and if we're 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.030
 focusing here 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.090
 the focus plane will grow according to 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.220
 put or decrease 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.860
 the opening will have more or less 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.170
 approach in a direction perpendicular to 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.569
 our sensor with these lenses what 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.120
 we get is that address where 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.849
 the focus is growing as we have 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.860
 greater or lesser opening instead of being so 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.379
 with respect to the sensor if we have thus the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.629
 camera may be that way it may be 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.700
 so in changing the angle that we 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.980
 will allow for example a landscape 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.110
 with openings more openings 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.329
 ideal for the lens that can be an f 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:57.569
 8 or so get everything focused 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.700
 from the plants that we have or the 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.860
 detail that we have just attached to 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.890
 the lens to the mountains that we have 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:09.420
 or what we have more in the end all this 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.510
 without having to resort to putting a f1 16 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.019
 11 22 that will always make the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.329
 image comes out more blurred or without having 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.660
 to resort to taking several photos 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.640
 focused on different distances and 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.200
 then united in photoshop then 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.739
 let's see a little bit how are these 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.739
 movements 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.510
 as I told you this kind of glasses 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.290
 has two movements one of shift or 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.290
 displacement 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.189
 that as we can see we can do it 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.990
 both up or down or if 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.390
 we turn the lens 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.730
 we can do it right 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.269
 to the left 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:59.080
 and on the other hand once we leave again 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:02.050
 the mind in its normal position we have 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.820
 a tilt shift that 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.370
 As I told you, it's good to change the 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.100
 Focus plane and get more focused 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.960
 or less and get different effects 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.730
 of blur that we have not gotten 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.040
 with other lenses 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.620
 so with that basically they are both 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.269
 movements that have such lenses 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.550
 on the other side basically what we have 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.280
 in this case in this particular model are 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.540
 locks in this way 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.560
 we take and fix 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:34.380
 a little the displacement we want 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.110
 We blocked and now even though 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.960
 accidentally touch the lens we 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.580
 will be fixed in a single position and 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.800
 same happens 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.849
 for the movement of displacement not 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.169
 we can unlock it 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:54.639
 and block and in this way we are left 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:57.580
 fixed in its concrete position by another 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:01.289
 side this concrete model has a 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:06.569
 block even more beast that exist here 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.569
 agree if we activate it, it leaves me 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.789
 this blocks us the displacement and we 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.039
 ok for when we want to save the 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.930
 lens inside the backpack is also 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.380
 advisable that once we have the 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.449
 enter the backpack always the 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.729
 we have a position more or less by 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.280
 define the rest is to say that it is not 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.060
 moved neither vertically nor horizontally 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.030
 and that is not of this entry 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.770
 and finally to finish 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.600
 simply with a small vision 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.050
 general of the movements that have the 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.110
 lens is in concrete is to say that this 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.449
 canon model and together with 17 of 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.599
 canon 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.189
 are the only models that allow 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.590
 do this is to say I am moving 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:55.719
 right now the axis of displacement and 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.980
 I can move independently of the 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:01.639
 axis 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.469
 tilt tilt 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.360
 this not all models allow it 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.710
 for example 45 the 90 of canon not what 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.840
 It allows 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.419
 the lenses or when it allows it I think that 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.710
 there are other lenses from the house sneijder that 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.419
 yes they allow movements 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.110
 independent with respect to both axes 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:20.870
 what this will do to us is allow us 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.419
 make creative moves more 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.520
 easy and with this basically it 's all 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.810
 logically from the center speak in the next 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.729
 videos we'll see 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.729
 what use can we make of them
