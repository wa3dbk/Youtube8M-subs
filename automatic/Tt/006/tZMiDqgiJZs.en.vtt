to call it but this is without a doubt

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.920 
to call it but this is without a doubt
it<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.940> good<00:01:00.090> reticle<00:01:00.449> far<00:01:00.719> better

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it really really good reticle far better

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
it really really good reticle far better
than<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.289> regular<00:01:02.100> dot<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.359> opinion<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
than the regular dot in my opinion I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.690 
than the regular dot in my opinion I
like<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.500> use<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.070> things<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
like to use this on things like the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.690 
like to use this on things like the
commando<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.680> FAMAS<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.310> think<00:01:08.549> that's

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
commando and the FAMAS I think that's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.179 
commando and the FAMAS I think that's
pretty<00:01:08.820> much<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.570> sights<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.979> yeah<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
pretty much all use sights on but yeah I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.950 
pretty much all use sights on but yeah I
would<00:01:11.549> highly<00:01:11.760> recommend<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.810> what

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
would highly recommend this this is what

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
would highly recommend this this is what
I'm<00:01:13.049> noticing<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.530> lot<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.799> people<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.220> using

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
I'm noticing a lot of people are using

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
I'm noticing a lot of people are using
in<00:01:14.700> game<00:01:14.880> battles<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.479> military<00:01:16.049> variants<00:01:16.470> so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
in game battles and military variants so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.380 
in game battles and military variants so
this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.580> some<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.460 
this is like you know some it's one of
those<00:01:18.479> things<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.869> might<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
those things that you might think of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
those things that you might think of
like<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.430> split<00:01:20.549> second<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.119> know

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
like just for a split second you know

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
like just for a split second you know
does<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.840> reticle<00:01:22.259> matter<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
does you know reticle matter and it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.100 
does you know reticle matter and it
actually<00:01:23.430> kind<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> does<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:24.960> use<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
actually kind of does so don't use a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.620 
actually kind of does so don't use a
heart<00:01:25.350> don't<00:01:25.680> use<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> skull<00:01:26.280> try<00:01:27.060> outline<00:01:27.450> with

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
heart don't use a skull try outline with

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.219 
heart don't use a skull try outline with
dot<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.549> thought<00:01:29.549> whatever<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
dot and thought whatever it is and you

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.770 
dot and thought whatever it is and you
should<00:01:31.409> notice<00:01:31.560> some<00:01:31.799> success<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.280> anyway

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
should notice some success so anyway

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.429 
should notice some success so anyway
what<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:33.869> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.020> notice<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
what you're going to notice is it

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.050 
what you're going to notice is it
playing<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:34.829> firing<00:01:35.280> range<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.700> firing

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
playing some firing range and firing

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.179 
playing some firing range and firing
range<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.630> mean<00:01:36.689> man<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.259> map<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.590> small<00:01:38.159> I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
range I mean man this map is small I

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
range I mean man this map is small I
mean<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> smallest<00:01:39.600> map<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
mean it's not the smallest map in the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.289 
mean it's not the smallest map in the
world<00:01:40.350> actually<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> fact<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
world actually but the fact is that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.999 
world actually but the fact is that
spawns<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.899> close<00:01:43.170> together<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.649> you're

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
spawns are so close together that you're

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.530 
spawns are so close together that you're
you're<00:01:44.520> hitting<00:01:44.759> your<00:01:44.880> encounter<00:01:45.360> like

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you're hitting your encounter like

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.819 
you're hitting your encounter like
you're<00:01:45.780> encountering<00:01:45.990> people<00:01:46.320> within<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you're encountering people within the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.600 
you're encountering people within the
first<00:01:47.130> I'd<00:01:47.460> say<00:01:48.409> 15<00:01:49.409> seconds<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.100> game<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
first I'd say 15 seconds of the game I

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.090 
first I'd say 15 seconds of the game I
mean<00:01:50.820> maybe<00:01:51.299> not<00:01:51.509> even<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.799> people

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
mean maybe not even that you know people

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.170 
mean maybe not even that you know people
are<00:01:53.189> always<00:01:53.340> rushing<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> middle<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
are always rushing in the middle of the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.539 
are always rushing in the middle of the
map<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.350> actually<00:01:55.680> causes<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.430> know

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
map and that actually causes you know

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.100 
map and that actually causes you know
you're<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> good<00:01:57.299> thing<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> want<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.930> rush

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
you're a good thing if you want to rush

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.410 
you're a good thing if you want to rush
it<00:01:58.469> also<00:01:58.740> cause<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.070> good<00:01:59.189> thing<00:01:59.399> if<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.299> would

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
it also cause a good thing if you would

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.429 
it also cause a good thing if you would
like<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.630> play<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> little<00:02:01.170> bit<00:02:01.320> more

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
like to play a little bit more

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.770 
like to play a little bit more
defensively<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.729> did<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
defensively and that's what I did in the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.260 
defensively and that's what I did in the
beginning<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.140> each<00:02:04.200> round<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.799> go<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.700> into<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
beginning of each round I go up into the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.490 
beginning of each round I go up into the
construction<00:02:06.780> building<00:02:07.200> which<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
construction building which is the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.800 
construction building which is the
building<00:02:07.649> right<00:02:08.310> over<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.849> domination<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
building right over a domination the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.089 
building right over a domination the
building<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.440> right<00:02:10.590> from<00:02:10.770> me<00:02:10.950> when<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
building that was right from me when I

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.250 
building that was right from me when I
spawned<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.700> went<00:02:12.060> up<00:02:12.180> into<00:02:12.480> obviously

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
spawned that I went up into obviously

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.979 
spawned that I went up into obviously
and<00:02:13.879> yeah<00:02:14.879> let's<00:02:15.120> call<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> construction

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
and yeah let's call the construction

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:16.850 
and yeah let's call the construction
building<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.409> that's<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> really<00:02:16.769> good

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
building and that's a really good

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.050 
building and that's a really good
building<00:02:17.129> because<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.459> got<00:02:17.610> those<00:02:17.730> sandbags

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
building because you got those sandbags

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.910 
building because you got those sandbags
to<00:02:18.420> cover<00:02:18.689> you<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:19.170> set<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.349> claymore<00:02:19.680> on

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
to cover you you can set a claymore on

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.190 
to cover you you can set a claymore on
your<00:02:20.099> butt<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:21.209> it's<00:02:21.360> also<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.629> good<00:02:21.780> building

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
your butt and it's also a good building

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.750 
your butt and it's also a good building
to<00:02:22.500> actually<00:02:22.980> kill<00:02:23.189> people<00:02:23.459> in<00:02:23.549> because

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
to actually kill people in because

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.910 
to actually kill people in because
typically<00:02:24.299> people<00:02:24.989> will<00:02:25.170> set<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.379> claymore<00:02:25.739> up

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
typically people will set a claymore up

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.009 
typically people will set a claymore up
in<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:26.159> building<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:26.760> there<00:02:27.030> are<00:02:27.299> two<00:02:27.840> ways

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
in this building but there are two ways

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.289 
in this building but there are two ways
to<00:02:28.290> actually<00:02:28.379> get<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.799> in<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.879> should

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
to actually get up in here so you should

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.699 
to actually get up in here so you should
have<00:02:30.480> quite<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> bit<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.049> success<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.590> you're

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
have quite a bit of success if you're

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.140 
have quite a bit of success if you're
trying<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:31.980> rush<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.459> take<00:02:32.610> people<00:02:32.879> out<00:02:32.970> in

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
trying to rush and take people out in

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.360 
trying to rush and take people out in
here<00:02:33.329> so<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.629> kind<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> both<00:02:35.099> ways

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
here so it's kind of like a both ways

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.030 
here so it's kind of like a both ways
sort<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.760> thing<00:02:35.909> as<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.209> see<00:02:36.920> right<00:02:37.920> here

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
sort of thing as you can see right here

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.009 
sort of thing as you can see right here
you<00:02:38.159> got<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> stairway<00:02:38.730> allows<00:02:39.629> people<00:02:39.870> to

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
you got the stairway allows people to

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.289 
you got the stairway allows people to
come<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.560> you've<00:02:40.920> also<00:02:41.069> got<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.640> ladder

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
come up and you've also got the ladder

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.740 
come up and you've also got the ladder
behind<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.079> two<00:02:43.140> things<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.680> keep<00:02:43.799> in<00:02:43.980> mind

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
behind it so two things to keep in mind

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.210 
behind it so two things to keep in mind
you'll<00:02:45.750> notice<00:02:46.049> right<00:02:46.109> here<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.620> know<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.769> knew

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
you'll notice right here you know I knew

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.640 
you'll notice right here you know I knew
that<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.519> guy<00:02:47.670> knew<00:02:47.909> I<00:02:47.940> was<00:02:48.329> and<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.230> second

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
that that guy knew I was and the second

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.020 
that that guy knew I was and the second
that<00:02:49.769> we<00:02:49.829> finished<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.459> little<00:02:50.700> encounter

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
that we finished that little encounter

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.910 
that we finished that little encounter
right<00:02:51.150> there<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:52.200> first<00:02:52.409> thing<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.620> popped

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
right there the first thing that popped

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.710 
right there the first thing that popped
in<00:02:53.010> my<00:02:53.040> mind<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.970> guy<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.209> already

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720

really good way to start off start off
rounds<00:05:32.419> is<00:05:32.600> going<00:05:32.930> up<00:05:33.020> into<00:05:33.169> that<00:05:33.260> building

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
rounds is going up into that building

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.320 
rounds is going up into that building
and<00:05:33.830> looking<00:05:34.250> across<00:05:34.460> into<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.910> construction

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
and looking across into the construction

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.690 
and looking across into the construction
building<00:05:35.750> but<00:05:36.710> just<00:05:37.010> remember<00:05:37.340> don't<00:05:37.490> say

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
building but just remember don't say

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.370 
building but just remember don't say
that<00:05:37.850> for<00:05:37.970> too<00:05:38.090> long<00:05:38.120> because<00:05:38.600> of<00:05:38.810> course<00:05:39.200> if

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
that for too long because of course if

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.810 
that for too long because of course if
you<00:05:39.440> sit<00:05:39.620> there<00:05:39.770> for<00:05:39.800> too<00:05:40.040> long<00:05:40.220> in<00:05:40.460> one<00:05:40.550> spot
