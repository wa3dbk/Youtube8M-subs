00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.080
 he was far ahead of his time and should strong Mercedes and COO 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.660
 einheizen 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.130
 What is holding so happy here Bank 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.130
 the Hörzu historical vehicle collection of the city of Ingolstadt 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:17.169
 it's not just one of the last places Nanosuit ro80 he has a downright 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.169
 breathtaking story 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.679
 Harald Kneitz has made this legend specifically for adventure car from the 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.189
 Brought evidence center 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.900
 He looks after the collection and is self-confessing 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.270
 Even as a student, I was the dominant team of his father 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.710
 Son no more 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.170
 it is not yet formally available 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.810
 and then when I may then after the opportunity he had a v10 Galler 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.610
 the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.600
 Gasoline trees on the portal are excited about the smoothness 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.630
 want authorities speeds 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.410
 As you might say, Oberwart Rauball of the ride end of this vehicle 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.620
 hair-raising of the explosiveness 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.780
 it is not exclusive 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.660
 Felix Wankel was personally owned by this ro80 built in 1977 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.510
 Here, the vehicle owner also gives the name of the engine 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.100
 exactly the rhenus group succeeded Professor Franke on his 75th birthday 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.770
 even at the end of the seventies, the limousine must have been so futuristic 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.770
 like the music of Kraftwerk 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.830
 Although drawn to Tony Windkanal he dismissed the bodywork as the award ceremony 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.640
 dynamic 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.810
 the alloy wheels of the company Fuchs Brooks otherwise only the construction site 911 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 dpa 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.240
 the two discs Wankel engine with 115 hp 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 developed into a curse for Annes Cuba China 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.340
 the media will be 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.460
 ten few stray stories 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.920
 in the reliability 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 his eldest in mixtures of poetry and truth 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.880
 true is that the revolutionary engine concept with teething problems 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.720
 to fight 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.060
 Matt still has a handful of specialists today 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.639
 like the company Buchholz in Vöhringen 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.639
 Here one dedicates itself for 30 years to the ro80 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.319
 There it does not sound exaggerated when Hartmut Buchholz says he can do one 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.419
 Assemble Wankel engine in your sleep 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.699
 the so-called trulli debuts the combustion chamber in which is the triangular 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.159
 Piston Neufeld country turns 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.799
 while a fourth has 2 piston engines every other crankshaft revolution 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.809
 so the Wankel turns three times per revolution 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.119
 with significantly less moving parts 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.689
 actually the years would not be because the wear of the spring loaded tight 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.169
 At the beginning, you are giving her a big headache 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.899
 occasionally beaten for gothic than 100 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:54.460
 Percent and they are there for the piston 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.460
 for goalkeeper Omeyer the back minus 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.279
 and of course Dietel 9 says 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.230
 There are and almost no longer every now and then very little 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.279
 Now the Greens have to vote or elsewhere 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:10.379
 Foto Riedel throw away we want the pet owner optically light tus-tor 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.309
 has survived 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:16.379
 who drives the rotary engine always carefully why and Friedel the 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.640
 oil level checked 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.840
 It easily gets over 200 thousand kilometers 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.709
 so the expert 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.129
 Buchholz is convincing in matters of Wankel 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.290
 every time I drive today 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.859
 Carolin Reiber finishes or runs the then a sense of achievement 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.539
 some people love me 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.889
 and 4 5 percent down 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.509
 that's it 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:46.399
 You have to pay around 2300 Euros for a completely overhauled Wankel 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:48.249
 Invest in installation 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:49.450
 in fact there were none 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.799
 ro80 initially numerous engine damage 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.009
 «From the image damage for him is and not to mention 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.659
 however, one must remember that most of the engines are the ASEAN compatriots in Cancún 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:00.590
 came 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.560
 in Neckarsulm have come to the test and run flawlessly 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.019
 But it's about who wins and us in our partner side 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.609
 the vast number of judges will have been motors was not perfect 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.779
 Sonneborn just got wet 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.599
 the design of the slide bucking CSU 80 product test 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.709
 should dampen a semi-automatic 3-speed gearbox 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.319
 also the front-wheel drive was rather uncertain in this class 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.330
 Hartmut Buchholz also meticulously takes care of the spare parts supply 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.139
 Thousands of ro80 parts of doors and fenders are stored here 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.139
 Windshields and bumpers 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.270
 to complete seating can be particularly popular parts 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.270
 sometimes laughs idiosyncratic criteria sold 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.050
 Altena 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.520
 new bumper to the complaints 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.249
 gone on it is already new 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:57.300
 but also there and if he is guilty that helps me 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.770
 that is just as available are the proteins as well and new replicas of 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.350
 Original parts do not always and always write that 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.960
 The apartment came from Finland and they were getting worse and worse 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.669
 worse 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.459
 and of course I have Dupper with more than 500 employees 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.990
 then we can do in Google but the desks Gucht 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:23.199
 Ro 80 in good condition is available from 5000 Euro 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.860
 for spike specimens, double is due 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.639
 around 37,000 pieces were built between 67 and 77 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.030
 private consumption by Felix Wankel 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.039
 presents itself in excellent condition 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.830
 the professor back seat to the right 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.730
 with the extra built in Liesi not in the door 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.730
 he was able to study construction plans with relish 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.849
 interesting detail on the edge 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.990
 Felix Wankel had no driver's license and was therefore chauffeured 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.259
 Who now asks where there is even cheaper ro80 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.610
 in hiding by Harald Kneitz 2010 the legendary Aniston on loving films 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.749
 bring these back to a shine 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:10.830
 they also need that 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.830
 from 500 euros per piece one is there 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.310
 this controls pulled 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.650
 In the garden the owners had to partly Carlos for that old order 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.010
 Had to go there to their teacher that is an advantage is that Michael Haas 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.770
 interested in the Knight's Hall of the Year and considered are the words 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.059
 Firstly, though, we have the time in the report 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:35.569
 not been rolled over to the train 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:37.990
 worse here in Germany strong 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.220
 that's why he wants to separate himself from his cherish until 4 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.639
 sda sixty-eight and 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.180
 Above all, I've been around for almost 20 years or are these models talking 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.949
 until ten o'clock 69 that's interesting 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.180
 that I'm here this sideline 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.500
 who shares this has the blood of social consequences 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.370
 that this line continues over the headlights here 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.560
 and also in the cool cellar then possibly on top will be 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.789
 and it draws this model series 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.349
 the first model row still got out in contrast 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:14.189
 at the Bavarians from 69 the Seagate the number still a little far into the bill 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:15.099
 the club is leaving 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.159
 but then he is completely flat of the team but also by the 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.159
 Halogen lamps caused Diddy later easier 

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:26.169
 a piece of automotive history that deserves to be celebrated in the future too 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:27.300
 become 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.999
 I just wish that the last ones received 

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:33.849
 Advantages of this type remain in good hands and continue to be maintained 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:37.029
 stay there and see them on the streets 

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:41.229
 for the still around 1000 cars we drive with the first gate 80 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:43.399
 maybe the most beautiful birthday present
