happened<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.149> example<00:00:45.600> when<00:00:45.899> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
happened here was for example when you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750 
happened here was for example when you
visit<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> certain<00:00:46.469> area<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:47.010> he<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.640> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
visit a certain area like he and you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.799 
visit a certain area like he and you
don't<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.149> anything<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.480> don't<00:00:48.510> place<00:00:48.780> any

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
don't do anything you don't place any

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.959 
don't do anything you don't place any
blocks<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.350> don't<00:00:49.500> remove<00:00:49.710> any<00:00:49.920> locks<00:00:50.190> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
blocks you don't remove any locks just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
blocks you don't remove any locks just
the<00:00:51.090> terrain<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.480> completely<00:00:51.840> unchanged<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the terrain is completely unchanged you

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
the terrain is completely unchanged you
you<00:00:53.100> know<00:00:53.190> discovered<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.820> go<00:00:53.940> past<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you know discovered you go past it and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.150 
you know discovered you go past it and
you<00:00:54.629> come<00:00:54.809> back<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> i<00:00:55.530> guess<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.100> will

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you come back to it i guess it will

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
you come back to it i guess it will
regenerate<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.090> structures<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.750> top<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.230> each

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
regenerate the structures on top of each

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.290 
regenerate the structures on top of each
other<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.800> assume<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.730> what<00:00:59.910> he<00:00:59.969> means<00:01:00.149> in

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
other I assume this is what he means in

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.580 
other I assume this is what he means in
this<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> bugs<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.140> assume<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.440> he

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
this one of the bugs I assume that he

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.789 
this one of the bugs I assume that he
has<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> fix<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> cool<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.320> picture

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
has to fix so it's a cool little picture

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.289 
has to fix so it's a cool little picture
you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.070> kind<00:01:05.280> gets<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> pumped<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.119> zero

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
you know kind gets you pumped with zero

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.250 
you know kind gets you pumped with zero
