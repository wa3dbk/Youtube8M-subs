00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
don't have to be square either you can

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.060 
don't have to be square either you can
do<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.080> lines<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.040> different

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
do in lines you can do them in different

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580 
do in lines you can do them in different
shapes<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.909> try<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.720> make<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.080> relative<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
shapes just try and make it relative to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.590 
shapes just try and make it relative to
the<00:01:28.890> arena<00:01:29.130> size<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.210> arena<00:01:30.420> is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the arena size so if your arena is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.969 
the arena size so if your arena is
really<00:01:30.869> big<00:01:31.049> try<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.500> make<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> platform

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
really big try and make the platform

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.370 
really big try and make the platform
slightly<00:01:32.700> bigger<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.600> players<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.259> have

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
slightly bigger because players do have

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.010 
slightly bigger because players do have
to<00:01:34.530> try<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:34.979> there<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.930> is

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
to try and get there in time so this is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.420 
to try and get there in time so this is
all<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> place<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.310> to

obviously<00:03:07.560> at<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.190> stage<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.730> can't<00:03:09.060> select

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
obviously at this stage you can't select

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.479 
obviously at this stage you can't select
light<00:03:09.840> blue<00:03:10.110> again<00:03:10.410> because<00:03:11.130> you've<00:03:11.280> selected

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
light blue again because you've selected

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.250 
light blue again because you've selected
it<00:03:11.850> as<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.150> floor<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.600> won't<00:03:12.810> let<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.050> do<00:03:13.230> it

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
it as the floor it won't let you do it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.559 
it as the floor it won't let you do it
so<00:03:13.950> I've<00:03:14.010> selected<00:03:14.190> nine<00:03:14.640> colors<00:03:14.970> if<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.450> go

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
so I've selected nine colors if I go

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.509 
so I've selected nine colors if I go
through<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:16.380> gets<00:03:16.560> me<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.890> set<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.100> spawn

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
through it then gets me to set the spawn

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.210 
through it then gets me to set the spawn
point<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.230> set<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:20.010> front

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
point so I like to set it just in front

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.370 
point so I like to set it just in front
of<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.459> block<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:21.930> type<00:03:22.079> in<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.350> word

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.530 
of this block so just type in the word
spawn<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.340> type<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.910> word<00:03:24.060> finished

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
spawn and then type in the word finished

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.259 
spawn and then type in the word finished
and<00:03:25.440> that's<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.950> setup<00:03:26.190> done<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:26.910> really

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
and that's the setup done it's really

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.449 
and that's the setup done it's really
easy<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.510> set<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.840> I'll<00:03:28.799> just<00:03:28.860> quickly<00:03:29.190> go<00:03:29.340> to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
just fly to the top quickly and then get

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.650 
just fly to the top quickly and then get
some<00:03:43.769> signs<00:03:44.070> all<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.000> have<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.209> do<00:03:45.299> is<00:03:45.420> place

the join sign all you have to do is

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.170 
the join sign all you have to do is
bracket<00:03:50.670> CS<00:03:51.420> arena<00:03:52.140> close<00:03:52.739> bracket<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:54.060> then

on the second line do the arena name so
this<00:03:56.880> ring<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:57.269> called<00:03:57.420> YouTube<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:59.010> then<00:03:59.130> it

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
this ring is called YouTube and then it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.920 
this ring is called YouTube and then it

in it the game's not open place another

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.280 
in it the game's not open place another
sign<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.030> this<00:04:06.120> will<00:04:06.299> show<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.720> players

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
sign and this will show you the players

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.670 
sign and this will show you the players
in<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.950> game<00:04:07.980> currently<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.660> do<00:04:09.840> see<00:04:10.500> s

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
in the game currently so you do see s

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.479 
in the game currently so you do see s
status<00:04:11.430> close<00:04:12.359> bracket<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.769> name<00:04:14.190> of<00:04:14.370> the

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
status close bracket the name of the

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.460 
status close bracket the name of the
arena<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.150> then<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.510> number<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.200> sign

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
arena and then the number of the sign

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.590 
arena and then the number of the sign
you<00:04:17.160> can<00:04:17.280> have<00:04:17.400> up<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.549> four<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:17.970> these<00:04:18.239> signs

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
you can have up to four of these signs

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.930 
you can have up to four of these signs
because<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.169> 16<00:04:19.769> player<00:04:20.070> max<00:04:20.400> for<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.760> game

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
because the 16 player max for the game

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.990 
because the 16 player max for the game
so<00:04:21.930> obviously<00:04:22.560> if<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:22.979> go<00:04:23.130> through<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:23.430> can<00:04:23.789> join

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
so obviously if I go through I can join

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.940 
so obviously if I go through I can join
the<00:04:24.150> game<00:04:24.330> again<00:04:24.659> can't<00:04:25.229> place<00:04:25.500> anything

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
the game again can't place anything

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.140 
the game again can't place anything
inside<00:04:26.280> is

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
inside is

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.350 
inside is
we<00:04:27.300> protected<00:04:27.840> even<00:04:28.320> on<00:04:28.470> up<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.669> I<00:04:29.699> like<00:04:30.180> that

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
we protected even on up so I like that

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.300 
we protected even on up so I like that
feature<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.960> means<00:04:31.139> no<00:04:31.380> one<00:04:31.500> can<00:04:31.680> break<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:32.070> to

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
feature it means no one can break it to

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.439 
feature it means no one can break it to
so<00:04:33.270> if<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.449> just<00:04:33.600> type<00:04:33.750> in<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.050> command<00:04:34.380> slash

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
so if I just type in the command slash

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
a really cool effect when the block is

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.450 
a really cool effect when the block is
selected<00:05:22.289> all<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.710> other<00:05:22.830> blocks<00:05:23.130> fall

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
selected all the other blocks fall

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.850 
selected all the other blocks fall
through<00:05:23.840> so<00:05:24.840> as<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.020> can<00:05:25.110> see<00:05:25.320> it's<00:05:25.650> now

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
through so as you can see it's now

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.469 
through so as you can see it's now
telling<00:05:26.220> me<00:05:26.250> which<00:05:26.520> color<00:05:26.789> I<00:05:26.880> need<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.150> stand

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
telling me which color I need to stand

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.360 
telling me which color I need to stand
on<00:05:27.720> so<00:05:28.349> I'll<00:05:28.440> quickly<00:05:28.620> just<00:05:28.889> play<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.099> bit<00:05:29.340> of

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
on so I'll quickly just play a bit of

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.070 
on so I'll quickly just play a bit of
this<00:05:29.550> I'll<00:05:29.820> fast<00:05:30.090> forward<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.570> just<00:05:30.870> so<00:05:30.990> you

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
this I'll fast forward it just so you

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.810 
this I'll fast forward it just so you
can<00:05:31.199> see<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.650> will<00:05:31.949> get<00:05:32.130> harder<00:05:32.520> in<00:05:32.639> later

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
can see that will get harder in later

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.920 
can see that will get harder in later
levels<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.970> I'm<00:05:36.060> just<00:05:36.240> going<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.419> skip<00:05:36.630> through

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
levels so I'm just going to skip through

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.950 
levels so I'm just going to skip through
about<00:05:37.169> 14<00:05:37.800> levels<00:05:38.220> here<00:05:38.460> to<00:05:38.789> level<00:05:39.030> 17<00:05:39.630> and

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
about 14 levels here to level 17 and

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.570 
about 14 levels here to level 17 and
this<00:05:40.080> is<00:05:40.260> when<00:05:40.410> I<00:05:40.440> actually<00:05:40.620> get<00:05:41.070> taken<00:05:41.340> out

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.480 
this is when I actually get taken out
this<00:05:42.419> is<00:05:42.630> getting<00:05:43.050> really<00:05:43.320> fast<00:05:43.770> and<00:05:44.130> playing

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490
