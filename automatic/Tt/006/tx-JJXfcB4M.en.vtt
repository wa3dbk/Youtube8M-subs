00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.520

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.859
 new said is directed 5 online and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.690
 well as you know gta 5 came out on 17 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.910
 September but good as you know 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 the online mode that is still as 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.170
 say it denied and good will update us 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.760
 until October 1 is to say the 1 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.130
 October through an update 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.330
 I guess it's good when I connect to GTA 5 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.230
 on October 1 it will put the new 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.090
 use of the game then 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.130
 I will update and you can save in the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.750
 online then well they have come out a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.150
 new detail in which I have 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.429
 compiled three important details and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.989
 good in the first detail is that good 

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:36.660
 mainly I was going to see only only 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.859
 16 players in the typical game of 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.269
 Free mode not to do what you want 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.370
 around the city but with people from all over the 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.960
 world was going to be only 16 players but 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.519
 it seems that people have complained 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.230
 saying that it was too good 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.909
 sent for so few people then 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.129
 it seems that the number of 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.449
 players to 32 players is a rumor not 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.219
 it has been confirmed but it happens to be going 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.350
 to be so there are going to be 22 players in 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.329
 the game thing that in 74 did not happen 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.579
 then we go with the next one that's good 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.979
 it is confirmed that there will be going to continue 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
 having the modes that a gta 4 like 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.370
 racing modes duel by team and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.570
 cops and thieves that by the way 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.510
 you have in the description 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.680
 in which I play this mode in gta 4 that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.940
 the truth is that I recommend that you see 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.470
 because it 's pretty cool alone and 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.120
 only a pretty short round the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.500
 video in case you want to see it good what 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.820
 commented very well to story but what 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.710
 had in the background is the a game of 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.750
 policemen and thieves and good to say that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.820
 I 'm not only will be policemen and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.140
 thieves simply but they have done 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.390
 with a socialization of the game mode 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.759
 and they have put it as more complex in the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.020
 which then good not only will only be 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.610
 that the policeman pays for the thief 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.050
 but the police will have to catch 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.700
 different license plate details 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.530
 car of the thieves to see if they are 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.270
 et cetera etcetera does not explain it 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.860
 very good but more or less good comes to 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.720
 say that it will be more complicated not of the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.050
 mode of the game that are those that 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520
 cool and good and finally we have to 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.530
 there will be a game mode which has more 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.390
 called the attention in which then 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 all the players of a game 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.060
 they will have to go for just one I do not know if 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.950
 will be in plan as the game is that it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.509
 make it be called rhythm there is a 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.860
 traitor and then you have to guess 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.390
 who is traitor 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.830
 or directly they will say you must kill 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.229
 success some will run out behind 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.670
 him for the city but whatever the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.259
 it's going to be pretty good and 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.030
 to go through the cities imagine that you 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.530
 It's up to you to go up and go with the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.240
 city ​​you have a helicopter up 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 up three things behind a truck 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.080
 front and all are all characters 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.440
 possible kill the truth has to be 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.450
 quite comfortable what do you think of these 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.580
 5 details of the metrobus and so on 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.170
 I hoped I expected a little less 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.190
 that you want it to leave because it's still not 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.410
 everything has been confirmed that there will be 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.410
 there will be more than 500 missions online 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.920
