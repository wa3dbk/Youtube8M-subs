00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
important to understand that there's a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.400 
important to understand that there's a
big<00:00:53.910> difference<00:00:54.360> between<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:54.960> men<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
big difference between the way men and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.590 
big difference between the way men and
women<00:00:56.129> usually<00:00:56.430> lose<00:00:56.969> their<00:00:57.210> hair<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
women usually lose their hair if you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.290 
women usually lose their hair if you
look<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> animation<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:59.129> men<00:00:59.520> hair<00:01:00.090> loss

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
look at the animation with men hair loss

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
look at the animation with men hair loss
typically<00:01:00.870> tends<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.530> start<00:01:01.859> around<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.280> back

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
typically tends to start around the back

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
typically tends to start around the back
of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> head<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.750> very<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.530> common

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of the head and it's very very common

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.770 
of the head and it's very very common
then<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> loss<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> temples

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
then to see the loss up in the temples

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.170 
then to see the loss up in the temples
but<00:01:07.260> that's<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.950> call<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.369> male<00:01:08.640> pattern

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
but that's what we call the male pattern

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.929 
but that's what we call the male pattern
of<00:01:09.330> hair<00:01:09.540> loss<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:10.200> women<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.950> tends<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.670> be

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
of hair loss with women it tends to be

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
of hair loss with women it tends to be
around<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.570> scalp<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> widening

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
around the scalp so you see a widening

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
around the scalp so you see a widening
of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> scalp<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.000> also<00:01:15.170> sometimes

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
of the scalp but you can also sometimes

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
of the scalp but you can also sometimes
see<00:01:16.409> hair<00:01:16.710> loss<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> front<00:01:17.670> by<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
see hair loss in the front by the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.719 
see hair loss in the front by the
temples<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.500> lot<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:20.009> women<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.610> my

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
temples I see this a lot in women in my

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
temples I see this a lot in women in my
practice<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.900> upsetting

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
practice and it is so upsetting

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.380 
practice and it is so upsetting
but<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.460> important<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> understand

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
but I think it's important to understand

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
but I think it's important to understand
you<00:01:24.540> mentioned<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.960> were<00:01:25.049> under<00:01:25.320> stress<00:01:25.590> day

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
you mentioned you were under stress day

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.609 
you mentioned you were under stress day
to<00:01:26.220> day<00:01:26.549> daily<00:01:27.090> average<00:01:27.479> stress<00:01:27.810> should

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to day daily average stress should

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319 
to day daily average stress should
really<00:01:29.189> make<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.490> lose<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:29.970> hair<00:01:30.180> we'd

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
really make you lose a lot of hair we'd

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.600 
really make you lose a lot of hair we'd
all<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.750> pretty<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.650> bald<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.369> were<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
all be pretty much bald if that were the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.210 
all be pretty much bald if that were the
case<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.299> big<00:01:33.540> hormonal<00:01:33.990> changes<00:01:34.619> some

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220

vitamin deficiencies thyroid problem and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.929 
vitamin deficiencies thyroid problem and
then<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.890> course<00:01:37.950> things<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> do

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
then of course things that you do

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.480 
then of course things that you do
yourself<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.930> hair<00:01:40.189> styling<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
yourself to your hair styling and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.920 
yourself to your hair styling and
coloring<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> things<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.720> you're

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
coloring and things that you're

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.200 
coloring and things that you're
mechanically<00:01:43.560> doing<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.430> also<00:01:44.640> play<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> role

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
mechanically doing can also play a role

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.179 
mechanically doing can also play a role
but<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.570> normally<00:01:46.079> tell<00:01:46.259> women<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:47.070> they

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189

healthy head of hair because the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.010 
healthy head of hair because the

these<00:03:20.850> follicles<00:03:21.240> can<00:03:21.690> shrink<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.230> wither

these follicles can shrink and wither

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.140 
these follicles can shrink and wither
and<00:03:22.770> what<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.190> what<00:03:23.490> happens<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:23.910> you

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
and what you what happens is that you

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.510 
and what you what happens is that you
miniaturized<00:03:24.870> these<00:03:25.230> hairs<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.890> with<00:03:26.250> laser

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
miniaturized these hairs so with laser

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.610 
miniaturized these hairs so with laser
therapy<00:03:26.850> we<00:03:27.210> can<00:03:27.240> use<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.380> non

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
therapy we can use a this is a non

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.250 
therapy we can use a this is a non
chemical<00:03:28.940> non-invasive<00:03:29.940> way<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.810> stimulate

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
chemical non-invasive way to stimulate

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.200 
chemical non-invasive way to stimulate
cellular<00:03:31.710> metabolism<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.490> this<00:03:32.610> light<00:03:32.850> energy
