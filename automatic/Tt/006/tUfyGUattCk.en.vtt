00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.550
 Hello, my dear gardeners and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.290
 gardeners 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.650
 today as always as i promised you 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.590
 I will tell you earlier how to protect 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.350
 tomatoes from phytophthora you are now 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.590
 you are in my greenhouse number two this 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.849
 one more polycarbonate greenhouse 3 by 8 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.899
 in that greenhouse I conducted an experiment i 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.350
 planted a tomato lying i mean i don't them 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.489
 buried as usual in this greenhouse I 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.629
 planted tomatoes as usual see too 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.260
 they are tied to the top of the wire here 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 so twine what I want to say pass 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.539
 about stepchildren 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.719
 stepchildren have tomato i think i delete 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.660
 always whenever possible bottom bottom stepson 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.510
 so that the tomato sheets are not lying on the ground 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.390
 as less touched well as a rule 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.280
 then end up by wearing you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.960
 see how much happens here 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.330
 tomato and sometimes i just have more 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.939
 not breaking off stepchildren because i think 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.490
 the more stepchildren we leave to those 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.210
 more will be a tomato that is stepchildren i 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.360
 I remove at a minimum it is my personal 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.750
 I donâ€™t impose it on you 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.240
 I want to recommend you 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.479
 two bushes do not completely tear off the parcel 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.220
 what I want to say now with us 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.500
 at least in the suburbs I find 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.130
 the weather has changed dramatically in Serpukhov 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.920
 dramatically changed 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.159
 the year it got cold it rained 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.729
 eat and this sign is a signal tomatoes 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.619
 may already be infected with blight that I 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.060
 doing against this disease 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.369
 you are probably at the beginning of our video 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.069
 noticed that I tied 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.520
 some bubble is not just bubble 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:10.149
 this is a bottle of iodine that is on this 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.630
 greenhouse I weigh greenhouses 3 by 8 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.349
 I'll hang such bubbles well somewhere 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.360
 about five pieces of cork I open 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.930
 i.e. that evaporation of iodine goes 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.260
 thus , I kind of protect tomatoes from 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.260
 phytophtors then I will spray them 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.200
 copper sulphate 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.549
 tablespoon of copper sulfate dining 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.220
 spoon of washing powder per 10 liters 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.459
 water and I these tomatoes all-all-all 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.480
 I will process for what so that they do not 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.150
 got sick and we gathered a full harvest 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.130
 washing powder I pour in order 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.000
 to bluestone 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.590
 stuck better on the leaves i mean i 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.060
 I'll tell you if it's sunny and hot outside 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.359
 okay tomatoes can not 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.130
 handle but if it rains more 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.700
 two days this is you first couple sign after 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.519
 the rain 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.900
 go and process necessarily farm 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.989
 door Well this perhaps I Zakkai 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.319

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.209
