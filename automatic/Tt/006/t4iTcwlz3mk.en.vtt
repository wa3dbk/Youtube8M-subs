this<00:00:07.830> lab<00:00:08.040> there<00:00:08.370> are<00:00:08.429> fairly<00:00:08.700> new<00:00:08.910> machines

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
this lab there are fairly new machines

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.509 
this lab there are fairly new machines
we<00:00:09.599> bought<00:00:09.780> them<00:00:09.840> about<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> year<00:00:10.200> ago<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.769> then

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
we bought them about a year ago and then

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.310 
we bought them about a year ago and then
we<00:00:11.639> installed<00:00:12.030> Windows<00:00:12.389> 7<00:00:12.690> Professional<00:00:12.780> on

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
we installed Windows 7 Professional on

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.310 
we installed Windows 7 Professional on
them<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.150> what<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.450> everything<00:00:15.929> was<00:00:16.049> fine

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
them and what that everything was fine

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.290 
them and what that everything was fine
but<00:00:16.740> then<00:00:16.920> some<00:00:17.279> people<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.820> another<00:00:18.000> class

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
but then some people for another class

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.769 
but then some people for another class
installed<00:00:18.840> Windows<00:00:19.199> 8<00:00:19.410> or<00:00:19.650> Server<00:00:20.279> 2012<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
installed Windows 8 or Server 2012 as a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.349 
installed Windows 8 or Server 2012 as a
second<00:00:22.320> boot<00:00:22.500> option<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.039> when<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
second boot option and when you do that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.779 
second boot option and when you do that
it<00:00:24.660> works<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.320> few<00:00:25.500> days<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.070> then<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
it works for a few days and then it

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.939 
it works for a few days and then it
self-destructs<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.410> what<00:00:28.590> happens

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
self-destructs and this is what happens

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.800 
self-destructs and this is what happens
this<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> fifth<00:00:30.060> machine<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.570> lab

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
this is the fifth machine in this lab

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.269 
this is the fifth machine in this lab
this<00:00:30.990> has<00:00:31.140> happened<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.890> last<00:00:32.070> two

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.720 
this has happened to in the last two
weeks<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:33.899> power<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.460> look<00:00:35.610> at

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
weeks and you power it up you look at

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.389 
weeks and you power it up you look at
the<00:00:35.850> screen<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:37.020> will<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.410> good<00:00:38.100> stuff

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
at first this is the beginning of the

at first this is the beginning of the
BIOS<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:41.239> get<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.360> much<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.840> BIOS<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
BIOS you get this much of the BIOS and

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.060 
BIOS you get this much of the BIOS and
now<00:00:45.149> when<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> should<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.590> operating

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
now when you should see the operating

now when you should see the operating
system<00:00:47.550> choice<00:00:47.879> screen<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.530> nothing<00:00:49.980> but

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
system choice screen you get nothing but

screen<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:56.010> looks<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.969> hardware

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
screen it looks like you have a hardware

failure<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> video<00:00:58.260> card<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.370> fact

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
failure of the video card and in fact

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.250 
failure of the video card and in fact
when<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.910> first<00:01:00.270> saw<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.780> went<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
when I first saw this I went and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.500 
when I first saw this I went and
purchased<00:01:01.500> another<00:01:01.949> video<00:01:02.250> card<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> put<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
purchased another video card and put it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
purchased another video card and put it
in<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> same<00:01:04.199> thing<00:01:04.439> happened<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
in and the same thing happened with the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
in and the same thing happened with the
new<00:01:05.100> video<00:01:05.369> card<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.510> found<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> solution

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
new video card and I found the solution

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.469 
new video card and I found the solution
just<00:01:07.979> by<00:01:08.189> trying<00:01:08.520> everything<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
just by trying everything this is a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.500 
just by trying everything this is a
Windows<00:01:09.900> 7<00:01:10.380> installers<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.299> this<00:01:12.299> machine

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
Windows 7 installers that this machine

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.590 
Windows 7 installers that this machine
is<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> dual<00:01:13.470> between<00:01:13.890> Windows<00:01:14.310> 7<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.450> more

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
is a dual between Windows 7 and a more

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.929 
is a dual between Windows 7 and a more
modern<00:01:15.630> operating<00:01:16.229> system<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.280> boot<00:01:17.640> from

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
modern operating system so you boot from

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.490 
modern operating system so you boot from
that<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.229> turn<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.680> off<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:22.110> turn<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.320> on

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that and just turn it off and turn it on

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.039 
that and just turn it off and turn it on
again<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.850> either<00:01:24.000> f9<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.420> f12<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
again and it's either f9 or f12 to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.390 
again and it's either f9 or f12 to
choose<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> boot<00:01:25.590> option<00:01:25.950> I'll<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.250> hit

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
choose the boot option I'll just hit

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.800 
choose the boot option I'll just hit
them<00:01:26.460> both

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.960 

there<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:33.650> boot<00:01:33.860> from<00:01:33.980> the<00:01:34.070> cd-rom<00:01:34.430> and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
there you boot from the cd-rom and

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.450 
there you boot from the cd-rom and
what's<00:01:35.270> interesting<00:01:35.630> here<00:01:36.260> is<00:01:36.410> that<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
what's interesting here is that the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.970 
what's interesting here is that the
message<00:01:37.910> is<00:01:38.090> why<00:01:38.360> do<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.570> which<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:39.620> have<00:01:39.740> seen

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
message is why do you which I have seen

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.260 
message is why do you which I have seen
many<00:01:40.340> times<00:01:40.630> with<00:01:41.630> Windows<00:01:42.320> startup<00:01:42.650> repair

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
many times with Windows startup repair

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.810 
many times with Windows startup repair
so<00:01:44.270> it's<00:01:44.390> going<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.570> boot<00:01:44.780> from<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.990> cd-rom

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
so it's going to boot from the cd-rom

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.210 
so it's going to boot from the cd-rom
now<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.880> first<00:01:47.210> time<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.480> did<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.290> wanted

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
now the first time I did this I wanted

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.370 
now the first time I did this I wanted
to<00:01:49.340> see<00:01:49.550> if<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.910> video<00:01:50.060> card<00:01:50.510> was<00:01:50.750> broken<00:01:51.200> and

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
to see if the video card was broken and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.710 
to see if the video card was broken and
I<00:01:51.920> thought<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.280> might<00:01:52.670> be<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.820> hard<00:01:53.120> drive<00:01:53.390> so

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
I thought it might be the hard drive so

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.630 
I thought it might be the hard drive so
if<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:53.930> boot<00:01:54.140> from<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.350> cd-rom<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.370> see

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
if I boot from the cd-rom and I see

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.760 
if I boot from the cd-rom and I see
graphics<00:01:56.180> then<00:01:56.750> it's<00:01:56.930> not<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.230> video<00:01:57.470> card

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
graphics then it's not the video card

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.860 
graphics then it's not the video card
and<00:01:58.070> that's<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.030> case<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.390> now<00:01:59.540> hear<00:01:59.780> I'm

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
and that's the case you now hear I'm

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.640 
and that's the case you now hear I'm
seeing<00:02:00.170> an<00:02:00.260> appropriate<00:02:00.740> loading<00:02:01.190> menu<00:02:01.790> and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.139 

it's<00:02:06.650> even<00:02:07.010> going<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.220> show<00:02:07.369> me<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.700> typical

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it's even going to show me the typical

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.140 
it's even going to show me the typical
pretty<00:02:08.390> graphics<00:02:08.840> pretty<00:02:09.110> soon<00:02:09.350> here<00:02:09.940> yep

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
pretty graphics pretty soon here yep

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.870 
pretty graphics pretty soon here yep
pushing<00:02:11.720> out<00:02:11.810> graphic<00:02:12.200> environment<00:02:12.740> so<00:02:13.250> this

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
pushing out graphic environment so this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.160 
pushing out graphic environment so this
might<00:02:14.090> make<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.390> video<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.690> little<00:02:14.959> tedious

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
might make the video a little tedious

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.230 
might make the video a little tedious
but<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.880> one<00:02:17.209> take

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
but I have to do this in one take

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.470 
but I have to do this in one take
because<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.560> not<00:02:18.920> reproducible<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.880> can't

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
because this is not reproducible I can't

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.810 
because this is not reproducible I can't
make<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.840> happen<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.320> once<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.220> fix<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.580> it's

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
make it happen and once I fix it it's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.400 
make it happen and once I fix it it's
all<00:02:22.970> over<00:02:23.000> until<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.690> next<00:02:23.840> machine<00:02:24.020> breaks

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
all over until the next machine breaks

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.310 
all over until the next machine breaks
and<00:02:24.709> they're<00:02:25.580> gradually<00:02:26.120> breaking<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:26.750> random

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
and they're gradually breaking at random

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.590 
and they're gradually breaking at random
through<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.590> whole<00:02:27.709> lab<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.280> few<00:02:28.880> days<00:02:29.060> after

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
through the whole lab a few days after

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.780 
through the whole lab a few days after
people<00:02:29.900> install<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.500> second<00:02:30.920> OS<00:02:31.190> or<00:02:31.459> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
people install the second OS or the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.449 
people install the second OS or the
third<00:02:32.000> OS<00:02:32.300> if<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:33.380> have<00:02:33.470> Windows<00:02:33.830> 7<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.340> then

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
third OS if you have Windows 7 and then

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.949 
third OS if you have Windows 7 and then
you<00:02:34.489> add<00:02:34.730> 8<00:02:35.060> or<00:02:35.450> 12<00:02:35.690> later<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:38.180> assume<00:02:38.540> only

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
you add 8 or 12 later and I assume only

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.509 
you add 8 or 12 later and I assume only
on<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:39.230> hardware<00:02:39.680> because<00:02:39.950> when<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.190> google

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
on this hardware because when I google

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.070 
on this hardware because when I google
for<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:40.910> don't<00:02:40.970> find<00:02:41.390> thousands<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.840> people

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
for it I don't find thousands of people

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.650 
for it I don't find thousands of people
screaming<00:02:42.410> about<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.739> problem<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.510> think

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
screaming about this problem so I think

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.530 
screaming about this problem so I think
it<00:02:44.930> has<00:02:45.019> something<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.320> do<00:02:45.410> with<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> default

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
it has something to do with the default

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.560 
it has something to do with the default
hardware<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.630> comes<00:02:47.750> with<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.050> HP<00:02:48.230> machine

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
hardware that comes with this HP machine

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.479 
hardware that comes with this HP machine
so<00:02:50.570> now<00:02:50.840> my<00:02:51.110> windows<00:02:51.380> 7<00:02:51.680> boot<00:02:52.010> up<00:02:52.130> disk<00:02:52.310> has

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
so now my windows 7 boot up disk has

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.720 
so now my windows 7 boot up disk has
come<00:02:52.670> up<00:02:52.820> all<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.870> have<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.110> get<00:02:54.260> his<00:02:54.380> next

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
come up all I have to get his next

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.330 
come up all I have to get his next
repair<00:02:55.730> your<00:02:55.940> computer<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:57.070> let<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.220> go

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
repair your computer and let it go

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.009

through this searching thing which is in

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.720 
through this searching thing which is in
fact<00:03:00.230> useful<00:03:00.709> for<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.950> video<00:03:01.220> because<00:03:01.610> you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
fact useful for the video because you

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.850 
fact useful for the video because you
will<00:03:01.880> see<00:03:02.090> what<00:03:02.870> we<00:03:02.989> really<00:03:03.290> have<00:03:03.440> here

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.870 

okay<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> Windows<00:03:11.450> 7<00:03:11.680> st<00:03:12.680> 14<00:03:13.130> with<00:03:13.520> a<00:03:13.550> 7

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
okay this is a Windows 7 st 14 with a 7

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880 
okay this is a Windows 7 st 14 with a 7

Professional and Windows 8.1 dual that
I've<00:03:16.130> also<00:03:16.340> seen<00:03:16.580> this<00:03:16.730> happen<00:03:17.090> with<00:03:17.240> just

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
I've also seen this happen with just

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.740 
I've also seen this happen with just
Windows<00:03:17.930> 7<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.350> Server<00:03:18.530> 2012<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.030> hit<00:03:20.240> next

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
Windows 7 and Server 2012 so I hit next

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.780 
Windows 7 and Server 2012 so I hit next
and<00:03:20.900> then<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.380> run<00:03:21.560> startup<00:03:22.070> repair<00:03:22.190> for

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
and then I run startup repair for

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.510 
and then I run startup repair for
Windows<00:03:23.090> 7<00:03:23.300> and<00:03:24.160> now<00:03:30.010> startup<00:03:31.010> repair<00:03:31.100> goes

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
Windows 7 and now startup repair goes

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.120 
Windows 7 and now startup repair goes
through<00:03:31.850> its<00:03:32.060> mysterious<00:03:32.630> process<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.980> it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
through its mysterious process and it

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.730 
through its mysterious process and it
tells<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.700> startup<00:03:35.450> repair<00:03:35.570> cannot<00:03:36.290> repair

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
tells you startup repair cannot repair

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.980 
tells you startup repair cannot repair

there is a Remote Desktop Protocol

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.840 
there is a Remote Desktop Protocol
attack<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.830> while<00:03:55.040> ago<00:03:55.220> see<00:03:55.280> now<00:03:55.459> it's<00:03:55.610> back<00:03:55.820> to

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
attack a while ago see now it's back to

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.520 
attack a while ago see now it's back to
giving<00:03:56.180> their<00:03:56.330> proper<00:03:56.660> multi<00:03:56.930> boot<00:03:57.080> menu<00:03:57.260> you

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
giving their proper multi boot menu you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.949 
giving their proper multi boot menu you
can<00:03:57.709> see<00:03:58.010> now<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.730> can<00:03:58.790> boot<00:03:59.120> any<00:03:59.300> OS<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.720> want

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
can see now I can boot any OS I want

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.920 
can see now I can boot any OS I want
like<00:04:00.350> Windows<00:04:00.709> 7<00:04:00.740> and<00:04:01.840> everything's<00:04:02.840> fine

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
like Windows 7 and everything's fine

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.660 
like Windows 7 and everything's fine
that's<00:04:03.440> how<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:03.650> fix<00:04:03.950> this<00:04:04.160> problem

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
that's how you fix this problem

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.150 
that's how you fix this problem
and<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:04.910> have<00:04:05.150> no<00:04:05.450> idea<00:04:05.480> why<00:04:06.020> I<00:04:06.380> don't<00:04:06.920> know<00:04:07.010> what
