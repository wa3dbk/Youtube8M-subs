Hello everyone, welcome to my 14th tutorial!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.270
I'm very happy to be with you today with my
new customization tutorial.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:32.140
It's true that most of the time I try to alternate
the different tutorials that I do. Like one time a sewing tutorial, the other time a DIY.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.200
But I still do a customization tutorial today!

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.500
Last week we customized caps and this week we customize a jacket!

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.800
I do this tutorial because someone asked me
on my channel to show some ways of customizing.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:56.900
I will show you two different ideas to do
on two jackets : a jean one and one color kaki.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.000
Here are the accessories needed

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.200
Thread
Laces

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.100
Needles
A pair of scissors

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.200
Adhesive fabric
A first jacket

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.300
A second jacket

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:21.300
First, I customize my jean jacket with different laces. I need needles, my thread and pair of scissors.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.800
I start to customize the front of the jacket.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:35.900
I will sew some lace right here, below the
pockets and between the sewings.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:45.900
I do it on both sides.
I start to cut the lace at the right length.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.200
Now you can sew the lace.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.500
Little precision : I use a different type
of lace to customize the back of my jacket.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.500
Like you can see, my jacket already has little
studs. They were already here when I bought it.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:42.800
I will just take them off so it won't look too much.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.200
I keep them because they may be useful for
a next customization.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:02.000
Now that I customized my jean jacket, I take
the kaki one.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:12.000
I bought this jacket when I was in Paris.
I already customized it with gold studs.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.600
I put them in different areas of the jacket.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.800
You can see that it's very easy to customize a jacket.
I will add something today.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:50.500
I choose to customize the pocket.
I take the adhesive fabric and take measures.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:04:02.600
Take mark with a pen and then cut it.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.290
Now it's ready, just check out if the size is good. This fabric is adhesive on paper and cardboard.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.180
You need to iron it on fabrics.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.300
I also want to customize the back of my jacket.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.300
I will put adhesive fabric just above the
studs that are already there.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.400
I will now fix everything with my iron.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:54.300
Take your first piece of fabric, take back the plastic behind. Position it. Iron.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.900

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.900

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.000
Now do the same on the back of your jacket.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.000
The customization is now over. I will now put on the jackets to show you the results.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:43.000
If you do this tutorial, I hope you will be
as happy as I am with the result. I think it's very important to be satisfied with every result you get, no matter if you do DIY or sewing tutorials.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.000
I hope you liked this customization. Don't hesitate to let me know by leaving me a comment.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:59.400
Next time I will keep doing a customization tutorial. If you have any question or idea, just let me know.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:08.200
I will be happy to show you some ways to make your clothes look great.
Don't hesitate to share this video.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.139
I see you all very soon and wish you a good weekend.
Bye everyone!
