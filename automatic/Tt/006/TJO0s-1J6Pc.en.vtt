00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 if they analyze most of the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.109
 queries that we receive you will see that all 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.690
 come focused on the combinations in 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.340
 how to make combinations really a 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.379
 incredible world is they are very elements 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.420
 important for man, that is, 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.240
 men have big big problems 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.600
 doubts when it comes to combining stripes 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.670
 Plain pictures with colors and mix the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.580
 rest with each other well then in this video 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.640
 we are going to reveal 5 keys so that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.920
 learn to combine patterns of tissues 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.920
 and colors in an elegant way 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.980
 I carry 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.780
 I am green boxes from Spain 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.390
 I want to send a very sincere greeting 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.610
 is out of my country and let's start 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.290
 with the say with the three 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.260
 possibilities that we have of 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.510
 combinations well the three 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.990
 possibilities could be number one 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.450
 combine equal patterns of fabric the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.409
 second possibility would be to combine 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.390
 similar colors or similar colors and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.330
 the third with and the third possibility 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.330
 it has to be pattern combinations 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.330
 and of different tissues 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.520
 I 'll leave you in this video the five 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.800
 keys so that you go starting to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.680
 learn to make very combinations 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.240
 elegant is very likely that if ever 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.880
 You have seen no videos of this channel 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.810
 have doubts about what a pattern is 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.730
 of tissue 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.650
 if that is your voice if that is the case with you 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.560
 do not worry because I'll leave you in 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.250
 the description of this video a link a 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.690
 link to a video that we've made 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.270
 so you can learn what the patterns are 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.670
 of fabrics and do not have that idea and that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.680
 very clear concept so that the content 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.260
 of this video you understand perfectly 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.650
 I have designed a number plan so that 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.360
 it's all easy for you all five 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.729
 keys and also we will go 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.940
 accompanying with images so that you have 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.520
 examples let's start with the first 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.510
 that we have called him three 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.280
 plus two plus one that means that each 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.130
 one of the patterns as they are seeing in 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.330
 this image are completely different 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.170
 the following zero possibilities 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.270
 + 0 this means that we are going to use 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.640
 three completely smooth patterns without 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.070
 stripes without pictures in this image you will see 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.320
 the example obviously this is the part 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.540
 more comfortable is the most comfortable thing there is for 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.610
 combine that we can go using 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.740
 different colors in both shirt and 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.080
 trousers like in america I do not sack like you 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.350
 want the third possibility is 2 + 0 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.740
 this means that you can use two 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.330
 equal patterns and one smooth 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.180
 completely for example we can 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.760
 use two boxes and one smooth 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.500
 make our combination the fourth 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.510
 possibility would be two plus one well this 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.620
 means that we are going to use two 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.600
 equal patterns and a different one in this 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.280
 image you will see this example clearly 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.930
 we use two patterns of tissue 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.450
 the same and one that is completely 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.300
 different 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.879
 and the fifth possibility that fifth key 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.230
 that I want to leave you is called 2 to 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.940
 square which means 2 squared you 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.250
 I'm going to put this image so you can see it 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.209
 means that every time you use a 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.760
 equal pattern for example a picture the 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.220
 next box has to be of greater 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.450
 size do not worry if missing 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.880
 a lot of very many data 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.220
 combinations I do not want to make a 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.480
 monothema nor a complete bible 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.920
 right now of combination in a single 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.140
 video but we're going to go up 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.870
 many more videos with more content 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.310
 and by the way subscribe to this channel if 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.310
 it's the first time that he comes to this channel 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.130
 subscribe because all this that we are going to 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.959
 expand on what about the combinations 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.480
 both colors and patterns 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.010
 you will have them on hand in the 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.950
 at which time they are also subscribed 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.079
 they give you a warning that there is already a video 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.049
 new recommendation subscribe to this 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:20.139
 channel well then if you think we're going to 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.470
 go directly to the council with which 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.389
 we always like to close our videos 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.900
 generally men have the 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.660
 bad 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.580
 custom of when a combination we 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.770
 like and we have accepted with her the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.080
 we block that means that the 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.259
 we block that we repeat it with a lot 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.570
 often, well, there's nothing else 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.250
 incorrect than blocking a combination 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.650
 because you think you feel good 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.229
 then today's council will go 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.110
 intended for you to do a month a 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.690
 exercise for a month try doing a 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.020
 exercise well the exercise that you 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.870
 I propose the following for a month 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.620
 dress without joining the combinations that 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.350
 you already know or try to combine 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.210
 every time different things pants with 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.370
 shirts with sacks with suits with 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.370
 ties always in a different way 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.100
 do not use that locked pattern that already 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.340
 have in a month you're going to 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.370
 find two great advantages two what 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.830
 first there are times when you are 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.880
 wearing and automatically thinks if 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.930
 I had a shirt 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.270
 well you know you're missing a shirt 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.640
 for your next purchase write it down is so 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.890
 easy as I want a picture shirt 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.000
 determined in the color because I 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.510
 it would have been necessary for these 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.420
 possibilities and two very probably 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.270
 discover new combinations that by 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.300
 that lock closure that we have the 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.520
 men in me many times 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.160
 we block a lot of possibilities 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.580
 playing in this way you can enhance 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.310
 new ways of increasing your see your 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.710
 style and increase those possibilities that 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.270
 you always have to get to be every day 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.270
 more elegant
