micro<00:02:46.090> flexion<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.690> way<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.960> making<00:02:47.770> more

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
micro flexion it's a way of making more

reflectivity<00:02:48.670> into<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.570> material<00:02:50.110> that

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
reflectivity into the material that

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.750 
reflectivity into the material that
really<00:02:50.500> would<00:02:50.770> light<00:02:50.980> up<00:02:51.010> when<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.460> gets<00:02:51.610> hit

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
really would light up when it gets hit

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.610 
really would light up when it gets hit
by<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.910> motorcycle<00:02:52.210> headlight<00:02:52.540> or<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:53.080> car<00:02:53.440> late

lengthening the impact and it does that

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.280 
lengthening the impact and it does that

here<00:05:05.450> I<00:05:05.600> didn't<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.200> think<00:05:06.470> there's<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.680> style

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
here I didn't I think there's a style

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.740 
here I didn't I think there's a style
factor<00:05:07.400> in<00:05:07.490> this<00:05:07.610> type<00:05:07.790> of<00:05:07.940> stitching<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.390> find

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
factor in this type of stitching I find

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.180 
factor in this type of stitching I find
that<00:05:08.810> sometimes<00:05:09.050> adventure<00:05:09.560> riders<00:05:09.860> want<00:05:10.160> a

that sometimes adventure riders want a

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.290 
that sometimes adventure riders want a
little<00:05:10.370> bit<00:05:10.490> more<00:05:10.700> of<00:05:10.760> a<00:05:10.820> simpler<00:05:11.210> style

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
little bit more of a simpler style

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.730 
little bit more of a simpler style
stitching<00:05:11.870> that's<00:05:12.230> going<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.410> be<00:05:12.500> really<00:05:12.710> a

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
stitching that's going to be really a

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.230 
stitching that's going to be really a
style<00:05:12.980> factor<00:05:13.430> that's<00:05:13.550> up<00:05:13.700> to<00:05:13.790> you<00:05:13.880> but<00:05:13.910> we<00:05:14.060> do

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
style factor that's up to you but we do

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.980 
style factor that's up to you but we do
see<00:05:14.390> that<00:05:14.480> in<00:05:14.630> some<00:05:14.720> of<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.870> European

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
see that in some of the European

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.050 
see that in some of the European
inspired<00:05:15.650> stuff<00:05:15.890> it<00:05:16.070> is<00:05:16.340> a<00:05:16.370> nice<00:05:16.640> touch<00:05:16.850> and

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
inspired stuff it is a nice touch and

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.400 
inspired stuff it is a nice touch and
it's<00:05:17.150> differentiated<00:05:17.780> it<00:05:17.840> adds<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:18.080> nice<00:05:18.230> line

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
it's differentiated it adds a nice line
