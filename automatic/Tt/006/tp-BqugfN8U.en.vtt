right<00:00:18.690> I'm<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.200> morning<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
right I'm here this morning to do a

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.610 
right I'm here this morning to do a
little<00:00:20.340> demonstration<00:00:20.700> of<00:00:21.390> shopping<00:00:22.350> in

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
little demonstration of shopping in

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.980 
little demonstration of shopping in
plane<00:00:22.920> blades<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.670> chisels<00:00:24.270> these<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.780> plane

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
plane blades and chisels these are plane

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.200 
plane blades and chisels these are plane
ions<00:00:25.560> actually<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:26.640> you'd<00:00:26.790> call<00:00:27.000> them

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
ions actually is what you'd call them

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.970 
ions actually is what you'd call them
and<00:00:27.390> I've<00:00:27.870> got<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.110> number<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.500> different<00:00:28.860> ones

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
and I've got a number of different ones

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.580 
and I've got a number of different ones
here<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> number<00:00:30.630> five<00:00:30.990> plane

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
here now these are a number five plane

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.070 
here now these are a number five plane
ions<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.220> Stanley<00:00:32.760> plane<00:00:33.060> and<00:00:33.420> these<00:00:33.900> are

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
ions for a Stanley plane and these are

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.960 
ions for a Stanley plane and these are
just<00:00:34.200> some<00:00:34.320> various<00:00:34.920> chisels<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.760> one

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
just some various chisels with one

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.030 
just some various chisels with one
narrower<00:00:36.450> around<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.930> half<00:00:37.140> an<00:00:37.290> inch<00:00:37.440> wide<00:00:37.559> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
narrower around a half an inch wide and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.080 
narrower around a half an inch wide and
this<00:00:38.160> one's<00:00:38.340> around<00:00:38.610> an<00:00:38.730> inch<00:00:38.880> and<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> half

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
this one's around an inch and a half

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.030 
this one's around an inch and a half
wide<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.840> we're<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.470> to<00:00:40.530> grind<00:00:40.770> these

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
wide and we're going to grind these

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.130 
wide and we're going to grind these
things<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> bench<00:00:41.940> grinder<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.630> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
things up on a bench grinder here and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.140 
things up on a bench grinder here and
then<00:00:43.260> switch<00:00:43.500> over<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.280> bit<00:00:44.970> of

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
then switch over and do a little bit of

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.510 
then switch over and do a little bit of
honing<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.170> some<00:00:46.379> stones<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.400> them

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
honing on some stones and get them

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.070 
honing on some stones and get them
sharpened<00:00:47.910> up<00:00:48.059> nice<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.270> show<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.629> how<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.840> go

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
sharpened up nice and show you how we go

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.660 
sharpened up nice and show you how we go
about<00:00:49.290> it<00:00:49.500> all<00:00:49.739> right<00:00:49.830> so<00:00:50.070> I'm<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> bench

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
about it all right so I'm at the bench

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
about it all right so I'm at the bench
grinder<00:00:51.150> here<00:00:51.330> now<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.839> a<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.110> small

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
grinder here now it's just a very small

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.700 
grinder here now it's just a very small
little<00:00:52.769> six-inch<00:00:53.580> bench<00:00:54.360> grinder<00:00:55.019> and<00:00:55.199> it's

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
little six-inch bench grinder and it's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.340 
little six-inch bench grinder and it's
got<00:00:56.040> an<00:00:56.280> aluminum<00:00:56.640> oxide<00:00:57.480> wheel<00:00:57.839> on<00:00:58.080> it<00:00:58.110> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
got an aluminum oxide wheel on it this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.890 
got an aluminum oxide wheel on it this
is<00:00:58.409> a<00:00:58.589> finer<00:00:59.040> grade<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.850> aluminum<00:01:00.269> oxide<00:01:00.420> one

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
is a finer grade of aluminum oxide one

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.229 
is a finer grade of aluminum oxide one
of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.110> finer<00:01:01.409> wheels<00:01:01.769> that<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:02.519> make<00:01:02.879> white

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
of the finer wheels that they make white

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.170 
of the finer wheels that they make white
and<00:01:04.010> right<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.220> I've<00:01:05.339> got<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.760> little

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and right here I've got this little

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.970 
and right here I've got this little
setup<00:01:06.480> and<00:01:06.810> I've<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:07.200> made<00:01:07.440> of<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.710> piece<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
setup and I've got made of a piece of

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.740 
setup and I've got made of a piece of
wood<00:01:08.310> clamped<00:01:08.909> down<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> bench

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
wood clamped down to the bench

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.140 
wood clamped down to the bench
it's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.500> very<00:01:10.800> nice<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.490> piece<00:01:11.880> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it's a very nice little piece of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.540 
it's a very nice little piece of
equipment<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.350> need<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.370> get

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
equipment that I need to have to get

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.240 
equipment that I need to have to get
this<00:01:14.700> project<00:01:15.150> done<00:01:15.600> properly<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.380> basically

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
this project done properly and basically

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.620 
this project done properly and basically
what<00:01:17.400> I'm<00:01:17.490> using<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.940> for<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.300> a<00:01:18.330> guide

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
what I'm using it for is a guide

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.300 
what I'm using it for is a guide
mechanism<00:01:19.350> well<00:01:19.470> first<00:01:19.710> thing<00:01:19.979> I'm<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
mechanism well first thing I'm going to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.359 
mechanism well first thing I'm going to
do<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.909> grind<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.690> thing<00:01:21.930> flat<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.070> end

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
do is grind this thing flat on the end

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.850 
do is grind this thing flat on the end
because<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.540> got<00:01:24.719> the<00:01:24.840> chips<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> damage<00:01:25.710> in

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
because it's got the chips and damage in

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.550 
because it's got the chips and damage in
it<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.280> said<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> I'm<00:01:27.780> using<00:01:28.200> this

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it like I said and I'm using this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
it like I said and I'm using this
aluminum<00:01:29.070> oxide<00:01:29.460> wheel<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> heats

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
aluminum oxide wheel because it heats

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.630 
aluminum oxide wheel because it heats
the<00:01:30.810> metal<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.469> very<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.460> that's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the metal very very little and that's

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.700 
the metal very very little and that's
the<00:01:32.820> whole<00:01:32.969> idea<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.539> don't<00:01:34.049> want<00:01:34.469> to<00:01:34.560> heat

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the whole idea you don't want to heat

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.219 
the whole idea you don't want to heat
this<00:01:34.920> metal<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> quench<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
this metal up I'm not going to quench it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.080 
this metal up I'm not going to quench it
in<00:01:37.320> water<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:38.280> I'm<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.939> heat

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
in water because I'm not going to heat

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.700 
in water because I'm not going to heat
it<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.630> no<00:01:39.810> reason<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.200> cool<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> down

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it I have no reason to cool it down

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.499 
it I have no reason to cool it down
because<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.399> not<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.820> eat<00:01:41.969> it<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
because I'm not going to eat it up and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.170 
because I'm not going to eat it up and
I'm<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> use<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.399> thumb<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.759> my

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
I'm actually going to use my thumb on my

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.319 
I'm actually going to use my thumb on my
left<00:01:45.420> hand<00:01:45.719> as<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.280> feed<00:01:47.280> mechanism<00:01:47.609> so<00:01:48.240> I'm

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
left hand as a feed mechanism so I'm

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.270 
left hand as a feed mechanism so I'm
going<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.539> slide<00:01:48.990> back<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.530> forth<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:50.039> very

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
going to slide back and forth there very

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.910 
going to slide back and forth there very
rapidly<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.149> I'm<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> allow<00:01:52.530> any

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
rapidly and I'm not going to allow any

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.830 
rapidly and I'm not going to allow any
heat<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.549> build<00:01:53.789> up<00:01:53.969> in<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.240> blade

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
heat to build up in this blade

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.230 
heat to build up in this blade
never<00:01:55.229> grinding<00:01:55.859> or<00:01:56.009> lingering<00:01:56.609> in<00:01:56.789> any<00:01:56.969> one

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
never grinding or lingering in any one

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.899 
never grinding or lingering in any one
spot<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.840> create<00:01:58.200> heat<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.710> any<00:01:58.950> one<00:01:59.250> spot

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
spot to create heat in any one spot

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.810 
spot to create heat in any one spot
so<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:00.659> I'm<00:02:00.929> grinding<00:02:01.619> yeah<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.310> getting<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so as I'm grinding yeah and getting the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340 
so as I'm grinding yeah and getting the
hollow<00:02:03.000> grind<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:03.719> looking<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
hollow grind that I'm looking for on the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.990 
hollow grind that I'm looking for on the
backside<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:05.039> gonna<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.460> turn<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.880> over

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
backside I'm gonna have to turn it over

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.940 
backside I'm gonna have to turn it over
every<00:02:06.479> once<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.869> while<00:02:06.929> like<00:02:07.289> that<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
every once in a while like that just to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.980 
every once in a while like that just to
see<00:02:08.190> if<00:02:08.429> I'm<00:02:08.610> pleased<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> length<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
see if I'm pleased with the length of

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.170 
see if I'm pleased with the length of
the<00:02:10.080> grind<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.619> I'm<00:02:10.740> getting<00:02:11.130> without<00:02:11.550> moving

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the grind and I'm getting without moving

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.900 
the grind and I'm getting without moving
my<00:02:12.390> finger<00:02:12.960> as<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> guide<00:02:13.680> mechanism<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.880> I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
my finger as a guide mechanism so that I

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.120 
my finger as a guide mechanism so that I
can<00:02:15.180> move<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.510> right<00:02:15.750> back<00:02:15.990> into<00:02:16.440> position<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
can move it right back into position and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.990 
can move it right back into position and
have<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.820> same<00:02:18.060> length<00:02:18.470> there's<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.560> wind

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
have the same length there's a wind

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.120 
have the same length there's a wind
coming<00:02:21.000> down<00:02:21.150> off<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:22.110> wheel<00:02:22.770> as<00:02:23.100> it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
coming down off of this wheel as it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.610 
coming down off of this wheel as it
rotates<00:02:23.820> that<00:02:24.120> actually<00:02:24.600> helps<00:02:24.900> cool<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
rotates that actually helps cool the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.619 
rotates that actually helps cool the
blade<00:02:25.920> I'm<00:02:26.280> actually<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.909> can<00:02:27.180> touch<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.450> with

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
blade I'm actually I can touch it with

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.750 
blade I'm actually I can touch it with
my<00:02:27.870> fingers<00:02:28.379> or<00:02:28.800> whatever<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.340> see<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
my fingers or whatever to see if the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.120 
my fingers or whatever to see if the
heats<00:02:29.940> increasing<00:02:30.599> but<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:31.019> know<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.800> as<00:02:31.950> I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
heats increasing but I know that as I

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.620 
heats increasing but I know that as I
grind<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.520> very<00:02:32.700> rapidly<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.270> don't<00:02:33.480> have<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
grind it very rapidly I don't have a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.560 
grind it very rapidly I don't have a
problem<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.430> V<00:02:35.880> enemy

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
problem with that and that is V enemy

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.960 
problem with that and that is V enemy
would<00:02:36.990> be<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.260> heat<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.740> blade<00:02:37.860> up<00:02:38.220> or<00:02:38.430> keep

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
would be to heat the blade up or keep

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.180 
would be to heat the blade up or keep
quenching<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.750> heating<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.560> quenching<00:02:41.070> it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
quenching it heating it and quenching it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.530 
quenching it heating it and quenching it
you<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.430> take<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.790> template<00:02:42.120> right<00:02:42.330> out<00:02:42.510> of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
you just take the template right out of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.930 
you just take the template right out of
it<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:43.740> I'm<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.100> take<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> look<00:02:44.610> at<00:02:44.790> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
it now I'm going to take a look at it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.720 
it now I'm going to take a look at it
and<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.530> finally<00:02:46.530> ground<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.100> all<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> way<00:02:47.460> from

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and I finally ground it all the way from

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.360 
and I finally ground it all the way from
the<00:02:47.850> heel<00:02:48.090> edge<00:02:48.390> all<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:49.380> way<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.010> cutting

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
the heel edge all the way to the cutting

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.400 
the heel edge all the way to the cutting
edge<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.420> actually<00:02:51.780> got<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> little<00:02:52.080> burr

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
edge and it's actually got a little burr

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.410 
edge and it's actually got a little burr
on<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.860> backside<00:02:53.370> from<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.790> grinding<00:02:54.270> now

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
on the backside from the grinding now

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.300 
on the backside from the grinding now
that's<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> way<00:02:54.960> I<00:02:54.990> know<00:02:55.170> I've<00:02:55.500> completed<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
that's the way I know I've completed it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.130 
that's the way I know I've completed it
I<00:02:56.550> know<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.600> show<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.930> little

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
I know I'm going to show you a little

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.230 
I know I'm going to show you a little
chisel<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.800> I've<00:02:58.950> been<00:02:59.070> using<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.970> cut

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
chisel that I've been using here to cut

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.060 
chisel that I've been using here to cut
the<00:03:00.270> rabbet<00:03:00.840> in<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.110> forefoot<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.950> 8

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
the rabbet in the forefoot of the 8

meter<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.550> I'm<00:03:02.730> working<00:03:03.060> on<00:03:03.180> now<00:03:03.450> I've

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
meter that I'm working on now I've

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.900 
meter that I'm working on now I've
actually<00:03:04.260> ground<00:03:04.800> this<00:03:05.070> many<00:03:05.340> times<00:03:05.670> before

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
actually ground this many times before

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.840 
actually ground this many times before
and<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.360> grinding<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.930> right<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:08.040> every<00:03:08.580> time

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
and the grinding is right but every time

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.260 
and the grinding is right but every time
I<00:03:09.180> shop<00:03:09.510> in<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.930> tool<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.680> grind<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.580> first<00:03:11.910> I

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
I shop in a tool I grind it first I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.930 
I shop in a tool I grind it first I
don't<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:13.110> take<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.410> tool<00:03:14.010> over<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.670> stone

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
don't just take a tool over to the stone

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.360 
don't just take a tool over to the stone
and<00:03:15.330> start<00:03:15.960> working<00:03:16.350> at<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.860> stone<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
and start working at it on the stone the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.280 
and start working at it on the stone the
damage<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> little<00:03:18.270> bit<00:03:18.450> too<00:03:18.630> much<00:03:18.810> even<00:03:19.170> if

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
damage is a little bit too much even if

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.860 
damage is a little bit too much even if
it's<00:03:19.440> very<00:03:19.680> very<00:03:19.950> slight<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.880> every<00:03:21.390> time<00:03:21.630> I

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
it's very very slight so every time I

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.630 
it's very very slight so every time I
shop<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.470> go<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.830> stone<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.250> we<00:03:23.400> grind

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
shop and I go to the stone and we grind

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.580 
shop and I go to the stone and we grind
you<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.240> see<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.630> it's<00:03:24.750> been<00:03:24.930> ground<00:03:25.230> all

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
you can see that it's been ground all

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.290 
you can see that it's been ground all
the<00:03:25.620> way<00:03:25.860> from<00:03:26.250> its<00:03:26.400> cutting<00:03:26.790> edge<00:03:26.940> all<00:03:27.240> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
the way from its cutting edge all the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.350 
the way from its cutting edge all the
way<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.870> heel<00:03:28.080> one<00:03:28.920> nice<00:03:29.280> consistent<00:03:30.150> ala

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
way to the heel one nice consistent ala

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.780 
way to the heel one nice consistent ala
grind<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.990> length<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.680> now<00:03:32.490> I<00:03:32.550> can

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
grind the length of it and now I can

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.910 
grind the length of it and now I can
move<00:03:32.910> over<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.480> stone<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.050> just<00:03:34.500> rub<00:03:34.800> it

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
move over to the stone and just rub it

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.620 
move over to the stone and just rub it
over<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.340> stone<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> little<00:03:35.910> bit<00:03:36.270> you'll<00:03:36.510> be

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
over the stone a little bit you'll be

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.530 
over the stone a little bit you'll be
done<00:03:36.840> I'm<00:03:37.080> just<00:03:37.140> about<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.950> hone<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.940> edge<00:03:39.180> on

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
done I'm just about to hone the edge on

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.870 
done I'm just about to hone the edge on
a<00:03:39.570> few<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:39.990> these<00:03:40.110> blades<00:03:40.530> here<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.130> first

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
a few of these blades here and first

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.250 
a few of these blades here and first
thing<00:03:42.030> I'd<00:03:42.150> like<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.330> show<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:42.960> I'm

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
thing I'd like to show you is that I'm

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.430 
thing I'd like to show you is that I'm
not<00:03:43.470> going<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.770> use<00:03:43.920> any<00:03:44.570> honing<00:03:45.570> oil<00:03:46.050> I'm

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
not going to use any honing oil I'm

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.620 
not going to use any honing oil I'm
going<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.710> use<00:03:46.830> denatured<00:03:47.520> alcohol<00:03:47.670> here<00:03:48.360> now

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
going to use denatured alcohol here now

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.070 
going to use denatured alcohol here now
the<00:03:48.690> idea<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.380> is<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.710> just<00:03:49.890> keep<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
the idea of this is to just keep the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.200 
the idea of this is to just keep the
metal<00:03:52.080> that<00:03:52.260> I've<00:03:52.440> honed<00:03:52.710> off<00:03:53.070> mobile<00:03:53.730> on<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
metal that I've honed off mobile on the

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.210 
metal that I've honed off mobile on the
stone<00:03:54.570> so<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.170> keeps<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.470> stone<00:03:55.770> kind<00:03:56.100> of

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
stone so it keeps the stone kind of

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.310 
stone so it keeps the stone kind of
clean<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.060> also<00:03:57.240> keeps<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.690> edge<00:03:57.960> of<00:03:58.230> the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
clean and it also keeps the edge of the

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.500 
clean and it also keeps the edge of the
blade<00:03:58.530> cool<00:03:58.980> first<00:03:59.670> I'm<00:03:59.850> going<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.090> start<00:04:00.330> off

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
blade cool first I'm going to start off

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.000 
blade cool first I'm going to start off
with<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.840> stone<00:04:01.140> right<00:04:01.350> here<00:04:01.380> now<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.830> is<00:04:01.890> a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
with this stone right here now this is a

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.680 
with this stone right here now this is a
little<00:04:02.250> diamond<00:04:02.700> stone<00:04:02.970> they<00:04:03.180> make<00:04:03.360> these<00:04:03.510> in

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
little diamond stone they make these in

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.240 
little diamond stone they make these in
different<00:04:03.840> grits<00:04:04.230> this<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.590> red<00:04:04.860> stone<00:04:05.190> I

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
different grits this is a red stone I

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.850 
different grits this is a red stone I
think<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:05.970> about<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.270> medium<00:04:06.650> grit<00:04:07.650> and

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
think this is about a medium grit and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.430 
think this is about a medium grit and
then<00:04:08.610> I've<00:04:09.030> got<00:04:09.270> a<00:04:09.300> little<00:04:09.480> Arkansas<00:04:10.080> stone

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
then I've got a little Arkansas stone

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.140 
then I've got a little Arkansas stone
here<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.130> razor<00:04:11.459> stone<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.120> don't

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
here and this is a razor stone I don't

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.790 
here and this is a razor stone I don't
know<00:04:12.420> what<00:04:12.570> kind<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.870> stone<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.500> but<00:04:13.680> it's

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
know what kind of stone this is but it's

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.330 
know what kind of stone this is but it's
awful<00:04:14.250> fine<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:15.030> this<00:04:15.420> puts<00:04:15.690> us<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.959> finish<00:04:16.340> on

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
awful fine and this puts us to finish on

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.310 
awful fine and this puts us to finish on
the<00:04:17.609> edge<00:04:17.760> right<00:04:17.790> there<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:19.020> I'm<00:04:19.140> going<00:04:19.290> to

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
the edge right there so I'm going to

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.539 
the edge right there so I'm going to
show<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.530> how<00:04:19.709> it's<00:04:19.890> really<00:04:19.980> going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.400> put<00:04:20.520> a

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
show you how it's really going to put a

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.660 
show you how it's really going to put a
little<00:04:20.700> alcohol<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.480> stone<00:04:21.750> here<00:04:22.109> and

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
little alcohol on the stone here and

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.730 
little alcohol on the stone here and
then<00:04:23.670> feel<00:04:24.000> for<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.330> right<00:04:24.480> angle<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.140> can<00:04:25.470> feel

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
then feel for the right angle I can feel

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.790 
then feel for the right angle I can feel
the<00:04:25.920> edge<00:04:26.340> down<00:04:27.060> right<00:04:27.450> there<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:27.930> I'm<00:04:28.740> just

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
the edge down right there and I'm just

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.860 
the edge down right there and I'm just
going<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.160> make<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.640> couple<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.270> little<00:04:30.450> swipes

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
going to make a couple of little swipes

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.990 
going to make a couple of little swipes
on<00:04:31.140> there<00:04:31.290> like<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.550> can<00:04:32.670> see<00:04:32.850> that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
on there like that and you can see that

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.030 
on there like that and you can see that
it's<00:04:33.180> under<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.780> alcohol<00:04:34.410> so<00:04:34.650> it's<00:04:34.800> staying

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
it's under the alcohol so it's staying

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.460 
it's under the alcohol so it's staying
nice<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.280> cool<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:36.000> that's<00:04:36.390> it<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:37.350> that

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
nice and cool and that's it and that

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.410 
nice and cool and that's it and that
diamond<00:04:37.890> stone<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.280> actually<00:04:38.670> raised<00:04:38.910> another

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
diamond stone is actually raised another

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.750 
diamond stone is actually raised another
burr<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:39.780> there<00:04:40.290> so<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:40.830> know<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.220> I've<00:04:41.490> gotten

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
burr on there so I know that I've gotten

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.250 
burr on there so I know that I've gotten
to<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.940> edge<00:04:42.090> of<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.360> again<00:04:42.660> now<00:04:42.870> I'm<00:04:42.990> going<00:04:43.140> to

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
to the edge of it again now I'm going to

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.500 
to the edge of it again now I'm going to
put<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.410> little<00:04:43.590> alcohol<00:04:44.130> on<00:04:44.700> this<00:04:44.880> stone<00:04:45.180> and

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
put a little alcohol on this stone and

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.720 
put a little alcohol on this stone and
I'm<00:04:46.260> actually<00:04:46.500> going<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.830> lay<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.220> down<00:04:47.250> on

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
I'm actually going to lay it down on

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.410 
I'm actually going to lay it down on
here<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:48.240> just<00:04:49.340> and<00:04:50.340> that's<00:04:50.550> pretty<00:04:50.880> much<00:04:51.120> it

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
here and just and that's pretty much it

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
move that little burr back and forth now

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.470 
move that little burr back and forth now
I'm<00:04:56.430> going<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.640> switch<00:04:56.820> over<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.330> next

I'm going to switch over to the next
stone<00:04:59.750> alcohol<00:05:00.750> on<00:05:00.990> her<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:02.730> I'm<00:05:02.970> going<00:05:03.180> to
