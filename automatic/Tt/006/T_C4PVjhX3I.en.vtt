actually really close so it was really

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.449 
actually really close so it was really

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.750 
with Super Saiyan to go ha i was
probably<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.260> she<00:02:40.320> moved<00:02:40.830> by<00:02:41.040> my<00:02:41.250> heart<00:02:41.550> but

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
