00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:12.360
 It was dawn here, people who say that. 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.460
 is that today are all welcome more 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.699
 a video in today's video I bring to 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.609
 comparisons between the versions of 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.189
 positions of old consoles and right 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.199
 new personal consoles on the left side 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.689
 you are seeing the old consoles and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.150
 on the right side the new islands in the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.399
 if I speak consoles but in reality is the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.110
 left side playstation 3 on the side 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.700
 right xbox one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 I am not comparing 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.980
 the same microsoft consoles because the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.899
 My 360 was off so it was very 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.760
 commitment to stay calling videogame calling 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 capture card to be able to do 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.140
 basically I only captured four 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.059
 small stretches also placing 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.149
 playstation 3 because the image of the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.370
 of Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in the neck 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.859
 goal x is basically the same thing 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.410
 Nothing changes at least today. 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.159
 I played both versions and the same thing already 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.619
 of the old islands by the new moults 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.500
 God damn I do not know about the pc 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.810
 connect however of playstation 3 wii and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.780
 xbox lan is basically as if it were 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.320
 almost another game do not say yes another game 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.420
 on different maps 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.790
 anyway the game is the same as you 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.900
 understand that the game is the same but the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.030
 textures or brightness contrast the sharpness of the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.890
 scenery is much more beautiful in 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.320
 new islands galera i believe 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.240
 both playstation 4 and xbox wool 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.530
 game should have to vote the same 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.570
 maybe it has a small difference 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.040
 ready it seems that playstation runs on 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.500
 resolution slightly higher than xbox 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.540
 but I think in the quality aspect 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.060
 of che dehs 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.759
 finally on both playstation 4 and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.310
 xbox the year the deal is very violent 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.140
 just to let you feel the pictures well 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.969
 captured from the two islands here 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.340
 have any type of imaging treatment 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.619
 nothing they were captured with a plaque 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.960
 capture is the cat then the images 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.270
 are raw without any kind of editing 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.039
 nothing unique that is edited in 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.119
 split- screen issue for you 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.370
 to accompany 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.540
 both games basically running on the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.069
 same scenario at the same time 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.870
 I confess to you who enjoy 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.489
 quite the version of xbox one 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.260
 although he has not played any 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.180
 multiplayer match nothing because the game 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.709
 just downloaded so not 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 I got to play multiplayer to see how 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.159
 is that the connection to see how the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.620
 scheme has worked by indicating the 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.750
 people can see that on some maps 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.329
 the image is much more beautiful too 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.920
 more detailed information is much sharper 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.450
 coloration mainly from 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.730
 coloration so you feel the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.620
 coloring is more vivid than the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.170
 some details mainly of water 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.450
 of smoke is much more 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.879
 also detailed in the new islands 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.590
 however the rest of the game continues to 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.930
 same thing the same same paths 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.180
 the same defects we say 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.129
 so the game has another in that 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.250
 point does not have any kind of difference 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.810
 The same gameplay is the exact time you 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.000
 pull aim at an opponent for the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.340
 other to do that dash is everything to 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.379
 same thing does not change anything at all 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.450
 this point here on this history map 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.889
 harry who is one of you will see the big 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.870
 for example the right side of the 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.419
 xbox you can see the effect of water 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.549
 he has the birds passing at last these 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.739
 this part detail but I did this part of 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.840
 is much more detailed by 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.180
 example, but the rest remains 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.280
 same thing I confess to you that 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.949
 so if you think about buying a 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.799
 playstation 3 playstation 4 o xbox one 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:34.569
 year to play with the future and no ghosts 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.299
 it's worth every difference is too little 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.970
 It does not pay I think it's worth much more 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.340
 It's a pity you continue on 360 and also 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.919
 playstation 3 because it has much more 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.879
 people playing online and that ends 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.919
 being much easier for you 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.260
 can play there you make a 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.419
 investment both at stake and in 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.120
 console to play the same game only with 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:58.209
 a more beautiful texture and ones and shape 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.159
 of light here or there but legal confessed 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.290
 for you who really do not pay 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.970
 I ended up buying because I am the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.129
 Youtube, do the video at last. 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.530
 willy - nilly always worth you 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.599
 spend a little more to try 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.489
 bring a little more novelty to the 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.840
 your subscribers in the case you in this part 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.790
 of you will also be able to see the 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.659
 absurd difference much clearer the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.849
 xbox year 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:22.000
 the effects are much cooler too 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.639
 anyway the game is the same but the image 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.530
 the image is much sharper 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.569
 in the new consoles or the galley 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.580
 I hope you enjoyed and that 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:31.110
 comparative video it can stay 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.569
 Calm down, I'll be bringing more 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.919
 ghosts color game place on xbox o 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.810
 year and if you have any questions 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.430

 I do some other kind of video 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.499
 explaining to you is taking away the doubt 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.669
 Neither of you 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:46.949
 This is it people, I hope you have 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.319

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.319
