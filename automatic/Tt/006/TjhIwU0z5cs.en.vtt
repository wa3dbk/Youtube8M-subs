00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
get out of a hat really well all your

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.230 
get out of a hat really well all your
kids<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.560> now<00:05:52.740> you<00:05:52.800> have<00:05:53.100> and<00:05:53.760> I<00:05:53.910> think<00:05:54.120> this

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
kids and now you have and I think this

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.700 
kids and now you have and I think this
is<00:05:54.300> one<00:05:54.540> of<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.720> things<00:05:54.930> that<00:05:55.020> I<00:05:55.110> really<00:05:55.350> am

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
is one of the things that I really am

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.820 
is one of the things that I really am
liking<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.610> trend<00:05:56.910> is<00:05:57.240> is<00:05:57.570> that<00:05:58.500> you<00:05:58.590> have

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
liking the trend is is that you have

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.620 
liking the trend is is that you have
things<00:05:59.040> that<00:05:59.190> double<00:05:59.580> so<00:06:00.030> you<00:06:00.120> can<00:06:00.600> actually

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
things that double so you can actually

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.030 
things that double so you can actually
get<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:01.020> car<00:06:01.230> seat<00:06:01.410> that<00:06:01.560> doubles<00:06:01.890> as<00:06:01.980> a

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
get a car seat that doubles as a

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.740 
get a car seat that doubles as a
stroller<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:02.880> know<00:06:03.000> that<00:06:03.120> will<00:06:03.240> turn<00:06:03.420> into<00:06:03.600> a

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
stroller you know that will turn into a

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.260 
stroller you know that will turn into a
shelter<00:06:04.110> well<00:06:04.440> yeah<00:06:04.770> which<00:06:05.160> I<00:06:05.370> think<00:06:05.880> when<00:06:06.150> you

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
shelter well yeah which I think when you

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.440 
shelter well yeah which I think when you
can<00:06:06.420> find<00:06:06.690> products<00:06:07.320> that<00:06:07.590> do<00:06:08.330> multiple<00:06:09.330> more

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
can find products that do multiple more

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.660 
can find products that do multiple more
