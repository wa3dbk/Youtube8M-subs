00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.250
 it's a Germanic concept it's called 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.049
 roux fra aus and in fact these are 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.940
 modular elements that come together 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.719
 according to not in the configuration of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.719
 field if you want 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.250
 for me my definition of luxury is a 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.529
 little space light then this 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.239
 villa concept fit well to this 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.220
 what I aspire for is a little bit of 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.050
 stripping the possibility anyway 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.269
 to recover some family furniture 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.159
 of peasant style I wondered if 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:37.010
 it was going to make a clash with the side a 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.809
 more rigorous a little zen of this all 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.460
 reason to black and its white walls 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.739
 finally it's a compromise that 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.570
 seems pretty sweet when we do a 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.460
 house of this style there we are invited to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.140
 to visit models villas and to be able to 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.129
 choose if it is best 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.350
 according to his needs 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.359
 so here every detail has been thought and has 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.899
 been arranged in a personalized way 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.039
 compared to a global concept 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.989
 when we have the chance to develop 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.610
 two houses according to his own 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.729
 needs you have to think about the practical side 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.970
 I thought I could combine 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.429
 my bedroom with the bathroom 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.649
 bath the locker room in passing and then 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.420
 still play on the leash the 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.830
 light have space in a room 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.610
 bathroom today it's also 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.610
 part of luxury 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.970
 this is the kitchen side obviously to 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.340
 the American for us not to be 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.930
 cut off guests when we're not in 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.280
 doing his little dishes then 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.720
 when he is very eager to have a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.330
 small kitchen corner laboratory where we 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.940
 can leave flu 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.170
 one of the microwaves mxr all 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.090
 that in general we have to live hidden in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 the cabinets before the arrival of the guests 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.060
 I think this solution pleased 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060
 many visitors 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.010
 that's one of the chances when 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.890
 built the house one lay on a 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.390
 source and the world workers there is this 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.680
 let it be taken from the soul and to the sewer julie 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.659
 North is what we can not collect 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.100
 on the contrary then the idea would have come 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.080
 to make a basin actually that is 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.820
 powered by both this source 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.179
 and then by the roof water that recovers 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.830
 and that also feeds when one is 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.810
 globe trotter journalist who travel 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.390
 three times a month we need 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.020
 to know where we are from and where we live where we have 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.010
 its roots 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.010
 for me it's here
