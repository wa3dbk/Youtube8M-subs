though is actually the brake lights at
the<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.149> because<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:54.660> are<00:00:54.840> indeed<00:00:55.289> brake

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the back because they are indeed brake

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.060 
the back because they are indeed brake
lights<00:00:56.329> there<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> rear<00:00:58.559> lights<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:58.949> they

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
would be normally but then by applying

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.119 
would be normally but then by applying
brakes<00:01:02.989> see<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.320> break<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.979> see

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
brakes see that for break you can see

lights they just plug it directly into
the<00:01:19.110> control<00:01:19.500> unit<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:20.159> stare<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.640> constant

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the control unit they stare of constant

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.789 
the control unit they stare of constant
voltage<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.530> why<00:01:22.650> they

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
voltage as you see this that's why they
