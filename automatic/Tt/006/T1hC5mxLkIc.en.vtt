00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.640 
150 of each line but because the ages
are<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.220> staggered<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:32.120> really<00:04:33.080> need<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.289> carry

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
are so staggered I really need to carry

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.939 
are so staggered I really need to carry
on<00:04:34.330> producing<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.539> lot<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.169> materials<00:04:36.740> so<00:04:36.919> that

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
on producing a lot of materials so that

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.379 
on producing a lot of materials so that
we<00:04:37.160> can<00:04:37.310> have<00:04:37.340> one<00:04:37.550> final<00:04:37.760> push<00:04:38.120> so

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
we can have one final push so

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:39.730 
we can have one final push so
everything's<00:04:38.810> within<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.199> couple<00:04:39.530> of<00:04:39.680> weeks

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
everything's within a couple of weeks

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.460 
everything's within a couple of weeks
age<00:04:40.099> of<00:04:40.340> each<00:04:40.460> other<00:04:40.729> so<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.479> the<00:04:41.870> results<00:04:42.289> on

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
age of each other so that the results on

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.040 
age of each other so that the results on
the<00:04:42.620> plot<00:04:42.860> are<00:04:43.130> more<00:04:43.669> or<00:04:43.760> less<00:04:43.789> uniform<00:04:44.060> that's

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
the plot are more or less uniform that's

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.430 
the plot are more or less uniform that's
that's<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.039> idea<00:04:46.310> as<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.820> standard

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
that's the idea as the standard

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.170 
that's the idea as the standard
hopefully<00:04:48.440> most<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.400> them<00:04:49.550> will<00:04:49.699> be<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:50.000> size

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
hopefully most of them will be that size

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.850 
hopefully most of them will be that size
what<00:04:50.810> we're<00:04:50.930> going<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.110> put<00:04:51.199> out<00:04:51.380> in<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.620> field

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
what we're going to put out in the field

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.790 
what we're going to put out in the field
is<00:04:52.010> about<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.280> hundred<00:04:52.520> plants<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.440> normal<00:04:54.440> 20

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
is about a hundred plants of normal 20

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.300 
is about a hundred plants of normal 20
and<00:04:55.160> 100<00:04:55.729> plants<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.449> 20<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:57.470> carry<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.919> late

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
then another one from a different wild

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.140 
then another one from a different wild
potato<00:05:05.840> called<00:05:06.349> salon<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:06.919> mochi<00:05:07.220> kenzie<00:05:07.639> so

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
potato called salon and mochi kenzie so

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.230 
potato called salon and mochi kenzie so
we'll<00:05:08.389> be<00:05:08.570> trying<00:05:09.020> these<00:05:09.470> two<00:05:09.860> GM<00:05:10.550> lines<00:05:10.849> and

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
we'll be trying these two GM lines and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.930 
we'll be trying these two GM lines and
we<00:05:11.720> hope<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:12.080> see<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.830> these<00:05:13.010> GM<00:05:13.460> varieties

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
we hope to see that these GM varieties

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.689 
we hope to see that these GM varieties
are<00:05:14.419> light<00:05:15.110> resistant<00:05:15.590> whereas<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:16.340> desire

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
are light resistant whereas the desire

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.570 
are light resistant whereas the desire
itself<00:05:17.270> goes<00:05:17.720> down<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.289> late<00:05:18.650> blight<00:05:18.860> late

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
itself goes down to late blight late

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.719 
itself goes down to late blight late
blight<00:05:19.849> is<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.479> very<00:05:21.070> versatile<00:05:22.070> pathogen<00:05:22.639> a

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
rapidly evolving pathogen so for this to

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.610 
rapidly evolving pathogen so for this to
be<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.639> long-term<00:05:25.849> strategy<00:05:26.630> we<00:05:27.110> need<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.470> be

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
be a long-term strategy we need to be

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.279 
be a long-term strategy we need to be
continuously<00:05:28.280> isolating<00:05:28.970> new<00:05:29.210> late<00:05:30.110> blight

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
continuously isolating new late blight

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.909 
continuously isolating new late blight
resistance<00:05:30.770> genes<00:05:31.039> and<00:05:31.510> putting<00:05:32.510> them<00:05:32.599> into

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
resistance genes and putting them into

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.860 
resistance genes and putting them into
the<00:05:33.919> varieties<00:05:34.340> we<00:05:34.490> want<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.849> consume<00:05:35.300> there's

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
the varieties we want to consume there's

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.820 
the varieties we want to consume there's
a<00:05:35.960> great<00:05:36.200> deal<00:05:36.530> of

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
a great deal of

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.890 
a great deal of
natural<00:05:38.370> variation<00:05:38.910> for<00:05:39.180> resistance<00:05:39.600> out

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
natural variation for resistance out

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.550 
natural variation for resistance out
there<00:05:40.320> and<00:05:40.560> with<00:05:41.340> new<00:05:41.870> technology<00:05:42.870> it's

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
there and with new technology it's

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.800 
there and with new technology it's
getting<00:05:43.830> easier<00:05:43.980> and<00:05:44.250> easier<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:45.000> isolate<00:05:45.630> the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
getting easier and easier to isolate the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.230 
getting easier and easier to isolate the
corresponding<00:05:46.440> genes<00:05:46.680> so<00:05:47.490> we<00:05:47.880> think<00:05:48.030> we'll<00:05:48.210> be

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
corresponding genes so we think we'll be

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.630 
corresponding genes so we think we'll be
able<00:05:48.450> to<00:05:48.630> develop<00:05:48.990> a<00:05:49.050> pipeline<00:05:49.560> of<00:05:49.800> new<00:05:49.890> genes

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
able to develop a pipeline of new genes

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.820 
able to develop a pipeline of new genes
that<00:05:51.210> will<00:05:51.360> mean<00:05:51.510> that<00:05:51.540> and<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.380> varieties

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
that will mean that and the varieties

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.010 
that will mean that and the varieties
that<00:05:52.860> we<00:05:53.130> like<00:05:53.370> can<00:05:53.970> be<00:05:54.000> kept<00:05:54.270> safe<00:05:54.510> from<00:05:54.780> late

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
that we like can be kept safe from late

that we like can be kept safe from late
