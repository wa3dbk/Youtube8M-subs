00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.440
 the facts he will have minister in ready form 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.240
 just as I sell advice 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.069
 practices on training to have 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.190
 a healthy weight and good in your skin 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.969
 so today he's talking about that that in 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.789
 did a woman talked about it a little 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.460
 lately nothing asked the question I'm 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.380
 I'm told it was definitely not 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.170
 the only one who had taken this question 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.810
 there so I decided to talk a little about it 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.640
 little more today not only that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.189
 I wanted to talk to me then that I 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.719
 know all the same well enough I think about 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.190
 through time right now so I 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.980
 can still understand a little 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.500
 why can people think 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.290
 why except it will make you lose 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.079
 weight what does this time actually 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.610
 it's really the sauna there are people 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.649
 who are mainly women 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.260
 obviously excel merkel on nine has 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.289
 makes you lose weight then I you 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.219
 explain today why 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.449
 does this well in my second capsule 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.870
 people express me the most important 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.700
 why am I doing this but are it our 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 what does it do it's really not 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.869
 complicated is that in the background that you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.210
 makes you sweat so when you 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.990
 train when you're hot it's done 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.970
 sweat 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.070
 why we sweat is really 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.930
 to regulate the temperature of our 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.210
 body our body sweats like fn to 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.049
 background to refresh in his look up 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.180
 worthy the temperature inside 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.400
 so there is also another side people 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.619
 who said if I do not sweat I 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.090
 do not work it's hard sometimes 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.000
 you will sweat other times you have 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.650
 makes you sweat a little less but that's 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.020
 not because you work not offend 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.710
 until it's the way kids are trying 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.960
 still wrigley's just the heat 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.640
 so to hear the sound is what you have 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.560
 does that make it transpire there are 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.759
 despots everyone who will use 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.729
 their note 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.520
 it's going to be said to detoxify remove the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.780
 toxins and that I was dead I would say 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.940
 than 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.700
 childhood confess t that you go 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.380
 take a little subcutaneous water but 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.140
 as soon as you go to drink water you 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.260
 go redo your fill of water that you 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.530
 lost it will take a little while 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.020
 I did a test with Maxim the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.410
 it was this year or last year 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.930
 busts with walkyries I think 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.850
 that with the walkyries is who we wanted 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.860
 to test a fund of how many 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.350
 grams of water where do not they have 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.300
 then compared to the impedance is in 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.440
 made his name by delon traces worse 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.190
 what does it do for the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.880
 group percentage that since that him 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.300
 give and we are less 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.340
 I was pampered to be the same we went 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.800
 buy me a sunu man he made me 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.890
 before he makes me drink a lot a lot 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.780
 a lot of water does not do I think that 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.360
 as parent is nothing a pound of water on 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.420
 the balance I'm wrong so here we go 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.160
 I see a liter of water then I want 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.340
 to sell his egg I was trying 10 nights 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.250
 stele of pain through his name and 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.910
 an impedance was very different 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.370
 the heavily affected the end thoroughly the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.780
 percentage of fat with just that 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.510
 in fact a fat percentage via 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.520
 impedance facing this barca are telling you 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.800
 that you may be bigger 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.620
 less oily depending on the machine 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.140
 but when dean body hulot 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.420
 water is part of the lean mass 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.830
 so that means that decrease the mass 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.870
 muscular 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.780
 the proportion of fat mass you be 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.150
 probably higher unless you 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.260
 have lost weight compared to water 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.780
 that you lost 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.720
 so it's just from posts too proud on 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.900
 the incidence also one thing but the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.090
 Sauna is not stone of the weight of 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.190
 big it makes you lose weight maybe 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.040
 the bar years and the port of lomÃ© - 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.200
 really built sheet after we go 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.120
 take back that weight so in the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.920
 second capsule I think more than 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.910
 why am I using are a 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.160
 recently 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.710
 what does it do to my body so 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.810
 on stage I will see their existence 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.850
 to see the second capsule simply 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.490
 become a member of a fund for them 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.750
 then it's going to triple w for the 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.970
 frail woman points as slashes 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.800
 subscription you will become a member 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.450
 simply register your email you 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.490
 will receive all emails by 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.010
 in your inbox 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.320
 videos in your inbox 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.940
 that you will have access also via facebook 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.470
 a facebook that emails are not 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.970
 done at the same time because it's not 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.220
 everyone his good at the same time 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.200
 so that's miss videos you 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.350
 want to see before that they skated 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.880
 on facebook enter your emails on 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.020
 what I see in ten seconds for the 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.020
 second capsule at all
