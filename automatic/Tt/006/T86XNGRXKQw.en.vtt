00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.129
 hello how are we send greetings 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:10.290
 from tejiendo mexico let's start 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:13.770
 with this thread the cotton silo 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.719
 and with this we are going to make a hexagon 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.270
 to make the bag of hexagons that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.369
 I already showed them in a previous video and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.880
 we did the little we're going to do 6 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.880
 chains 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.810
 456 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.810
 let's close with a slipped point 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.650
 and we raise with three chains 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.950
 three chains let's make six groups 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.030
 of three beds 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.030
 two beds 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.280
 three massifs I hope you can appreciate 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.120
 very well the three chains that we raise 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.989
 towards this massif 2 3 we are going to separate 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.989
 with 2 chains 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.520
 and we finished 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.520
 the six groups of three each 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.850
 we go very fast 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.270
 two chains of separation between group and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.270
 group 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.460
 can you find us on facebook so that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.460
 see photos and videos too 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.780
 you can subscribe for them to arrive 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.330
 all the videos 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.510
 123 two strings of separation and now yes 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.510
 we did 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.950
 we take 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.280
 this is a massif 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.570
 of two saccades 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.130
 we take out 1 we take out 2 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.130
 two separation chains 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.550
 with hexagons can do what 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.479
 like teabags can chambritas 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.759
 whatever they want 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.759
 a bolerito 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.459
 We are not missing our last group of 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.819
 two strings of separation and ends 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.400
 two 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.100
 two separation chains 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.660
 and we are going to join 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.640
 to the third chain of the first massif 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.110
 we did 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.110
 well it is already united 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.990
 here it is 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.410
 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.500
 let's go hiding with the thread 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.070
 over here and we're going to give up this first 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.070
 space 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.320
 here we are going to raise three chains 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.440
 this already made a massif a slow going 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.070
 2 and 3 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.240
 here in this same space in this same 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:30.480
 we are going to separate with 2 chains and 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.480
 we make another three beds 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.840
 here we are finished, we go to the next 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.420
 small 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.180
 without a chain of separation we are going to 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.980
 say of corridito 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.060
 we make three other chains two chains 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.060
 and three beds 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.400
 we will be uploading many videos of 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.359
 neck warmers scarves 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.359
 they are going to see it 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.770
 here we go to the next hole without 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.770
 separation 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.689
 let's make three massifs 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.250
 two chains 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.250
 three other beds 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.600
 let's do the second group 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.140
 and we go to the other little hole 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.020
 12 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.460
 two separation chains 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.780
 in the next video I tell you how 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:57.050
 we continue this hexagon 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.050
