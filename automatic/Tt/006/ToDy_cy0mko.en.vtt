then the next chord is a B minor 7 I

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.090 
then the next chord is a B minor 7 I
play<00:04:01.850> it<00:04:01.970> like<00:04:02.120> this<00:04:02.330> if<00:04:03.110> you<00:04:03.260> know<00:04:03.740> the<00:04:03.920> barre

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.440 
play it like this if you know the barre
chord<00:04:04.340> better<00:04:04.550> you<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:04.850> play<00:04:05.030> it<00:04:05.120> as<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:05.240> barre

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
chord better you can play it as a barre

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.030 
chord better you can play it as a barre
chord<00:04:05.510> but<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:06.020> think<00:04:06.200> most<00:04:06.350> people<00:04:06.470> find<00:04:06.920> it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
chord but I think most people find it

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.740 
chord but I think most people find it
easier<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.490> play<00:04:07.610> this<00:04:08.090> version<00:04:08.480> which<00:04:08.600> is
