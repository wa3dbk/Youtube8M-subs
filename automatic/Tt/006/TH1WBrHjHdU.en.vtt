00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
Iraq and it would seem to me that

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.310 
Iraq and it would seem to me that
training<00:00:20.939> shadow<00:00:21.210> operators<00:00:21.779> would<00:00:21.930> seem<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
training shadow operators would seem to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.320 
training shadow operators would seem to
be<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.830> first<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.789> foremost<00:00:24.180> responsibility

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
trainer which is the device you see

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.509 
trainer which is the device you see
behind<00:01:02.430> us<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.320> what<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.350> did<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:05.400> were

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
behind us and what we did there were

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520 
behind us and what we did there were
certain<00:01:05.909> functions<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.990> knew<00:01:07.140> needed<00:01:07.470> to

can be trained on this particular device

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.790 
can be trained on this particular device
the<00:04:01.459> system<00:04:01.850> actually<00:04:02.120> has<00:04:02.750> an<00:04:03.319> instructive

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
the system actually has an instructive

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.100 
the system actually has an instructive
structured<00:04:04.730> training<00:04:04.910> station<00:04:05.600> operators

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
structured training station operators

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.270 
structured training station operators
station<00:04:06.830> to<00:04:07.490> crew<00:04:07.910> stations<00:04:08.620> launch<00:04:09.620> recovery

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
station to crew stations launch recovery

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.880 
station to crew stations launch recovery
station<00:04:10.730> as<00:04:10.910> well<00:04:11.360> as<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.660> role<00:04:11.990> player<00:04:12.350> station

so<00:04:13.280> seven<00:04:13.760> soldiers<00:04:14.030> get<00:04:14.360> trained

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
so seven soldiers get trained

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.380 
so seven soldiers get trained

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.570 
action review put that in their training
folder<00:06:14.710> the<00:06:15.710> advantage<00:06:16.099> of<00:06:16.220> having<00:06:16.370> the

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
folder the advantage of having the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.969 
folder the advantage of having the
simulator<00:06:17.150> is<00:06:17.360> that<00:06:17.750> with<00:06:18.620> our<00:06:18.740> real-world

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 
simulator is that with our real-world

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.490 
simulator is that with our real-world
training<00:06:19.430> we<00:06:20.180> might<00:06:20.360> be<00:06:20.479> in<00:06:20.599> the<00:06:20.720> air<00:06:20.840> we<00:06:21.289> might

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
training we might be in the air we might

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.800 
training we might be in the air we might
be<00:06:21.650> flying<00:06:21.979> but<00:06:22.700> we<00:06:22.820> can't<00:06:23.030> generate<00:06:23.419> some<00:06:23.720> of

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
be flying but we can't generate some of

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.089 
be flying but we can't generate some of
the<00:06:23.870> scenarios<00:06:24.050> that<00:06:24.530> we<00:06:24.650> might<00:06:24.830> encounter

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
the scenarios that we might encounter

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.100 
the scenarios that we might encounter
overseas<00:06:25.820> so<00:06:26.450> we<00:06:26.539> have<00:06:26.659> a<00:06:26.690> virtual

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
overseas so we have a virtual

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.600 
overseas so we have a virtual
environment<00:06:27.740> or<00:06:27.979> we<00:06:28.070> can<00:06:28.190> have<00:06:28.340> a<00:06:28.370> vehicle

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
environment or we can have a vehicle

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.000 
environment or we can have a vehicle
going<00:06:29.060> down<00:06:29.240> the<00:06:29.419> street<00:06:29.690> maybe<00:06:30.500> it's<00:06:30.710> stolen

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
going down the street maybe it's stolen

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.060 
going down the street maybe it's stolen
it<00:06:31.370> depends<00:06:31.849> on<00:06:31.909> the<00:06:32.030> scenario<00:06:32.210> basically<00:06:33.080> the

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
it depends on the scenario basically the

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.159 
it depends on the scenario basically the
creativity<00:06:34.550> of<00:06:34.760> your<00:06:34.970> trainer<00:06:35.270> allows<00:06:35.900> you<00:06:36.080> to

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
creativity of your trainer allows you to

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.050 
creativity of your trainer allows you to
determine<00:06:36.289> how<00:06:36.710> realistic<00:06:37.130> the<00:06:37.640> simulated

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
determine how realistic the simulated

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.779 
determine how realistic the simulated
environment<00:06:38.690> is<00:06:38.840> as<00:06:39.250> you<00:06:40.250> can<00:06:40.370> see<00:06:40.550> we<00:06:40.669> have

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
environment is as you can see we have

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.600 
environment is as you can see we have
the<00:06:40.820> vehicle<00:06:41.300> going<00:06:41.539> down<00:06:41.690> the<00:06:41.900> road<00:06:42.080> here<00:06:42.440> I

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
the vehicle going down the road here I

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.430 
the vehicle going down the road here I
also<00:06:43.610> have<00:06:43.880> the<00:06:44.060> ability<00:06:44.120> to<00:06:44.630> control<00:06:45.260> the

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
also have the ability to control the

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.880 
also have the ability to control the
environment<00:06:45.590> in<00:06:46.159> which<00:06:46.340> the<00:06:46.550> vehicle<00:06:46.909> is<00:06:47.060> in

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
environment in which the vehicle is in

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.380 
environment in which the vehicle is in
now<00:06:48.890> right<00:06:49.099> now<00:06:49.310> have<00:06:49.580> an<00:06:49.729> operator<00:06:50.150> that's

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
now right now have an operator that's

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.089 
now right now have an operator that's
tracking<00:06:50.659> this<00:06:50.960> vehicle<00:06:51.409> as<00:06:51.500> it's<00:06:51.680> going<00:06:51.860> down

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
tracking this vehicle as it's going down

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.719 
tracking this vehicle as it's going down
the<00:06:52.280> road<00:06:52.490> I<00:06:52.789> can<00:06:53.720> come<00:06:53.870> over<00:06:53.900> here<00:06:54.200> and<00:06:54.770> as<00:06:55.550> its

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
the road I can come over here and as its

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.210 
the road I can come over here and as its
approaching<00:06:56.030> an<00:06:56.300> intersection<00:06:56.360> I<00:06:57.110> can<00:06:58.099> have

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
approaching an intersection I can have

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.000 
approaching an intersection I can have
artillery<00:06:58.580> fire<00:06:58.940> come<00:06:59.240> in<00:06:59.450> that<00:07:00.320> information

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.010 
artillery fire come in that information

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.010 
artillery fire come in that information
can<00:07:01.039> then<00:07:01.250> be<00:07:01.520> relayed<00:07:01.909> to<00:07:02.599> the<00:07:02.720> mission

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
can then be relayed to the mission

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.390 
can then be relayed to the mission
commander<00:07:03.500> just<00:07:03.800> like<00:07:03.950> it<00:07:04.099> would<00:07:04.220> in<00:07:04.340> a

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
commander just like it would in a

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.090 
commander just like it would in a
battlefield<00:07:04.729> situation
