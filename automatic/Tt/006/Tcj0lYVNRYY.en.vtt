a<00:01:35.810> separate<00:01:37.280> synchronization<00:01:38.280> cable<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.090> may

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
a separate synchronization cable I may

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.800 
a separate synchronization cable I may
be<00:01:40.079> wrong<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.610> far<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.360> this

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
be wrong on this but so far it this

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.380 
be wrong on this but so far it this
cable<00:01:43.320> does<00:01:43.560> not<00:01:43.740> seem<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> charge<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.909> purely

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
cable does not seem to charge it purely

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
cable does not seem to charge it purely
seems<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.170> synchronization<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.250> if

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
seems to be for synchronization so if

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.240 
seems to be for synchronization so if
you<00:01:47.399> want<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> charge<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.210> synchronize<00:01:49.250> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
you want to charge and synchronize you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
you want to charge and synchronize you
