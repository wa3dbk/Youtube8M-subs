plasmids<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:18.230> different<00:00:19.230> weapons<00:00:19.680> how<00:00:19.830> does

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
plasmids on different weapons how does

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
plasmids on different weapons how does
different<00:00:20.400> workings<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.820> branch<00:00:21.300> while

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
different workings of that branch while

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.370 
different workings of that branch while
you're<00:00:21.960> killing<00:00:22.320> them<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.529> different<00:00:22.680> way<00:00:22.980> oh

oh so you take a picture and then
there's<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.120> e<00:01:00.210> counter<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> left<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
there's an e counter on the left and the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
there's an e counter on the left and the
more<00:01:03.090> crazy<00:01:03.359> shit<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.199> higher<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
more crazy shit you do the higher the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
more crazy shit you do the higher the
counter<00:01:04.949> goes<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> faster<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> counter

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
counter goes and the faster the counter

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.780 
counter goes and the faster the counter
goes<00:01:06.540> oh<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.409> not<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.770> camera<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
goes oh so it's not a camera it's a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.710 
goes oh so it's not a camera it's a
video<00:01:09.030> camera<00:01:09.560> yeah<00:01:10.560> oh<00:01:11.299> okay<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:12.600> that's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
video camera yeah oh okay well that's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
video camera yeah oh okay well that's
worth<00:01:12.960> noting<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.100> did<00:01:14.280> not

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
worth noting I think because I did not

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.920 
worth noting I think because I did not
understand<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.110> yeah<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.740> film<00:01:17.070> camera<00:01:17.549> oh

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
understand that yeah it's film camera oh

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.620 
understand that yeah it's film camera oh
when<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> said<00:01:19.170> film<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.680> figured<00:01:20.369> film<00:01:21.299> versus

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
when you said film I figured film versus

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.219 
when you said film I figured film versus
digital<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:22.200> still<00:01:22.770> verse<00:01:23.150> video<00:01:24.150> an<00:01:24.630> SLR

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
digital not still verse video an SLR

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.080 
digital not still verse video an SLR
versus<00:01:25.830> video<00:01:27.829> yeah<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.520> video<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
versus video yeah so it's video it's a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.569 
versus video yeah so it's video it's a
video<00:01:30.180> camera<00:01:30.540> oh<00:01:31.189> that<00:01:32.189> makes<00:01:32.310> more<00:01:32.520> sense

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
video camera oh that makes more sense

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.359 
video camera oh that makes more sense
then<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> combo<00:01:34.530> meter<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.340> you

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
then so it's like a combo meter and you

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
then so it's like a combo meter and you
have<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.880> shit<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.360> moving<00:01:37.170> up

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
have to get that shit like moving up

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.730 
have to get that shit like moving up
yeah<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> way<00:01:39.360> oh

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
yeah can you think of it that way oh

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.420 
yeah can you think of it that way oh
that's<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.009> cool

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that's kind of cool

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.410 
that's kind of cool
yeah<00:01:42.470> you're<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> fucking<00:01:43.590> dumbass<00:01:44.369> why<00:01:45.240> my

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
dumb ass I've employed this and that's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.319 
dumb ass I've employed this and that's
definitely<00:01:47.340> different<00:01:47.490> from<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> last<00:01:48.090> game

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
