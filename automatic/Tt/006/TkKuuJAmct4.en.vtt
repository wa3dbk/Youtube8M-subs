00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.110
 recently ubisoft has been on the penny 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.480
 arcade expo might and magic 10 legacy 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.130
 announced and that means after eleven 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.080
 years await us the first time again 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.119
 a real roleplaying game from the magic 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.770
 franchise after ubisoft so far only 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.130
 strategy and action games 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.960
 has fabricated meant magic 9 is already 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.570
 Eleven years ago and then belonged to the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.160
 series still peace as ubisoft den 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.770
 licenses was bought a year later 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.170
 the universe completely reboot all 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.090
 since then, play under the magic label 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.580
 have appeared so canonically nothing 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.260
 to do with the original series and that 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.000
 will unfortunately also apply to legacy 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.040
 after all, that's the strategy 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.920
 heroes of might magic again with one 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.840
 roleplay linked might magic 10 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.700
 Legacy reminds at first glance 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.960
 legend of green rock the dungeon crawler 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.790
 with retro gameplay 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 thus also might and magic follows one 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.540
 trend and turns to the purist roots 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.369
 back in the 80's but maybe 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.350
 you really only know the series 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.000
 as strategy to admit the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.310
 Beginnings of the mighty magic series lie 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.450
 now quite a bit back and 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.189
 neither were the last games 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.329
 necessarily the best but we would be 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.929
 just have a look in the 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.710
 past 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:20.060
 the series started in 1986 as the first 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 Product of new world computing 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.960
 or his only one 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.909
 staff already fontane hamm if you 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.319
 his mother does not count the 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.909
 Developer had the roleplaying in 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.530
 three-year work for apple two 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.210
 However, it was written because of the 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.429
 great success soon for many 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.840
 ported other systems and that though 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.759
 Nobody at first banish the title 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.030
 I did not want to copy and copy from anybody 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.740
 self sent meant magic box 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.509
 The Inner Sanctum is a role playing game in 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.549
 a fantasy world and with characters 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.319
 in dungeons in dragon steel that's out 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.299
 an ego perspective is played 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.520
 where the player is a group of six 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.259
 self-generated heroes control it 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.179
 allows a free exploration of this world 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.399
 and offers a nonlinear plot 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.560
 battles with monsters run turn based 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.270
 From though magic meant like classic 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.340
 it does contain fantasy 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.740
 strong science fiction component for 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.720
 twist the whole world dare is nothing 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.060
 other than a biosphere on board one 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.880
 spaceship part two games to another 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.740
 World remained in this setting in 1988 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.750
 here is the play figures in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.490
 another biosphere and it became 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.740
 introduced revolutionary features 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.270
 npcs could be hired 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.860
 Heroes aged and could also 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.020
 Aging dying and even dying 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.940
 Time travel was also possible 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.930
 automap function was integrated this 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.360
 But you had to go through the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.800
 craft cartographer he play in 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.720
 it was about sharing the two 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.760
 opponent scolded the resists 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.760
 wanted to plunge biospheres into a sun 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.270
 he asks the cinemas 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.959
 Part 3 continued the series logically and 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.700
 later on a planet on the shield 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.920
 in some biospheres crash 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.290
 had brought these now drifted as the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.480
 eponymous as of tara in ocean 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.590
 Once again it was the villain of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.250
 the destruction of these spheres 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.689
 hold 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.159
 apparently from mankind to 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.790
 Settlement of the universe has been sent 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.859
 were 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.540
 this time with a new hero group 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.549
 and with a new engine similar to the one 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.829
 which also love from classics like off 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.540
 holder learn so dungeon master and 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.700
 The Nordland trilogy was used 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.120
 in chic vga optics with mouse control 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.319
 and sound cards support 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.730
 however, shelton could escape and 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.920
 traveled to another settler 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.359
 biosphere the double world war one 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.099
 flat world on both sides 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.909
 each a fantasy eskes rich 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.920
 hosted 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.329
 he wanted to bring this on tera 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.849
 and it was the hero group him 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.950
 finally stop and destroy 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.569
 for the final of this epic 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.579
 No one had any action line 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.310
 something special came up with a feature 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.530
 which is still revolutionary 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.900
 magic 4 and 5 each played on the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.790
 opposite sides of xin am 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.859
 By the end of 5, the player was able to complete the story 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.629
 finish or he installed both 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.669
 Play on his system so that both 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.799
 pages of xin in a big game 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.359
 merged this also switched new ones 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.609
 questing and a new end to the story 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.109
 free technically differ 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.530
 three four and five hardly 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.530
 from one another 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.750
 after the completion of this series 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.909
 established new world computing with 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.470
 heroes of might magic 1 and 2 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.239
 his series of turn-based 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.060
 Strategy playing in the fantasy setting of the 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.889
 planets centos that these in the same 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.750
 was settled like the universe 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.060
 previous might and magic games became 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.159
 only with might magic 6 heroes 3 really 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.349
 clearly as an indirect consequence of 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.360
 Events from Michael Magic 5 The Alien 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.159
 race of war on android attacks 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.669
 the then also a playable faction in 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:40.320
 heroes 3 put magic six days 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.300
 of heaven is still considered one of the 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.039
 Best games of the series and is often with 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.560
 for the renaissance of genre end of 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.880
 Blamed the 90s here 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.800
 was first on the chessboard 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.020
 dispense with the movement of previous titles 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.660
 The player was free in a 3D 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.430
 move world escapes 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.980
 is still represented by Spreitzer 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.140
 The bouts could be turn based or in 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.580
 real time be set new goods 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.740
 also elaborately before curled 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.540
 Cutscenes in the story has always been 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:16.100
 again referring to the events of the 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:17.930
 first five games taken seven and 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.360
 Eight built on the same technology and 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.890
 the same story principles on old 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.750
 plot threads from that time already as 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.280
 Classics apply to the precursors 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.960
 spun and with the events 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.940
 out of heroes 3 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.830
 the stronger the technology of this new 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.900
 trilogy obsolete over the years 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.860
 the worse, however , was magic 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.860
 also the audience to 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.710
 a new engine should solve this problem 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.900
 to solve 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.870
 this is how might magic 9 presented itself 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.650
 year 2002 thanks to listec 1.5 for the first time in 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.380
 real 3d 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.419
 nevertheless this title also fell through the 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.949
 problem in addition four if ross 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.270
 destroyed and its inhabitants in 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.400
 fled a new world 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.900
 after the multiple setting move, there was 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.970
 in might and magic new almost none 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.800
 references more to the predecessor of the 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.240
 The fans did not like the 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.010
 everyone shares to eight because of her 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.810
 had praised rich background 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.460
 That may also have been because that 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.229
 johnny fontane hermann this title 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.690
 no longer involved as a designer 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.160
 In addition, publisher frido demanded that 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.990
 to throw unfinished game on the market 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.850
 and the team was still with the 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.710
 work on the mediocre legends of 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.410
 might magic employs a team 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.720
 shooter in fantasy turned frido went 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.150
 2003 bankruptcy and disney world computing 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.830
 is working with johnson carragher 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:36.020
 today at ea the new magic will be with the 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.669
 old parts have nothing to do with it 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.020
 on heroes of might and magic so the 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.729
 last two share from ubisoft 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.199
 that means everything that I am 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.030
 tell you now will join you 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.680
 the game does not help but if 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.970
 one argued so one could also all 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.950
 humanities subjects 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:52.360
 and nobody wants that in the 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.360
 Remember bye and see you next time
