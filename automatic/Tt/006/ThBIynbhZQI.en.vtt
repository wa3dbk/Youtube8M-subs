00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.630
 welcome as well as roughly itv 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.070
 Kanal we already have some 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.720
 time my video brought the country more 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.220
 in own thing and that we wanted 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.230
 to demonstrate on which league 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.950
 if you meanwhile our videos 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.900
 able to see 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.270
 and of course it also includes roger 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.270
 waters a very interesting video 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.670
 themes platform where you have videos 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.590
 can see on for example technisat 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.660
 sat receivern and a few others 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.330
 models as well as that and that is 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.800
 the latest also on a television and 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.140
 not some but on 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.190
 many samsung televisions and then 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.660
 we think about it very quickly 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.829
 video to demonstrate how easy 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.300
 because now watchmi on the existing 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.660
 collections of televisions are installed 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.360
 can 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.140
 First, it is on all televisions the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.369
 d series of it serie and also the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.440
 f series 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.390
 what do you have to do when you get this 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.800
 connected to your network what 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.360
 yes in most models then over 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.280
 A network cable definitely goes 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.350
 or alternatively via this wlan so 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.290
 then open the radio connection 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.550
 Just have a look at this smart hub function 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.470
 if you have this smart hub function now 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.899
 then they will open there 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.520
 now up to date with the new model of the 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.530
 f-series up here then for example 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.990
 the possibility of seeing this here now 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.970
 their so-called tv apps so their tv 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.470
 application can look at 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.090
 Part of this application will be yes 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.250
 already at the first commissioning directly 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.200
 installed but there is also one 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.789
 so-called app store how to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.860
 New German says so I say one 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.819
 side where to get more programs 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.170
 can look at 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.569
 and that is, for example 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.360
 at the f series here if they are now 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.530
 have a device from the d or it serie 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.479
 then have a look where you have the word 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.069
 Find samsung apps if you like that now 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.020
 want to open here to demonstrate 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.300
 or to see what is there there 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.860
 still for more programs then takes 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.840
 the few seconds and then you watch 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.700
 once a survey sorted by a lot 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.709
 popular or even after various 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.660
 categories such as video 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.160
 plays sports lifestyle and so on 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.020
 but we do not need them for long 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.310
 looking because the colleagues of watchmi 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.900
 even have one right up here 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.790
 Direct advertising banner switched 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.440
 so to point out that watchmi 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.120
 Finally, about the samsung 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.650
 television would be available 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.420
 So let's just go up now 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.610
 this logo click on it 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.840
 Immediately the logo is loaded short 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.220
 described what is here for 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.599
 at all and then they need it 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.860
 do not read long but just easy 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.900
 press download 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.090
 These programs are always relative 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.420
 little memory is required too 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.800
 again 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.290
 very fast and once it installs 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.780
 they can actually already 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.390
 directly start the program we say 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.590
 now execute in the case 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.989
 yes and so we are in the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.880
 watchmi surface watchmi themed channels 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.560
 they should actually be there for a short time 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.660
 So say that you have this function 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.590
 want to use and can and now 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.330
 it's already happening that 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.850
 for example, at number one at the time 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.620
 the topic of channel kicker is where she is 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.120
 So watch the latest videos 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.130
 You can talk about soccer 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720
 if we are looking for grobi of course 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.880
 would be easy for following one 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.590
 the button will enter and yours will now 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.530
 here you see the following namely 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.660
 the so-called overview and at the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.580
 Survey now you can see more here 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.530
 themed channels at the moment there are altogether 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.310
 50 themed channels called here 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.080
 can be 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.760
 fair enough , we want channels again 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.040
 show if the weather ds or from the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.380
 picture newspaper the politics video channels 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.290
 or just educator has already 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.090
 pit tv or room or mirror tv 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.220
 Stiftung Warentest has videos in it 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.450
 Etc 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.890
 of course, the example of our channel 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.180
 it looks like we will 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.890
 Now call the groupie channel here 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.750
 and we already see a right one 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.220
 selection of videos and we can 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.510
 Of course, we always promise 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.140

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.269
 Upload 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.370
 there are always 30 videos in total 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.329
 picking her up there directly 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.010
 can be 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.359
 there is a short description of the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.739
 videos we could just go now 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.540

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.049
 and weeks and below each one 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.670
 description if you have such a video 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.519
 then we would like to call 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.840
 they make them go on the 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.130
 that's what he is now 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.739
 in that case her picture is now 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.690
 framed blue here I say okay and 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.700
 we have been here for some time now 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.470
 minutes the latest VIDEO from it 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.660
 that is because we were on the isc 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.050
 in amsterdam a very interesting 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.979
 trade fair if you look for the topic of media 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.500
 so interested in media form of 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.510
 televisions from corresponding multi room 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.370
 systems of large screen projectors and such 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.020
 continue and therefore have the big boys 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.310
 as you say so well about the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.110
 shoulder looked what the there because 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.220
 have everything on offer as I have it 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.710
 Now I want to see what I have to do 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.210
 i just press the button okay and 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.710
 already all the fun is going on 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.520
 few seconds later then that will be immediately 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.780
 loaded 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.720
 I also see one again below 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.919
 short description of the video and yes there 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.330
 you can actually in perfect 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.490
 quality on his favorite TV 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.000
 our content in hd quality even 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.229
 see if you need it 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.120
 certainly very unlikely 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.949
 would like to rewind you need it 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.120
 just press the ok button 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.919
 so they will see below, the 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.030
 corresponding foreplay functions you 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.280
 see there again the possibility 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.139
 to call further details 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.340
 to the video we can also say okay 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.650
 we'll go to the next one 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.900
 so it is very very intuitive and very 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.240
 easily made of the operation 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.379
 and what they can do, of course 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.159
 That's what we want to do for a moment 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:24.469
 look at 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.419
 You can also decide that me 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:28.460
 this channel so here our groupie 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.590
 channel is currently in the works 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.180
 seven is to place two upwardly 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.280
 would like to push because of the use of 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.810
 seems somehow against advertising etc 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.520
 apparently to be sold because there 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.900
 We could not get there at the moment 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.580
 but what about 2nd place give us 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.530
 also like to express satisfaction so here 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.810
 the button again okay and have already 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.190
 We positioned the page 2 and 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.500
 So we can do it right now 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.500
 get started and then continue our canal 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.210
 look to the end so we find great 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.039
 history how to be ours 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.539
 groupie channel even more comfortable home 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.759
 can get and even on right 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.960
 I would have said big once 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.159
 because that almost reminds me of the 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.669
 canvas because I have to synonymous short 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.379
 to explain 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:07.129
 So what we see here is the new one 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:09.500
 samsung 65 inch tv and indeed the f 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.180
 90 90 this is one of the absolute top 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.219
 samsung's device has this one 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.930
 so called ultra hd resolution so the 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.080
 four times higher resolution than that 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.339
 normal full hd and this device is included 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.139
 us, of course, in the exhibition 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.300
 we like to show and even more 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.610
 rather watchmi is finally too 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.740
 available there and will be here then 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.159
 accordingly also demonstrated naturally 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.659
 become 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.039
 If so, then just ask yourself 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:32.750
 it's great to help 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.699
 Employee will be his until next 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.000
