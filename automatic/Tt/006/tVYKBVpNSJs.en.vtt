00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
I work at comic relief I think he's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.030 
I work at comic relief I think he's
feeling<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.930> nervous<00:00:34.140> about<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.800> one

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
feeling really nervous about this one

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.560 
feeling really nervous about this one
then<00:00:35.370> obviously<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.850> channel<00:00:36.180> said<00:00:36.360> he'd

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
then obviously the channel said he'd

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.510 
then obviously the channel said he'd
never<00:00:36.690> done<00:00:36.930> anything<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.440> before<00:00:37.649> but
