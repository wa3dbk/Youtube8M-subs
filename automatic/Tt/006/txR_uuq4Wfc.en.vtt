some X flies most people would think

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.250 
some X flies most people would think
this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.100> shoulders<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.110> let

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
this is shoulders and it is if we let

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.859 
this is shoulders and it is if we let
the<00:01:10.380> shoulders<00:01:10.790> work<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.689> I'm

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the shoulders work but on this one I'm

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.469 
the shoulders work but on this one I'm
really<00:01:13.350> focusing<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.040> squeezing<00:01:14.880> my<00:01:15.180> back

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
really focusing on squeezing my back

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.280 
really focusing on squeezing my back
together<00:01:16.070> I'm<00:01:17.070> sure<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.430> chest<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.970> kept

together I'm sure my chest is kept

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.109 
together I'm sure my chest is kept
elevated<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.490> therefore<00:01:20.490> I'm<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.580> hunching

from there aiming for about twelve

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.880 
from there aiming for about twelve
repetitions<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:39.119> each<00:01:39.179> one<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.799> this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
repetitions on each one and for this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.980 
repetitions on each one and for this
particular<00:01:41.130> work<00:01:41.609> out<00:01:41.819> I'm<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.719> to<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.869> it

particular work out I'm going to do it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.249 
particular work out I'm going to do it
in<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.319> circuit<00:01:43.920> moving<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:44.579> one<00:01:44.759> exercise

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
straight on to the next so from there

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.529 
straight on to the next so from there
we're<00:01:49.709> going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> go<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.280> into<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.909> row<00:01:51.179> I'm

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.780

pumped<00:02:22.120> full<00:02:22.210> of<00:02:22.330> blood<00:02:23.460> as<00:02:24.460> this<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.510> very

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
pumped full of blood as this is a very

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.330 
pumped full of blood as this is a very
isolated<00:02:27.160> movement<00:02:27.930> therefore<00:02:29.250> we're<00:02:30.250> not

broom handle we can do this one at home
in<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.900> gym<00:02:41.140> basically<00:02:41.890> anywhere<00:02:42.250> we<00:02:43.150> don't

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
in the gym basically anywhere we don't

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.520 
in the gym basically anywhere we don't
need<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.540> much<00:02:43.720> weight<00:02:43.960> it's<00:02:44.200> more<00:02:44.380> the

need that much weight it's more the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.400 
need that much weight it's more the
movement<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.370> really<00:02:45.520> works<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.030> muscle

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
movement that really works the muscle

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.310 
movement that really works the muscle

where's the bug light up of our hair
pause

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.750 

breathe<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.569> on<00:03:06.689> the<00:03:06.750> way<00:03:06.870> back<00:03:06.989> down<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.760> we

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
breathe in on the way back down so we

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.110 
breathe in on the way back down so we
exhale<00:03:09.890> keep<00:03:10.890> your<00:03:11.010> arms<00:03:11.159> up<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.790> start<00:03:12.000> to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
exhale keep your arms up it start to

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.699 
exhale keep your arms up it start to
shake<00:03:12.390> as<00:03:12.599> we<00:03:12.720> start<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:12.989> wear<00:03:13.110> out<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.349> muscle

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
shake as we start to wear out the muscle

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:27.559 
shake as we start to wear out the muscle
energy<00:03:13.920> within<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.739> then<00:03:25.819> now<00:03:26.819> that<00:03:26.849> one<00:03:27.209> may

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
energy within and then now that one may

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.240 
energy within and then now that one may
not<00:03:27.599> seem<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.290> difficult<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:29.099> it's

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
not seem that difficult but it's

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.039 
not seem that difficult but it's
actually<00:03:29.609> one<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.849> hardest<00:03:30.299> exercises
