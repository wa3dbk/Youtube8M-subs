00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.740
 hello with you polina kuznetsova 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:10.900
 today we will make out a haute couture skirt 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.900
 which you can do with your own hands 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:18.020
 I am often asked how to sew 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.020
 multi layered skirt look 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.560
 the pictures look like this is wonderful 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.890
 skirt 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.230
 it can be worn in the summer with a shirt 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.560
 every day with a jacket and any 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.560
 party 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:38.090
 these skirts are made of fine mesh upper 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.800
 two three layers are made solid and the bottom 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.399
 layers can be with two or three 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.699
 ruffles mesh on petticoats is taken 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.000
 tougher but if this is not you 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.420
 make several layers from the main 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.420
 the grid 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.010
 look at the layout of this skirt 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.910
 look here three suns 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.570
 and they all make up one layer of ours 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.410
 skirts 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.960
 if you want to make or fabric you do not 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.860
 so much can of the two suns 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.130
 one layer to make if the waist is not needed 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.520
 assembly then the calculated radius of steel on the skirt 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 sun divide by 3 this by the amount 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:31.090
 suns if you made two suns 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.850
 accordingly divide this scheme in two 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.440
 made for a long skirt where in the middle 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.190
 edge passes 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.190
 or cut 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.730
 if the skirt is short and its diameter 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.520
 fits in one width 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.090
 then the cut lines will be only in one 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.400
 place 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.360
 so that you can connect all three 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.360
 the sun 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.090
 Consider the order of assembly and tailoring skirts 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.210
 prepare petticoats each by 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.980
 seperately this means sew the cuts 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.830
 sew a frill 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:15.730
 and all the stocked petticoats 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.610
 fold between the level and type of waist 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.130
 pin off evens 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.900
 sweep and sew two machines 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.780
 Line up the top of each skirt 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.410
 separately here, too, just flash 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.480
 cuts gather upper and lower skirts 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.240
 battles 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.310
 equating the slice for the clasp but to 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.160
 make a beautifully uniform build 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.050
 pave 2 machine lines one on 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.310
 1 centimeter away 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.110
 second by 0 2 centimeters from 1 to the side 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.300
 slice 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.420
 to build build pull 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.110
 simultaneously for the lower 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.110
 shuttle threads 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.580
 after the lower and upper yuki 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.680
 collected and harvested for the year and collected 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.830
 sweat 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.850
 do belt belt harvesting and his 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.660
 attaching 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.690
 I have shown a free course but 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.610
 lightning for these skirts do not because 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.260
 what 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.570
 the layering of this skirt does not allow 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:31.750
 make lightning beautiful it will overlap 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:36.490
 the seam will overlap where the belt is being stacked 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:40.180
 there will be nothing visible belt for such 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.810
 skirt is made of satin waist can 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.410
 process 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.510
 not only a belt but also a strip from 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.720
 satin and in this strip develops or 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.380
 gum or ent but the length of this 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:01.390
 stripes taken equal to the amount of hips plus 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.610
 4 and you can take any width 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.130
 even the picture shows that from this 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.330
 stripes you can create a belt which also 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.700
 will be going to gum can be narrow 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.570
 striped do just to 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.489
 fit you there tape or rezinochka 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:24.360
 The conclusion on the pictures shows what to decorate 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:27.820
 can such a strip or belt bow and 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.760
 still such a little secret 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.660
 on these strips if you go out 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.950
 do not forget ribbons 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.380
 process the loop to exit and still lower 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.160
 never cut skirts 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.160
 being processed 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.870
 averaged tissue calculation 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.490
 it's very difficult to do because I don't 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.880
 I know from what layers you will have a skirt 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.910
 how much sun will be in one layer 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.280
 so all questions on the calculation 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.490
 Constructing cutting and sewing conic 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.280
 skirts including skirts the sun you 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.950
