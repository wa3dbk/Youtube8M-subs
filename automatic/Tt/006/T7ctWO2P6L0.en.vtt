00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
in the other hands on the left side we

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.939 
in the other hands on the left side we
have<00:00:26.369> also<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.000> new<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.840> magic<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.650> is

have also the new one the magic that is
a<00:00:28.980> completely<00:00:29.550> touch<00:00:30.000> there<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.510> no<00:00:30.810> physical

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
a completely touch there is no physical

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.590 
a completely touch there is no physical
keyboard<00:00:31.679> let's<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> main<00:00:33.180> difference

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
keyboard let's see the main difference

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.260 
keyboard let's see the main difference
between<00:00:33.870> them<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.739> both<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.280> Quadra<00:00:36.059> band

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
between them they are both a Quadra band

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.709 
between them they are both a Quadra band
gsm<00:00:36.600> GPRS<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:38.070> edge<00:00:38.219> connection<00:00:38.730> they<00:00:39.540> are

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
gsm GPRS and edge connection they are

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.639 
gsm GPRS and edge connection they are
also<00:00:39.980> HSPA<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.329> no<00:00:42.329> problem<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> 3g

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
also HSPA so no problem with the 3g

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.340 
also HSPA so no problem with the 3g
connection<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> dimension<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.020> they<00:00:46.170> are

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
connection but the dimension as they are

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.119 
connection but the dimension as they are
bit<00:00:46.680> different<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:47.969> them<00:00:48.469> dream<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.770> is

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:01.369 

117<00:00:54.230> 55.7<00:00:55.230> /<00:00:55.910> 15.1<00:00:56.910> millimeter<00:00:58.219> against<00:01:00.379> 170

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
117 55.7 / 15.1 millimeter against 170

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.539 
117 55.7 / 15.1 millimeter against 170
point<00:01:01.620> 7<00:01:02.070> /<00:01:02.280> 50<00:01:02.730> /<00:01:03.320> 13.7<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.369> bit

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
point 7 / 50 / 13.7 so it's a bit

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.090 
point 7 / 50 / 13.7 so it's a bit
smaller<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:07.080> don't<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> qwerty

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
smaller as you don't have the qwerty

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.600 
smaller as you don't have the qwerty
keyboard<00:01:08.610> inside<00:01:09.150> both<00:01:09.960> i<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.470> 3.2<00:01:11.310> inch

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
keyboard inside both i have a 3.2 inch

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.050 
keyboard inside both i have a 3.2 inch
screen<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:14.130> huge<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
screen so on really huge in the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.109 
screen so on really huge in the
dimension<00:01:16.009> resolution<00:01:17.060> 320<00:01:18.060> /<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.470> 480<00:01:19.470> so

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
dimension resolution 320 / of 480 so

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.539 
dimension resolution 320 / of 480 so
classical<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:24.229> 65,000<00:01:25.229> colors<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.009> both

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
classical one 65,000 colors and both

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.700 
classical one 65,000 colors and both
have<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> accelerometer<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.500> rotate

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
have the accelerometer so you can rotate

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.080 
have the accelerometer so you can rotate
them<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.259> on<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.280> back<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.940 
have a 3 megapixel camera no LED flash
unfortunately<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.329> focus

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
unfortunately and then just out of focus

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.980 
unfortunately and then just out of focus

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
can see here you have the keyboard that

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.440 
can see here you have the keyboard that
is<00:02:03.869> completely<00:02:04.439> virtual<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:06.060> working

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
is completely virtual it's working

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.540 
is completely virtual it's working
pretty<00:02:06.689> good<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.590> had<00:02:07.740> some<00:02:08.009> problems

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
pretty good we just had some problems

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.350 
pretty good we just had some problems
with<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.259> words<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.770> recognition<00:02:11.730> let's<00:02:12.030> say

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
with the words of recognition let's say

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.420 
with the words of recognition let's say
they<00:02:12.599> are

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.730 

so<00:02:20.430> see<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.960> have<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.230> get<00:02:22.410> used

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
so see there is you have to get used

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.050 
so see there is you have to get used
because<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.940> non<00:02:24.360> physical<00:02:24.710> keyboard<00:02:25.710> has

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
because the non physical keyboard has

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.220 
because the non physical keyboard has
really<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:28.070> bit<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.370> Education<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.270> use<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.690> in

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
really a bit of Education to use it in

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.190 
really a bit of Education to use it in
the<00:02:31.440> best<00:02:31.650> way<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:34.140> memory<00:02:34.530> on<00:02:34.650> board<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:36.200> 192

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the best way the memory on board is 192

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.640 
the best way the memory on board is 192
megabyte<00:02:37.710> of<00:02:37.740> ram<00:02:38.190> 512<00:02:39.150> megabyte<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.960> Rome<00:02:40.350> so

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
megabyte of ram 512 megabyte of Rome so

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.450 
megabyte of ram 512 megabyte of Rome so
you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.520> really<00:02:41.940> use<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:43.230> form<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.980> save
