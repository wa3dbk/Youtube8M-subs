00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
about a third actually I think that's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.140 
about a third actually I think that's
less<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.860> says<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.280> does<00:01:08.430> quite<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> large

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
less it says it does quite a large

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.050 
less it says it does quite a large
surface<00:01:09.540> area<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.280> possible<00:01:11.340> I'd

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
surface area so if at all possible I'd

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.580 
surface area so if at all possible I'd
like<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.630> make<00:01:12.869> sure<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.409> not

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
bubbles that I was worried about

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.330 
bubbles that I was worried about
everything<00:05:31.720> is<00:05:31.870> actually<00:05:32.290> tried<00:05:32.560> really<00:05:33.130> well

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
everything is actually tried really well

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.000

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.550 
is a nice flat black do have one concern
but<00:05:39.610> I've<00:05:39.790> decided<00:05:40.180> I'm<00:05:40.570> not<00:05:40.840> going<00:05:41.230> to<00:05:41.380> try

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
but I've decided I'm not going to try

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.330 
but I've decided I'm not going to try
and<00:05:41.710> fix<00:05:41.950> it<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.580> you'll<00:05:43.210> see<00:05:43.480> that<00:05:43.510> is<00:05:43.900> this

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
and fix it and you'll see that is this

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.140 
and fix it and you'll see that is this
middle<00:05:45.340> section<00:05:45.730> right<00:05:46.300> here<00:05:47.610> or<00:05:48.610> obviously<00:05:49.030> I

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
middle section right here or obviously I

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.490 
middle section right here or obviously I
went<00:05:49.450> over<00:05:49.720> everything<00:05:49.930> else

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
went over everything else

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.260 
went over everything else
more<00:05:51.250> times<00:05:51.550> than<00:05:51.850> that<00:05:53.100> I'm<00:05:54.100> worried<00:05:54.940> that<00:05:54.970> if

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
more times than that I'm worried that if

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.530 
more times than that I'm worried that if
I<00:05:55.450> do<00:05:55.510> go<00:05:55.960> over<00:05:55.990> it<00:05:56.350> again<00:05:56.669> that<00:05:57.669> it<00:05:57.820> will<00:05:58.000> be

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
I do go over it again that it will be

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.030 
I do go over it again that it will be
even<00:05:58.750> darker<00:05:59.080> I'll<00:05:59.470> have<00:05:59.620> to<00:05:59.740> wait<00:05:59.830> another

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
even darker I'll have to wait another

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.030 
even darker I'll have to wait another
eight<00:06:00.400> hours<00:06:00.760> and<00:06:01.300> I<00:06:01.690> think<00:06:01.930> when<00:06:02.110> I<00:06:02.140> sponge<00:06:02.800> on

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
eight hours and I think when I sponge on

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.760 
eight hours and I think when I sponge on
the<00:06:03.160> mineral<00:06:03.340> paint<00:06:03.760> that<00:06:04.660> that<00:06:05.440> will<00:06:05.620> be

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
the mineral paint that that will be

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:13.950 
the mineral paint that that will be
covered<00:06:06.100> up<00:06:06.250> in<00:06:06.490> no<00:06:06.820> real<00:06:07.180> problem<00:06:07.720> so<00:06:12.960> there

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
covered up in no real problem so there
