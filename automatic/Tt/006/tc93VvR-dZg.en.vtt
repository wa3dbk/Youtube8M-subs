00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:56.239 
other animals you could kind of judge

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:57.969 
other animals you could kind of judge
when<00:01:56.450> they're<00:01:56.599> ready<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:56.989> yeah<00:01:57.110> we<00:01:57.500> think

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
when they're ready but yeah we think

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.070 
when they're ready but yeah we think
that<00:01:58.399> it's<00:01:59.119> part<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.420> nature<00:01:59.509> it's<00:01:59.929> an

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
that it's part of nature it's an

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.600 
that it's part of nature it's an
essential<00:02:00.319> part<00:02:00.679> of<00:02:00.770> nature<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.489> know

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
essential part of nature and you know

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.339 
essential part of nature and you know
just<00:02:01.940> kind<00:02:02.209> of<00:02:02.300> understanding<00:02:02.929> that's<00:02:03.110> really

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
just kind of understanding that's really

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.440 
just kind of understanding that's really
important<00:02:03.739> so<00:02:03.920> we<00:02:04.369> don't<00:02:04.580> hide<00:02:04.849> that<00:02:05.149> at<00:02:05.300> all

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
important so we don't hide that at all

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.690 
important so we don't hide that at all
as<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.989> with<00:02:06.200> most<00:02:06.530> things<00:02:06.830> in<00:02:07.009> parenting<00:02:07.489> it

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
as it with most things in parenting it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.570 
as it with most things in parenting it
depends<00:02:08.360> on<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:09.050> individual<00:02:09.679> kid<00:02:10.009> I<00:02:10.280> think

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
depends on the individual kid I think

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.030 
depends on the individual kid I think
largely<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.540> but<00:02:11.989> it's<00:02:12.140> true<00:02:12.410> like<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.739> know

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
largely but but it's true like you know

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.640 
largely but but it's true like you know
it's<00:02:13.520> it's<00:02:13.790> also<00:02:14.000> how<00:02:14.360> its<00:02:14.569> presented<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.379> and
