moding<00:01:54.670> also<00:01:55.670> another<00:01:56.030> finger<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.630> mention<00:01:57.020> is

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
moding also another finger to mention is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.800 
moding also another finger to mention is
uh<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:59.950> think<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.369> when<00:02:01.820> more<00:02:02.060> particles<00:02:02.420> hit

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
uh I think you when more particles hit

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.529 
uh I think you when more particles hit
it<00:02:03.020> it'll<00:02:03.380> do<00:02:03.530> more<00:02:03.740> damage<00:02:03.979> but<00:02:04.850> sometimes<00:02:05.360> if

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
it it'll do more damage but sometimes if

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.370 
it it'll do more damage but sometimes if
