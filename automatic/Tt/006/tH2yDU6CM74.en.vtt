edit<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.220> pages<00:03:35.699> so<00:03:36.329> but<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.620> bit<00:03:37.799> tricky

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
edit the pages so but it's a bit tricky

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.129 
edit the pages so but it's a bit tricky
editing<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.209> pages<00:03:39.540> because<00:03:39.660> there's<00:03:39.989> no

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
editing the pages because there's no

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.009 
editing the pages because there's no
line<00:03:40.590> spacing<00:03:41.310> know<00:03:41.940> like<00:03:42.239> paragraphing<00:03:42.840> and

line spacing know like paragraphing and

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.080 
line spacing know like paragraphing and
it<00:03:43.680> hasn't<00:03:43.949> got<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> character<00:03:44.699> limit<00:03:44.849> so<00:03:45.060> you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
it hasn't got a character limit so you

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.819 
it hasn't got a character limit so you
can<00:03:45.180> just<00:03:45.389> go<00:03:45.540> on<00:03:45.660> forever<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.139> ever<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.530> ever

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
can just go on forever and ever and ever

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.680 
can just go on forever and ever and ever
