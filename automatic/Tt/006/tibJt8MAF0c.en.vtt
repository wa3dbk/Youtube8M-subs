00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it kind of depends on on how things are

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740 
it kind of depends on on how things are
working<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.790> today<00:01:32.939> how<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.600> your

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
working for you today how you have your

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.230 
working for you today how you have your
bike<00:01:33.930> setup<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.680> things<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
bike setup and things like that but you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.730 
bike setup and things like that but you
know<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.659> bury<00:01:36.840> end<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.290> corner<00:01:37.650> as

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
know I like to bury end of the corner as

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.710 
know I like to bury end of the corner as
hard<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.189> get<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.820> leaned<00:01:39.090> over<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
hard as I can get it leaned over it and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.690 
hard as I can get it leaned over it and
get<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.140> gas<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> get<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.280> sideways

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
get on the gas and and get it sideways

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.760 
get on the gas and and get it sideways
but<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.119> too<00:01:42.299> sideways<00:01:42.570> which<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.409> really

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
but not too sideways which is really

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980 
but not too sideways which is really
tricky<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:44.610> Lima<00:01:44.850> because<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.570> generally

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
tricky here at Lima because it generally

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.749 
tricky here at Lima because it generally
gets<00:01:46.140> some<00:01:46.350> little<00:01:46.590> ruts<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.009> stuff<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> your

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
gets some little ruts and stuff and your

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.370 
gets some little ruts and stuff and your
back<00:01:47.970> wheel<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:48.600> hung<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.020> rut<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
back wheel can get hung in a rut and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.310 
back wheel can get hung in a rut and
really<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.280> hang<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:52.110> go

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
really just hang out there and not go

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
really just hang out there and not go
anywhere<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.850> fine<00:01:54.090> line<00:01:54.119> between

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
anywhere so it's a fine line between

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
anywhere so it's a fine line between
keeping<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.229> sideways<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.040> keeping<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.399> going

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
keeping it sideways and keeping it going

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.539 
keeping it sideways and keeping it going
forward<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:58.710> sooner<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
forward the sooner you get on at the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.280 
forward the sooner you get on at the
better<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.630> sooner<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.049> get<00:02:01.170> your

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
better and the sooner you can get your

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
better and the sooner you can get your
foot<00:02:01.469> up<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> pegs<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.299> sit<00:02:03.540> on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
have a good setup and just let the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.389 
have a good setup and just let the
hardly<00:02:07.079> take<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> corner<00:02:08.250> and

hardly take you out of the corner and
just<00:02:09.090> kind<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:10.020> count<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.770> keep

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
just kind of just count on it to keep

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
the exit the corners is good place to

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.160 
the exit the corners is good place to
come<00:02:21.579> off<00:02:21.819> towards<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.239> bottom<00:02:22.420> there's<00:02:23.019> not

a<00:02:23.200> ton<00:02:23.439> we<00:02:23.620> do<00:02:23.739> different<00:02:24.099> with<00:02:24.219> the<00:02:24.340> bikes

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
a ton we do different with the bikes

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.949 
a ton we do different with the bikes
here<00:02:24.760> for<00:02:24.939> the<00:02:25.030> cushion<00:02:25.329> I<00:02:25.420> mean<00:02:25.540> obviously

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
here for the cushion I mean obviously

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.629 
here for the cushion I mean obviously
you<00:02:26.109> want<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.319> really<00:02:26.469> good<00:02:26.709> fresh<00:02:27.040> tire<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:27.609> it

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
you want a really good fresh tire on it

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.580 
you want a really good fresh tire on it
so<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.269> pretty<00:02:28.480> much<00:02:28.599> have<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.930> brand<00:02:29.260> new<00:02:29.379> tie

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
so I pretty much have a brand new tie

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.339 
so I pretty much have a brand new tie
every<00:02:29.889> time<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.069> hit<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> track<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:32.230> that

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
every time I hit the track and and that

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.229 
every time I hit the track and and that
scuffs<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.859> in<00:02:32.980> nicely<00:02:33.189> for<00:02:33.579> Hagerstown<00:02:33.760> which

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
scuffs it in nicely for Hagerstown which

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.420 
scuffs it in nicely for Hagerstown which
is<00:02:34.389> always<00:02:34.629> next<00:02:34.810> weekend<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:36.129> that<00:02:36.280> works

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
is always next weekend so so that works

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.240 
is always next weekend so so that works
out<00:02:36.609> well<00:02:36.670> for<00:02:37.030> us<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.450> then<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.680> know<00:02:38.799> it's

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
out well for us and then you know it's

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.159 
out well for us and then you know it's
kind<00:02:39.579> of<00:02:39.609> like<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.000> still<00:02:40.569> would<00:02:40.750> run<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.989> same

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.169 
kind of like I still would run the same

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:42.659 
kind of like I still would run the same
back<00:02:41.349> I'd<00:02:41.530> run<00:02:41.709> on<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:41.889> mile<00:02:42.069> because<00:02:42.280> this

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:42.669 
back I'd run on the mile because this

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.690 
back I'd run on the mile because this
track<00:02:42.879> is<00:02:43.030> quite<00:02:43.540> big<00:02:43.749> and<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:45.310> cushion

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
track is quite big and and the cushion

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.789 
track is quite big and and the cushion
sucks<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.180> horsepower<00:02:46.569> out<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.139> really<00:02:47.319> it

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
sucks the horsepower out of it really it

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.170 
sucks the horsepower out of it really it
can<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.129> cushion<00:02:48.430> can<00:02:48.519> really<00:02:48.730> slow<00:02:48.909> you<00:02:48.969> down

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
can the cushion can really slow you down

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.209 
can the cushion can really slow you down
trying<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.599> plow<00:02:49.780> through<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.079> so<00:02:50.409> I<00:02:50.680> run<00:02:51.099> the

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:51.219 
trying to plow through that so I run the

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.770 
trying to plow through that so I run the
fastest<00:02:51.609> bike<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.909> have<00:02:52.090> out<00:02:52.419> here<00:02:52.629> you're

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
fastest bike I have out here you're

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.860 
fastest bike I have out here you're
always<00:02:53.109> and<00:02:53.409> and<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.969> setups<00:02:55.299> pretty<00:02:55.540> similar

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
always and and the setups pretty similar

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.539 
always and and the setups pretty similar
maybe<00:02:56.109> a<00:02:56.230> little<00:02:56.500> less<00:02:56.739> swing<00:02:57.040> arm<00:02:57.219> angle

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
maybe a little less swing arm angle

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.209 
maybe a little less swing arm angle
because<00:02:57.819> these<00:02:58.030> ruts<00:02:58.469> are<00:02:59.469> really<00:02:59.769> really

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:00.219 
because these ruts are really really

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.189 
because these ruts are really really
tricky<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.669> challenging<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.780> felt<00:03:02.049> like

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:02.199 
tricky and challenging and I felt like

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.170 
tricky and challenging and I felt like
with<00:03:02.680> with<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.189> extra<00:03:03.549> swing<00:03:03.760> swing<00:03:04.000> arm

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
with with the extra swing swing arm

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.939 
with with the extra swing swing arm
angle<00:03:04.449> I<00:03:04.540> normally<00:03:04.930> run<00:03:05.169> on<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.469> clay<00:03:05.650> tracks

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:05.949 
angle I normally run on the clay tracks

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.920 
angle I normally run on the clay tracks
it<00:03:06.159> it<00:03:06.609> makes<00:03:06.849> it<00:03:06.969> a<00:03:07.000> little<00:03:07.269> harder<00:03:07.629> to<00:03:07.659> ride

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
it it makes it a little harder to ride

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.229 
it it makes it a little harder to ride
out<00:03:08.169> here<00:03:08.199> so<00:03:08.829> so<00:03:09.639> I've<00:03:09.760> been<00:03:09.879> running<00:03:10.180> a

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
out here so so I've been running a

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.659 
out here so so I've been running a
little<00:03:10.449> less<00:03:10.599> angle<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.379> you<00:03:11.560> know<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.980> run<00:03:12.639> a

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
little less angle and you know I run a

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.390 
little less angle and you know I run a
similar<00:03:13.510> wheel<00:03:13.719> base<00:03:13.959> 22<00:03:14.290> when<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.069> run<00:03:15.219> on<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
similar wheel base 22 when I run on the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.939 
similar wheel base 22 when I run on the
miles<00:03:15.689> on<00:03:16.689> the<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.019> play<00:03:17.290> half<00:03:17.439> miles<00:03:17.739> are

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
miles on the on the play half miles are

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.710 
miles on the on the play half miles are
on<00:03:18.159> a<00:03:18.370> little<00:03:18.579> shorter<00:03:18.939> wheelbase<00:03:19.120> than<00:03:19.569> out

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
on a little shorter wheelbase than out

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.530 
on a little shorter wheelbase than out
here<00:03:19.750> but<00:03:20.579> really<00:03:21.579> that's<00:03:21.699> about<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.180> just
