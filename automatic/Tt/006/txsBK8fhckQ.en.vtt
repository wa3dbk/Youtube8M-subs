00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
it is a marathon for the violinist for

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.360 
it is a marathon for the violinist for
the<00:02:20.040> soloist<00:02:20.459> because<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:22.260> past<00:02:22.470> Kali<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.799> so

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
the soloist because the past Kali is so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.699 
the soloist because the past Kali is so
intense<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.120> requires<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:24.870> much<00:02:25.049> strength<00:02:25.410> I

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
intense and requires so much strength I

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.190 
intense and requires so much strength I
believe<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.819> is<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.940> longest<00:02:27.299> cadenza<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.959> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
believe it is the longest cadenza in the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.430 
believe it is the longest cadenza in the
violin<00:02:28.500> repertoire<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.819> gets<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.209> like<00:02:30.269> a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
violin repertoire it gets to like a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.750 
violin repertoire it gets to like a
point<00:02:31.440> where<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.739> can<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.160> nothing<00:02:32.579> else<00:02:32.700> but

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
point where it can do nothing else but

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.250 
point where it can do nothing else but
go<00:02:32.970> off<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> cliff<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.630> then<00:02:33.690> that's<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.079> last

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
go off a cliff and then that's the last

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.800 
go off a cliff and then that's the last
moment<00:02:34.709> it's<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> greatest<00:02:36.150> piece<00:02:36.600> of

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
moment it's just the greatest piece of

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.780 
moment it's just the greatest piece of
music<00:02:37.139> to<00:02:37.260> play<00:02:37.440> for<00:02:37.889> me<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.130> play<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.549> concerto
