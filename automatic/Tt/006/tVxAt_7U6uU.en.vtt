what<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.160> gotta<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.880> basically<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:13.049> just

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
what you gotta do is basically you just

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.510 
what you gotta do is basically you just
gotta<00:00:14.089> make<00:00:15.230> loops<00:00:16.970> like<00:00:17.970> circular<00:00:18.570> loops<00:00:19.520> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
gotta make loops like circular loops and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.220 
gotta make loops like circular loops and
they<00:00:20.939> already<00:00:21.060> gave<00:00:21.300> me<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.529> crappy<00:00:22.529> piece

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.260 

like<00:00:26.890> that<00:00:27.310> that's<00:00:28.240> how<00:00:28.359> you<00:00:28.420> get<00:00:28.539> points

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.570 

now<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:32.990> bigger<00:00:33.260> they<00:00:33.500> are<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:34.070> more<00:00:34.190> points

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
now the bigger they are the more points

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.700 
now the bigger they are the more points
you<00:00:34.670> get<00:00:35.080> but<00:00:36.080> you<00:00:36.170> don't<00:00:36.230> want<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.500> make<00:00:36.590> them

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
you get but you don't want to make them

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.020 
you get but you don't want to make them
too<00:00:36.920> big<00:00:37.130> because<00:00:37.400> then<00:00:38.110> you'll<00:00:39.110> get<00:00:39.320> you<00:00:39.740> know

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
you'll get those really bad pieces like

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.690 
you'll get those really bad pieces like
in<00:00:47.600> Tetris<00:00:48.129> that<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.280> don't<00:00:49.580> want<00:00:51.550> it's<00:00:52.550> like
