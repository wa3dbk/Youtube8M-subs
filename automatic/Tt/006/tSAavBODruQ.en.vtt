behind<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:17.359> this<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.570> really<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.170> lot

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
behind it and this is really a lot

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.830 
behind it and this is really a lot
different<00:00:19.949> than<00:00:20.070> 911<00:00:20.820> our<00:00:21.150> intelligence

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
different than 911 our intelligence

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.550 
different than 911 our intelligence
agencies<00:00:22.470> our<00:00:22.710> police<00:00:23.100> forces<00:00:24.380> everything<00:00:25.380> we

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
agencies our police forces everything we

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.640 
agencies our police forces everything we
do<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.070> much<00:00:27.060> sharper<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:28.140> gonna<00:00:28.260> go<00:00:28.470> back

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
do is much sharper we're gonna go back

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.259 
do is much sharper we're gonna go back
and<00:00:28.890> reconstruct<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.699> we'll<00:00:30.000> go<00:00:30.119> back

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and reconstruct this we'll go back

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
and reconstruct this we'll go back
through<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> electronics<00:00:31.500> we'll<00:00:31.740> go

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
through all the electronics we'll go

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.280 
through all the electronics we'll go
back<00:00:32.040> through<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> video<00:00:32.820> surveillance

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
back through all the video surveillance

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.870 
back through all the video surveillance
we'll<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.380> back<00:00:34.590> through<00:00:34.860> telephone<00:00:35.370> records

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
we'll go back through telephone records

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.900 
we'll go back through telephone records
everything<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.640> we're<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> lot<00:00:38.850> more

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
everything and we're a lot more

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
everything and we're a lot more
efficient<00:00:39.510> than<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.780> were<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.559> think

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
efficient than we were then and I think

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.369 
efficient than we were then and I think
we're<00:00:41.219> waiting<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.450> know<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
we're waiting and see we know that if it

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.160 
we're waiting and see we know that if it
is<00:00:43.440> al<00:00:43.950> Qaeda<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.670> someone<00:00:45.420> affiliated<00:00:45.660> with

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is al Qaeda or someone affiliated with

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.260 
is al Qaeda or someone affiliated with
it<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.710> there's<00:00:47.039> been<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.550> risk<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.090> know

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
it we know there's been a risk we know

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
it we know there's been a risk we know
there's<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> been<00:00:49.379> we've<00:00:49.950> said<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> long

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
there's a been we've said for a long

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.830 
there's a been we've said for a long
time<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.120> there<00:00:51.239> was<00:00:51.270> always<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.570> possibility

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
time that there was always a possibility

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.330 
time that there was always a possibility
of<00:00:52.469> Obama<00:00:52.890> who<00:00:53.309> worked<00:00:54.210> alone<00:00:54.600> who<00:00:54.989> was

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
of Obama who worked alone who was

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.920 
of Obama who worked alone who was
self-motivated<00:00:56.370> who<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.149> reading<00:00:57.600> websites

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
self-motivated who was reading websites

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.560 
self-motivated who was reading websites
maybe<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.949> wasn't<00:00:59.190> actually<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.030> connection

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
maybe but wasn't actually in connection

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.290 
maybe but wasn't actually in connection
maybe<00:01:01.170> that's<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.609> really

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
maybe that's what this is it's really

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.509 
maybe that's what this is it's really
not<00:01:03.449> very<00:01:03.510> useful<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> speculate<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
not very useful to speculate on it this

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.100 
not very useful to speculate on it this
point<00:01:05.850> what's<00:01:06.119> interesting<00:01:06.600> however<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
point what's interesting however is that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.219 
point what's interesting however is that
there<00:01:07.380> were<00:01:07.500> no<00:01:07.770> no<00:01:08.760> alerts<00:01:09.360> or<00:01:09.630> warnings

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
there were no no alerts or warnings

ahead of what we saw today because
oftentimes<00:01:13.080> univercity<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:14.010> come<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
oftentimes univercity will come out and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.450 
oftentimes univercity will come out and

national assets to bear and I'm sure

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.650 
national assets to bear and I'm sure
those<00:05:32.100> assets<00:05:32.340> have<00:05:33.060> been<00:05:33.270> brought<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.630> bear

those assets have been brought to bear
in<00:05:34.020> this<00:05:34.200> case<00:05:34.470> but<00:05:35.130> right<00:05:35.430> now<00:05:35.640> given<00:05:36.630> what<00:05:36.810> we

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
in this case but right now given what we

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.300 
in this case but right now given what we
know<00:05:37.169> about<00:05:37.200> it

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
know about it

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.820 
know about it
the<00:05:38.820> military<00:05:39.210> is<00:05:39.270> probably<00:05:39.570> not<00:05:39.990> involved<00:05:40.710> I

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
the military is probably not involved I

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.740 
the military is probably not involved I
would<00:05:41.010> guess<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.280> there<00:05:41.700> may<00:05:42.240> be<00:05:42.270> some

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
would guess that there may be some

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.140 
would guess that there may be some
special<00:05:43.440> units<00:05:44.010> of<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.220> military<00:05:44.640> maybe<00:05:44.850> some

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
special units of the military maybe some

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.650 
special units of the military maybe some
explosive<00:05:45.810> ordnance<00:05:46.229> demolition<00:05:46.830> maybe<00:05:47.160> some

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
explosive ordnance demolition maybe some

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.840 
explosive ordnance demolition maybe some
medical<00:05:48.660> units<00:05:49.050> in<00:05:49.229> the<00:05:49.650> Massachusetts<00:05:50.370> area

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
medical units in the Massachusetts area

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.550 
medical units in the Massachusetts area
maybe<00:05:51.180> they've<00:05:51.479> received<00:05:51.930> some<00:05:52.200> kind<00:05:52.350> of<00:05:52.440> a

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
maybe they've received some kind of a

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.520 
maybe they've received some kind of a
warning<00:05:52.950> order<00:05:53.130> but<00:05:54.120> it's<00:05:54.330> a<00:05:54.419> little<00:05:54.660> early<00:05:54.750> to

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
warning order but it's a little early to

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.800 
warning order but it's a little early to
expect<00:05:56.160> anything<00:05:56.430> like<00:05:56.700> that<00:05:56.760> in<00:05:57.210> this<00:05:57.479> in

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
expect anything like that in this in

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.290 
expect anything like that in this in

would evolve you would expect that
there'd<00:07:04.240> be<00:07:04.330> some<00:07:04.600> indicator<00:07:05.200> and<00:07:05.470> you<00:07:05.979> could

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
there'd be some indicator and you could

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.940 
there'd be some indicator and you could
focus<00:07:06.729> your<00:07:07.000> resources<00:07:07.630> a<00:07:07.780> little<00:07:08.110> bit<00:07:08.260> we'll

focus your resources a little bit we'll

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.890 
focus your resources a little bit we'll
