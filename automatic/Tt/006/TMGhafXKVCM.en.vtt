semaphore<00:00:24.109> signals<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.590> railroad<00:00:25.920> used

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
semaphore signals that the railroad used

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.600 
semaphore signals that the railroad used
to<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.699> early<00:00:27.029> 1900's<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:31.399> did<00:00:32.399> some

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
to have in early 1900's and I did some

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.310 
to have in early 1900's and I did some
digging<00:00:32.820> around<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.649> found<00:00:35.809> pictures<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
digging around and found pictures and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.700 
digging around and found pictures and
use<00:00:37.500> everything<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.600> scale<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.110> down<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
use everything to scale it all down to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.729 
use everything to scale it all down to
what<00:00:41.010> make<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.370> project<00:00:42.500> initially<00:00:43.500> you'll

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
what make this project initially you'll

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.330 
what make this project initially you'll
see<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.399> three<00:00:44.850> inch<00:00:45.000> lenses<00:00:46.070> those<00:00:47.070> are

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
see I have three inch lenses those are

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.299 
see I have three inch lenses those are
actually<00:00:47.969> lenses<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.750> found<00:00:49.129> which<00:00:50.129> are

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
actually lenses I found which are

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.270 
actually lenses I found which are
filters<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.379> photographic<00:00:52.379> flash<00:00:52.710> units<00:00:53.160> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
filters for photographic flash units I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.910 
filters for photographic flash units I
found<00:00:53.550> those<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.879> eBay<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.590> my

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
found those on eBay and that was my

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.130 
found those on eBay and that was my
starting<00:00:56.460> point<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.059> project<00:00:57.360> those

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
starting point for this project those

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.770 
starting point for this project those
are<00:00:58.379> three<00:00:58.649> inch<00:00:58.829> lenses<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.520> tried<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.570> find

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
are three inch lenses I tried to find

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.189 
are three inch lenses I tried to find
lenses<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.350> were<00:01:01.559> green<00:01:02.010> amber<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.850> yeah

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
lenses that were green amber and yeah

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.859 
lenses that were green amber and yeah
red<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.400> had<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> hard<00:01:06.299> time<00:01:06.510> finding<00:01:06.810> lenses

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
red and I had a hard time finding lenses

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
red and I had a hard time finding lenses
until<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> ran<00:01:10.140> across<00:01:10.290> these<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.830> eBay<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
until I ran across these on eBay that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
until I ran across these on eBay that
was<00:01:12.150> my<00:01:12.270> starting<00:01:12.750> point<00:01:12.960> everything<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
was my starting point everything is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.740 
was my starting point everything is
scaled<00:01:13.920> down<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.580> these<00:01:14.760> three<00:01:14.790> inch<00:01:15.240> lenses

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
scaled down to these three inch lenses

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
scaled down to these three inch lenses
because<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:18.020> real<00:01:19.100> semaphores<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.369> seven<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
because a real semaphores have seven and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.300 
because a real semaphores have seven and
three-quarter<00:01:21.479> inch<00:01:21.630> diameter<00:01:22.590> lenses<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
three-quarter inch diameter lenses I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.120 
three-quarter inch diameter lenses I
wasn't<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> full<00:01:24.810> scale<00:01:25.140> system

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
wasn't going to make a full scale system

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.420 
wasn't going to make a full scale system
so<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.670> had<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.710> find<00:01:28.710> something<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.130> was

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
so I had to find something that was

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.780 
so I had to find something that was
scaled<00:01:29.939> down<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.590> this<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.250> first<00:01:32.460> set

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
scaled down and this was the first set

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.640 
scaled down and this was the first set
of<00:01:32.820> lenses<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.689> could<00:01:33.869> find<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> these<00:01:34.470> are

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of lenses I could find and these are

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.749 
of lenses I could find and these are
roughly<00:01:35.430> three<00:01:35.790> inches<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.360> diameter

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
roughly three inches in diameter

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.520 
roughly three inches in diameter
and<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.329> did<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.110> scaled

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and what I did was is I scaled

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.560 
and what I did was is I scaled
everything<00:01:41.070> down<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> ratio<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.030> 7<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
everything down to the ratio of 7 and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.499 
everything down to the ratio of 7 and
3/4<00:01:43.170> inches<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> real<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.970> 3<00:01:45.240> inches

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
3/4 inches for a real one to 3 inches

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.780 
3/4 inches for a real one to 3 inches
for<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.320> then<00:01:46.950> everything<00:01:47.460> else<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
for this one and then everything else is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
for this one and then everything else is
scaled<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:50.040> ratio<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:51.420> spectacled<00:01:52.229> that

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
scaled to that ratio the spectacled that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.490 
scaled to that ratio the spectacled that
holds<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> lenses<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.759> actual<00:01:54.659> flag<00:01:55.020> all

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
holds the lenses the actual flag all

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.940 
holds the lenses the actual flag all
that<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.920> scaled<00:01:56.280> down<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.860> would

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that is scaled down to what you would

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.450 
that is scaled down to what you would
find<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.369> our<00:01:59.399> real<00:01:59.790> semaphore<00:02:01.130> now<00:02:02.130> let's<00:02:02.340> get

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
find on our real semaphore now let's get

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.800 
find on our real semaphore now let's get
a<00:02:02.520> little<00:02:02.610> closer<00:02:02.909> here<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:04.579> have<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.850> gear<00:02:06.509> motor

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a little closer here I have a gear motor

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.410 
a little closer here I have a gear motor
with<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> turntable<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.149> that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
with a turntable on it that that

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.910 
with a turntable on it that that
actually<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.200> driver<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.830> holds<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
actually is the driver that holds and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.580 
actually is the driver that holds and
a<00:02:11.970> rotates<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.300> entire<00:02:13.930> spectacle<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.340> arm

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
a rotates the entire spectacle and arm

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.699 
a rotates the entire spectacle and arm
he<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:18.040> reed<00:02:18.880> switch<00:02:18.910> sensor<00:02:19.780> here<00:02:20.170> I've

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
he have a reed switch sensor here I've

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.710 
he have a reed switch sensor here I've
got<00:02:20.980> another<00:02:21.069> one<00:02:21.459> over<00:02:21.489> here<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.360> can't

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
got another one over here that you can't

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.180 
got another one over here that you can't
really<00:02:22.930> see<00:02:23.050> too<00:02:23.260> well<00:02:23.470> because<00:02:23.739> it's<00:02:23.980> hidden

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
really see too well because it's hidden

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.990 
really see too well because it's hidden
and<00:02:24.940> let's<00:02:25.120> go<00:02:25.300> look<00:02:25.569> from<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> top<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.590> you

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
and let's go look from the top and you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.660 
and let's go look from the top and you
can<00:02:28.000> see<00:02:28.420> it's<00:02:29.380> kind<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.800> dark<00:02:30.040> but<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.370> made<00:02:30.550> it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
can see it's kind of dark but I made it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.430 
can see it's kind of dark but I made it
dim<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.120> we<00:02:31.239> could<00:02:31.390> see<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.660> lights<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.170> when

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
dim so we could see the lights one when

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.280 
dim so we could see the lights one when
everything<00:02:32.800> is<00:02:32.890> running<00:02:33.360> there's<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.540> three

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
everything is running there's a three

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.540 
everything is running there's a three
inch<00:02:35.650> diameter<00:02:36.220> lantern<00:02:37.209> shroud<00:02:38.019> from<00:02:38.380> a

inch diameter lantern shroud from a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.009 
inch diameter lantern shroud from a
lantern<00:02:39.550> flashlight<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.150> use<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.600> for

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
lantern flashlight I use that for

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.850 
lantern flashlight I use that for
lighting<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.390> will<00:02:43.630> actually<00:02:44.110> shine

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
lighting and that will actually shine

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.800 
lighting and that will actually shine
light<00:02:45.100> right<00:02:45.340> through<00:02:45.550> lenses<00:02:46.030> let's<00:02:46.600> get

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
light right through lenses let's get

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.280 
light right through lenses let's get
this<00:02:46.989> thing<00:02:47.050> started<00:02:47.530> okay<00:02:49.290> everything's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
this thing started okay everything's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.210 
this thing started okay everything's
running<00:02:50.530> 110<00:02:51.280> volts<00:02:51.810> I'll<00:02:52.810> turn<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:53.380> and

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
running 110 volts I'll turn it on and

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.860 
running 110 volts I'll turn it on and
you<00:02:54.910> can<00:02:54.940> see<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.330> light<00:02:55.540> come<00:02:55.750> on

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
you can see the light come on

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.710 
you can see the light come on
immediately<00:02:56.819> initially<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:57.940> see<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.540> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
immediately initially you see that the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.350 
immediately initially you see that the
semaphore<00:02:59.200> dropped<00:02:59.830> down<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.880> what<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.090> call

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
semaphore dropped down to what I call

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.750 
semaphore dropped down to what I call
the<00:03:01.510> home<00:03:01.720> position<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.280> starting

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
position that I programmed in the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.210 
position that I programmed in the
Arduino<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.930> allow<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:07.989> system<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.799> figure

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
Arduino to allow the system to figure

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.850 
Arduino to allow the system to figure
out<00:03:09.370> where<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:10.030> arm<00:03:10.269> or<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.870> initial<00:03:11.560> home

it<00:03:16.450> keeps<00:03:16.720> track<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.049> its<00:03:17.410> position<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.329> will

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
it keeps track of its position and will

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.770 
it keeps track of its position and will
move<00:03:20.140> everything<00:03:20.350> accordingly<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:22.480> keeps

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
move everything accordingly it keeps

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.940 
move everything accordingly it keeps
count<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:24.540> make<00:03:25.540> sure<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.590> doesn't

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
count and make sure that it doesn't

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.030 
count and make sure that it doesn't
rotate<00:03:27.310> past<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.299> proper<00:03:29.170> positions<00:03:29.680> and

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
rotate past the proper positions and

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.460 
rotate past the proper positions and
like<00:03:30.640> I<00:03:30.730> said<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:30.970> use<00:03:31.239> Reed<00:03:31.540> switches<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:33.160> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
like I said I use Reed switches on the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.349 
like I said I use Reed switches on the

drive the brightness of the bulb for the
lantern<00:07:14.300> light<00:07:14.509> and<00:07:15.430> since<00:07:16.430> I<00:07:16.520> had<00:07:16.639> to<00:07:16.759> reduce

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:17.659 
lantern light and since I had to reduce

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:19.869 
lantern light and since I had to reduce
the<00:07:17.719> voltage<00:07:17.990> anyway<00:07:18.529> because<00:07:18.710> system<00:07:19.639> runs

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 
the voltage anyway because system runs

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:24.070 
the voltage anyway because system runs
on<00:07:19.999> 15<00:07:20.509> the<00:07:20.779> lantern<00:07:21.759> bulb<00:07:22.759> is<00:07:22.939> 6<00:07:23.210> volts<00:07:23.599> so<00:07:23.810> I

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
on 15 the lantern bulb is 6 volts so I

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.559 
on 15 the lantern bulb is 6 volts so I
figure<00:07:24.680> well<00:07:24.889> I'll<00:07:25.099> add<00:07:25.339> PWM<00:07:25.999> I<00:07:26.150> built<00:07:26.419> a

figure well I'll add PWM I built a
simple<00:07:26.899> five<00:07:27.860> five<00:07:28.189> five<00:07:28.460> timers<00:07:28.879> PWM<00:07:29.749> circuit

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:30.229 
simple five five five timers PWM circuit

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:33.369 
simple five five five timers PWM circuit
and<00:07:30.409> allows<00:07:31.129> me<00:07:31.430> to<00:07:31.699> reduce<00:07:32.539> the<00:07:32.839> power<00:07:33.050> going

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:33.379 
and allows me to reduce the power going

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:36.249 
and allows me to reduce the power going
to<00:07:33.469> the<00:07:33.649> bulb<00:07:33.889> and<00:07:34.399> I<00:07:34.879> have<00:07:35.330> adjustable

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:36.259 
to the bulb and I have adjustable

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:39.369 
to the bulb and I have adjustable
brightness<00:07:36.589> also<00:07:37.279> the<00:07:38.240> entire<00:07:38.569> cabinet<00:07:39.169> is

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:39.379 
brightness also the entire cabinet is

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:43.689 
brightness also the entire cabinet is
actually<00:07:40.279> a<00:07:40.520> closed-circuit<00:07:42.699> television

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:43.699 
actually a closed-circuit television

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:47.920 
actually a closed-circuit television
cabinet<00:07:43.999> I<00:07:44.300> found<00:07:44.599> at<00:07:45.159> a<00:07:46.159> surplus<00:07:46.939> electronics

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:47.930 
cabinet I found at a surplus electronics

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.209 
cabinet I found at a surplus electronics

store science and electronics store and
like<00:07:52.219> I<00:07:52.339> said<00:07:52.399> all<00:07:52.939> these<00:07:53.209> parts<00:07:53.719> came

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:54.169 
like I said all these parts came

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:56.639 
like I said all these parts came
together<00:07:54.379> in<00:07:54.860> a<00:07:54.949> nine-month<00:07:55.459> period<00:07:55.729> I

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:56.649 
together in a nine-month period I

00:07:56.649 --> 00:08:00.760 
together in a nine-month period I
fabricated<00:07:57.649> a<00:07:57.860> bunch<00:07:58.069> of<00:07:58.189> stuff<00:07:58.490> I<00:07:58.990> read<00:07:59.990> her

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:00.770 
fabricated a bunch of stuff I read her

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.529 
fabricated a bunch of stuff I read her
purse<00:08:00.979> a<00:08:01.099> lot<00:08:01.279> of<00:08:01.459> things<00:08:01.759> to<00:08:02.209> make<00:08:02.360> this

00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:02.539 
purse a lot of things to make this

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:04.779 
purse a lot of things to make this
entire<00:08:02.749> project<00:08:03.289> it<00:08:03.680> took<00:08:03.830> me<00:08:03.979> like<00:08:04.129> a<00:08:04.189> lei<00:08:04.520> say

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:04.789 
entire project it took me like a lei say

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:08.860 
entire project it took me like a lei say
nine<00:08:05.029> months<00:08:05.449> but<00:08:06.399> as<00:08:07.399> you<00:08:07.669> can<00:08:07.789> see<00:08:07.849> it<00:08:08.330> works

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:08.870 
nine months but as you can see it works

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.260 
nine months but as you can see it works
and<00:08:09.199> I'm<00:08:09.709> pretty<00:08:09.979> happy<00:08:10.219> with<00:08:10.459> it<00:08:10.520> and<00:08:10.789> I<00:08:11.089> hope
