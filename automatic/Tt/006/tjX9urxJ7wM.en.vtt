00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.590
 We divide zero points 25 by 1 points 0 3 0 7 5 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.590
 now the first thing they have to do when their gdp and only number by which 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.929
 they lived is a decimal 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.959
 is multiplied by ten enough times 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.959
 so that it becomes a whole number 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.359
 then they can run the decimal to the right then every time 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.539
 multiplied by ten are running the simat to the right 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.569
 so in that case we want to run 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.310
 those on the right one and two times 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.300
 then it will be point 25 by ten times it will be the same as 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.250
 a bridge and 5 percent and we'll change the point to 5 25 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.410
 if they do that with the divider they also have to do it with the dividend on 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.650
 number you may be dividing then you have to multiply this by 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.460
 ten twice or another way of seeing these correal decimal acelar cast pest 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.030
 then run it once twice we will stick here 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.220
 and to see what makes sense we have to realize that that expression 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.240
 here 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.470
 this division problem is exactly the same as having zero 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.690
 point 25 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.039
 is exactly the same as having the 1 point dividend 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.039
 0 3 0 7 5 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.110
 by 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.540
 zero point 25 two point shots 25 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.590
 then we are multiplying zero point 25 per foot twice 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.340
 we are essentially multiplying percent 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.340
 I will do that in a different color 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.310
 we are multiplying by a hundred in the denominator this is the divisor 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.490
 we are multiplying by a hundred then we have to do the same the numerator 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.100
 if we do not want to change that expression if we do not want to change the numbers 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.020
 so you also have to multiply that by a hundred and when you do that 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.920
 this is transformed into 25 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.740
 and this transforms into 103 points 0 7 5 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.040
 I'm going to rewrite this sometimes when they do this is a notebook something 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.819
 so you do not have to rewrite it remember meters 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:59.960
 what is a decimal 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 but I'm going to rewrite this so that a little more orderly 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.130
 because we apply the divisor the dividend percent that problem are transformed 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.869
 the dividend 25 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.869
 in 103 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.069
 outon 0 7 5 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.250
 this will result in that act mind the same quotient in that act mind the 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.879
 same fraction 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.290
 we simply have to multiply both the numerator and the denominator 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.290
 percent to change the decimal does the right twice 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.809
 now we want the fact that we are ready to divide 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:37.679
 the first thing that we have 25 and always has some art of living something for a 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.679
 multiple digit let's see that we also do it then 25 do not fit 1 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.289
 they do not fit 10 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.349
 25 fits in 103 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.349
 cadence four times four times five 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 is 20 4 for 2 expo done 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.579
 four ports is 8 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.949
 it was enough session 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:04.619
 we knew that now subtracts moss 103-100 will be 3 and now we can lower this 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.619
 center 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.859
 and we can third bars 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:20.049
 25 face in 30 once 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.569
 and if we want we can immediately by stress and maracay 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.980
 we do not have to wait until the end of the problem this tenth they put that 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.150
 place then we can always have sdc himalaya in our conscious or our 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.150
 answer 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.980
 then 25 cantons at once one times 25 25 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.980
 and then we can spend 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.349
 30-25 is simply 5 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.349
 and we can do this boring job 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.439
 that are transformed 10 these are transformed two 2-2 is nothing but 30-25 5 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.439
 now we can lower this 7 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.669
 this 7 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.849
 25 k in 57 2 times 25 by 12 50 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:13.249
 25 kg 57 twice two times 25 and 50 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.559
 and now we subtract again 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:19.469
 57-57 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.859
 and now we are almost ready 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.859
 we can download is 50 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.960
 you gave 5 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 25 fit 75 three times 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.649
 three for 25 and 75 say 3 for 5 is15 we group the hub 1 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:44.150
 we ignore what was before three times 12 6 +1 7 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.249
 you can see that and then we subtract 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:55.159
 and we have no rest then 25 fits in 103 points 0 7 5 that minute mind 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.600
 four point a two three times what makes sense since 25 can be said 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.220
 approximately four times 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.050
 that's a little bigger than it was then it was a little over four 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.600
 months 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.240
 and that will be exactly the same response as the times in which point xero 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.210
 25 fit 1 points 0 3 0 7 5 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.020
 this will also be four point one two three then this fraction costs 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.740
 expression 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.099
 It's totally the same 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.610
 what four point one two three 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.740
 and we are ready
