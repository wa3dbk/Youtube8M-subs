00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.130
 hello my name is sonia and today I like it 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.379
 I'm going to teach you how to do these 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.920
 original gift bags made with 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.140
 an envelope are very easy to do if 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.720
 You want to know how to make yourself stay 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.439
 right now I explain the step by step of 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.439
 how to make them 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.420
 to make these gift bags 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.780
 we're just going to need one on one 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.970
 ruler wrapping paper a small piece 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.610
 of cardboard sticking tape 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.070
 on both sides stick glue one 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.020
 scissors a scissor that cut wavy a 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.020
 pencil cord and a tie 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.030
 the main material to do these 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.520
 sachets is a simple envelope to send 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.820
 letters as you can see the first thing that 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.860
 we are going to do is close the envelope 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.200
 and once closed we will decorate it 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.290
 as I want, I have chosen to decorate 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.300
 this little bag of gift paper and what 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.640
 I'm going to do to give it an effect 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.640
 interesting is to tear it by the sides 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.640
 See how it looks with a very nice effect 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.729
 the paper always has a side that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.380
 tears perfectly and the opposite side is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.140
 it starts very bad so let's look 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.000
 that side that we rip without any 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.729
 problem to make it easier for me 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.880
 paste the paper to the envelope I will use 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.880
 glue stick 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.119
 It is important that we keep the paper 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.939
 all covered with glue in bar 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.490
 and now we're going to put the paper in 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.340
 this part of the envelope and so we take advantage 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.469
 and we cover it, we press very well for 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.990
 everything is very well stuck now 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.970
 we cut a piece of top 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.829
 the top of the bag is going to be 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.110
 what we have open and below that 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.750
 it's closed we're going to turn it around 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.260
 about and we're going to mark at the base of 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.080
 about 2 centimeters up now 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.330
 we put the rule in the brands and with the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.769
 tip of the scissors we will mark a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.239
 little to do the fold now for that 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.239
 reference we are going to double 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.510
 the next thing we're going to do is double 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.909
 here a diagonal in the corners we go 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.579
 to take reference these two 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:38.770
 centimeters from here we are going to double the 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.710
 corner and make it match 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.660
 with this top part we are going to mark 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.520
 very well this fold and let's do what 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.450
 same with this part 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.310
 we erase the marks of the pencil 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.110
 and these brands that we have already made 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.080
 they give the reference to double for the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.769
 sides we can do it by eye taking this 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.769
 reference 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.920
 or we can do as we did before 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.920
 mark to be able to do the fold 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.550
 let's mark all the folds towards 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.660
 both sides and now what we're going to do 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.610
 is to put your hand over here 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.610
 and we are going to build the base 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.970
 let's press 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.610
 this already we have marked the reference 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.770
 with the double is that we have done and we are going 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.930
 to come out as well as a triangle 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.930
 and on the other side exactly the same 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.769
 and here I have these two points marked 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:58.769
 which are the ones that are going to go that way 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.769
 in and now let's mark the sides 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.410
 now we cut a small rectangle of 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.260
 gift wrap we are going to put you very 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.569
 good glue in bar from behind and 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.020
 this will serve us to cover here in 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.020
 base 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.410
 and to make sure that this is very 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.900
 well we are going to turn the sachet 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.030
 and with something long 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.960
 we are going to press that base so that 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:33.060
 is very well stuck now we mark 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.060
 this center line and we put together like this 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.830
 and now it's time to calculate 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.639
 how high do we want the bag then 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.639
 we fold it like this 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.199
 and we are going to cut what we consider 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.020
 We can use a scissors that 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.099
 Wavy cut or with normal scissors 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.099
 we cut straight 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.709
 now with the scissors we are going to cut this 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:02.709
 part and we're going to leave it straight 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.719
 Now we need a small piece of 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.999
 cardboard and small piece of paper 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.400
 gift to the piece of cardboard we are going to 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:16.339
 trace two small circles with 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.889
 pencil and paper gift Let him 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.870
 put glue on bars 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.930
 Now we stick the cardboard on top of the 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.820
 wrapping paper and now we cut these 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.830
 circles 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.930
 now we need this adhesive tape 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.810
 that sticks on both sides that has 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.910
 this thickness and we're going to stick it 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.790
 small pieces behind each 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.550
 circle now we need a string of 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.440
 any type we put double or simple 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.260
 or as we want and we can decorate it with 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.510
 beads or with bells this cord what 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.240
 we are going to paste in this part and to 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.180
 help us to paste it we can do it with 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:57.110
 the tape that we have put here we paste 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.670
 we sink the cord and this we are going to 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.670
 paste in this part 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.199
 the second circle we are going to stick a 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.270
 little below we are going to close like this and what 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.880
 let's put like at this distance more 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.800
 or less and to close the sachet is very 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.500
 simple let's move this cord 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.500
 around the circle below 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.660
 and now to finish decorating the 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.540
 I'm going to put a magic tie 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.610
 that you can see the tutorial on my channel 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.920
 clicking on the screen or on the 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.500
 description of this video I have also 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.980
 put tape on this adhesive and I'll 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.980
 I'm going to paste 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.000
 and that's how nice these little bags are 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.920
 very easy to do with very few 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.530
 materials and we can do them with 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.210
 any size of about the best is what 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.390
 What I like most is that decorating 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.490
 very simple a great result is achieved 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.890
 in this case I decorated him with two 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.370
 stickers on three of these that has 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:59.470
 very elegant with the magic tie 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.690
 is the simplest decoration only 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.180
 I've put the buttons ahead 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.630
 to close with central has left white 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:10.200
 and it's also very beautiful and I've 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.850
 decorated with this adhesive tape 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.410
 decorated here instead of putting the 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.150
 buttons what I've done is put the 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.700
 tape 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.220
 so I can open and close this 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.670
 way and now it only remains to put a 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.670
 present 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.180
 and give it to that special person 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:38.250
 as always I hope you enjoyed 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.770
 today's project and that you put it in 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.199
 practice now I say goodbye I wish you
