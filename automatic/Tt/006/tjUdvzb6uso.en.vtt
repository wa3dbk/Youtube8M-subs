the next call of duty maybe it's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179 
the next call of duty maybe it's
equivalent<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> DNA<00:01:07.170> bomb<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.830> Moab

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
equivalent to the DNA bomb or the Moab

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.620

going to be a hit in 25 streak until

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
going to be a hit in 25 streak until
some<00:01:15.659> early<00:01:15.960> gameplay<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.530> released<00:01:16.890> on
