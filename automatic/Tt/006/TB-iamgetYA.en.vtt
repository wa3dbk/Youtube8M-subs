 do not 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.560
 or not 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.359
 hi how are youtube friend in this 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.210
 video tutorial let's learn to 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.450
 repair the damaged files of our 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.970
 OS 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.910
 for this, before doing it, I want to 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.480
 give them some things this happens because 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.850
 sometimes we download programs or files 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.540
 to our pc and sometimes these programs 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.820
 of files we download it with some 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.030
 virus class not be a stewart a 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.220
 malware is a robot and this variety of 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.290
 virus in the Internet and what 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.080
 passes the main function of viruses 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.690
 in general that I am damaging the archives 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.500
 system especially generally 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.220
 the knit files of l and this 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.460
 cause our pc to become unstable 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.800
 slow and does not work well and she even 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.450
 there are some files or programs that do not 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.520
 you can open it because there are 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.479
 Missing or damaged files in our 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.340
 operating system then knowing this 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.950
 what we are going to do is repair this 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.080
 with the tool that gives us this the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.660
 same windows operating system 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.460
 it is a tool we are going to repair these 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.680
 damaged files and to do it 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.350
 we just have to press the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.479
 windows + r key 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.250
 and from that window that has been opened 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.250
 let's write here on it in that bar 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 cmd 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.190
 very well once we are here what 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.430
 we have to write is the following 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.430
 command 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.700
 ffc backslash is camp nou and what 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.560
 only thing we have to do is give it 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.770
 click on enter 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.870
 we have to wait this determines the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.959
 exam this what you are going to do is 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.330
 analyze all system files 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.400
 of our operating system and if 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.650
 detect an error file 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.470
 damaged will immediately proceed to 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.260
 repair it I recommend that when you do 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.900
 this procedure after restart 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.880
 the pc so that everything is all 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.110
 changes zoltan effect and already your pc is 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.110
 completely restored 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.769
 very well already the command finished the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.540
 console finished repairing files 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.849
 damaged on the pc even there in the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.280
 message comes out that you already found 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.650
 damaged files and tells us and that does not 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.420
 got some of them repaired has 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.120
 say that many of them and the repairs 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.769
 and there were damaged files 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.300
 for example in a next video I have 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.440
 teach how to finish repairing these 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.069
 files that really remained 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.450
 useless as it were 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.549
 irremediably repairable then 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.739
 there is a way like this will come back to 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.799
 replace files with files 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.440
 new that I'll do it in a second 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.079
 in a second video that I will upload to my 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.519
 youtube channel for this I encourage you to 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.450

 of corrupted files on your pc but

 there are always files that practically 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.790
 they are hopelessly damaged because 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.640
 because the viruses 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.290
 they began their destruction in certain 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.510
 archives with the passage of time 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.030
 they finished destroying them totally and 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.920
 then this but those who just 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.349
 they started to hurt him with this 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.359
