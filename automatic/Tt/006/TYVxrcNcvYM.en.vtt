00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
never have my water and in my setup here
normally<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> pole<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.479> that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
normally this would be on a pole so that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.350 
normally this would be on a pole so that
you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.869> lower<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.200> raise<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.150> can

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you can lower or raise or on so we can
