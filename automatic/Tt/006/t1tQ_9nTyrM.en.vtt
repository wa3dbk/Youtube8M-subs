00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.990

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.650
 here for you a game gameplay 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.109
 Tahitian fol because finally I 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.730
 I was able to record the gameplay of this game 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.250
 was if he did not imagine the amount of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.410
 problems I'm having so much to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.519
 to be able to play from time to time some 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.710
 problems mainly because of their 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.820
 to record videos from Taiwan was my 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.619
 joy was so great that I succeeded 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.720
 Record this game play that I did issue 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.669
 to bring here in the main channel 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.989
 do not even play the game 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.640
 bring it here because I also had 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.380
 said this game a while back in the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.480
 Rock video so I really wanted 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.309
 also contextualise this video with 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.600
 The other one I said is good invitation. 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.100
 of the rock for those who do not know a game 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.660
 Indian who also has titans in the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.640
 battle and everything but for those who do not 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.480
 know much yet lack FAO is a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.829
 multiplayer action game is focused 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.510
 only in multiplayer so much that it does not have 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.129
 no single player campaign mode or 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.039
 anything of the kind is not being 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.280
 distributed by electronic arts by ei 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.229
 and it was developed by responds that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.020
 is a producer that came from 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.030
 employees of the old and infinity ward 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.979
 who created the code so we saw 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.659
 what a damn hype because you like code 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.229
 thinks it will replace record 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.750
 because it can're boring and such and such and such 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.049
 basically this is the trick and the hype 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.030
 involved is so is around such 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.590
 shape in the cup so cute is involved 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.390
 but the game itself is a very 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.100
 fun if I know from my job I 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.500
 I got a little lost on the hill one 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.049
 face very tactically took a shot is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.670
 capturing the flag that this 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.280
 it's a game mode I'm playing a mode 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.229
 domain control point the domain of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.939
 points against something in an angels 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.189
 in 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.600
 The goal is to capture the flags now 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.729
 began the beautiful sequence that osmar 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.170
 has a fondness here there will see another 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.210
 the other side I'm going to kill a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.740
 shotgun is also another button 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.479
 with the grenade they will kill it makes the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.219
 old first degree slaughter and hama 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.549
 second guess I make up a double that 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.439
 Mistake me also to touch O 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.460
 more human and dies I do not eat either 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.710
 giba 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.899
 but I gave assistance assistance 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.580
 that I was dying and this is one of the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.040
 cool things about the game was frantic 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.420
 more expensive when you start to get an error 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.860
 while other players or even 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.569
 against the Titans who just mount 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.829
 my title and now the deal is 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.540
 frantic 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.980
 You have to be smart and have to be smart. 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.989
 on the controls in order to be able to 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.180
 survive when you 're on x1 dude 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.060
 If it was not I was shotgun then 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.579
 she gave me a diesel comparsa 1 a 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.709
 advantage of being close to my 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.420
 opponents was far away with certainty 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.370
 would have died because the guys with a 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.569
 Minimal miracle already managed to hit and 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.730
 consequently take away my 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.560
 Life I lost a lot, it's very fast and 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.579
 ended up dying also totally 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.920
 then the time the game with the title 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.470
 again you will see that it is quiet and it is 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.569
 and I can split the trophy in three 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.299
 different game modes you playing 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.500
 against you playing against boat and 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.329
 you playing titan 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.489
 are three different levels which are within 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.900
 from the game are you coming a little bit from my 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.489
 I play against the player there that I did 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.560
 that my x 1 but also a part 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.849
 important of the game is you know how to play 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.829
 against the boxes because I do not play 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.109
 multiplayer that has boat in the middle and these 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.909
 boxes give as week the enemy boats 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.250
 they give you advantages for you 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.689
 get your titan that's the robozÃ£o 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.790
 Giant you use after 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.440
 battles understood is very important 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.519
 know how to master it you know that you 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.709
 You have to also mark 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.799
 the boats that is a different business from 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.409
 other fs multiplayer party that does not have 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.180
 this aspect does not have these this action of 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.859
 you find good against intelligence 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.720
 artificial in the middle of the game 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.340
 So be smart, said you bought it. 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.650
 This game is right 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.750
 be smart to look at the boats and 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.400
 behind him without killing the boats is theme 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.629
 also a breast a boat you can 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.519
 capture him by his team that is the 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.379
 spectrum this also gives enough point 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.449
 has some a challenge that you have to 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.340
 do to evolve within the game you 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.229
 have to capture these aspects 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.470
 are a tip for you who are 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:57.510
 hiring staff is also right and is 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.180
 this the third game play clicks 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.489
 with the titans guys where you have some 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.139
 has the biggest difficulty is you 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.970
 get away from the players you've seen 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.970
 have on top of such a 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.530
 little time and went right to one of the 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.900
 actions that the players can do 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.639
 mount the titan and destroy them in the gun 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.620
 understood you have this too but you too 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.180
 in addition to worrying about prices may 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.609
 up you have to worry about 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.959
 other titans who can kill you and have 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.880
 several times you kill the players and the 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.770
 titans and can kill both with attacks 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.340
 myles as well as attacks 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.860
 is the abnormal grumpy st explosion will be the name 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.840
 strange is and can also kill 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.099
 is with crushing the players player can 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.840
 go over them 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.729
 you saw the text the gameplay of a 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.900
 small start and now I'm going to start 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.460
 talk about my problems I'm having 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.440
 hunger ann contact mainly at the time 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.300
 recording was using flex 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.039
 can do the recording of my game place 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.620
 it's time to deal with this problem 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.569
 dropping from now awaiting a 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.190
 start fan if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.110
 You are now watching the crime. 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.180
 well worked well into account 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.039
 game was not but the recording stays me 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.880
 I do not know why, I do not know why. 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.319
 that happens 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.240
 Another problem is also that sometimes 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.909
 mainly with phelps the audio 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.740
 disappears you listen in the game have seen 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.900
 until you lose the game too 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.789
 and everything is flooded all weird or 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.409
 audio jumps popping the sound 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.639
 listen to another machine gun listening 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.960
 plus the sound of the affection that is speaking 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.599
 Whatever you have to do or not 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.259
 then that is a problem as having 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.729
 with the trump when recording to 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.409
 seek another recording program 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.699
 to record this video to 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.500
 You guys, that's why I'm doing this. 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.509
 this video on channel 5 on the primary channel 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.400
 a next game to be able to 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.080
 to commemorate the fact that 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.819
 gotta record a gameplay of dayton 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.830
 sun and show some of the game to 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.810
 You because the front city is in 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.469
 field to the very frantic game and I 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.419
 I already died 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.750
 with the match already over for me only 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.580
 there is an epilogue stage where you 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.990
 your team has to flee to a ship 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.529
 in case you lose what happened to my 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.940
 team 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.020
 We ended up losing nobody. 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.690
 accurate flag when only wanting 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.099
 kill and that's what I wanted to show you 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.870
 I told you I hope you 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.969
 have had any doubt whatsoever. 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.560
