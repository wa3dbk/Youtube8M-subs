cover and then what I want you to do is

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.390 
cover and then what I want you to do is
take<00:00:48.020> them<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.500> your<00:00:48.830> side<00:00:49.250> burner<00:00:49.580> and<00:00:50.150> cook

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.790 
take them to your side burner and cook
them<00:00:52.400> over<00:00:53.080> low<00:00:54.080> heat<00:00:54.110> for<00:00:55.210> about<00:00:56.380> 20<00:00:57.380> minutes

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
them over low heat for about 20 minutes

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.920 
them over low heat for about 20 minutes
okay<00:00:58.100> they're<00:00:58.790> gonna<00:00:58.880> come<00:00:59.150> up<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.450> a<00:00:59.480> simmer

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
okay they're gonna come up to a simmer

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.470 
okay they're gonna come up to a simmer
slowly<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:01.640> then<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:01.820> want<00:01:01.970> to<00:01:02.000> watch<00:01:02.210> them

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
slowly and then you want to watch them

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.970 
slowly and then you want to watch them
so<00:01:02.690> they<00:01:02.840> don't<00:01:02.930> cook<00:01:03.170> too<00:01:03.350> quickly<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.830> idea

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
so they don't cook too quickly the idea

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.520 
so they don't cook too quickly the idea
is<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:04.610> want<00:01:04.640> them<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.210> turn<00:01:05.390> golden<00:01:05.780> slowly

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
is you want them to turn golden slowly

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.959 
is you want them to turn golden slowly
and<00:01:06.920> soft<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:13.310> when<00:01:13.399> everything's<00:01:13.700> cooled

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
and soft so when everything's cooled

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.969 
and soft so when everything's cooled
down<00:01:14.240> this<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:14.780> what<00:01:14.960> you've<00:01:15.109> got<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.590> garlic

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979

down this is what you've got the garlic
is<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:16.399> so<00:01:16.729> soft<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.270> could<00:01:17.420> just<00:01:17.630> squash<00:01:18.409> it

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
is is so soft you could just squash it

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.770 
is is so soft you could just squash it

black pepper

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.739 
black pepper
I<00:01:50.889> usually<00:01:51.889> grind<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.729> bunch<00:01:52.969> every<00:01:53.299> few<00:01:53.539> days

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
I usually grind a bunch every few days

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:55.419 
I usually grind a bunch every few days
then<00:01:54.079> I<00:01:54.170> just<00:01:54.350> leave<00:01:54.499> a<00:01:54.530> container<00:01:54.979> out<00:01:55.219> like

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
then I just leave a container out like

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.699 
then I just leave a container out like
this<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.939> it's<00:01:56.090> still<00:01:56.270> got<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.659> lot<00:01:56.959> of<00:01:57.439> punch

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
this and it's still got a lot of punch

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.749 
this and it's still got a lot of punch
to<00:01:58.009> it<00:01:59.709> just<00:02:00.709> turn<00:02:00.920> these<00:02:01.069> over<00:02:01.279> and<00:02:01.520> do<00:02:01.639> the

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
to it just turn these over and do the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.139 
to it just turn these over and do the
other<00:02:01.789> side<00:02:02.859> now<00:02:03.859> rib<00:02:04.069> eyes<00:02:04.219> have<00:02:04.429> so<00:02:04.789> much

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
other side now rib eyes have so much

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.899 
other side now rib eyes have so much
natural<00:02:05.679> marbling<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:06.979> much<00:02:07.130> fat<00:02:07.490> inside

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
natural marbling so much fat inside

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.820 
natural marbling so much fat inside
there<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.270> don't<00:02:08.390> need<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.600> whole<00:02:08.899> lot<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.470> oil

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
there you don't need a whole lot of oil

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.900 
there you don't need a whole lot of oil
actually<00:02:11.800> but<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.890> does<00:02:13.040> taste<00:02:13.280> good

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.550 

so<00:02:17.910> maybe<00:02:18.150> I'll<00:02:18.300> go<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> little<00:02:19.080> bit<00:02:19.290> more

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so maybe I'll go with a little bit more

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.980 
so maybe I'll go with a little bit more
drizzle<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.280> top

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990
