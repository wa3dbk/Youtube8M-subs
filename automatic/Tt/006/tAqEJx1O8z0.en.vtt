corrosives<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:59.130> you're<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.490> use

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
corrosives and then you're going to use

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580 
corrosives and then you're going to use
this<00:01:59.939> shape<00:02:00.210> which<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> ranks<00:02:01.380> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this shape which is in the ranks you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.280 
this shape which is in the ranks you
don't<00:02:01.950> want<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.159> use<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.490> there's<00:02:02.759> another

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
don't want to use the there's another

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.539 
don't want to use the there's another
rectangle<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.619> lot<00:02:04.770> fatter<00:02:05.070> which<00:02:05.430> is

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
rectangle but it's a lot fatter which is

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.280 
rectangle but it's a lot fatter which is
probably<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:06.000> Paul<00:02:06.210> used<00:02:06.479> which<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.899> why<00:02:07.020> his

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
probably what Paul used which is why his

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.589 
probably what Paul used which is why his
looks<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:07.920> chubbier<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:09.090> there's

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
looks a little chubbier like there's

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.119 
looks a little chubbier like there's
gonna<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:09.899> tons<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.170> dick<00:02:10.349> jokes<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:11.039> are

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
gonna be tons of dick jokes that are

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.500 
gonna be tons of dick jokes that are
going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.280> come

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
going to come

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.850 
going to come
out<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.659> this<00:02:11.750> with<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.989> shape<00:02:12.200> make<00:02:12.560> names

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
out of this with the shape make names

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.949 
out of this with the shape make names
I'm<00:02:13.159> saying<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.610> all<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.909> bullshit<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:14.569> it

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
I'm saying and all this bullshit but it

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.229 
I'm saying and all this bullshit but it
is<00:02:15.110> what<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.379> is<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:17.030> these<00:02:17.180> three

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
is what it is so you have these three

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.929 
is what it is so you have these three
lines<00:02:17.629> on<00:02:17.840> top<00:02:18.079> all<00:02:19.010> right<00:02:19.159> and<00:02:19.370> then<00:02:19.819> you're

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
lines on top all right and then you're

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.699 
lines on top all right and then you're
going<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.120> put<00:02:20.269> this<00:02:20.450> line<00:02:20.840> right<00:02:21.110> here<00:02:21.170> to

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
going to put this line right here to

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.369 
going to put this line right here to
make<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.010> connection<00:02:22.489> right<00:02:23.299> there<00:02:23.360> now<00:02:24.140> this

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
make the connection right there now this

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.530 
make the connection right there now this
part<00:02:24.650> right<00:02:24.799> here<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:25.280> added<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:26.180> make<00:02:26.390> the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
part right here I added to make the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.300 
part right here I added to make the
curve<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:27.079> the<00:02:27.200> O<00:02:27.230> go<00:02:27.590> down<00:02:27.799> you'll<00:02:28.040> see<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
curve of the O go down you'll see the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.649 
curve of the O go down you'll see the
other<00:02:28.430> one<00:02:28.610> it's<00:02:28.760> further<00:02:29.030> down<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.480> line

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
other one it's further down in the line

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.270 
other one it's further down in the line
because<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.079> is<00:02:30.260> like<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> late<00:02:30.769> minute

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
because this is like a late minute

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.330 
because this is like a late minute
change<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.299> add<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.140> logo<00:02:33.470> then<00:02:34.250> we

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
change of I add it to the logo then we

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.220 
change of I add it to the logo then we
go<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.610> green<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.930> case<00:02:36.110> you're

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
go to the green and in case you're

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.360 
go to the green and in case you're
wondering<00:02:36.319> what<00:02:36.950> green<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.549> am<00:02:37.790> using<00:02:38.030> here<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
wondering what green I am using here the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.750 
wondering what green I am using here the
green<00:02:40.579> I'm<00:02:40.730> using<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.329> this<00:02:41.840> one<00:02:41.900> right<00:02:42.560> here

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
green I'm using is this one right here

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.300 
green I'm using is this one right here
it's<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:44.030> fourth<00:02:44.299> row<00:02:44.510> third<00:02:44.959> green<00:02:45.349> down<00:02:45.739> so

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
it's the fourth row third green down so

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.039 
it's the fourth row third green down so
that's<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.640> OP<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.940> green<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.480> think<00:02:47.810> best

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
that's the OP to green that I think best

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.690 
that's the OP to green that I think best
resembles<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.680> green<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:49.040> use<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.549> can<00:02:49.670> use

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
resembles the green we use you can use

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.339 
resembles the green we use you can use
any<00:02:50.000> kinds<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.389> combinations<00:02:50.629> once<00:02:51.109> you<00:02:51.230> have

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
any kinds of combinations once you have

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.589 
any kinds of combinations once you have
the<00:02:51.470> structure<00:02:51.709> lined<00:02:52.129> up<00:02:52.340> which<00:02:53.299> would<00:02:53.450> look

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
the structure lined up which would look

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.470 
the structure lined up which would look
pretty<00:02:53.870> cool<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.650> would<00:02:55.129> imagine<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.329> have

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
pretty cool I would imagine so you have

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.690 
pretty cool I would imagine so you have
that<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:57.590> you're<00:02:57.739> just<00:02:57.859> making<00:02:58.069> this<00:02:58.310> bottom

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
that so you're just making this bottom

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.089 
that so you're just making this bottom
line<00:02:58.879> you're<00:02:59.209> gonna<00:02:59.299> have<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.540> stack<00:02:59.810> these

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
line you're gonna have to stack these

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.000 
line you're gonna have to stack these
okay<00:03:01.099> so<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.000> got<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.389> just<00:03:03.260> carve<00:03:03.769> them<00:03:03.920> up

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
okay so you got that just carve them up

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.490 
okay so you got that just carve them up
same<00:03:04.430> shape<00:03:04.730> curve<00:03:05.239> them<00:03:05.450> up<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:05.900> then<00:03:06.409> you

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
same shape curve them up and then you

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.379 
same shape curve them up and then you
start<00:03:06.739> up<00:03:06.889> top<00:03:07.040> remember<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.609> make<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.060> top

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
start up top remember to make the top

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.110 
start up top remember to make the top
part<00:03:08.420> go<00:03:09.019> underneath<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.859> O<00:03:09.889> and<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.340> bottom

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
part go underneath the O and the bottom

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.330 
part go underneath the O and the bottom
part<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.510> G<00:03:11.690> go<00:03:11.840> above<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.560> o<00:03:12.590> that's

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
part of the G go above the o that's

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.069 
part of the G go above the o that's
important<00:03:13.819> as<00:03:13.940> well<00:03:13.970> some<00:03:14.450> people<00:03:14.569> don't<00:03:14.900> do

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
important as well some people don't do

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.770 
important as well some people don't do
that<00:03:15.200> they<00:03:15.379> forget<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.709> do<00:03:15.919> it<00:03:16.389> or<00:03:17.389> they<00:03:17.629> do<00:03:17.690> it

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
that they forget to do it or they do it

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.309 
that they forget to do it or they do it
wrong<00:03:18.379> that<00:03:18.440> may<00:03:19.010> be<00:03:19.069> flip<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:20.290> then<00:03:21.290> you

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
wrong that may be flip it so then you

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.319 
wrong that may be flip it so then you
just<00:03:21.440> have<00:03:21.650> these<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:22.790> have<00:03:22.910> this<00:03:23.060> piece

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
just have these and you have this piece

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.300 
just have these and you have this piece
right<00:03:23.540> here<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:23.780> made<00:03:24.019> it<00:03:24.139> nice<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.530> big<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:25.069> it

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
right here I made it nice and big and it

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.680 
right here I made it nice and big and it
actually<00:03:25.459> worked<00:03:25.849> out<00:03:26.030> really<00:03:26.239> well<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.510> it

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
actually worked out really well and it

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.930 
actually worked out really well and it
curved<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.139> at<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.349> right<00:03:27.470> angle<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.819> was

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
curved it at the right angle and it was

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.270 
curved it at the right angle and it was
able<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.299> fit<00:03:29.900> in<00:03:30.019> perfectly<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.769> make<00:03:31.129> that

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
able to fit in perfectly and make that

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.270 
able to fit in perfectly and make that
curve<00:03:31.639> just<00:03:32.480> perfect<00:03:33.470> admit<00:03:33.769> was<00:03:33.949> really

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
curve just perfect admit was really

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.580 
curve just perfect admit was really
simple<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.669> do<00:03:34.819> then<00:03:35.569> I<00:03:35.599> just<00:03:35.810> went<00:03:35.989> over<00:03:36.139> here

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
simple to do then I just went over here

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.409 
simple to do then I just went over here
now<00:03:37.040> when<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.370> go<00:03:37.519> back<00:03:37.760> you're<00:03:38.060> going<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.269> see

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
now when you go back you're going to see

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:39.369 
now when you go back you're going to see
it's<00:03:38.599> going<00:03:38.629> to<00:03:38.750> look<00:03:38.900> perfect<00:03:39.230> here

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
it's going to look perfect here

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.900 
it's going to look perfect here
sometimes<00:03:39.799> but<00:03:40.129> then<00:03:40.250> when<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.519> go<00:03:40.699> out<00:03:40.879> check

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
sometimes but then when you go out check

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.240 
sometimes but then when you go out check
when<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:41.900> go<00:03:42.019> into<00:03:42.169> like<00:03:42.379> your<00:03:42.650> pregame<00:03:42.919> hobby

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
when you go into like your pregame hobby

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.830 
when you go into like your pregame hobby
and<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.489> hit<00:03:44.090> -<00:03:44.209> you're<00:03:44.329> right<00:03:44.449> where<00:03:44.629> I<00:03:44.660> was

demonstrating for you guys the the other
logos<00:03:47.060> you'll<00:03:47.959> see<00:03:48.199> parts<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:48.769> pieces<00:03:48.919> might

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
logos you'll see parts and pieces might

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.189 
logos you'll see parts and pieces might
not<00:03:49.519> be<00:03:49.639> lined<00:03:50.209> up<00:03:50.419> right<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.900> might<00:03:51.019> be

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
not be lined up right you might be

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.629 
not be lined up right you might be
missing<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.620> chunk<00:03:51.829> or<00:03:52.099> a<00:03:52.129> part<00:03:52.459> might<00:03:52.609> be

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
missing a chunk or a part might be

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.309 
missing a chunk or a part might be
raised<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.359> it<00:03:53.540> might<00:03:53.629> look<00:03:53.690> different<00:03:53.959> in

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
raised so it might look different in

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.259 
raised so it might look different in
your<00:03:54.440> editor<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.549> might<00:03:55.730> not<00:03:55.760> look<00:03:56.060> right

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
your editor and it might not look right

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.240 
your editor and it might not look right
in<00:03:56.480> your<00:03:56.569> editor<00:03:56.900> but<00:03:57.590> on<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.799> screen<00:03:58.010> it's

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
in your editor but on the screen it's

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.530 
in your editor but on the screen it's
right<00:03:58.400> because<00:03:58.639> that's<00:03:58.970> where<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.269> want<00:03:59.480> it

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
right because that's where you want it

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.339 
right because that's where you want it
because<00:03:59.629> that's<00:03:59.750> where<00:03:59.930> everybody's<00:04:00.230> going

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
because that's where everybody's going

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.140 
because that's where everybody's going
to<00:04:00.379> see<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.680> now<00:04:01.340> we<00:04:01.459> have<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.699> curve<00:04:01.909> right

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
to see it now we have the curve right

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.430 
to see it now we have the curve right
here<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:03.199> make<00:04:03.349> that<00:04:03.530> looking<00:04:03.889> right<00:04:05.440> right

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
here to make that looking right right

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.469 
here to make that looking right right
chair<00:04:06.919> that<00:04:07.489> goes<00:04:07.639> underneath<00:04:07.940> remember

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:08.479 
chair that goes underneath remember

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.530 
chair that goes underneath remember
underneath<00:04:09.430> then<00:04:10.430> we<00:04:10.519> got<00:04:10.669> this<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.269> curves

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
underneath then we got this the curves

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.500 
underneath then we got this the curves
for<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.989> G

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
for the G

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.170 
for the G
little<00:04:13.780> more<00:04:14.110> of<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.290> curve<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:15.489> it's<00:04:16.000> just

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
little more of a curve and it's just

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.509 
little more of a curve and it's just
kind<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:16.840> just<00:04:16.989> adjusting<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.769> getting<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.489> to

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
kind of just adjusting and getting it to

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.039 
kind of just adjusting and getting it to
fit<00:04:18.729> right<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.239> see<00:04:19.419> this<00:04:19.690> little<00:04:19.840> piece

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
fit right and see this little piece

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.409 
fit right and see this little piece
right<00:04:20.199> here<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.709> had<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.160> little<00:04:21.400> chunk<00:04:21.820> hanging

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
right here I had a little chunk hanging

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.510 
right here I had a little chunk hanging
out<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.960> didn't<00:04:23.620> appear<00:04:23.860> on<00:04:23.949> the<00:04:24.040> editor<00:04:24.310> but

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
out that didn't appear on the editor but

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.340 
out that didn't appear on the editor but
it<00:04:24.580> appeared<00:04:24.850> on<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.090> other<00:04:25.240> thing<00:04:25.479> and<00:04:26.139> there

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
it appeared on the other thing and there

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.629 
it appeared on the other thing and there
you<00:04:26.440> go<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:26.830> these<00:04:26.979> are<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.190> pieces<00:04:27.520> you're

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
you go so these are the pieces you're

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.490 
you go so these are the pieces you're
going<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.850> use<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.750> might<00:04:28.990> actually<00:04:29.199> find

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
going to use so you might actually find

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.960 
going to use so you might actually find
out<00:04:29.710> an<00:04:29.830> easier<00:04:30.130> way<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:30.639> don't<00:04:30.790> have<00:04:30.850> to

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
out an easier way that you don't have to

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.700 
out an easier way that you don't have to
use<00:04:31.060> all<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.330> layers<00:04:31.540> but<00:04:32.320> those<00:04:32.500> are<00:04:32.680> the

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
use all the layers but those are the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.230 
use all the layers but those are the
three<00:04:32.949> pieces<00:04:33.250> you're<00:04:33.490> going<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.699> use<00:04:33.940> you're

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
three pieces you're going to use you're

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.750 
three pieces you're going to use you're
going<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.419> use<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.810> curve<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.979> ranks<00:04:36.370> emblem

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
going to use the curve the ranks emblem

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.570 
going to use the curve the ranks emblem
and<00:04:36.970> then<00:04:37.720> this<00:04:37.900> guy<00:04:38.139> which<00:04:38.919> isn't<00:04:39.100> tools<00:04:39.400> as
