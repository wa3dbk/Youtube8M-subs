you<00:00:19.289> guys<00:00:19.410> have<00:00:19.560> probably<00:00:19.680> already<00:00:20.010> seen<00:00:20.130> this

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
you guys have probably already seen this

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
you guys have probably already seen this
from<00:00:20.550> Computex<00:00:21.090> footage<00:00:21.420> from<00:00:21.630> other<00:00:21.869> sites

from Computex footage from other sites

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.630 
from Computex footage from other sites
but<00:00:22.500> they<00:00:22.590> took<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.859> user<00:00:23.010> feedback<00:00:23.220> in

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
options stuff like that so the first

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.410 
options stuff like that so the first
thing<00:00:28.710> you'll<00:00:28.830> notice<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.880> lining

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
thing you'll notice is that this lining

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.550 
thing you'll notice is that this lining
around<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> outside<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> aluminum

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
around the outside of the aluminum

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
around the outside of the aluminum
paneling<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.040> quite<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.309> bit<00:00:32.460> thinner<00:00:32.850> they

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
paneling is quite a bit thinner they

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.910 
paneling is quite a bit thinner they
reduced<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.989> lot<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.290> cost<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> lot<00:00:34.890> of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
reduced a lot of cost there and a lot of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
reduced a lot of cost there and a lot of
weight<00:00:35.309> who's<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:35.820> heavy<00:00:36.030> case<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.570> well

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
weight who's a really heavy case as well

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.709 
weight who's a really heavy case as well
now<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.649> jump<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> inside<00:00:38.700> you'll<00:00:39.660> see

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
now if we jump on the inside you'll see

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
now if we jump on the inside you'll see
that<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> hard<00:00:40.590> drive<00:00:40.649> cages<00:00:41.219> are<00:00:41.370> now<00:00:41.489> in

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
that the hard drive cages are now in

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.729 
that the hard drive cages are now in
three<00:00:42.030> separate<00:00:42.540> sections<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.620> can

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
three separate sections so you can

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
three separate sections so you can
actually<00:00:43.980> remove<00:00:44.280> them<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> top<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
actually remove them the top one is to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.850 
actually remove them the top one is to
the<00:00:45.629> bottom<00:00:45.930> two<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.230> both<00:00:46.350> three<00:00:46.680> hard

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the bottom two are both three hard

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.799 
the bottom two are both three hard
drives<00:00:46.950> individually<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.120> remove<00:00:48.450> them

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
drives individually you can remove them

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.569 
drives individually you can remove them
you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.230> add<00:00:49.350> radiators<00:00:49.860> or<00:00:49.890> fans<00:00:50.219> where<00:00:50.489> they

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you can add radiators or fans where they

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.610 
you can add radiators or fans where they
once<00:00:50.789> were<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.170> move<00:00:52.410> them

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
once were or you can just move them

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
once were or you can just move them
around<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.039> case<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.399> customize<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> layout

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
around the case to customize the layout

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.670 
around the case to customize the layout
yourself<00:00:54.629> however<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.050> actually<00:00:55.350> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> go

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
yourself however you actually want to go

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.650 
yourself however you actually want to go
about<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.129> they've<00:00:56.579> also<00:00:56.850> done<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> little

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
about that they've also done a little

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 
about that they've also done a little
bit<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.930> cost<00:00:58.710> savings<00:00:59.129> inside<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> case<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
bit of cost savings inside the case so a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
bit of cost savings inside the case so a
little<00:01:00.390> bit<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.570> thick<00:01:00.870> thinner<00:01:01.140> metal<00:01:01.440> inside

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
little bit of thick thinner metal inside

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.779 
little bit of thick thinner metal inside
the<00:01:01.859> case<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.129> well<00:01:02.309> which<00:01:02.460> will<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.640> passed

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the case as well which will be passed

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.100 
the case as well which will be passed
down<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.480> should<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.719> cheaper

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
down to you so it should be a cheaper

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.310 
down to you so it should be a cheaper
lighter<00:01:04.680> case<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.250> those<00:01:05.430> aspects<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.320> also
