00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 We need to show the power we have 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.870
 less today, guys, we have to choose the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.220
 fair topic so that none of the girls 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.080
 well then you have to compose a 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.630
 new song something specific for this 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.000
 exercise something that represents us that 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.609
 it says to me it seems a good idea to me 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.529
 I love girls but please do not 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.180
 we'll get to bring it into line 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.670
 to compose a theme from the date of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.240
 presentation that's true we do not have 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.820
 long time 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.340
 well then you have to do the song 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.869
 that we were really writing 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.960
 I have a new version that I made of a 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.960
 theme that can teach us the subject 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.480
 to enjoy everything is ready 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.250
 and let yourself go 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.409
 s 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.760
 feeling feelings 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.760
 full of emotion 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.000
 who causes me this song hey my 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.180
 heart 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.440
 how it accelerates when the public 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.500
 waiting 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.800
 nothing my dad 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.470
 it is equal you take it off begins the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:31.800
 function the lights 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:34.370
 is music will be the key applause 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.370
 hundred 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 is 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.000
 the party starts 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.000
 d 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.570
 I think that this works represents us 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.900
 as a group, it seems great to me 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.820
 I could perfect street or laburo 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.310
 Well, Diego, I think it's the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.050
 theme that best represents us 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.790
 If you do not like it, you can propose another one 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.790
 guys I vote in this contest 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.550
 and this is a team competition 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.260
 and we have to be all together to 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.599
 be able to win them to the males ok yes 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.230
 neither for so much 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.230
 if it was not the idea
