00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.070
 when our onion is transparent 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.200
 and peppers chins or 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:52.810
 soft peppers let's add 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.810
 our garlic I run or our dog 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.620
 let's mix a good time 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.660
 and then we will add the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 chopped mushrooms 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.460
 we mix another couple of minutes 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.950
 and we put a little salt to go 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.950
 giving flavor and fair 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.230
 then mix for 10 minutes 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.930
 and we proceed to cover 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.360
 then add the zucchini and 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.100
 chopped carrots and mix in 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.370
 enveloping form so that we do not leave 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.370
 lets vote 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.050
 after that we are going to cover again 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.050
 for a few more minutes 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.070
 After the minutes we will place the 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.930
 chopped tomatoes 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.320
 and we mix again in 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.320
 envelope 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.600
 after a while covered 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.369
 we see that it has exhausted its juice 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.289
 We'll let the vegetables 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.610
 dressings are cooked in their juices for about 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.420
 5 minutes 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.160
 we adjust the salt again 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.459
 we have always maintained the fire 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.540
 medium-high in all the preparation 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.540
 we mix in an enveloping way 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.989
 here we made the chicken breasts with a 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.430
 little garlic onion porro and ample let's go 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.430
 to crumble it with two cutlery 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.630
 and when they're ready, we're going to 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.990
 add to our dressings and vegetables 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.900
 that we already had cooked 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.930
 that are on fire 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.599
 add the shredded breasts and 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.060
 let's mix in an enveloping way 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.250
 also so that it goes uniting what 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.239
 is below with the above and go 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.239
 mixing the flavors 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.189
 after we mix very well 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.480
 let's add our coloring 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.569
 yellow that this is optional if you do not 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.890
 like no problem do not put it on and 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.890
 we are going to add the pepper 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.640
 let's mix again so 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.640
 envelope 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.250
 we leave it a couple of minutes mixing 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.760
 meanwhile we are mixing until 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:46.040
 let's see that your juice will have consumed a 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.040
 little let's try the salt as it is 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.840
 and if necessary we adjust again 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.840
 the salt this is the moment 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.580
 after a couple of minutes of cooking 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.430
 turn off and reserve 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.909
 now we are going to 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.219
 with the dough we will grab a mold and 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.670
 we are going to put it together with a little oil 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.670
 and flour 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.329
 and then unrolled extended to the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.329
 dough 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.790
 we are going to make the mold with the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.790
 flour 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.100
 there are people who prefer to put 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.490
 butter no problem as you 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.490
 like 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.600
 Now we place the mold on the dough and 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.600
 we turn around 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.640
 and we started to shape the mass of 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.340
 the same faith that sticks in the mold 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.949
 It is worth sticking to the mold 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.510
 without leaving any gap or bubble nor 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.780
 nothing will start to take off the 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.780
 paper 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.030
 very carefully that we are not going to 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.740
 come the dough 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.660
 and what we are completely be 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.140
 some opening or something we cover it with 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.140
 the little fingers 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.169
 Now let's remove excess 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.099
 or the leftover mass 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.099
 with a knife 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.750
 I am using a mass that is 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.790
 flame mass breeze that you get in the 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.010
 supermarkets here in Spain 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.910
 we prick it with a fork so it does not 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.870
 we are going to Bombara in the oven 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.150
 you can also put some chickpeas 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.580
 so that you do not like what I'm gonna do 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:52.440
 so you do not get up and take it 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.440
 Baked for about 15 minutes 10 minutes 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:02.579
 the pre cook and take it out of the oven 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:04.889
 after 10 minutes and we're going to 

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:07.169
 add our prepared chicken the 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.509
 let's fill with this delicious 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.509
 chicken prepared in this way 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.790
 until all is well covered until 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.790
 above 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.050
 then we are going to extend the second 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:24.750
 package of mass breeze 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.420
 thus 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.190
 and we proceed to 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.190
 and remove the tissue paper 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.670
 and has already removed the plant paper 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.420
 We cut by the knife again 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.220
 everything we have left over, do not go bouncing 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.520
 mass and will be used for 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.520
 decor 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.379
 and so you should stay 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.990
 the cake being raw 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.930
 with a rolling pin we are going to stretch the dough 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.949
 that has left us 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:07.810
 and we're going to make eight strips of 1 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:07.810
 centimeter for our decoration 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.020
 We are going to weave the strips so that 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.090
 we stay like this and decorate it 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.729
 with rositas corazoncitos as more you 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:24.240
 like we take it to the oven for 35 to 40 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:26.220
 minutes when golden brown and the 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.990
 I remove and so we have not left him 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.020
 put egg above because I do not 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.440
 like but you can add egg 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:37.669
 that's how our piece of cake looks 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:41.009
