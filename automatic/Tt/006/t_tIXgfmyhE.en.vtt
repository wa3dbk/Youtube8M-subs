 g code in c cup and Dyson Goal 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:40.239
 The code used for this song is also g code c 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:42.340
 Curve d7 composition and 1 minor code 2 - and 5 things like this 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.110
 I will be born again. 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.050
 First, what did you all 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:53.050
 If you move under 1 2 cracks in offense a cup you will not lose 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 U 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:03.600
 The south code c code is the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.070
 1 2 After moving down 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.070
 It is a relaxed code. 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.940
 And d7 nose off this wind 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.480
 That's the case that this bondage hit in three pounds. 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.540
 Now I can play dsm code 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.540
 Yes 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.010

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.020
 Next a-bell 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.610
 Off l 3 l In this code 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.610
 If this spoon is subtracted , it becomes a minor code 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.610
 U 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.170
 Then 1-2-all 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:57.510
 It was not obesity that I caught in the code . 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:02.640
 b Minor code to move up one fret will result in 7 miles of code 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:10.350
 If the behavior of the 12 closed-up again in simayi records 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:14.280
 b When the minor chord and moving over from one wish d Maybach 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.770
 This will be an e-minor code 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.770
 I'll try playing some of my sins. 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:47.209
