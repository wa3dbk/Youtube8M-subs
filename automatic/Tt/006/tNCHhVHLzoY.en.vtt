00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
plain it looked too fake all that so um

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.170 
plain it looked too fake all that so um
I<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.790> gonna<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.210> these<00:00:36.829> silver<00:00:37.829> parts<00:00:38.190> no

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
I was gonna have these silver parts no

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.750 
I was gonna have these silver parts no
matter<00:00:39.390> what<00:00:39.649> but<00:00:40.649> adding<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.550> like

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
matter what but adding all this like

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.840 
matter what but adding all this like
black<00:00:42.149> dirt<00:00:42.750> grime<00:00:43.260> looking<00:00:43.739> stuff<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.399> later

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
black dirt grime looking stuff was later

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.209 
black dirt grime looking stuff was later
and<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> think<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.450> looks<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.719> lot<00:00:45.960> better<00:00:46.020> now<00:00:46.579> so

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
and I think it looks a lot better now so

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
and I think it looks a lot better now so
it<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.280> looks<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:51.050> worn<00:00:52.050> down<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.320> stuff

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it just looks really worn down and stuff

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
it just looks really worn down and stuff
I<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.730> how<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> looks

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
I I really like how it looks

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.500 
I I really like how it looks
um<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:55.410> know<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:57.710> only<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.829> could<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.219> done<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
um to know I only I could have done a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.569 
um to know I only I could have done a
bit<00:01:00.510> better<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> job<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.890> mean<00:01:02.370> maybe

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
bit better of a job but I mean maybe

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
bit better of a job but I mean maybe
like<00:01:02.850> maybe<00:01:03.570> cleaner<00:01:03.960> lines<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> whatnot<00:01:04.890> but

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
like maybe cleaner lines and whatnot but

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.620 
like maybe cleaner lines and whatnot but
it<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.430> first<00:01:05.610> time<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.090> ever<00:01:06.180> doing

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it was my first time really ever doing

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.030 
it was my first time really ever doing
some<00:01:06.840> serious<00:01:07.200> painting<00:01:08.330> but<00:01:09.330> um<00:01:09.860> first<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
some serious painting but um first I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.390 
some serious painting but um first I
primed<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.869> silver

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
primed it and then I put this silver

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
primed it and then I put this silver
which<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.909> looks<00:01:15.090> gold<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.810> it's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
which it kind of looks gold but it's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.480 
which it kind of looks gold but it's
silver<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> read<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.570> um<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:19.340> put<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
silver you have to read it um I put that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.510 
silver you have to read it um I put that
and<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.180> put<00:01:21.900> vaseline<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.250> parts

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and then I put vaseline on the parts

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.719 
and then I put vaseline on the parts
that<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> wanted<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:25.229> silver<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.890> then

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
that I wanted to be silver and then

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.840 
that I wanted to be silver and then
painted<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> green<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:29.310> green<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.759> then

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
painted it green that green and then

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.539 
painted it green that green and then
painted<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> black<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.590> parts<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.009> had<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.369> I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
painted it black on the parts I had to I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.770 
painted it black on the parts I had to I
used<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.030> painters<00:01:33.509> tape<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:36.450> worked<00:01:36.630> out

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
used a painters tape and it worked out

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840 
used a painters tape and it worked out
pretty<00:01:36.930> good<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.250> don't<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> really

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
pretty good so I don't think I really

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
pretty good so I don't think I really
could<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.030> done<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> better<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.990> job<00:01:40.020> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
could have done that better of a job I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.760 
could have done that better of a job I
think<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.799> turned<00:01:40.950> out<00:01:41.070> pretty<00:01:41.130> well<00:01:41.720> um<00:01:42.770> I

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
think this turned out pretty well um I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.710 
think this turned out pretty well um I
still<00:01:44.220> got<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> put<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> visor<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.060> padding

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
still got to put the visor and padding

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.120 
still got to put the visor and padding
and<00:01:45.899> I'm<00:01:46.079> pretty<00:01:46.320> sure<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.590> gonna<00:01:46.710> put<00:01:46.890> lights

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna put lights

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.450 
and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna put lights
in<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.979> should<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.250> pretty

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
in right here so that should be pretty

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.899 
in right here so that should be pretty
cool<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.649> that's<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.430> hope<00:01:53.790> you
