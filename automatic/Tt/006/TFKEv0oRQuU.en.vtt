00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
what we have accomplished we started out

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:56.790 
what we have accomplished we started out
with<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.140> rendering

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.850 

and<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:59.600> owner<00:00:59.840> authorized<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.500> rendering

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
and the owner authorized the rendering

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.229 
and the owner authorized the rendering
and<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.039> that's<00:01:01.219> what<00:01:01.370> we<00:01:01.460> decided<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:02.030> build

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
and so that's what we decided to build

actually install that engine into a
early<00:01:32.090> Ford<00:01:32.450> chassis<00:01:32.750> well<00:01:33.080> you<00:01:33.259> need<00:01:33.409> to

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
early Ford chassis well you need to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.100 
early Ford chassis well you need to
start<00:01:33.770> out<00:01:33.979> with<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.819> wide<00:01:35.119> frame<00:01:35.539> Ford<00:01:35.960> had

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
start out with the wide frame Ford had

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.450 
start out with the wide frame Ford had
two<00:01:36.289> versions<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:36.920> frame<00:01:37.130> they<00:01:37.310> had<00:01:37.429> a

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
two versions of the frame they had a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.100 
two versions of the frame they had a
narrow<00:01:37.759> frame<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.360> then<00:01:38.630> they<00:01:38.750> had<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:38.899> wide

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
narrow frame and then they had a wide

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.590 
narrow frame and then they had a wide
frame<00:01:39.440> you're<00:01:39.830> going<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:40.100> have<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.729> start<00:01:41.450> out

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.620 
frame you're going to have to start out
with<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.810> wide<00:01:42.110> frame<00:01:43.179> because<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.210> power

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
with a wide frame because the power

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.820 
with a wide frame because the power
stroke<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.409> very<00:01:45.830> big<00:01:46.250> engine<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.869> wide

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
stroke is a very big engine so wide

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.850 
stroke is a very big engine so wide

need<00:01:52.009> two<00:01:52.130> outboard<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:53.000> steering<00:01:53.390> box<00:01:53.600> now

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
need two outboard the steering box now

Ford<00:01:54.530> power<00:01:54.770> steering<00:01:55.220> absolute<00:01:55.759> was

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
Ford power steering absolute was

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.300 
Ford power steering absolute was
terrible<00:01:56.299> on<00:01:56.420> these<00:01:56.569> old<00:01:56.780> trucks<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.950> didn't

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
terrible on these old trucks so I didn't

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.680 
terrible on these old trucks so I didn't
think<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:58.520> was<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.880> big<00:01:59.330> of<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.509> deal

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
think that was that big of a deal

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.050 
think that was that big of a deal
because<00:02:00.110> we<00:02:00.319> were<00:02:00.470> able<00:02:00.739> to<00:02:00.770> install<00:02:01.759> and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
because we were able to install and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.510 
because we were able to install and
mount<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.479> Chevy<00:02:03.110> style<00:02:03.530> steering<00:02:04.009> box<00:02:04.220> that

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
mount a Chevy style steering box that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.330 
mount a Chevy style steering box that
was<00:02:04.640> outboard<00:02:05.239> then<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:06.319> went<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.800> did<00:02:07.099> a

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
was outboard then we went and did a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.059

able to do because we have the cab off
of<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.370> chassis<00:03:01.819> I<00:03:01.849> thought<00:03:02.060> it'd<00:03:02.180> be<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.300> great

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
of the chassis I thought it'd be a great

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.559 
of the chassis I thought it'd be a great
time<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.319> give<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.620> guys<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:04.220> guided<00:03:05.180> tour<00:03:05.210> of

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.730 
is a f-350 four-wheel drive so how do
you<00:03:28.860> then<00:03:29.580> get<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.940> transfer<00:03:30.420> case<00:03:30.600> well<00:03:31.050> if<00:03:31.530> you

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
you then get a transfer case well if you

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.160

also utilized hydro boost now this is

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.800 
also utilized hydro boost now this is
really<00:06:05.819> really<00:06:05.940> common<00:06:06.240> when<00:06:06.539> you<00:06:06.629> have<00:06:06.780> a

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
really really common when you have a

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.409 
really really common when you have a
turbocharger<00:06:07.699> you<00:06:08.699> don't<00:06:08.879> have<00:06:09.000> vacuum

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.959 
turbocharger you don't have vacuum
brakes<00:06:09.690> and<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.050> reason<00:06:10.409> why<00:06:10.530> is<00:06:10.949> that<00:06:11.009> they

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
brakes and the reason why is that they

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.610 
brakes and the reason why is that they
produce<00:06:12.180> boost<00:06:12.599> they<00:06:12.870> don't<00:06:13.050> have<00:06:13.229> engine

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
produce boost they don't have engine

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.600 
produce boost they don't have engine
vacuum<00:06:13.979> they<00:06:14.159> have<00:06:14.370> boost<00:06:14.639> so<00:06:14.930> we<00:06:15.930> had<00:06:16.199> to

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
vacuum they have boost so we had to

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.519 
vacuum they have boost so we had to
fabricate<00:06:17.610> a<00:06:18.180> couple<00:06:18.810> of<00:06:18.900> spacers<00:06:19.289> and<00:06:19.500> a

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:19.529 
fabricate a couple of spacers and a

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:20.899 
fabricate a couple of spacers and a
couple<00:06:19.800> mounting<00:06:20.129> brackets<00:06:20.490> you<00:06:20.610> can<00:06:20.639> see

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
couple mounting brackets you can see

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:22.429 
couple mounting brackets you can see
this<00:06:21.120> is<00:06:21.300> kind<00:06:21.509> of<00:06:21.569> just<00:06:21.870> for<00:06:21.960> mock-up

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:22.439 
this is kind of just for mock-up

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:24.110 
this is kind of just for mock-up
purposes<00:06:22.949> only<00:06:23.099> this<00:06:23.460> stuff<00:06:23.639> will<00:06:23.759> all<00:06:23.909> get

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
purposes only this stuff will all get

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.749 
purposes only this stuff will all get
cleaned<00:06:24.419> up<00:06:24.599> it'll<00:06:25.229> get<00:06:25.349> boxed<00:06:25.800> in<00:06:25.949> so<00:06:26.190> that<00:06:26.639> it

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
cleaned up it'll get boxed in so that it
