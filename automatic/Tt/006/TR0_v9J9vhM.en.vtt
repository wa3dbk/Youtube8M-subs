mint<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.059> little<00:00:42.239> trick<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.290> could<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
mint a little trick that it could do I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
mint a little trick that it could do I
suppose<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.489> don't<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.149> watch<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.450> of

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
suppose you don't have to watch out of

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.819 
suppose you don't have to watch out of
here<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.899> windows<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.649> pretty

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
here and windows because it's pretty

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.200 
here and windows because it's pretty
useless<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.550> can't<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.000> trick

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
useless because you can't do this trick

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.299 
useless because you can't do this trick
but<00:00:48.690> anyway<00:00:48.960> basically<00:00:49.469> stacks<00:00:50.039> you'll

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
but anyway basically stacks you'll

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.270 
but anyway basically stacks you'll
notice<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.969> stack<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.809> default<00:00:52.410> image

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
notice that in a stack the default image

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400 
notice that in a stack the default image
is<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> walnuts<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.449> front<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
is the walnuts on the front or on the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.189 
is the walnuts on the front or on the
top<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.550> list<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.510> example<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:58.140> one

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
top of the list so for example this one

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.720 
top of the list so for example this one
is<00:00:58.559> enough<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:58.859> vertical<00:00:59.280> order<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.750> bee<00:01:00.750> bee

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
is enough for vertical order a bee bee

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.359 
is enough for vertical order a bee bee
ccc<00:01:02.730> etc<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.570> down<00:01:03.750> right<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
ccc etc all the way down right so the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.270 
ccc etc all the way down right so the
first<00:01:05.549> one<00:01:05.850> after<00:01:06.360> effects<00:01:06.600> stuff<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.560> first

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
first one after effects stuff is first

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100 
first one after effects stuff is first
in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> list<00:01:08.700> therefore<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.780> front<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
in the list therefore it's the front of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.140 
in the list therefore it's the front of
the<00:01:10.200> stack<00:01:10.500> okay<00:01:11.689> now<00:01:12.689> let's<00:01:13.220> see<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.850> didn't

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the stack okay now let's see we didn't

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.130 
the stack okay now let's see we didn't
want<00:01:15.470> after<00:01:16.470> effects<00:01:16.710> area<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.659> another

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
want after effects area to be if another

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.640 
want after effects area to be if another

at<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> front<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> bit<00:01:50.670> crap<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.750> be

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
at the front and it's a bit crap to be

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.590 
at the front and it's a bit crap to be
honest<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.100> best<00:01:53.369> way<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.149> put<00:01:54.390> an

image at the front but it's probably the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.999 
image at the front but it's probably the
best<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.540> thought<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.200> came<00:01:58.740> across

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
best we have thought of or came across

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
seen I've opened the documents

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.250 
seen I've opened the documents
to<00:02:13.480> find<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.920> documents<00:02:15.430> stuck<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:17.110> do<00:02:17.170> i

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
to find the documents stuck so what do i

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.050 
to find the documents stuck so what do i
do<00:02:17.320> I<00:02:17.620> create<00:02:18.070> new<00:02:18.250> folder<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.820> want<00:02:19.000> to

do I create new folder and I want to

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.810 
do I create new folder and I want to
call<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.240> ah<00:02:19.830> why<00:02:20.830> because<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
call it ah why because it is the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.980 
call it ah why because it is the
first-ever<00:02:22.920> letter<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> alphabet<00:02:24.990> over

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
first-ever letter of the alphabet over

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.560 
first-ever letter of the alphabet over
in<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.790> documents<00:02:27.790> case<00:02:27.970> because<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.480> the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
in the documents case because of the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.120 
in the documents case because of the
number<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.080> might<00:02:29.290> be<00:02:29.320> good<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.740> put<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
number and might be good to just put a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.090 
number and might be good to just put a
one<00:02:30.600> ok<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.860> now<00:02:33.600> when<00:02:34.600> we<00:02:34.810> see<00:02:35.320> we<00:02:35.830> actually

the front image okay now sometimes that

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.449 
the front image okay now sometimes that
this<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.930> not<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.140> best<00:03:44.380> work<00:03:44.680> around<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.190> must

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
this is not the best work around I must

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.990 
this is not the best work around I must
say<00:03:45.610> it's<00:03:45.850> not<00:03:46.150> at<00:03:46.390> all<00:03:46.570> practical<00:03:47.700> it's<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.850> bit

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
say it's not at all practical it's a bit

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.640 
say it's not at all practical it's a bit
crap<00:03:49.330> but<00:03:50.170> it's<00:03:50.500> swimming<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.489> start<00:03:51.790> with

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
crap but it's swimming to start with

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.130 
crap but it's swimming to start with
because<00:03:53.650> sometimes<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.610> don't<00:03:55.360> really<00:03:55.570> want
