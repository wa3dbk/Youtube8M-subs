00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.820
 So there he is the napoleon mirage 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.550
 m 730 as you can really see 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.730
 powerful grill man approached we have 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.730
 so 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.440
 Anyone can have a say, we have four 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.670
 main burner 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.949
 we have a red series one 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.340
 so-called bowl son what a ceramic 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.660
 burner is heated up to 1000 degrees 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.729
 we have 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:12.720
 fine pages burner and the most important 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:16.360
 advertise handy without end one meter 4 x 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.240
 43 centimeters of grill area you see 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.500
 her typical napoleon wave shape 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.580
 of the unaware 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.880
 this barbeque is heavy and we are 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:32.200
 can see here are really thick so 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.830
 really ready when the temperature 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.149
 then have the jurisdiction and 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.300
 another feature which I have not 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.830
 may very properly this way for 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.509
 ice cubes or 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.149
 where probably then rather chilled 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.060
 drinks rhine should be that now 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.800
 I really do not need it 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.990
 which I find quite good compared to 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.509
 Weber collects these two clubs 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.970
 because playing in a league is that 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.330
 the one at the weber summit is the rotary one 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.009
 motor is hidden underneath and is 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.630
 almost permanently there that means if I 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.849
 make the grill clean or something then 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.069
 there is a danger that the things get wet 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.800
 Here we can be 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.230
 here a participation becomes this 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.580
 rotisserie engine can be stuck on and 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.440
 that is, only if we really are 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.790
 he is also there and otherwise 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.319
 is a security and can not 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.840
 Dirty will break otherwise 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.990
 Something in the downstairs took her 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.610
 these protection parts that the 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.290
 Brenner Protection took me to one 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.290
 stainless steel burner so everything on the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.140
 then four main burner and here one 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.010
 Another ceramic burner is just up 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.610
 heats to over 1000 degrees and then for 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.150
 the steaks wonderful temperatures a lot 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.880
 fast searing supplies with it so 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.319
 No 415 grill is the enormous storage space 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.670
 that you have so you see you have you 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.819
 two drawers and 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.310
 a total of four storage compartments and these 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.030
 storage compartments are so big that one eleven 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.770
 kilo gas bottle fits and fits comfortably there 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.020
 you also have no danger that therefore 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.580
 the grill is actually next to it is the 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.709
 So really there something happen 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.540
 Can with the gas bottle really one 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.370
 fine thing and so it is not drum 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.569
 around like the summit has to be next to it 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.020
 be hung or it has to be 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.310
 an extra beside it, I move it 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.269
 so it will not be bought here 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.130
 the case that is all directly 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.590
 included 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.090
 What are you really up to? 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.090
 Much of storage space in it 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.819
 here is a small shelf in there and 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.819
 really a lot of space 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.819
 that now in the resort the 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.260
 thermometer so I have the grill 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.180
 branded and managed pope 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.069
 within a quarter of an hour as 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.719
 only the four main races that means 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.459
 not the infrared trainer's turn 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.290
 because I managed it within 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.340
 a quarter of an hour to the stop too 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.019
 So this double band is coming here 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.469
 stainless steel double wall keeps the heat very much 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.450
 good and it can not leak sideways 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.880
 he sure has the videos about the weber 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.109
 've seen summit noted that there the 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.810
 handles resp 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.889
 the dials are illuminated that is 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.550
 here with this grill also the case 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.470
 turn on her look so the 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.570
 flames in the buttons and the 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.940
 things next to it are so by blue 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.699
 LEDs then light that they 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.259
 really dark out what the dark 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.139
 grill as such is missing and what the 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.599
 Webers on hat had over 1000 for it 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.130
 euro also costs more so are lights 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.840
 The handles are attached 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.550
 but then you can do that by weber 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.349
 Just order and they fit well 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.669
 quite normal to the handle on it 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.310
 means I ordered two times now 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.880
 and as soon as they are there I will be with you 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.880
 also mount 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.580
 Motor fastened as you will see 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.699
 just started here and then comes 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.050
 this one really spits where he is 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.130
 we must be able to see so in total 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.130
 four hooks are included 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.030
 where you then loose two accordingly 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.759
 Chicken on it can make 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.840
 at the same time then via the infrared 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.840
 then write in 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.120
 I hope you can get a picture 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.430
 over the napoleon more than 730 a 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.410
 really the whole city ​​is playing in the 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.010
 same league as a weber summit is 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.060
 but over 1000 euro cheaper 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.980
 I can really recommend that 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.200
 Processing is very good is a very good 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.710
 robust device from completely 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.510
 stainless steel the grill grates are very thick 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.850
 are also made of stainless steel are the 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.190
 Keep temperature good 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.530
 similar to the weber last station 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.660
 there is the so-called napoleon 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.000
 Situations as I said about 1000 degrees 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.560
 Heat produced and sear for spicy 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.560
 and is suitable 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:17.830
 I recommend him and keep watching 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.770
 barbecue the index many delicious recipes 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.770
 to prepare for these glasses is gone
