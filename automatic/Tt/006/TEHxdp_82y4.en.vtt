00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
to open the program now you could use

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.420 
to open the program now you could use
four<00:01:40.540> or<00:01:40.810> five<00:01:41.200> fingers<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.799> access<00:01:42.720> launchpad

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
four or five fingers to access launchpad

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.830 
four or five fingers to access launchpad

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
it looks like we just saw a bug because

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.120 
it looks like we just saw a bug because
it<00:02:09.910> didn't<00:02:10.149> actually<00:02:10.800> blur<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:12.010> background

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
it didn't actually blur the background

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.040 
it didn't actually blur the background
and<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.700> did<00:02:12.849> not<00:02:12.940> get<00:02:13.180> rid<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.390> it

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
and it did not get rid of it

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.740 
and it did not get rid of it
that<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.290> bar<00:02:14.440> like<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:14.770> supposed<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.100> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
that is bar like it's supposed to and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.270 
that is bar like it's supposed to and
for<00:02:16.750> some<00:02:16.990> reason<00:02:17.020> my<00:02:17.380> doc<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.770> hiding<00:02:18.130> even

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
for some reason my doc is hiding even

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.820 
for some reason my doc is hiding even
though<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.520> never<00:02:19.200> said<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.350> do<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:22.830> okay

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
though I never said it to do that okay

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.110 
though I never said it to do that okay
so<00:02:23.890> I'm<00:02:24.220> going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.400> go<00:02:24.490> ahead<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.790> move<00:02:24.850> this

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
so I'm going to go ahead and move this

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.490 
so I'm going to go ahead and move this
application<00:02:25.780> back<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.380> where<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.620> was<00:02:28.500> which

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
application back to where it was which

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.090 
application back to where it was which
was<00:02:29.530> right<00:02:29.980> there<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:32.230> then<00:02:32.350> just<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.770> iOS

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
was right there and then just like iOS

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.560 
was right there and then just like iOS
you<00:02:33.340> could<00:02:33.460> rename<00:02:33.730> your<00:02:33.880> folders<00:02:34.240> by<00:02:34.390> just

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
you could rename your folders by just

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.600 
you could rename your folders by just
tapping<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.470> instead<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:35.920> utilities<00:02:36.430> we

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
tapping on it so instead of utilities we

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.170 
tapping on it so instead of utilities we
could<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.850> call<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.210> whatever<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:39.180> you've

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
could just call this whatever and you've

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.780 
could just call this whatever and you've
just<00:02:40.390> changed<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:41.220> label<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.580> folder

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
just changed the label of the folder

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.680 
just changed the label of the folder
then<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.880> could<00:02:46.000> do<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.210> same<00:02:46.360> thing<00:02:46.570> with

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
then you could do the same thing with

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.600 
then you could do the same thing with
applications<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.380> believe<00:02:47.680> nope<00:02:48.220> you'd<00:02:48.430> have

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
applications I believe nope you'd have

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.240 
applications I believe nope you'd have
to<00:02:48.790> actually<00:02:49.110> change<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.470> actual<00:02:50.860> name<00:02:51.190> of

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
to actually change the actual name of

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.040 
to actually change the actual name of
the<00:02:51.520> app<00:02:51.670> itself<00:02:51.850> but<00:02:52.600> like<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.870> mentioned

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
the app itself but like I mentioned

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.690 
the app itself but like I mentioned
earlier<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.770> create<00:02:53.920> folders<00:02:54.370> by<00:02:54.520> just

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
earlier you can create folders by just

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.520 
earlier you can create folders by just
dragging<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.180> leaving<00:02:55.870> an<00:02:55.960> application<00:02:56.500> on

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
dragging and leaving an application on

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.220 
dragging and leaving an application on
top<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.950> another<00:02:57.130> one<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:58.330> drag<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.600> out<00:02:58.870> to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
top of another one just drag it out to

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.280 
top of another one just drag it out to
remove<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.510> then<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.630> have<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.840> remove<00:03:02.080> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290

of preview and I believe that if you tap
or<00:05:00.420> if<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:00.840> click<00:05:01.080> on<00:05:01.230> this<00:05:01.380> green<00:05:01.590> button

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.030 
or if you click on this green button
here<00:05:02.400> okay<00:05:03.300> that<00:05:03.480> just<00:05:03.630> moves<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.770> over<00:05:05.010> a

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
here okay that just moves it over a

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.980 
here okay that just moves it over a
little<00:05:05.190> bit<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:05.670> I<00:05:05.970> thought<00:05:06.540> that<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:06.840> would

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
little bit so I thought that that would

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.510 
little bit so I thought that that would
also<00:05:07.200> make<00:05:07.470> it<00:05:07.530> go<00:05:07.710> to<00:05:07.740> full<00:05:08.040> screen<00:05:08.250> but

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
also make it go to full screen but

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.760 
also make it go to full screen but
nevermind<00:05:09.410> um<00:05:12.170> that's<00:05:13.170> going<00:05:13.470> to<00:05:13.530> be<00:05:13.650> it<00:05:13.740> for

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
nevermind um that's going to be it for

was<00:05:41.700> trying<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:41.970> get<00:05:42.090> this<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.750> work<00:05:42.810> in<00:05:43.050> a

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
was trying to get this to work in a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.570 
was trying to get this to work in a
virtual<00:05:43.440> machine<00:05:43.470> inside<00:05:44.100> of<00:05:44.250> windows<00:05:44.550> seven

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
virtual machine inside of windows seven

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.970 
virtual machine inside of windows seven
but<00:05:45.240> for<00:05:45.780> whatever<00:05:46.020> reason<00:05:46.200> that<00:05:46.560> just<00:05:46.710> cannot

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
but for whatever reason that just cannot

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.790 
but for whatever reason that just cannot
get<00:05:47.160> it<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.370> boot<00:05:47.550> after<00:05:47.970> I<00:05:48.000> get<00:05:48.180> it<00:05:48.300> installed

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
get it to boot after I get it installed

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.190 
get it to boot after I get it installed
I<00:05:49.850> think<00:05:50.850> it's<00:05:50.970> just<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.270> way<00:05:51.390> it's<00:05:51.780> currently

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
I think it's just the way it's currently

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.620 
I think it's just the way it's currently
made<00:05:52.440> maybe<00:05:52.740> we<00:05:52.980> might<00:05:53.160> find<00:05:53.580> a<00:05:53.790> custom<00:05:54.330> kernel

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
made maybe we might find a custom kernel

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.140 
made maybe we might find a custom kernel
as<00:05:55.020> sort<00:05:55.260> of<00:05:55.350> allows<00:05:56.160> it<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.400> boot<00:05:56.640> on<00:05:56.790> stuff

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
as sort of allows it to boot on stuff

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.690 
as sort of allows it to boot on stuff
other<00:05:57.390> than<00:05:57.480> max<00:05:57.810> which<00:05:58.080> includes<00:05:58.470> pcs<00:05:59.430> for

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
other than max which includes pcs for

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.960 
other than max which includes pcs for
hacking<00:06:00.030> toshing<00:06:00.480> and<00:06:01.070> osx86<00:06:02.070> stuff<00:06:02.670> or

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
hacking toshing and osx86 stuff or

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.200 
hacking toshing and osx86 stuff or
virtual<00:06:03.690> machines<00:06:04.610> so<00:06:05.610> that's<00:06:05.820> about<00:06:05.910> it<00:06:06.000> with

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
virtual machines so that's about it with

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.490 
virtual machines so that's about it with
