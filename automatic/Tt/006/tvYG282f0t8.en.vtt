against all based on resources because

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.660 
against all based on resources because
resources<00:02:07.079> are<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.290> infinite<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> someone

resources are not infinite and someone

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.339 
resources are not infinite and someone
somewhere<00:02:09.149> would<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.479> perceived<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.050> having

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
more than someone else and so there

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.360 
more than someone else and so there
would<00:02:12.180> always<00:02:12.300> be<00:02:12.420> some<00:02:12.690> kind<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.989> term

and<00:02:13.550> that<00:02:14.060> things<00:02:14.300> like<00:02:14.480> structure<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.140> order

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
and that things like structure and order

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.440 
and that things like structure and order
and<00:02:15.620> governments<00:02:16.160> would<00:02:16.489> rise<00:02:16.790> up<00:02:17.090> not

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
and governments would rise up not

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.570 
and governments would rise up not
because<00:02:17.720> humanity<00:02:18.530> wants<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.069> be<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.370> way

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
because humanity wants it to be that way

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.339 
because humanity wants it to be that way
but<00:02:20.060> because<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.450> has<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.840> be<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.140> way<00:02:21.290> to

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
but because it has to be that way to

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.040 
but because it has to be that way to
keep<00:02:21.650> humanity<00:02:21.890> from<00:02:22.220> destroying<00:02:22.610> itself<00:02:23.120> now

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
keep humanity from destroying itself now

the difference between carnage and venom

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.540 
the difference between carnage and venom
here<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.620> course<00:02:27.800> carnage<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.370> the
