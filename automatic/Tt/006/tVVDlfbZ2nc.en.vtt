00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.180
 welcome back it takes between lover 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.960
 how you see this the glorious silvio 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.179
 master system ii 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.050
 with ninja gaiden today I wanted to show 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.640
 how to solve the most common problem 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.329
 according to me that afflicts the master system 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.449
 or rather a component of it or the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 deep end of the controller now how many of 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.210
 you happened this I don't know how I in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.790
 During these years I found myself 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.100
 very often in front of this type of 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.190
 problem that is always forced to me or to 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.480
 throw away at the controller or 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.039
 remedy by wrapping the scotch 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 around the ipad and nothing despite 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.289
 even the many web searches do not have 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.739
 never found any kind of help so me 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.810
 I am armed a little patience and after a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.810
 come up with a very functional method 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.159
 to solve the problem to remedy 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.780
 to this problem 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.580
 we need some glass paper 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.580
 of a Phillips screwdriver and a 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.580
 lighter 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.570
 ok then first of all and we remove the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:36.680
 deep end and disassemble the controller are 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:42.619
 served ok fine now we need 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:50.250
 to do some tests only of the part 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:53.759
 frontal and now instead and we move on to the al 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:59.030
 worse to act depends on how 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.859
 you see is born only with a tongue of 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.829
 Support our task will be to 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:07.430
 to create another now I will show you 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.430
 such as 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.320
 now after creating a tab 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:48.320
 similar to the original one 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:53.760
 we will have to sand the part a little 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:58.820
 lower to create less less thickness 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.820
 in short, this way 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:13.140
 every now and then try it to see if it goes 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.720
 well if it is not thick on one side 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.519
 than on the other 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:24.780
 in this case, as you can see, it is a little more 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:29.160
 low on this side here instead it is 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:34.569
 higher then a scrap you still have 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:41.939
 a little does not seem ok 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.939
 we can become a dog now 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.610
 seems to be everything you see 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:59.599
 beautiful solid now we just have to 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.599
 try 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:24.479
 they are very good as new practically 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.880
 that's all for today 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.190
 if you have any questions they are usual 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.560
 leave a comment 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.560
 and see you at the next beautiful
