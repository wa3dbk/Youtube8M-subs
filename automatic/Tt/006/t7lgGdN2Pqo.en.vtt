of put it really together there's like
script<00:04:13.950> writing<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.430> takes<00:04:14.609> a<00:04:14.730> long<00:04:14.880> time

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
script writing it takes a long time

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.360 
script writing it takes a long time
and<00:04:16.780> looking<00:04:17.780> at<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:17.989> footage<00:04:18.230> it<00:04:18.650> very<00:04:18.950> early

I just saw Anna is open opens herself up

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.190 
I just saw Anna is open opens herself up
the<00:04:24.230> most<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.040> she<00:04:25.400> performs<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.240> in<00:04:27.110> the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
the most and she performs and in the

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.110 
the most and she performs and in the
interviews<00:04:27.560> it's<00:04:27.710> great<00:04:28.040> because<00:04:28.340> there's<00:04:29.030> a

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
interviews it's great because there's a

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.420 
interviews it's great because there's a
few<00:04:29.419> things<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:29.900> will<00:04:30.110> point<00:04:30.470> Julie<00:04:31.100> really

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
few things it will point Julie really

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.240 
few things it will point Julie really
wants<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.790> get<00:04:31.880> across<00:04:32.180> but<00:04:32.900> better<00:04:33.260> soul<00:04:33.710> her

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
wants to get across but better soul her

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.840 
wants to get across but better soul her
spirit<00:04:35.030> her<00:04:35.800> heart<00:04:36.800> opens<00:04:37.430> up<00:04:37.580> in<00:04:37.730> the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
spirit her heart opens up in the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.840 
spirit her heart opens up in the
performance<00:04:38.330> so<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:38.510> decided<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.860> tell<00:04:40.580> the

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
performance so I decided I tell the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.690 
performance so I decided I tell the
movie<00:04:41.150> through<00:04:41.480> Anna's<00:04:42.430> performance<00:04:43.430> that's

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
movie through Anna's performance that's

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.820 
movie through Anna's performance that's
what<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:43.910> saw<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:44.810> which<00:04:45.020> is<00:04:45.139> unusual<00:04:45.290> as<00:04:45.740> a

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
what I saw and which is unusual as a

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.070 
what I saw and which is unusual as a
concept<00:04:46.250> it's<00:04:46.669> like<00:04:46.850> in<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.480> way<00:04:47.630> it's<00:04:47.840> not<00:04:47.960> the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
concept it's like in a way it's not the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.930 
concept it's like in a way it's not the
movie<00:04:48.290> about<00:04:48.410> dance<00:04:48.740> because<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.430> taught<00:04:49.820> is

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
movie about dance because it taught is

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.969 
movie about dance because it taught is
told<00:04:50.210> to<00:04:50.450> dance<00:04:50.750> but<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.229> then<00:04:51.530> it's<00:04:51.830> about

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
told to dance but it then it's about

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.879 
told to dance but it then it's about
life<00:04:52.460> it's<00:04:53.180> definitely<00:04:53.840> about<00:04:53.960> life<00:04:54.290> and<00:04:54.530> and

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
life it's definitely about life and and

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.390 
life it's definitely about life and and
and<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:56.030> meet<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.750> came<00:04:57.620> back<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:58.100> what<00:04:58.250> the

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
and to meet it came back to what the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.190 
and to meet it came back to what the
originally<00:04:58.729> started<00:04:58.940> out<00:04:59.240> with<00:04:59.419> anna<00:04:59.690> i<00:04:59.840> came

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
originally started out with anna i came

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.700 
originally started out with anna i came
from<00:05:00.350> the<00:05:00.470> theater<00:05:00.830> and<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.960> all<00:05:02.960> my<00:05:03.169> life<00:05:03.470> i'm

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
from the theater and and all my life i'm

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.800 
from the theater and and all my life i'm
thinking<00:05:04.280> about<00:05:04.370> performance<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.600> other

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
thinking about performance and the other

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.280 
thinking about performance and the other
end<00:05:06.139> and<00:05:06.350> what<00:05:06.800> does<00:05:06.979> that<00:05:07.220> mean<00:05:07.700> that<00:05:08.290> you

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
end and what does that mean that you

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.830 
end and what does that mean that you
know<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.680> roots<00:05:09.950> of<00:05:10.220> faith<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:10.700> how<00:05:11.540> is

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
know that the roots of faith and how is

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.990 
know that the roots of faith and how is
it<00:05:11.870> still<00:05:12.320> there<00:05:12.530> today<00:05:12.950> a<00:05:13.130> live<00:05:13.490> performance

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
it still there today a live performance

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.260 
it still there today a live performance
so<00:05:14.389> much<00:05:14.660> and<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.530> beats<00:05:15.830> everything

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
so much and it beats everything

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.870 
so much and it beats everything
sometimes<00:05:17.979> i<00:05:18.979> remembered<00:05:19.729> the

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
sometimes i remembered the

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.100 
sometimes i remembered the
mathematicians<00:05:22.880> as<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.300> proof<00:05:23.660> is<00:05:23.870> always

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
mathematicians as the proof is always

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.770 
mathematicians as the proof is always
stronger<00:05:24.410> than<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.860> prude<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.789> truth<00:05:26.450> is<00:05:26.690> I

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
stronger than the prude the truth is I

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.659 
stronger than the prude the truth is I
was<00:05:26.930> stronger<00:05:27.350> than<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.770> proof<00:05:28.039> of<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.370> truth

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
was stronger than the proof of the truth

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:35.110 
was stronger than the proof of the truth
hmm<00:05:29.289> so<00:05:31.300> anyway<00:05:32.300> I<00:05:33.020> am<00:05:33.740> okay<00:05:34.580> some<00:05:34.880> of<00:05:34.910> that

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
hmm so anyway I am okay some of that

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.750 
hmm so anyway I am okay some of that
passion<00:05:35.360> is<00:05:35.780> definitely<00:05:36.410> in<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:37.250> film<00:05:37.550> I

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
passion is definitely in the film I

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.010 
passion is definitely in the film I
don't<00:05:37.910> know<00:05:38.000> who<00:05:38.180> else<00:05:38.360> could<00:05:38.690> have<00:05:38.720> done<00:05:38.810> this

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
don't know who else could have done this

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.219 
don't know who else could have done this
film<00:05:39.530> I<00:05:39.770> mean<00:05:40.729> Anna<00:05:40.910> it's<00:05:41.150> Anna<00:05:41.479> but<00:05:41.810> it's<00:05:41.960> you

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
film I mean Anna it's Anna but it's you

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.680 
film I mean Anna it's Anna but it's you
did<00:05:42.289> and<00:05:42.530> then<00:05:43.100> was<00:05:43.640> an<00:05:43.760> important<00:05:44.300> thing<00:05:44.539> I

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
did and then was an important thing I

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.990 
did and then was an important thing I
have<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.080> mention<00:05:45.200> and<00:05:45.800> ice<00:05:46.430> well<00:05:46.669> documented

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
have to mention and ice well documented

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.980 
have to mention and ice well documented
in<00:05:47.539> a<00:05:47.630> way<00:05:48.130> but<00:05:49.130> often<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:49.910> it's<00:05:50.330> filmed<00:05:50.840> as

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
in a way but often the it's filmed as

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.350 
in a way but often the it's filmed as
workshop<00:05:51.560> footage<00:05:52.010> and<00:05:52.280> it's<00:05:52.580> it's<00:05:53.090> not

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
workshop footage and it's it's not

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.529 
workshop footage and it's it's not
really<00:05:53.600> carefully<00:05:54.110> filmed<00:05:54.700> it's<00:05:55.700> just<00:05:55.910> having

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
really carefully filmed it's just having

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.750 
really carefully filmed it's just having
the<00:05:56.630> camera<00:05:56.930> there's<00:05:57.110> not<00:05:57.350> enough<00:05:57.729> so<00:05:58.729> I

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
the camera there's not enough so I

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.540 
the camera there's not enough so I
really<00:05:59.570> thought<00:06:00.410> then<00:06:00.710> when<00:06:00.919> you<00:06:01.039> carefully

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
really thought then when you carefully

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.510 
really thought then when you carefully
film<00:06:01.930> this<00:06:02.930> process<00:06:03.470> is<00:06:03.740> sometimes<00:06:04.160> so<00:06:04.310> just

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
film this process is sometimes so just

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.040 
film this process is sometimes so just
the<00:06:04.610> performance<00:06:05.180> itself<00:06:05.270> which<00:06:05.720> happens

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
the performance itself which happens

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.650 
the performance itself which happens
maybe<00:06:06.169> only<00:06:06.410> ones<00:06:06.740> you<00:06:07.610> under<00:06:08.030> magnifying

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
maybe only ones you under magnifying

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.150 
maybe only ones you under magnifying
glass<00:06:08.900> you<00:06:08.930> start<00:06:09.350> to<00:06:09.470> really<00:06:09.710> see<00:06:10.039> how

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
glass you start to really see how

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.050 
glass you start to really see how
precious<00:06:10.760> these<00:06:11.389> things<00:06:11.780> are
