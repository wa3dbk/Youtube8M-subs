00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
then we slowly place one of these at

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.630 
then we slowly place one of these at
time<00:02:37.570> one<00:02:38.110> day<00:02:38.410> at<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.680> time<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.400> want<00:02:39.550> to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
be careful because it's going to make

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.530 
be careful because it's going to make
your<00:02:42.370> food<00:02:42.580> processor<00:02:42.820> kind<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.510> angry<00:02:43.930> so

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.320 

so<00:02:48.540> slowly<00:02:48.840> my<00:02:49.170> free<00:02:49.409> men

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.030 

yes<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.810> texture<00:02:56.200> really<00:02:56.380> depends<00:02:56.890> on<00:02:56.980> how

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
yes the texture really depends on how

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.890 
yes the texture really depends on how
you<00:02:57.220> want<00:02:57.610> if<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.060> wanted<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.450> get<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.660> really

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
you want if you wanted to get it really

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.750 
you want if you wanted to get it really
smooth<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.500> can<00:02:59.650> keep<00:02:59.950> blending<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.520> for<00:03:00.700> a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
smooth you can keep blending it for a

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.970 
smooth you can keep blending it for a
long<00:03:00.910> time<00:03:01.440> otherwise<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.650> can<00:03:02.800> leave<00:03:02.950> it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
long time otherwise you can leave it

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.560 
long time otherwise you can leave it
just<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.280> little<00:03:03.310> bigger<00:03:03.820> e-cig<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.390> little

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
just a little bigger e-cig a little

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.360 
just a little bigger e-cig a little
chunky<00:03:04.960> yeah<00:03:05.500> we're<00:03:05.800> going<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.070> do<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.250> little

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
chunky yeah we're going to do a little

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:15.830 
chunky yeah we're going to do a little
bit<00:03:07.060> longer

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.770 

it<00:03:16.840> also<00:03:16.990> depends<00:03:17.410> on<00:03:17.530> how<00:03:17.709> high<00:03:17.950> power<00:03:18.220> you're

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.030 

an<00:03:22.780> organ<00:03:24.239> like<00:03:25.239> 30<00:03:25.569> is<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.050> ready<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.440> think

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
an organ like 30 is it ready I think

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.790 
an organ like 30 is it ready I think
it's<00:03:27.160> pretty<00:03:27.280> good<00:03:27.989> what<00:03:28.989> we<00:03:29.080> can<00:03:29.260> do<00:03:29.410> now<00:03:29.560> to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
it's pretty good what we can do now to

vessel<00:03:43.420> i<00:03:43.690> expended<00:03:44.260> like<00:03:44.440> laughs<00:03:44.860> then<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.250> say

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
vessel i expended like laughs then I say

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.490 
vessel i expended like laughs then I say
like<00:03:45.730> half<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.120> teaspoon<00:03:46.599> maybe<00:03:46.930> that's<00:03:47.290> good

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
like half a teaspoon maybe that's good

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.620 
like half a teaspoon maybe that's good
yeah<00:03:47.680> salt<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.489> taste<00:03:48.610> salt<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.360> going<00:03:49.569> to

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
yeah salt to taste salt is going to
