I'm gonna let it go ahead and create
that<00:03:14.470> database<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.760> that's<00:03:21.940> there<00:03:22.210> it's

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
that database and so that's there it's

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.440 
that database and so that's there it's
ssma<00:03:22.990> demo<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:24.250> if<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:24.490> drill<00:03:24.730> into<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.150> then

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
ssma demo and if I drill into that then

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.680 
ssma demo and if I drill into that then
on<00:03:26.380> its<00:03:26.680> dashboard<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.520> ought<00:03:28.240> to<00:03:28.270> be<00:03:28.450> able<00:03:28.630> to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
on its dashboard I ought to be able to

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.550 
on its dashboard I ought to be able to
get<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.680> fully<00:03:30.220> qualified<00:03:30.490> server<00:03:31.120> name<00:03:31.560> for

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
get the fully qualified server name for

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.390 
get the fully qualified server name for
that<00:03:32.680> database<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:34.680> back<00:03:35.680> over<00:03:35.920> here<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.280> the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
that database and back over here in the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.370 
that database and back over here in the
azure<00:03:36.790> sequel<00:03:37.420> migration<00:03:38.290> assistant

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
azure sequel migration assistant

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.750 
azure sequel migration assistant
actually<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.100> don't<00:03:39.340> need<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.610> fully

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
actually I don't need the fully

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.220 
actually I don't need the fully
qualified<00:03:40.209> name<00:03:40.240> I<00:03:40.540> just<00:03:40.570> need<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.020> server

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
qualified name I just need the server

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.330 
qualified name I just need the server
name<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.040> can<00:03:42.310> get<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.610> server<00:03:42.910> name<00:03:43.150> and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
name so I can get the server name and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.490 
name so I can get the server name and
paste<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.610> in<00:03:45.880> then<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.840> wants<00:03:46.990> to<00:03:47.200> know<00:03:47.260> the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
paste that in then it wants to know the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.090 
paste that in then it wants to know the
database<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.030> want<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.330> connect<00:03:49.600> up<00:03:49.780> to

modifies<00:04:20.200> your<00:04:20.230> Access<00:04:20.680> database<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:21.220> that

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
modifies your Access database so that

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.370 
modifies your Access database so that
your<00:04:21.850> queries<00:04:22.150> etc<00:04:22.630> will<00:04:22.750> perform<00:04:23.140> against

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
your queries etc will perform against

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.140 
your queries etc will perform against
the<00:04:23.530> database<00:04:23.890> on<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.130> back<00:04:24.280> end<00:04:24.580> here<00:04:24.850> I'm

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
the database on the back end here I'm

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.350 
the database on the back end here I'm
not<00:04:25.450> going<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.720> link<00:04:25.930> tables<00:04:26.940> that<00:04:27.940> that<00:04:28.240> would

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
not going to link tables that that would

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.750 
not going to link tables that that would
let<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:28.660> link<00:04:28.900> up<00:04:29.050> your<00:04:29.400> forms<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.550> things

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
let you link up your forms and things

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.360 
let you link up your forms and things
like<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:30.940> but<00:04:31.419> in<00:04:31.630> Access<00:04:32.050> 2013<00:04:32.169> as<00:04:33.010> far<00:04:33.190> as<00:04:33.280> I

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
like that but in Access 2013 as far as I

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.430 
like that but in Access 2013 as far as I
understand<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:34.060> Access<00:04:34.540> database<00:04:34.870> projects

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
understand it Access database projects

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.060 
understand it Access database projects
are<00:04:36.040> not<00:04:36.600> functional<00:04:37.600> there<00:04:37.750> but<00:04:38.110> I'm<00:04:38.950> going

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
are not functional there but I'm going

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:46.010 
are not functional there but I'm going
to<00:04:39.130> go<00:04:39.220> onto<00:04:39.340> next<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:41.610> on<00:04:42.610> the

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.570 

okay<00:04:47.020> yeah<00:04:47.140> so<00:04:47.320> up<00:04:47.440> in<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.590> database<00:04:47.860> side<00:04:48.250> I

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
okay yeah so up in the database side I

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.430 
okay yeah so up in the database side I
don't<00:04:49.180> see<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.510> people<00:04:49.750> table<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.290> in<00:04:50.350> the

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
don't see the people table but in the

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.110 
don't see the people table but in the
local<00:04:50.620> table<00:04:51.070> we<00:04:51.190> do<00:04:51.370> have<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:51.880> it's<00:04:52.000> going

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
local table we do have it so it's going

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.820 
local table we do have it so it's going
to<00:04:52.180> pull<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.630> across<00:04:52.810> I<00:04:53.410> see<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:53.680> it's

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
to pull that across I see that it's

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.130 
to pull that across I see that it's
going<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.280> pull<00:04:55.150> that<00:04:55.300> database<00:04:55.600> up<00:04:55.870> that

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
going to pull that database up that

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.760 
going to pull that database up that
looks<00:04:56.350> good

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
looks good

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.890 
looks good
hit<00:04:57.250> OK<00:04:58.530> and<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:01.120> should<00:05:01.300> have<00:05:01.390> pulled<00:05:01.540> my<00:05:01.690> data

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
hit OK and it should have pulled my data

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.780 
hit OK and it should have pulled my data
in<00:05:02.110> for<00:05:02.350> me<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:03.960> close<00:05:04.960> up<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:06.610> now<00:05:06.640> I

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
in for me and close up and so now I

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.970 
in for me and close up and so now I
should<00:05:07.090> see<00:05:07.330> that<00:05:07.360> up<00:05:07.660> there<00:05:07.690> and<00:05:08.650> if<00:05:08.740> I<00:05:08.830> were

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
should see that up there and if I were

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.160 
should see that up there and if I were
to<00:05:09.100> go<00:05:09.250> now<00:05:09.490> back<00:05:10.390> over<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.750> my<00:05:10.840> national

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
to go now back over to my national
