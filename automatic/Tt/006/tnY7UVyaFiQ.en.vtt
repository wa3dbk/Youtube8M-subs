that protects smart cards from hackers
in<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.070> first<00:00:37.309> place<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:38.120> today<00:00:38.390> what<00:00:38.600> we're

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
in the first place so today what we're

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.380 
in the first place so today what we're
going<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:38.930> do<00:00:39.109> is<00:00:39.260> we're<00:00:39.410> going<00:00:39.559> to<00:00:40.210> take<00:00:41.210> out

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
going to do is we're going to take out

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.299 
going to do is we're going to take out
this<00:00:41.660> piece<00:00:42.050> of<00:00:42.170> metal<00:00:42.289> we're<00:00:42.949> gonna<00:00:43.070> remove

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
this piece of metal we're gonna remove

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.689 
this piece of metal we're gonna remove
it<00:00:43.570> we're<00:00:44.570> going<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:44.960> expose<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.710> some

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
it we're going to expose it to some

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.439 
it we're going to expose it to some
acids<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:48.079> first<00:00:48.320> phase<00:00:48.620> is<00:00:48.649> going<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.449> remove

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
acids the first phase is going to remove

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.720 
acids the first phase is going to remove
the<00:00:50.629> epoxy<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:51.170> actually<00:00:51.590> expose<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.519> chip

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
the epoxy and actually expose the chip

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.919 
the epoxy and actually expose the chip
so<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.030> white<00:00:53.210> stuff<00:00:53.420> is<00:00:53.480> going<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:53.660> come<00:00:53.780> off

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
so this white stuff is going to come off

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.660 
so this white stuff is going to come off
so<00:00:54.350> basically<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.890> plastics<00:00:55.250> broken<00:00:55.519> down

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
so basically the plastics broken down

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.279 
so basically the plastics broken down
now<00:00:55.850> after<00:00:56.059> about<00:00:56.149> 10<00:00:56.719> minutes<00:00:57.019> have<00:00:57.109> gone<00:00:57.140> by

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
now after about 10 minutes have gone by

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.290 
now after about 10 minutes have gone by
first<00:00:58.039> phase<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.489> exposure<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:58.969> going<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.210> be

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
first phase of exposure is going to be

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.180 
first phase of exposure is going to be
to<00:00:59.420> get<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.899> actual<00:01:00.140> device<00:01:00.530> inside<00:01:00.920> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
to get to the actual device inside the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.560 
to get to the actual device inside the
substrate<00:01:01.640> we're<00:01:01.879> going<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.089> put<00:01:02.239> acetone

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
substrate we're going to put acetone

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.290 
substrate we're going to put acetone
into<00:01:02.719> these<00:01:03.140> two<00:01:03.320> beakers<00:01:03.879> one<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.000> going<00:01:05.150> to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
into these two beakers one is going to

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.960 
into these two beakers one is going to
be<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.440> nitric<00:01:06.740> rinse<00:01:06.980> and<00:01:07.220> then<00:01:07.790> the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
be the the nitric rinse and then the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.819 
be the the nitric rinse and then the
second<00:01:08.450> beaker<00:01:08.570> will<00:01:08.810> be<00:01:08.930> considered<00:01:09.560> clean

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
second beaker will be considered clean

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.469 
second beaker will be considered clean
and<00:01:10.070> that'll<00:01:10.610> be<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.729> final<00:01:11.150> rinse<00:01:11.299> in

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
and that'll be the final rinse in

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.999 
and that'll be the final rinse in
ultrasonic<00:01:11.869> we're<00:01:12.409> gonna<00:01:12.500> pull<00:01:12.710> these<00:01:12.799> out

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
ultrasonic we're gonna pull these out

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.109 
ultrasonic we're gonna pull these out
and<00:01:13.250> we're<00:01:13.400> gonna<00:01:13.490> stick<00:01:13.700> them<00:01:13.820> on<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.000> hot

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
and we're gonna stick them on the hot

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.289 
and we're gonna stick them on the hot
plate<00:01:14.270> with<00:01:14.509> some<00:01:14.659> fuming<00:01:15.079> nitric<00:01:15.110> acid<00:01:15.710> hno3

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
plate with some fuming nitric acid hno3

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.539 
plate with some fuming nitric acid hno3
I'm<00:01:17.299> very<00:01:17.600> very<00:01:17.840> dangerous<00:01:18.100> it's<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> very

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
I'm very very dangerous it's a very

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.340 
I'm very very dangerous it's a very
aggressive<00:01:20.000> acid<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:20.570> I'm<00:01:20.659> gonna<00:01:20.750> wash<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.170> I'm

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
aggressive acid so I'm gonna wash it I'm

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.319 
aggressive acid so I'm gonna wash it I'm
gonna<00:01:21.470> rinse<00:01:21.649> it<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.820> piece<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.210> now

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
gonna rinse it that piece is now

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.840 
gonna rinse it that piece is now
finished<00:01:23.720> he's<00:01:23.930> opened<00:01:24.229> up<00:01:24.350> enough<00:01:24.850> just

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
finished he's opened up enough just

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.179 
finished he's opened up enough just
removing<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.360> extra<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.710> ultrasonic<00:01:28.130> is

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
removing the extra so the ultrasonic is

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.590 
removing the extra so the ultrasonic is
gonna<00:01:28.340> basically<00:01:28.490> give<00:01:28.820> vibrations<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.479> this

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
gonna basically give vibrations to this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.660 
gonna basically give vibrations to this
and<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.110> clean<00:01:30.680> off<00:01:30.860> any<00:01:31.100> residue<00:01:31.340> that's

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
and and clean off any residue that's

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.760 
and and clean off any residue that's
left<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:33.560> can<00:01:33.710> see<00:01:33.890> on<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.130> monitor<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:36.350> looks

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
left you can see on the monitor it looks

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.850 
left you can see on the monitor it looks
good<00:01:37.219> it<00:01:37.820> looks<00:01:37.850> beautifully<00:01:38.509> clean<00:01:38.860> we're

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
good it looks beautifully clean we're

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.609 
good it looks beautifully clean we're
going<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.130> put<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.369> chip<00:01:40.549> back<00:01:40.579> in<00:01:40.880> place<00:01:41.619> if

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
going to put the chip back in place if

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.050 
going to put the chip back in place if
you<00:01:42.770> look<00:01:42.950> at<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.219> chip<00:01:43.460> there's<00:01:43.670> basically

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
you look at this chip there's basically

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.179 
you look at this chip there's basically
two<00:01:44.540> layers<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.110> top<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.560> third<00:01:45.770> top

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
two layers and a top and a third top

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.380

metal down on that second layer where

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.920 
metal down on that second layer where
we're<00:01:52.850> going<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.149> burn<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.329> hole<00:01:53.450> through<00:01:53.600> it

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
we're going to burn a hole through it

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.899 
we're going to burn a hole through it
but<00:01:54.289> we're<00:01:54.409> going<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.710> burn<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.890> very<00:01:55.130> special

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
but we're going to burn a very special

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.480 
but we're going to burn a very special
hole<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.930> I<00:01:56.960> will<00:01:57.140> make<00:01:57.469> with<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.159> mask

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
hole that that I will make with a mask

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.510 
hole that that I will make with a mask
we<00:01:59.180> just<00:01:59.390> want<00:01:59.539> to<00:01:59.600> coat<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.930> top<00:02:00.520> creating

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
we just want to coat the top creating

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.999 
we just want to coat the top creating
basically<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:02.000> mask<00:02:02.560> we'll<00:02:03.560> give<00:02:03.680> this<00:02:03.829> some

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
basically a mask we'll give this some

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.480 
basically a mask we'll give this some
time<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.340> dry<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:05.469> then<00:02:06.469> we're<00:02:06.680> going<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:07.009> use

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
time to dry and then we're going to use

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.359 
time to dry and then we're going to use
a<00:02:07.850> sewing<00:02:08.450> type<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.930> needle<00:02:09.140> being<00:02:09.950> held<00:02:10.130> by<00:02:10.340> a

substrate<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.459> blue<00:03:42.700> line<00:03:42.880> represents<00:03:43.090> reset

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
substrate the blue line represents reset

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.410 
substrate the blue line represents reset
every<00:03:44.650> time<00:03:44.799> I<00:03:44.830> reset<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.250> card<00:03:45.519> we're<00:03:46.299> going

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
every time I reset the card we're going

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.240 
every time I reset the card we're going
to<00:03:46.480> build<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.690> log<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:47.170> where<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.860> chip<00:03:48.010> went

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
to build a log of where the chip went

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.250 
to build a log of where the chip went
when<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.579> powered<00:03:48.820> up<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.180> you're<00:03:49.900> basically

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
when it powered up and you're basically

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.500 
when it powered up and you're basically
going<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.650> see<00:03:50.890> everything<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:52.360> we're<00:03:52.450> gonna

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
going to see everything so we're gonna

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.500 
going to see everything so we're gonna
take<00:03:52.720> 800<00:03:53.260> hexadecimal<00:03:53.920> samples<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.209> this<00:03:55.390> is

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
take 800 hexadecimal samples so this is

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.900 
take 800 hexadecimal samples so this is
just<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.900> sequential<00:03:56.860> order<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.579> samples

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
just a sequential order of the samples

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.479 
just a sequential order of the samples
taken<00:03:58.030> sample<00:03:58.780> 500<00:03:59.260> hex<00:03:59.410> simplified<00:04:00.010> 20<00:04:00.340> and

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
taken sample 500 hex simplified 20 and

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.920 
taken sample 500 hex simplified 20 and
what<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:00.940> saw<00:04:01.209> at<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.450> period<00:04:01.720> of<00:04:01.780> time

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
what I saw at the period of time

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.690 
what I saw at the period of time
anything<00:04:02.680> in<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:02.829> chip<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.100> can<00:04:03.250> see<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.519> right

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
anything in the chip I can see it right

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.210 
anything in the chip I can see it right
here<00:04:03.730> as<00:04:04.000> we<00:04:04.720> take<00:04:05.019> more<00:04:05.170> simples<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:05.980> all

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
here as we take more simples it's all

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.500 
here as we take more simples it's all
gonna<00:04:06.400> fall<00:04:06.489> into<00:04:06.820> place<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.180> you'll<00:04:07.269> see<00:04:07.420> it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
gonna fall into place and you'll see it

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.410 
gonna fall into place and you'll see it
I<00:04:07.660> could<00:04:08.200> actually<00:04:08.350> send<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.519> management

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
I could actually send a management

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.030 
I could actually send a management
message<00:04:10.840> for<00:04:11.019> example<00:04:11.350> into<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.590> chip<00:04:11.860> and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
message for example into the chip and

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.039 
message for example into the chip and
east<00:04:12.549> drop<00:04:12.790> everything<00:04:13.239> that<00:04:13.510> chip<00:04:13.660> did<00:04:13.870> to

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
east drop everything that chip did to

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.170 
east drop everything that chip did to
decrypt<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.440> message<00:04:14.709> for<00:04:14.890> example<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:15.790> if<00:04:16.060> I

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
decrypt the message for example so if I

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.789 
decrypt the message for example so if I
can<00:04:16.390> see<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.870> can<00:04:17.079> do<00:04:17.229> anything<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.560> want<00:04:17.590> to

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
can see I can do anything I want to

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.440 
can see I can do anything I want to
right<00:04:17.950> now<00:04:17.979> I<00:04:18.310> can<00:04:18.729> control<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.239> or<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.390> can

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
right now I can control it or I can

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.750 
right now I can control it or I can
listen<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:19.959> can<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:20.919> can<00:04:21.190> read<00:04:21.370> out<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.579> east

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
listen I can I can read out the east

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.730 
listen I can I can read out the east
where<00:04:21.970> if<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.150> wanted<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.510> I<00:04:22.720> could<00:04:23.020> read<00:04:23.620> out

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
where if I wanted to I could read out

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.720 
where if I wanted to I could read out
the<00:04:23.860> ROM

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
the ROM

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.100 
the ROM
anything<00:04:25.270> goes<00:04:25.420> at<00:04:25.600> this<00:04:25.660> point<00:04:25.900> in<00:04:25.990> time

anything goes at this point in time

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.990 
anything goes at this point in time
versus<00:04:26.770> glitching<00:04:27.310> with<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> glitch<00:04:27.760> err
