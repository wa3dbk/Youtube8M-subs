enemies in this video this round is
actually<00:00:51.329> quite<00:00:51.629> interesting<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.160> say

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
actually quite interesting and I say

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.939 
actually quite interesting and I say
that<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:53.730> my<00:00:54.690> team<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:54.989> pretty<00:00:55.620> much<00:00:55.739> over

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
that because my team is pretty much over

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.740

can<00:01:05.939> kind<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.720> US<00:01:06.900> Coast<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.260> be

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
can kind of see on how US Coast can be

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.859 
can kind of see on how US Coast can be
useful<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.860> more<00:01:08.159> defensive<00:01:08.670> situations<00:01:09.299> but

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
useful in more defensive situations but

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.170 
useful in more defensive situations but
as<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.409> see<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.460> enemy<00:01:11.729> does<00:01:11.909> have

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
as you can see the the enemy does have

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.109 
as you can see the the enemy does have
heavy<00:01:13.170> medic<00:01:13.619> combo<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.250> point<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
heavy medic combo on the point and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.550 
heavy medic combo on the point and
there's<00:01:15.360> nothing<00:01:15.479> really<00:01:15.750> much<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.409> at

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
there's nothing really much I can do at

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.289 
there's nothing really much I can do at
this<00:01:16.590> point<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.280> could<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.670> after<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> medic

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
this point I could go after the medic

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.550 
this point I could go after the medic
which<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.659> decide<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.200> right<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.470> i'm

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.430 
some on the crates and some at the
bottom<00:02:30.319> so<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.860> really<00:02:31.459> allows<00:02:31.670> me<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.000> be<00:02:32.440> to

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
bottom so I really allows me to be to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.870 
bottom so I really allows me to be to
cover<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.709> lot<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.920> distances<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.580> go<00:02:34.730> and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
cover a lot of distances this go and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.860 
cover a lot of distances this go and
that's<00:02:34.940> really<00:02:35.150> what<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.360> want<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.630> do<00:02:35.720> on

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
that's really what you want to do on

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.259 
that's really what you want to do on
this<00:02:35.989> map<00:02:36.230> as<00:02:36.440> much<00:02:36.650> as<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.860> can<00:02:37.090> get<00:02:38.090> me

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
this map as much as you can get me

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.210 
this map as much as you can get me
actually<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:38.810> has<00:02:38.959> quite<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.260> bit<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.500> scouts<00:02:39.859> I

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
actually now has quite a bit of scouts I

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.940 
actually now has quite a bit of scouts I
stole<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.090> health<00:02:41.900> pack<00:02:42.140> from<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.530> heavy

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
stole that health pack from the heavy

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.500 
stole that health pack from the heavy
there<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.370> gave<00:02:43.549> him<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.790> little<00:02:44.030> bat<00:02:44.209> as<00:02:44.480> a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
there and I gave him a little bat as a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.319 
there and I gave him a little bat as a
as<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:45.109> salute<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.829> guess<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:46.340> that's<00:02:47.209> kind

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
as a salute I guess because that's kind

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.759 
as a salute I guess because that's kind
of<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.510> bad<00:02:47.690> play<00:02:47.930> by<00:02:48.079> mean<00:02:48.260> probably<00:02:48.560> should

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
of a bad play by mean probably should

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.289 
of a bad play by mean probably should
let<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.070> heavy<00:02:49.250> have<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.640> health<00:02:49.850> but<00:02:50.150> I

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
let the heavy have the health but I

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.150 
let the heavy have the health but I
didn't<00:02:50.660> recognize<00:02:51.140> him<00:02:51.380> early<00:02:51.680> enough<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:52.010> let

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
didn't recognize him early enough to let

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.789 
didn't recognize him early enough to let
him<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.120> my<00:02:53.600> mistake<00:02:53.959> but<00:02:54.230> instead

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
him do that so my mistake but instead

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.420 
way to the point you kind of get
surprised<00:04:20.350> by<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:20.590> century<00:04:21.039> and<00:04:21.160> that<00:04:21.280> gives

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
surprised by that century and that gives

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.189 
surprised by that century and that gives
me<00:04:21.549> enough<00:04:21.579> time<00:04:21.789> to<00:04:22.240> get<00:04:22.389> a<00:04:22.449> couple<00:04:22.810> shots<00:04:22.840> on

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
me enough time to get a couple shots on

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.500 
me enough time to get a couple shots on
them<00:04:23.320> but<00:04:23.949> now<00:04:24.460> you're<00:04:25.180> actually<00:04:25.300> defending

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
them but now you're actually defending

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.270 
them but now you're actually defending
this<00:04:25.870> last<00:04:26.110> point<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:26.740> is<00:04:27.070> what<00:04:27.190> you're

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
this last point and that is what you're

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.040 
this last point and that is what you're
going<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.460> be<00:04:27.550> seeing<00:04:27.760> for<00:04:28.030> most<00:04:28.449> of<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.720> video

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
going to be seeing for most of the video

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.439 
going to be seeing for most of the video
actually<00:04:29.699> but<00:04:30.699> they<00:04:31.090> have<00:04:31.240> already

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
actually but they have already

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.909 
actually but they have already
essentially<00:04:31.900> gonna<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.169> second<00:04:32.530> point<00:04:32.650> so

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
essentially gonna the second point so

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.159 
essentially gonna the second point so
I'm<00:04:33.220> unable<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.910> really<00:04:34.030> push<00:04:34.330> out<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:34.690> chase

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
I'm unable to really push out and chase

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.560 
I'm unable to really push out and chase
that<00:04:35.410> medic<00:04:35.740> there<00:04:35.919> so<00:04:36.490> I'm<00:04:36.910> stuck<00:04:37.060> as<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.270> scout

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
that medic there so I'm stuck as a scout

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.800 
that medic there so I'm stuck as a scout
here<00:04:38.050> but<00:04:38.410> it<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.340> kind<00:04:39.550> of<00:04:39.610> an<00:04:39.700> open<00:04:40.090> point<00:04:40.360> and

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
here but it is kind of an open point and

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.650 
here but it is kind of an open point and
there's<00:04:41.349> a<00:04:41.410> things<00:04:42.010> up<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.580> few<00:04:42.910> all<00:04:43.150> gets<00:04:43.389> hot

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
there's a things up a few all gets hot

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.000 
there's a things up a few all gets hot
rain<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.110> know<00:04:44.169> we<00:04:44.289> got<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.560> pipes<00:04:44.770> up<00:04:44.979> top

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
rain you know we got the pipes up top

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.790 
rain you know we got the pipes up top
which<00:04:45.400> allows<00:04:46.120> me<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.389> do<00:04:46.510> a<00:04:46.539> few<00:04:47.320> neat<00:04:47.560> things

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
which allows me to do a few neat things

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.760 
which allows me to do a few neat things
as<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.010> scout<00:04:48.310> here<00:04:48.550> but<00:04:49.289> but<00:04:50.289> Jack<00:04:50.440> couldn't<00:04:50.710> be

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
as a scout here but but Jack couldn't be

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.159 
as a scout here but but Jack couldn't be
chillin<00:04:51.070> back<00:04:51.190> waiting<00:04:51.430> for<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.760> enemy<00:04:52.169> but

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
chillin back waiting for the enemy but

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.719 
chillin back waiting for the enemy but
yeah<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.770> would<00:04:53.919> actually<00:04:54.039> be<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.310> good<00:04:54.580> time

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
yeah that would actually be a good time

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.129 
yeah that would actually be a good time
for<00:04:54.789> me<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.120> talk<00:04:55.389> about<00:04:55.450> what's<00:04:55.900> going<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.080> be

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
for me to talk about what's going to be

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.719 
for me to talk about what's going to be
coming<00:04:56.289> out<00:04:56.500> in<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.710> future<00:04:57.010> of<00:04:57.099> T<00:04:57.250> of<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.520> hear

i think in mid-september as well as
announced<00:05:00.789> that<00:05:00.880> they're<00:05:01.240> going<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.450> release

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
announced that they're going to release

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.110 
announced that they're going to release
the<00:05:02.050> polycount<00:05:02.889> update<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.490> that's<00:05:03.880> gonna<00:05:04.000> be

the polycount update and that's gonna be

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.430 
the polycount update and that's gonna be
actually<00:05:04.330> one<00:05:04.419> of<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:04.570> biggest<00:05:04.810> updates<00:05:05.260> to

new<00:05:11.050> weapons<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:11.919> game<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.610> cool

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
new weapons to the game and the cool

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.089 
new weapons to the game and the cool
thing<00:05:13.300> is<00:05:13.570> in<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.110> recent<00:05:14.440> interview<00:05:14.530> valve

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
thing is in a recent interview valve

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.469 
thing is in a recent interview valve
actually<00:05:15.310> said<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:15.580> they<00:05:15.820> can<00:05:15.940> be<00:05:16.030> taking<00:05:16.389> a

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
actually said that they can be taking a

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.560 
actually said that they can be taking a
lot<00:05:16.810> of<00:05:16.960> time<00:05:17.200> to<00:05:17.849> design<00:05:18.849> these<00:05:19.120> weapons

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
lot of time to design these weapons

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.240 
lot of time to design these weapons
attributes<00:05:20.349> and<00:05:20.470> whatnot<00:05:20.770> so<00:05:20.800> it's<00:05:21.070> not<00:05:21.130> going

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
attributes and whatnot so it's not going

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.920 
attributes and whatnot so it's not going
to<00:05:21.340> be<00:05:21.400> like<00:05:21.490> one<00:05:21.669> of<00:05:21.700> those<00:05:21.849> crappy<00:05:22.419> community

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
to be like one of those crappy community

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.250 
to be like one of those crappy community
made<00:05:23.110> weapons<00:05:23.320> where<00:05:23.800> they<00:05:24.370> stick<00:05:24.639> on<00:05:24.820> like<00:05:25.060> a

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
made weapons where they stick on like a

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.589 
made weapons where they stick on like a
little<00:05:26.260> like<00:05:26.500> damage<00:05:27.340> boost<00:05:27.639> and<00:05:27.940> slow<00:05:28.570> down

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
little like damage boost and slow down

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:29.820 
little like damage boost and slow down
or<00:05:29.020> something<00:05:29.260> like<00:05:29.349> that<00:05:29.410> they're<00:05:29.710> actually

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
or something like that they're actually

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.070 
or something like that they're actually
going<00:05:30.039> to<00:05:30.130> design<00:05:30.430> these<00:05:30.610> weapons<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.090> be

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
going to design these weapons to be

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.809 
going to design these weapons to be
to<00:05:32.409> have<00:05:32.770> a<00:05:32.800> little<00:05:32.979> bit<00:05:33.159> of<00:05:33.189> a<00:05:33.310> different<00:05:33.639> edge

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
to have a little bit of a different edge

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.879 
to have a little bit of a different edge
so<00:05:34.270> that'll<00:05:34.689> be<00:05:34.780> actually<00:05:35.050> pretty<00:05:35.349> cool<00:05:35.620> to

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
so that'll be actually pretty cool to

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.290 
so that'll be actually pretty cool to
see<00:05:35.919> so<00:05:36.370> there's<00:05:36.669> going<00:05:36.789> to<00:05:36.909> be<00:05:36.939> a<00:05:37.000> lot<00:05:37.270> of

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
see so there's going to be a lot of

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.550 
see so there's going to be a lot of
stuff<00:05:37.599> coming<00:05:37.750> out<00:05:37.990> there<00:05:38.229> i'm<00:05:38.409> actually

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
stuff coming out there i'm actually

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.290 
stuff coming out there i'm actually
really<00:05:38.979> excited<00:05:39.099> to<00:05:39.729> try<00:05:39.759> out<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.270> new

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
really excited to try out the new

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.240 
really excited to try out the new
weapons<00:05:40.689> when<00:05:40.840> they<00:05:40.870> do<00:05:40.990> come<00:05:41.080> out<00:05:41.409> but<00:05:41.979> i

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
weapons when they do come out but i

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.290 
weapons when they do come out but i
don't<00:05:42.490> think<00:05:42.639> that's<00:05:42.699> coming<00:05:43.030> until

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
don't think that's coming until

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469 
about to attack and picking my spots of

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:19.499 
about to attack and picking my spots of
course<00:06:17.680> like<00:06:17.860> I<00:06:17.949> said<00:06:18.129> before<00:06:18.250> to<00:06:18.969> attack<00:06:19.330> the

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
course like I said before to attack the

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.600 
course like I said before to attack the
enemy<00:06:20.050> trying<00:06:20.710> to<00:06:20.800> pick<00:06:20.919> off<00:06:21.069> that<00:06:21.190> soldier

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
enemy trying to pick off that soldier

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.740 
enemy trying to pick off that soldier
there<00:06:21.729> and<00:06:21.849> always<00:06:21.969> kind<00:06:22.210> of<00:06:22.330> at<00:06:22.449> low<00:06:22.599> health

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
there and always kind of at low health

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.899 
there and always kind of at low health
of<00:06:22.990> course<00:06:23.680> the<00:06:23.740> enemy<00:06:23.919> does<00:06:23.949> have<00:06:24.310> a<00:06:24.340> level<00:06:24.639> 3

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
of course the enemy does have a level 3

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:26.399 
of course the enemy does have a level 3
century<00:06:25.240> gun<00:06:25.389> they're<00:06:25.569> trying<00:06:25.870> to<00:06:25.900> do<00:06:26.110> my<00:06:26.229> best

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409 
century gun they're trying to do my best

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:27.600 
century gun they're trying to do my best
to<00:06:26.529> pistol<00:06:26.889> it<00:06:27.009> but<00:06:27.159> I<00:06:27.219> don't<00:06:27.340> think<00:06:27.400> that's

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
to pistol it but I don't think that's

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.980 
to pistol it but I don't think that's
going<00:06:27.699> to<00:06:27.759> do<00:06:27.909> much<00:06:28.090> to<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.360> engineer<00:06:28.840> behind

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
going to do much to the engineer behind

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.140 
going to do much to the engineer behind
it<00:06:29.319> but<00:06:29.919> again<00:06:30.279> it's<00:06:30.460> kind<00:06:30.610> of<00:06:30.639> hard<00:06:30.879> for<00:06:30.909> us<00:06:31.120> to

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
it but again it's kind of hard for us to

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.909 
it but again it's kind of hard for us to
push<00:06:31.419> out<00:06:31.629> I'm<00:06:32.050> actually<00:06:32.289> surprised<00:06:32.800> that

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
push out I'm actually surprised that

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.769 
push out I'm actually surprised that
we've<00:06:33.069> been<00:06:33.189> able<00:06:33.279> to<00:06:33.430> hold<00:06:33.669> out<00:06:33.849> for<00:06:34.150> so<00:06:34.479> long

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779 
we've been able to hold out for so long

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.230 
we've been able to hold out for so long
seeing<00:06:35.259> as<00:06:35.379> our<00:06:35.500> defenses<00:06:36.039> it's<00:06:37.029> not<00:06:37.120> really

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
seeing as our defenses it's not really

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.420 
seeing as our defenses it's not really
made<00:06:37.509> up<00:06:37.629> of<00:06:37.810> too<00:06:37.990> much<00:06:38.139> I<00:06:38.349> do<00:06:38.529> I<00:06:38.860> guess<00:06:39.190> we<00:06:39.310> do

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
made up of too much I do I guess we do

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.550 
made up of too much I do I guess we do
have<00:06:39.460> a<00:06:39.610> heavy<00:06:39.879> there<00:06:40.150> but<00:06:40.419> here<00:06:41.169> again<00:06:41.319> the

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560
