00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
here is a self portrait mode so we can

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.740 
here is a self portrait mode so we can
actually<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.599> had

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
up a little bit we might get the flash

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.170 
up a little bit we might get the flash
even<00:00:39.890> leaving<00:00:40.890> there<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.730> go<00:00:42.980> there<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.219> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
even leaving there we go there you go so

even leaving there we go there you go so
you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.450> flip<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.960> LCD<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.680> 180<00:00:47.370> degrees<00:00:47.760> as

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you can flip this LCD up 180 degrees as

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.180 
you can flip this LCD up 180 degrees as
the<00:00:48.870> position<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.410> that's<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.739> right<00:00:49.950> now

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the position in it that's in right now

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.900 
the position in it that's in right now
and<00:00:50.789> another<00:00:51.420> cool<00:00:51.690> feature<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> back

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
and another cool feature is on the back

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.130 
and another cool feature is on the back
you<00:00:53.910> turn<00:00:54.120> around<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.870> little

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you turn around we have this little

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.830 
you turn around we have this little
kickstand<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:56.879> there's<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.180> kickstand<00:00:57.660> here

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
kickstand so there's this kickstand here

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.889 
kickstand so there's this kickstand here
it's<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> little<00:00:58.199> hard<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.739> single-handed

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
it's a little hard to do single-handed

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.590 
it's a little hard to do single-handed
there<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.969> open<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> kickstand

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
there we go just open up the kickstand

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.289 
there we go just open up the kickstand
and<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.739> lean<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.010> back<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
and then you can lean it back and you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
and then you can lean it back and you
can<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.659> straight<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.560> some<00:01:07.950> portrait<00:01:08.340> shots

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
can do straight on some portrait shots

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.030 
can do straight on some portrait shots
like<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:09.960> lean<00:01:10.229> back<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.710> its<00:01:10.890> own

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
like this so it can lean back on its own

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
like this so it can lean back on its own
as<00:01:11.369> well<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.540> display<00:01:12.930> tilts<00:01:13.680> down<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:15.080> like

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
as well the display tilts down and like

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
as well the display tilts down and like
on<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.439> other<00:01:17.090> articulating<00:01:18.090> models<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
on some other articulating models that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.780 
on some other articulating models that
we've<00:01:18.659> seen<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.740> tilt<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.100> for

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
we've seen so you can tilt it down for

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.160 
we've seen so you can tilt it down for
shooting

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
shooting

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.670 
shooting
below<00:01:22.620> the<00:01:22.800> waist<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.500> also

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.810 
below the waist like so you can also
tilt<00:01:26.010> it<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.360> for<00:01:27.360> some<00:01:27.479> overhead<00:01:27.870> shots

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
tilt it up for some overhead shots

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.210 
tilt it up for some overhead shots
