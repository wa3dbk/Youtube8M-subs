Green Mountain Grill Daniel Boone model

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.379 
Green Mountain Grill Daniel Boone model
now<00:00:07.830> before<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.910> had<00:00:09.030> looked<00:00:09.179> at

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
now before I got this I had looked at

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.650 
now before I got this I had looked at
several<00:00:09.929> different<00:00:11.000> pellet<00:00:12.000> grills<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.450> see

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
several different pellet grills to see

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.419 
several different pellet grills to see
which<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.019> wanted<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.009> course<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
which one I wanted and of course the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.490 
which one I wanted and of course the
trigger<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.389> was<00:00:15.509> headed<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.809> way<00:00:15.990> but

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
trigger and I was headed that way but

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.359 
trigger and I was headed that way but
actually<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.940> grill<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.740> heavier<00:00:19.740> for<00:00:20.279> an

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
actually this grill is heavier for an

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.109 
actually this grill is heavier for an
equivalent<00:00:20.609> size<00:00:22.100> trigger<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.939> is

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
equivalent size trigger this is

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.580 
equivalent size trigger this is
equivalent<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.070> elite<00:00:26.070> little<00:00:26.580> Tex<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
equivalent to the elite little Tex and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
equivalent to the elite little Tex and
it<00:00:28.590> has<00:00:28.769> way<00:00:29.189> more<00:00:29.220> features<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.269> got<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> low

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
it has way more features it's got a low

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.130 
it has way more features it's got a low
pellet<00:00:31.230> sensor<00:00:31.790> and<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.030> way<00:00:33.329> more<00:00:33.870> accurate

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
pellet sensor and it's way more accurate

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.799 
pellet sensor and it's way more accurate
as<00:00:34.620> far<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.399> temperature<00:00:36.120> setting<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
as far as the temperature setting and it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.049 
as far as the temperature setting and it
also<00:00:36.960> blows<00:00:37.500> itself<00:00:37.950> clean<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.820> done

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
also blows itself clean when it's done

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.880 
also blows itself clean when it's done
it<00:00:39.239> has<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> secondary<00:00:39.930> fan<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.379> blow<00:00:40.500> itself

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it has a secondary fan to blow itself

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.490 
it has a secondary fan to blow itself
clean<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> decided<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.540> go<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.020> model

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
clean so I decided to go with this model

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440

it<00:02:34.360> was<00:02:34.480> quality<00:02:34.720> checked<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.379> way<00:02:35.670> they<00:02:36.670> had

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
it was quality checked that way they had

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.789 
it was quality checked that way they had
a<00:02:36.849> checklist<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.540> was<00:02:37.720> all<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.079> Chinese<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:38.769> I

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
a checklist that was all in Chinese so I

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.440 
a checklist that was all in Chinese so I
don't<00:02:39.069> know<00:02:39.129> what<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.459> actually<00:02:39.640> said<00:02:40.090> but<00:02:40.329> it

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
don't know what it actually said but it

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.660 
don't know what it actually said but it
looked<00:02:40.629> like<00:02:40.780> they'd<00:02:41.129> done<00:02:42.129> some<00:02:42.370> kind<00:02:42.549> of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
looked like they'd done some kind of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.670 
looked like they'd done some kind of
checking<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.239> now<00:02:43.360> I'm<00:02:43.480> flipping<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.930> over<00:02:44.079> and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
checking so now I'm flipping it over and

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.039 
checking so now I'm flipping it over and
the<00:02:44.769> instructions<00:02:45.220> say<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.609> it<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.849> way<00:02:46.090> I

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
the instructions say to do it this way I

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.630 
the instructions say to do it this way I
have<00:02:47.680> watched<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.549> review<00:02:49.030> or<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.329> video<00:02:50.019> online

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
have watched a review or a video online

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.220 
have watched a review or a video online
from<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.849> Green<00:02:52.120> Mountain<00:02:52.450> Grylls<00:02:52.690> website

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
from the Green Mountain Grylls website

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.759 
from the Green Mountain Grylls website
that<00:02:53.799> showed<00:02:54.010> him<00:02:54.190> kind<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.879> doing<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:55.329> and<00:02:55.769> I

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
that showed him kind of doing this and I

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.050 
that showed him kind of doing this and I
just<00:02:57.129> thought<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.280> could<00:02:57.489> make<00:02:57.609> a<00:02:57.639> little<00:02:57.909> bit

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
just thought I could make a little bit

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.879 
just thought I could make a little bit
better<00:02:58.269> video<00:02:58.659> from<00:02:59.170> somebody<00:02:59.560> that's<00:02:59.739> not

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
better video from somebody that's not

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.559 
better video from somebody that's not
trained<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.489> is<00:03:00.639> the<00:03:00.730> first<00:03:00.970> time<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.180> put<00:03:01.420> one

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
trained this is the first time I put one

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.780 
trained this is the first time I put one
of<00:03:01.659> these<00:03:01.750> together<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:03.340> thought<00:03:03.489> I'd<00:03:03.609> show

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
of these together and I thought I'd show

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:13.540 
of these together and I thought I'd show
you<00:03:03.819> how<00:03:03.970> easy<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.420> is

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.250 

flip<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.240> out<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.600> front<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:15.110> can<00:03:15.230> see

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
flip it out to the front you can see

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.870 
flip it out to the front you can see
that<00:03:15.590> there's<00:03:15.740> bolts<00:03:16.100> for<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> handle

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
that there's bolts for the handle

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.490 
that there's bolts for the handle
they<00:03:17.120> actually<00:03:17.300> bolt<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.930> handle<00:03:18.320> on<00:03:18.410> the

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
they actually bolt the handle on the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.570 
they actually bolt the handle on the
inside<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.190> lid<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.460> make<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.970> easier<00:03:20.360> to

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
inside of the lid to make it easier to

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.550 
inside of the lid to make it easier to
package<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.880> assume<00:03:23.110> it's<00:03:24.110> a<00:03:24.170> pretty<00:03:24.410> good

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
package it I assume it's a pretty good

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.970 
package it I assume it's a pretty good
idea<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.700> handle<00:03:26.060> has<00:03:26.210> some

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
idea and the handle has some

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.970 
idea and the handle has some
heat-resistant<00:03:27.980> washers<00:03:28.400> two<00:03:28.910> per<00:03:29.840> side<00:03:29.980> so

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
heat-resistant washers two per side so

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.460 
heat-resistant washers two per side so
there's<00:03:31.190> four<00:03:31.570> two<00:03:32.570> on<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.810> inside<00:03:33.110> two<00:03:33.350> on

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
there's four two on the inside two on

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.320 
there's four two on the inside two on
the<00:03:33.560> outsides<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.190> four<00:03:34.490> per<00:03:34.760> side<00:03:37.330> works

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
the outsides of this four per side works

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.820 
the outsides of this four per side works
out<00:03:38.480> with<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.780> will<00:03:38.960> my<00:03:39.200> handle<00:03:39.560> hasn't

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
out with the will my handle hasn't

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:52.510 
out with the will my handle hasn't
gotten<00:03:39.950> hot<00:03:40.220> yet<00:03:40.490> so<00:03:40.880> I<00:03:40.910> like<00:03:41.180> that

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.860 

comes<00:03:53.520> with<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> starter<00:03:53.970> bag<00:03:54.300> of<00:03:54.480> pellets<00:03:54.660> that

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
comes with a starter bag of pellets that

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.980 
comes with a starter bag of pellets that
you<00:03:54.990> put<00:03:55.200> in<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.350> firebox<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:56.570> that<00:03:57.570> prevents

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
you put in the firebox and that prevents

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.340 
you put in the firebox and that prevents
you<00:03:58.080> from<00:03:58.250> overheating<00:03:59.250> your<00:04:00.230> firing<00:04:01.230> rod

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
you from overheating your firing rod

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.530 
you from overheating your firing rod
grease<00:04:04.350> bucket<00:04:04.680> on<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.830> side

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.970 

now<00:04:09.540> there's<00:04:09.720> notches<00:04:10.170> for<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.590> fit<00:04:10.800> into

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
now there's notches for that to fit into

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.470 
now there's notches for that to fit into
I<00:04:11.190> don't<00:04:11.460> know<00:04:11.520> what<00:04:11.670> they<00:04:11.790> call<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.240> but<00:04:12.390> the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
I don't know what they call that but the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.610 
I don't know what they call that but the
center<00:04:12.750> panel<00:04:12.900> there's<00:04:13.650> also<00:04:13.920> some<00:04:14.310> heat

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
center panel there's also some heat

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.920 
center panel there's also some heat
diffusers<00:04:16.620> or<00:04:16.799> reflectors<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.700> guess<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.209> I've

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
diffusers or reflectors I guess and I've

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.099 
diffusers or reflectors I guess and I've
been<00:04:19.200> told<00:04:19.470> not<00:04:19.920> to<00:04:19.980> put<00:04:20.370> those<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.910> because<00:04:21.209> it

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
been told not to put those in because it

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.140 
been told not to put those in because it
just<00:04:22.170> takes<00:04:22.560> longer<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:23.160> your<00:04:23.340> grilled<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
just takes longer for your grilled the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.690 
just takes longer for your grilled the
heat<00:04:24.360> up<00:04:24.510> it<00:04:24.750> what<00:04:25.710> they<00:04:25.890> do<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.250> they<00:04:26.370> prevent

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
heat up it what they do is they prevent

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.170 
heat up it what they do is they prevent
hotspots<00:04:27.000> like<00:04:27.600> if<00:04:27.810> you're<00:04:27.960> really<00:04:28.710> picky<00:04:29.180> but

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
hotspots like if you're really picky but

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.530 
hotspots like if you're really picky but
I<00:04:30.290> didn't<00:04:31.290> put<00:04:31.410> mine<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:32.280> hole<00:04:32.640> has<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.390> go

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
I didn't put mine in that hole has to go

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.920 
I didn't put mine in that hole has to go
on<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.990> left<00:04:34.640> there's<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.760> sensor<00:04:36.240> for<00:04:36.480> sensing

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
on the left there's a sensor for sensing

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.930 
on the left there's a sensor for sensing
your<00:04:37.050> temperature<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.919> needs<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.520> space

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
your temperature and it needs that space

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.830 
your temperature and it needs that space
from<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.210> hole

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
from that hole

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.140 
from that hole
I've<00:04:40.590> actually<00:04:41.160> called<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.580> green<00:04:41.820> mountain

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
I've actually called the green mountain

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.460 
I've actually called the green mountain
people<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.630> they<00:04:42.690> said<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.050> biggest<00:04:43.290> problem

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
people and they said the biggest problem

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.260 
people and they said the biggest problem
with<00:04:43.770> people<00:04:43.919> have<00:04:44.160> with<00:04:44.370> assembly<00:04:44.850> is<00:04:45.030> they

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
with people have with assembly is they

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.770 
with people have with assembly is they
put<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.840> hole<00:04:46.080> on<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.380> right<00:04:46.500> hand<00:04:46.950> side<00:04:47.070> so

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
put the hole on the right hand side so
