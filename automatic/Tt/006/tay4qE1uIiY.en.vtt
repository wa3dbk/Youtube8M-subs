triggers<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.140> I'm<00:01:51.920> no<00:01:52.100> rocket<00:01:52.369> scientist<00:01:53.240> but

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.300 
triggers and I'm no rocket scientist but
I<00:01:53.690> think<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.290> means<00:01:54.530> it's<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.830> good<00:01:54.860> bet<00:01:55.280> that

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
I think that means it's a good bet that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.040 
I think that means it's a good bet that
your<00:01:55.670> attack<00:01:55.910> must<00:01:56.149> be<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> shield<00:01:56.780> trigger

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
your attack must be a shield trigger

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.700 
your attack must be a shield trigger
