00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
programming look at that and in a very

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.620 
programming look at that and in a very
short<00:04:28.700> bit<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.790> writing<00:04:30.210> they're<00:04:30.360> going<00:04:30.540> to

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.720 
short bit of writing they're going to
explain<00:04:31.020> what<00:04:31.620> this<00:04:31.830> program<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.640> why

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
explain what this program is and why

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.060 
explain what this program is and why
it's<00:04:32.910> interesting<00:04:33.560> but<00:04:34.560> that's<00:04:34.740> what<00:04:34.950> you

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
it's interesting but that's what you

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.590 
it's interesting but that's what you
want<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.370> come<00:04:35.520> up<00:04:35.640> with<00:04:35.850> what<00:04:36.330> is<00:04:36.360> this

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
want to come up with what is this

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.360 
want to come up with what is this
program<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.170> why<00:04:37.320> it's<00:04:37.500> interesting<00:04:37.650> that

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
program and why it's interesting that

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.980 
program and why it's interesting that
you've<00:04:38.580> designed<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.270> could<00:04:39.450> be<00:04:39.540> again<00:04:39.780> a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
you've designed and it could be again a

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.410 
you've designed and it could be again a
walk<00:04:40.320> through<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.680> museum<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:41.160> tour<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.700> know

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
walk through the museum a tour you know

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.140 
walk through the museum a tour you know
specifically<00:04:43.260> done<00:04:43.560> by<00:04:43.860> an<00:04:44.040> artist<00:04:44.550> who<00:04:44.760> will

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
specifically done by an artist who will

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.970 
specifically done by an artist who will
have<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.330> different<00:04:45.630> insight<00:04:45.900> or<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.710> could<00:04:46.860> be

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
have a different insight or it could be

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.120 
have a different insight or it could be
a<00:04:47.010> workshop<00:04:47.280> or<00:04:47.730> it<00:04:48.030> could<00:04:48.150> be<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.300> lecture

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
a workshop or it could be a lecture

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.290 
a workshop or it could be a lecture
workshops<00:04:50.130> in<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.340> way<00:04:50.460> are<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.730> easiest<00:04:51.060> their

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
workshops in a way are the easiest their

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.780 
workshops in a way are the easiest their
hands<00:04:51.690> on<00:04:51.810> people<00:04:52.350> like<00:04:52.560> them<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.400> define

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
hands on people like them that define

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.610 
hands on people like them that define
periods<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.420> time<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:54.990> then<00:04:55.170> they're<00:04:55.410> easy

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
periods of time and then they're easy

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.300 
periods of time and then they're easy
really<00:04:56.480> showing<00:04:57.480> people<00:04:57.900> how<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.310> photograph

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
really showing people how to photograph

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.120 
really showing people how to photograph
how<00:04:59.670> to<00:04:59.730> paint<00:05:00.090> how<00:05:00.540> to<00:05:00.600> draw<00:05:01.020> but<00:05:01.830> in<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:02.010> way

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
how to paint how to draw but in a way

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.100 
how to paint how to draw but in a way
that's<00:05:02.400> somehow<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.970> little<00:05:03.270> bit<00:05:03.510> different<00:05:03.930> so

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
that's somehow a little bit different so

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.540 
that's somehow a little bit different so
the<00:05:04.200> public<00:05:04.530> comes<00:05:04.740> in<00:05:04.980> and<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.280> don't<00:05:05.460> have

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
the public comes in and you don't have

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.690 
the public comes in and you don't have
to<00:05:05.669> be<00:05:05.790> an<00:05:05.880> artist<00:05:06.330> in<00:05:06.510> order<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.930> do<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.700> the

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
to be an artist in order to do it the

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.450 
to be an artist in order to do it the
way<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:08.850> begin<00:05:09.060> this<00:05:09.300> process<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:11.010> look<00:05:11.310> at

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
way to begin this process is to look at

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.250 
way to begin this process is to look at
the<00:05:11.550> local<00:05:11.730> museum<00:05:11.940> that's<00:05:12.480> near<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:12.990> or

within drivable distance and find the

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.230 
within drivable distance and find the
contact<00:05:16.140> number<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:17.130> director<00:05:17.730> of<00:05:17.910> the
