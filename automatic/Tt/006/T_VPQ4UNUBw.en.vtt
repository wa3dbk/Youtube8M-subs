unfortunately<00:04:17.540> his<00:04:18.169> little<00:04:18.590> comma<00:04:18.889> here<00:04:19.280> is

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
unfortunately his little comma here is

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.580 
unfortunately his little comma here is
preventing<00:04:20.090> him<00:04:20.209> from<00:04:20.239> moving<00:04:20.720> like<00:04:21.139> his<00:04:21.320> legs

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
preventing him from moving like his legs

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.790 
preventing him from moving like his legs

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
so he does have ball hinged uh double

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.320 
so he does have ball hinged uh double
ball<00:04:24.980> hinge<00:04:25.190> knees<00:04:25.430> if<00:04:25.760> you<00:04:26.000> can<00:04:26.150> see<00:04:26.300> that
