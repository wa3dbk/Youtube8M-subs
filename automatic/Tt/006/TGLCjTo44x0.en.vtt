00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.820 

then<00:01:49.720> I<00:01:49.990> did<00:01:50.230> find<00:01:50.500> two<00:01:50.740> strategy<00:01:51.490> guides

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
guess they got water damage because it's

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.280 
guess they got water damage because it's
been<00:01:58.060> raining<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.480> lot<00:01:58.600> that's<00:01:58.810> why<00:01:59.020> I<00:01:59.050> haven't
