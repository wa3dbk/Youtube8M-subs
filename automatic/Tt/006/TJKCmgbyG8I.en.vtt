00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
stable actually consider it does kind of

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.830 
stable actually consider it does kind of
insinuate<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> by<00:01:33.210> stating<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.750> know

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
insinuate that by stating you know

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140 
insinuate that by stating you know
additional<00:01:34.320> updates<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:35.400> GTA<00:01:35.759> online<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
improve the stability and other minor

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.469 
improve the stability and other minor
fixes<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> course<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.000> does<00:01:39.299> suggest

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
fixes so of course that does suggest

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
fixes so of course that does suggest
that<00:01:39.689> they<00:01:39.840> are<00:01:39.960> attempting<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> make<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.799> more

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that they are attempting to make it more

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.649 
that they are attempting to make it more
stable<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.759> whether<00:01:41.970> or<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.210> attempt

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
stable but whether or not that attempt

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.300 
stable but whether or not that attempt
is<00:01:42.750> successful<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.590> guess<00:01:43.979> we'll<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> wait

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
is successful I guess we'll have to wait

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.639 
is successful I guess we'll have to wait
