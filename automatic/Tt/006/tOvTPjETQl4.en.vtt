second by just channeling manatee you

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.650 
second by just channeling manatee you
can<00:03:06.660> use<00:03:07.590> two<00:03:07.860> stacks<00:03:08.209> which<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.480> same

can use two stacks which is the same

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.030 
can use two stacks which is the same
amount<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:10.019> time<00:03:10.230> as<00:03:10.440> actually<00:03:10.739> having<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
glyph so it's no point in having it so I

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.800 
glyph so it's no point in having it so I
just<00:03:13.500> replaced<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.070> with<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.250> bit<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.269> enduring

this is just my gym and then in the made
a<00:04:47.290> socket<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:47.830> have<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.450> PvP<00:04:49.450> gym<00:04:49.950> what<00:04:50.950> the

a socket I have the PvP gym what the

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.350 
a socket I have the PvP gym what the
name<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.460> it<00:04:51.550> is

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
name of it is

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.090 
name of it is
it's<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.690> tyrannical<00:04:53.140> primal<00:04:53.560> diamond<00:04:53.890> and

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
it's the tyrannical primal diamond and

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.420 
it's the tyrannical primal diamond and
the<00:04:54.220> meta<00:04:55.470> I<00:04:56.470> think<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:56.980> covers<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.310> for

the meta I think that covers it for

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.570 
the meta I think that covers it for
jimang<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.390> that's<00:04:59.170> it

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
jimang so that's it
