 fortified supplements such as 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.390
 Calcium and multivitamins are best 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.100
 these drugs come in the form

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.500
 this mixture sprinkle feed objects for 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.250

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:16.550
 we take the second bank fall asleep in it 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.550

 shake so that they sprinkle 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:45.770
 everything can be served to the table if we allow 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.080
 we need to mix some other 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.570
 proportions if you say there you 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.640
 several animals and calcium proportions 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.310
 multivitamins for each their own 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.490
 then just buy one more 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.140
 a jar and there already mix in the right 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.030

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.690
 jar signed there can be signed 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:11.230
