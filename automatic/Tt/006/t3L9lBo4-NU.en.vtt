we're gonna take a look at the lick this
in<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.040> key<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.220> B<00:00:05.460> flat<00:00:05.490> minor<00:00:06.060> we're<00:00:06.809> gonna

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
in the key of B flat minor we're gonna

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.980 
in the key of B flat minor we're gonna
use<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.830> series<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.250> sweet<00:00:08.910> picked<00:00:09.150> arpeggios

use a series of sweet picked arpeggios

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.850 
use a series of sweet picked arpeggios
and<00:00:10.410> then<00:00:10.500> do<00:00:10.919> a<00:00:10.950> chromatic<00:00:11.460> run<00:00:12.559> that<00:00:13.559> uses

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
and then do a chromatic run that uses

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.680 
and then do a chromatic run that uses
some<00:00:14.070> outside<00:00:14.669> notes<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.150> give<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.509> bit<00:00:15.660> more

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
some outside notes to give it a bit more

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.020 
some outside notes to give it a bit more
flavor<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.289> bit<00:00:16.320> more<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.980> jazzy<00:00:17.520> twist

flavor a bit more of a a jazzy twist
I'll<00:00:18.779> poke<00:00:18.990> through<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.349> to<00:00:19.380> speed<00:00:19.740> start<00:00:20.099> with

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.269 

let's<00:00:26.369> break<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.730> lip<00:00:26.910> down<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:28.130> start<00:00:29.130> off

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
let's break this lip down I start off

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.150 
let's break this lip down I start off
with<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.759> run<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:31.189> three<00:00:32.189> different<00:00:32.850> arpeggios

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
with a run of three different arpeggios

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.690 
with a run of three different arpeggios
the<00:00:35.160> first<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.670> being<00:00:36.150> F<00:00:36.510> sharp<00:00:37.200> major<00:00:37.500> 7<00:00:37.860> or<00:00:38.220> G

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the first one being F sharp major 7 or G

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.740 
the first one being F sharp major 7 or G
flat<00:00:38.730> major<00:00:39.240> 7<00:00:40.220> which<00:00:41.220> is<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:44.300> then<00:00:45.300> move<00:00:45.540> up

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
flat major 7 which is this then move up

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.950 
flat major 7 which is this then move up
to<00:00:45.810> a<00:00:46.170> flat<00:00:47.180> dominant<00:00:48.180> 7<00:00:52.190> hmm<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.790> then<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> B

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to a flat dominant 7 hmm and then do a B

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.860 
to a flat dominant 7 hmm and then do a B
flat<00:00:55.320> minor<00:00:55.740> 7<00:00:56.010> which<00:00:56.580> is<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.180> root<00:00:57.390> note<00:00:57.630> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
flat minor 7 which is the root note and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.929 
flat minor 7 which is the root note and
arpeggio<00:00:58.860> going<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.730> across<00:00:59.910> 5<00:01:00.420> strings<00:01:04.939> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
arpeggio going up across 5 strings so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.169 
arpeggio going up across 5 strings so
let's<00:01:06.840> break<00:01:06.990> those<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.219> the<00:01:08.399> F<00:01:08.609> sharp<00:01:09.000> or

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
let's break those down so the F sharp or

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:14.270 
let's break those down so the F sharp or
G<00:01:09.240> flat<00:01:09.420> major<00:01:10.259> 7<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.920> 9<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:13.380> hammer<00:01:13.740> onto<00:01:14.009> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
G flat major 7 is 9 you hammer onto the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.969 
G flat major 7 is 9 you hammer onto the
13th<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.570> play<00:01:18.899> my<00:01:19.679> 2nd<00:01:20.100> finger

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.859 

my<00:01:23.579> first<00:01:23.969> finger<00:01:24.390> goes<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.899> 10<00:01:25.740> G<00:01:29.030> 10<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.299> 11<00:01:30.719> on

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
my first finger goes to 10 G 10 to 11 on

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.520 
my first finger goes to 10 G 10 to 11 on
the<00:01:30.990> gene

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.380 

and<00:01:36.530> then<00:01:36.649> come<00:01:36.950> back<00:01:36.979> down<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.909> arpeggio

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
and then come back down the arpeggio

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.300 
and then come back down the arpeggio
with<00:01:40.329> eleventh<00:01:41.329> on<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.930> D<00:01:43.539> 13th<00:01:44.539> on<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.350> now

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.780 

that's<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.990> arpeggio<00:03:30.290> over<00:03:30.620> one<00:03:30.860> octave<00:03:31.250> but

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
that's the arpeggio over one octave but

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.370 
that's the arpeggio over one octave but
with<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.000> b-flat<00:03:32.360> minor<00:03:32.630> seven<00:03:33.110> we're<00:03:33.260> going

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
to go up two octaves so next note is

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.870 
to go up two octaves so next note is
fourteenth<00:03:40.100> on<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.580> B<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.590> then<00:03:43.100> thirteenth

fourteenth on the B and then thirteenth
on<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.360> E<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:50.530> we<00:03:51.530> hammer<00:03:51.770> on<00:03:52.040> up<00:03:52.490> to<00:03:52.850> the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
on the E and we hammer on up to the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.320 
on the E and we hammer on up to the
sixteenth<00:03:54.140> on<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.530> E<00:03:54.710> just<00:03:55.550> put<00:03:55.820> those<00:03:55.970> three

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
sixteenth on the E just put those three

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:14.530 
sixteenth on the E just put those three
operators<00:03:56.780> together<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.940> is<00:04:14.150> where<00:04:14.270> we<00:04:14.390> do

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
operators together this is where we do

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.180 
operators together this is where we do
the<00:04:14.570> chromatic<00:04:15.170> run<00:04:15.380> down<00:04:15.590> once<00:04:15.800> you<00:04:15.860> get<00:04:16.070> to

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
the chromatic run down once you get to

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.650 
the chromatic run down once you get to
that<00:04:16.310> stage<00:04:16.370> now<00:04:17.210> I<00:04:17.239> said<00:04:17.480> we're<00:04:17.630> using

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
that stage now I said we're using

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.070 
that stage now I said we're using
outside<00:04:18.200> notes<00:04:19.210> outside<00:04:20.210> notes<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:20.840> notes

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
outside notes outside notes and notes

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.520 
outside notes outside notes and notes
that<00:04:21.230> aren't<00:04:21.590> contained<00:04:22.190> within<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.730> scale

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
that aren't contained within the scale

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.740 
that aren't contained within the scale
so<00:04:24.530> here<00:04:24.770> I'm<00:04:25.010> just<00:04:25.190> doing<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.670> note<00:04:26.120> one<00:04:26.360> note

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
so here I'm just doing a note one note

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.990 
so here I'm just doing a note one note
run<00:04:26.930> that's<00:04:27.230> all<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.800> chromatic<00:04:28.340> means<00:04:28.550> okay

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
run that's all that chromatic means okay

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.200 
run that's all that chromatic means okay
so<00:04:30.190> 16<00:04:31.210> 15<00:04:32.210> 14<00:04:32.920> 13<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:36.530> then<00:04:37.430> same<00:04:37.790> again<00:04:38.090> on

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
so 16 15 14 13 and then same again on

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.740 
so 16 15 14 13 and then same again on
the<00:04:38.300> B<00:04:38.450> string<00:04:38.620> 16<00:04:39.620> 15<00:04:40.250> 14<00:04:40.580> 13

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
the B string 16 15 14 13

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.930 
the B string 16 15 14 13
I<00:04:43.580> then<00:04:44.580> play<00:04:45.830> 15<00:04:46.830> 30<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:48.170> then<00:04:49.170> finish<00:04:49.500> with

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
I then play 15 30 and then finish with

00:04:49.940 --> 00:05:12.059 
I then play 15 30 and then finish with
15<00:04:50.940> D<00:04:54.050> 1315<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.680> G<00:04:55.890> so<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.610> run<00:04:56.850> down

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.700 

now<00:05:13.069> this<00:05:13.280> run<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.819> alternate<00:05:14.630> pick<00:05:14.990> as<00:05:15.259> opposed

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
now this run I alternate pick as opposed

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.210 
now this run I alternate pick as opposed
to<00:05:16.569> economy<00:05:17.569> pick<00:05:17.780> or<00:05:17.990> sweet<00:05:18.289> thing<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.949> I<00:05:18.979> go

to economy pick or sweet thing so I go

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:44.969 
to economy pick or sweet thing so I go
down<00:05:19.910> I<00:05:27.849> play<00:05:28.849> the<00:05:28.970> lick<00:05:29.120> all<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.360> way<00:05:29.449> through

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.419 

I'll<00:05:45.979> play<00:05:46.190> through<00:05:46.400> again<00:05:46.699> up<00:05:46.940> to<00:05:47.180> speed
