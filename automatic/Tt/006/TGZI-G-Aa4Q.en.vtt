here's<00:00:51.190> what<00:00:51.400> it<00:00:51.520> says<00:00:53.790> on<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.850> back<00:00:55.120> it<00:00:55.420> has

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
here's what it says on the back it has

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.980 
here's what it says on the back it has
instructions<00:00:55.840> on<00:00:56.350> how<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.560> install<00:00:56.680> it<00:01:00.990> here's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
instructions on how to install it here's

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.170 
instructions on how to install it here's
the<00:01:02.230> other<00:01:02.320> side<00:01:02.710> OneTouch<00:01:03.610> mounting<00:01:04.119> system

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the other side OneTouch mounting system

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.870 
the other side OneTouch mounting system
specifications<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.510> nothing<00:01:07.750> on<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:07.990> bottom

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
specifications and nothing on the bottom

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.180 
specifications and nothing on the bottom
so<00:01:09.880> don't<00:01:10.090> leave<00:01:10.240> open<00:01:10.900> this<00:01:11.170> up<00:01:11.380> show<00:01:12.130> you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
so don't leave open this up show you

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.110 
so don't leave open this up show you
what's<00:01:12.520> inside<00:01:14.190> here's<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.310> mount<00:01:16.210> itself<00:01:18.120> so

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
what's inside here's the mount itself so

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.880 
what's inside here's the mount itself so
you<00:01:19.210> can<00:01:19.360> adjust<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.840> size<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:23.229> by<00:01:25.890> pressing

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
you can adjust the size just by pressing

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.200 
you can adjust the size just by pressing
on<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.220> sides<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:28.330> opens<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.930> up<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:30.040> then<00:01:31.030> I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
on the sides it opens it up and then I

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:48.590 
on the sides it opens it up and then I
think<00:01:31.510> this<00:01:31.720> is<00:01:31.780> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.500 

so<00:01:50.490> squeezing<00:01:51.490> on<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.730> sides<00:01:52.000> makes<00:01:52.390> it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
so squeezing on the sides makes it

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
so squeezing on the sides makes it
expand<00:01:53.340> there's<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.460> middle<00:01:54.700> button<00:01:54.970> over<00:01:55.210> here

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
expand there's a middle button over here

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.640 
expand there's a middle button over here
which<00:01:56.530> makes<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.980> retract<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:58.140> fit<00:01:59.140> onto<00:01:59.380> the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
which makes it retract and fit onto the

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.970 
which makes it retract and fit onto the
phone<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.810> here's<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.260> back<00:02:02.470> side<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:05.740> sure

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
phone so here's the back side not sure

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.940 
phone so here's the back side not sure
what<00:02:06.190> that's<00:02:06.370> for<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:07.290> think<00:02:08.290> you<00:02:08.380> can<00:02:08.530> adjust

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
what that's for I think you can adjust

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.160 
what that's for I think you can adjust
this<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:10.990> knob<00:02:11.290> here<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.930> pretty

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
this with this knob here it's pretty

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.010 
this with this knob here it's pretty
easy<00:02:14.490> see<00:02:15.490> what<00:02:15.700> else<00:02:15.880> was<00:02:16.090> included<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.720> here

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
easy see what else was included in here

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:28.710 
easy see what else was included in here
a<00:02:22.230> suction<00:02:23.230> cup<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:27.459> that's<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.120> these<00:02:28.510> two

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
a suction cup and that's it these two

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.320 
a suction cup and that's it these two
things<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.320> open<00:02:30.130> this<00:02:30.280> up<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:30.940> can<00:02:31.120> show

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
things you open this up so you can show

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.080 
things you open this up so you can show
this<00:02:31.450> section<00:02:34.290> pause<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.910> here's<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
this section pause this here's the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.199 
this section pause this here's the
suction<00:02:37.540> cup<00:02:37.750> where<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.170> either<00:02:39.070> put<00:02:39.520> on<00:02:39.700> here

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
suction cup where you either put on here

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.410 
suction cup where you either put on here
or<00:02:41.170> if<00:02:41.590> down<00:02:41.830> here<00:02:42.040> if<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.280> had<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> dash

suction<00:02:44.170> cup<00:02:44.320> mount<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:45.630> then<00:02:46.630> here<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.350> can

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
suction cup mount and then here you can

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.610 
suction cup mount and then here you can
see<00:02:49.050> how<00:02:50.050> works<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:51.340> tightens<00:02:51.850> on<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.090> side

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
see how works just tightens on the side

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:03.150 
see how works just tightens on the side
righty<00:02:53.620> tighty<00:02:53.739> lefty<00:02:54.010> loosey<00:03:01.950> pretty<00:03:02.950> simple

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
righty tighty lefty loosey pretty simple

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.360 
righty tighty lefty loosey pretty simple
design<00:03:04.620> whoa<00:03:06.750> there's<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.140> knob<00:03:08.800> over<00:03:09.040> here

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
design whoa there's the knob over here

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.140 
design whoa there's the knob over here
which<00:03:09.580> tightens<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.410> suction<00:03:11.410> cup<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.940> that

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
which tightens the suction cup do that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.150 
which tightens the suction cup do that
and<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.540> should<00:03:13.720> set<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.530> wall<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.680> so

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
and it should set to the wall and so

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.640 
and it should set to the wall and so
that's<00:03:21.310> pretty<00:03:21.580> much<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:23.170> easily

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
that's pretty much it and this easily

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.160 
that's pretty much it and this easily
mounts<00:03:24.070> on<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:31.299> back<00:03:31.510> side<00:03:31.780> through<00:03:32.140> the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
mounts on to the back side through the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.229 
mounts on to the back side through the
clips<00:03:33.420> there's<00:03:34.420> one<00:03:35.010> two<00:03:36.010> three<00:03:36.459> clips<00:03:36.820> and<00:03:37.030> it

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
clips there's one two three clips and it

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.070 
clips there's one two three clips and it
would<00:03:37.360> mount<00:03:37.540> onto<00:03:38.080> those<00:03:38.500> three<00:03:38.830> Clips<00:03:39.130> so

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
would mount onto those three Clips so

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:49.080 
would mount onto those three Clips so
let's<00:03:41.740> see<00:03:42.040> if<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.310> can<00:03:42.340> put<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.910> we<00:03:49.060> can

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
let's see if I can put it on so we can

00:03:49.090 --> 00:04:03.660 
let's see if I can put it on so we can
see<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.540> clips<00:03:49.840> again<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.890> comes<00:04:03.130> in<00:04:03.340> like

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
see the clips again it comes in like

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.640 
see the clips again it comes in like
