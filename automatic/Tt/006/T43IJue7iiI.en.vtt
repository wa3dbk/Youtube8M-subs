00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
to install front derailleur the first

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.839 
to install front derailleur the first
step<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.820> install<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.630> front<00:00:13.469> derailleur

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
step is to install the front derailleur

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.870 
step is to install the front derailleur
around<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.150> seat<00:00:15.570> post<00:00:15.870> tube<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.410> your<00:00:16.529> bike

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
around the seat post tube of your bike

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.939 
around the seat post tube of your bike
you'll<00:00:17.880> want<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.210> put<00:00:18.449> some<00:00:18.750> grease<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
you'll want to put some grease on the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.150 
you'll want to put some grease on the
bolt<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.939> attaches<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.630> derailleur<00:00:22.439> now

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
bolt that attaches the derailleur now

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.650 
bolt that attaches the derailleur now
you're<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> need<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.939> set<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.390> height

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
you're going to need to set the height

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.170 
you're going to need to set the height
of<00:00:24.900> your<00:00:25.019> derailleur<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:26.189> goal<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
of your derailleur the goal of this is

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.089 
of your derailleur the goal of this is
to<00:00:27.210> obtain<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.779> height<00:00:28.109> where<00:00:28.590> when<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to obtain a height where when the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.089 
to obtain a height where when the
trailer<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.730> closest<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.199> outer<00:00:31.650> chain

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
trailer is closest to the outer chain

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.440 
trailer is closest to the outer chain
ring<00:00:32.340> there<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.669> only<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> two<00:00:33.360> millimeter<00:00:33.989> gap

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
ring there is only a two millimeter gap

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.900 
ring there is only a two millimeter gap
next<00:00:36.450> step<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.200> adjust<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.800> angle<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.430> your

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
next step is to adjust the angle of your

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.299 
next step is to adjust the angle of your
front<00:00:39.329> derailleur<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.170> want<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.680> parallel

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
with the chain rings you're going to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.430 
with the chain rings you're going to
need<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.270> install<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.329> chain<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
need to install your chain for the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860 
need to install your chain for the
following<00:00:47.100> step<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.730> well<00:00:48.329> you're<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.719> to

to make sure that when you're shifting
into<00:01:47.640> your<00:01:47.759> largest<00:01:48.210> front<00:01:48.930> chainring<00:01:49.470> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
into your largest front chainring that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.730 
into your largest front chainring that
you<00:01:50.009> don't<00:01:50.220> shift<00:01:50.520> over<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.560> we

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
you don't shift over so what we do is we

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.270 
you don't shift over so what we do is we
shift<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.189> into<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.520> largest<00:01:54.030> chainring<00:01:55.280> now

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
shift it into the largest chainring now

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.459 
shift it into the largest chainring now
we're<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.610> push<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.390> far<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
we're gonna push as far as we can on the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.800 
we're gonna push as far as we can on the
shifter<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.310> now<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.729> can<00:02:00.000> tighten<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.540> H

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
shifter and now you can tighten the H

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.640 
shifter and now you can tighten the H
screw

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
screw

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.070 
screw
and<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:03.730> can<00:02:03.880> see<00:02:04.090> how<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.420> limits<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.990> amount

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
and you can see how it limits the amount

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.190 
and you can see how it limits the amount
of<00:02:05.520> pushover<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:06.910> there<00:02:07.420> we<00:02:07.450> go<00:02:07.720> now<00:02:07.990> it's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
of pushover we have there we go now it's

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.460 
of pushover we have there we go now it's
set<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.590> you're<00:02:08.710> ready<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.010> go<00:02:09.190> riding
