00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.678
You know when you find a bee and it's crawling on its last legs, you give it honey

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.619
It's the only thing they eat makes sense when you think about it

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.700
No point just talking to it! Give it honey

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.649
They're very much a one-recipe species

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.600
I'm sorry, I'm intrigued because I would I gently give it the sole of my shoe

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.140
Not to be harsh but you know

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800
You would stand on a struggling, crawling bee??

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.380
Well what, what? As opposed to rehabilitating it?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.700
I like honey on my porridge, you murderer!

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.110
We depend on bees, we need the bees

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.929
Okay, so in Future I should lure the bee back I like I

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.539
Do I get a syringe of Honey Just A tiny amount of Honey

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.659
I don't I don't feel Easy to see leave it with the Honey

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.110
Don't Tread [on] it it Should [be] Plenty fans that you Should be Arrested Excuse me

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.379
you know, we're in A hive

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.640
Isn't it true though that a bee in its entire lifetime makes an absolutely tiny amount of honey?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.880
Overall, I mean just a minute amount that you don't have to give much

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.920
rehabilitating honey to this one bee before the Nation - the World - is  making a net loss

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.780
I mean it's useless, if you only get one teaspoon of honey from a whole Bee's lifetime and every time

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.069
we have to get it back on its feet, it takes a teaspoon and a half

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.220
suddenly there's no honey at all!

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.380
This is more honey than this bee has seen in its life!

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.409
You're insulting it ! It's like showing a very tired mason a whole cathedral!

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.670
Well let's let's Say that You're in Between our?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.149
Allen and Daraa so like allen You want to Help the big and it but like dari you, also want to kill kill kill

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.309

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.270
