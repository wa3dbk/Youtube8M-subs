him spawn out earlier round on like a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.860 
him spawn out earlier round on like a
very<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:49.860> low<00:00:50.340> ground<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> need<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> do

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
very very low ground what you need to do

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.770 
very very low ground what you need to do
is<00:00:52.430> if<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.699> four<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> guys<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.510> under<00:00:54.690> a

is if all four of you guys are under a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
is if all four of you guys are under a
problem<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:55.410> been<00:00:55.620> better<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.129> just

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
problem that's been better just just

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.990 
problem that's been better just just
keep<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.539> zombie<00:00:57.809> alive<00:00:58.520> want<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.609> walk<00:00:59.789> or

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
keep one zombie alive want to walk or

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
keep one zombie alive want to walk or
crawler<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.750> better<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.350> walker

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
crawler it's better if it's a walker

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.450 
crawler it's better if it's a walker
it's<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> crawler<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.870> just

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
it's not a crawler because I know just

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.590 
it's not a crawler because I know just
just<00:01:05.460> has<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> higher<00:01:05.939> chance<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.390> actually

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
just has a higher chance of actually

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.690 
just has a higher chance of actually
making<00:01:06.869> him<00:01:07.080> spawn<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.799> works<00:01:08.159> about<00:01:08.490> like

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
making him spawn this works about like

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.179 
making him spawn this works about like
90<00:01:09.000> percent<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> time<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.920> what<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> want

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
90 percent of the time so what you want

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.789 
90 percent of the time so what you want
to<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> kill<00:01:12.170> everyone<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.380> keep<00:01:13.560> one

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to do is kill everyone just keep one

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.700 
to do is kill everyone just keep one
person<00:01:14.010> make<00:01:14.520> him<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.600> circles<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.200> do

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
person make him like go in circles or do

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.880 
person make him like go in circles or do
whatever<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.100> want<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.820> once<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.180> hear

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890

spawn so we did it I don't know if this
is<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.380> collector<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.729> actually<00:01:39.000> how

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
is a collector or this is actually how

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.609 
is a collector or this is actually how
you<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.390> him<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.600> spawn<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.500> found

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
you get him to spawn but I just found

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.469 
you get him to spawn but I just found
out<00:01:40.799> about<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:41.880> making<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.180> video<00:01:42.299> about

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
out about it so I'm making a video about

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.010 
out about it so I'm making a video about
it<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.560> um<00:01:44.130> yeah<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it so um yeah I know and then on the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.539 
it so um yeah I know and then on the
second<00:01:46.439> try<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.680> actually<00:01:47.009> killed<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.520> zombie

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
second try I actually killed a zombie

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.580 
second try I actually killed a zombie
and<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.390> thought<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> last<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.470> he

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and I thought it was the last one but he

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.520 
and I thought it was the last one but he
wasn't<00:01:49.799> because<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.759> turned<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.630> my

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
wasn't because it turned out that my

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.209 
wasn't because it turned out that my
friend<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.100> halfway<00:01:53.340> across<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.939> map<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
friend like halfway across the map I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.679 
friend like halfway across the map I
think<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.700> time<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.240> something<00:01:57.540> he

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
think it was that time or something he

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.389 
think it was that time or something he
had<00:01:57.780> another<00:01:58.079> zombie<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> told<00:01:59.009> him<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.219> kill

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
had another zombie I told him to kill

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.670 
had another zombie I told him to kill
him<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.579> fast<00:01:59.790> as<00:01:59.939> he<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.270> whenever<00:02:01.079> he<00:02:01.200> did<00:02:01.439> as

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
him as fast as he can whenever he did as

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.380 
him as fast as he can whenever he did as
you<00:02:01.890> saw<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> crapload<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.030> Thunder

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you saw there was a crapload of Thunder

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.999 
you saw there was a crapload of Thunder
going<00:02:03.689> around<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.340> he's<00:02:05.340> falling<00:02:05.700> again<00:02:05.909> so

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
going around and he's falling again so

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.010 
going around and he's falling again so
that's<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.160> only<00:02:08.250> reason<00:02:08.399> why<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.759> see<00:02:09.119> anyone

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
that's the only reason why I see anyone

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.500 
that's the only reason why I see anyone
would<00:02:10.229> want<00:02:10.440> him<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> spawn<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.819> just

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
would want him to spawn just just just

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.839 
would want him to spawn just just just
because<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:13.590> need<00:02:14.069> them<00:02:14.189> to<00:02:14.580> do<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
because you need them to do the

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.899 
because you need them to do the
easter-egg<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.480> Max's<00:02:16.080> side<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:17.370> that's<00:02:17.640> it

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
easter-egg on Max's side so that's it

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:18.979
