without<00:00:20.060> poison<00:00:21.060> basically<00:00:22.100> we<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.189> call<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
without poison basically we can call a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.320 
without poison basically we can call a
pesticide<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.029> pesticide<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:26.060> if<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> would

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
pesticide a pesticide but if it would

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.790 
pesticide a pesticide but if it would
just<00:00:27.359> kill<00:00:27.720> pests<00:00:28.140> that'd<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.380> cool<00:00:28.590> but

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
just kill pests that'd be cool but

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.189 
just kill pests that'd be cool but
optimally<00:00:29.369> winds<00:00:29.640> up<00:00:29.730> killing<00:00:29.880> bees<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
optimally winds up killing bees and

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.250 
optimally winds up killing bees and
other<00:00:31.320> things<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.570> was<00:00:33.570> determined<00:00:33.870> try<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
other things and I was determined try to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
other things and I was determined try to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
raising bees for honey production

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.660 
raising bees for honey production
putting<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.570> barrels<00:00:55.039> and<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.489> got<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
putting it in barrels and it just got to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
putting it in barrels and it just got to
where<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.879> wasn't<00:00:57.149> making<00:00:57.360> any<00:00:57.449> money<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
where I wasn't making any money so you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400

either<00:00:58.980> had<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> go<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> pollination<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.410> kind

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
either had to go to pollination or kind

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.560 
either had to go to pollination or kind
of<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.829> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
of get out of it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.660 
of get out of it
the<00:01:04.110> mobile<00:01:04.439> pollination<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.489> hard

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the mobile pollination is really hard

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
the mobile pollination is really hard
work<00:01:06.200> it's<00:01:07.200> wonderful<00:01:07.619> thing<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.979> people

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
work it's wonderful thing that people

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.060 
work it's wonderful thing that people
are<00:01:08.310> doing<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:08.820> that's<00:01:09.299> how<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.689> eat

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
are doing it because that's how we eat

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.300 
are doing it because that's how we eat
but<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:11.850> hard<00:01:12.270> work<00:01:12.479> and

but it's it's really hard work and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.610

is right next to the box but when you
lift<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:14.010> pretty<00:02:14.280> hard<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.880> this

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
to work without gloves

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.960 
to work without gloves
I<00:02:20.040> wear<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> veil<00:02:21.209> but<00:02:22.280> as<00:02:23.280> soon<00:02:23.519> as<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.730> crush

I wear a veil but as soon as you crush
bees<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.739> mood<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.250> hive<00:02:26.400> gets<00:02:26.790> a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
bees you the mood of the hive gets a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
bees you the mood of the hive gets a
little<00:02:27.030> bit<00:02:27.239> more

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
little bit more

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.710 
little bit more
man<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.799> know<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.099> so<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:30.000> try<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.329> minimize

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
crushing these also I feel like we

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.160 
crushing these also I feel like we
shouldn't<00:02:33.150> be<00:02:33.269> crushing<00:02:33.510> bees<00:02:33.750> where<00:02:34.019> the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
shouldn't be crushing bees where the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.259 
shouldn't be crushing bees where the
beekeepers<00:02:34.650> nut<00:02:34.860> shouldn't<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.819> killing<00:02:36.030> bees

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
beekeepers nut shouldn't be killing bees

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.170 
beekeepers nut shouldn't be killing bees
right<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> topper<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.670> did<00:02:41.939> you

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
you can use the same bar over and over

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.670 
you can use the same bar over and over
for<00:02:47.939> many<00:02:48.629> many<00:02:48.870> years<00:02:48.930> there's<00:02:49.319> nothing<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
for many many years there's nothing to

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.550 
for many many years there's nothing to
break<00:02:49.829> you<00:02:50.340> know<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:51.049> it's<00:02:52.049> just<00:02:52.140> really

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
cheap the tubs can I've made two uh

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.199 
cheap the tubs can I've made two uh
perhaps<00:02:55.319> out<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.980> plastic<00:02:56.609> blue<00:02:56.790> barrels

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
perhaps out of plastic blue barrels

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.430 
perhaps out of plastic blue barrels
glass

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.830 

lots<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.010> different<00:03:01.280> materials<00:03:01.760> mud<00:03:02.330> dirty

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
lots of different materials mud dirty

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.780 
lots of different materials mud dirty
mud<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:05.240> so<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.540> thought<00:03:05.990> well<00:03:06.460> these<00:03:07.460> are<00:03:07.640> kind

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
mud and so I thought well these are kind

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.160 
mud and so I thought well these are kind
of<00:03:07.850> cool<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.210> experimented<00:03:08.630> with<00:03:08.810> him<00:03:08.990> for

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
of cool and I experimented with him for

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.130 
of cool and I experimented with him for
a<00:03:09.200> lot<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.470> years<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.010> then<00:03:10.790> one<00:03:11.600> year<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.840> lost

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
a lot of years and then one year I lost

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.870 
a lot of years and then one year I lost
a<00:03:12.290> lot<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.560> bees<00:03:12.710> to<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:12.920> varroa<00:03:13.220> mite<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:14.530> I

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
a lot of bees to the varroa mite and I

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.220 
a lot of bees to the varroa mite and I
my<00:03:16.880> life's<00:03:17.090> with<00:03:17.270> equipment<00:03:17.540> was<00:03:17.780> wearing<00:03:18.080> out

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
my life's with equipment was wearing out

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.190 
my life's with equipment was wearing out
and<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.470> decided<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:19.160> would<00:03:21.910> try<00:03:22.910> 30<00:03:23.570> top<00:03:23.900> bribes

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
and I decided I would try 30 top bribes

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.160 
and I decided I would try 30 top bribes
as<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.410> business<00:03:24.830> experiment<00:03:25.790> because<00:03:26.510> they

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
as a business experiment because they

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.510 
as a business experiment because they
were<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.470> cheap<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.890> could<00:03:28.040> make<00:03:28.190> them<00:03:28.310> famous

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
were so cheap I could make them famous

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.270 
were so cheap I could make them famous
never<00:03:29.410> put<00:03:30.410> together<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.740> bunch<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.040> scrap

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
never put together a bunch of scrap

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.320 
never put together a bunch of scrap
lumber<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:34.010> did<00:03:34.280> well<00:03:34.490> you<00:03:34.910> know<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.060> bought

lumber and it did well you know I bought
some<00:03:35.540> packages<00:03:36.020> they<00:03:36.500> weren't<00:03:36.770> all<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:37.340> great

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
some packages they weren't all so great

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.300 
some packages they weren't all so great
but<00:03:37.820> I<00:03:38.060> got<00:03:38.330> by<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.840> made<00:03:38.960> some<00:03:39.140> honey<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.650> I

paid for everything and made a little
profit<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.590> then<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.220> thought<00:03:43.460> well<00:03:43.580> then<00:03:43.880> I

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910

profit and then I thought well then I
could<00:03:44.150> go<00:03:44.270> ahead<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.510> reinvest<00:03:44.870> in<00:03:45.020> my<00:03:45.140> legs

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
could go ahead and reinvest in my legs

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.620 
could go ahead and reinvest in my legs
with<00:03:45.680> equipment<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:46.100> I<00:03:46.250> thought<00:03:46.520> yeah<00:03:47.390> but<00:03:47.540> I

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
with equipment that I thought yeah but I

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.690 
with equipment that I thought yeah but I
could<00:03:47.780> have<00:03:47.810> twice<00:03:48.470> as<00:03:48.530> many<00:03:48.800> or<00:03:49.010> ten<00:03:49.280> times<00:03:49.490> as

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
could have twice as many or ten times as

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.610 
could have twice as many or ten times as
many<00:03:49.850> top<00:03:50.150> arrives<00:03:50.480> for<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.840> same<00:03:51.050> investment

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
many top arrives for the same investment

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.590 
many top arrives for the same investment
so<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.700> built<00:03:53.570> more<00:03:53.720> top<00:03:53.960> arrives<00:03:54.290> and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
so I built more top arrives and

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.820 
so I built more top arrives and
basically<00:03:56.600> you've<00:03:56.780> never<00:03:56.960> looked<00:03:57.170> back

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
basically you've never looked back

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.230 
basically you've never looked back

well<00:06:28.300> then<00:06:28.480> they<00:06:28.630> might<00:06:28.900> build<00:06:29.080> a<00:06:29.200> whole<00:06:29.380> sheet

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
well then they might build a whole sheet

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.330 
well then they might build a whole sheet
of<00:06:29.740> drone<00:06:30.130> comb<00:06:30.450> yep<00:06:31.480> they<00:06:31.780> might<00:06:31.960> well<00:06:32.920> drones

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
of drone comb yep they might well drones
