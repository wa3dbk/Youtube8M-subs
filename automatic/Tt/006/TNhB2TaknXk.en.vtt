to move to the stream and I don't want

come out here and it's nice to know that
you<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.710> a<00:03:22.740> wide<00:03:23.130> area<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:24.060> fish<00:03:24.330> without

you<00:03:28.080> know<00:03:28.170> angling<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.800> very<00:03:29.490> important

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
you know angling is a very important

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.070 
you know angling is a very important
part<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.750> our<00:03:31.590> history<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.660> think<00:03:33.720> it's

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
part of our history and and I think it's

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.560 
part of our history and and I think it's
something<00:03:34.290> we<00:03:34.530> should<00:03:34.560> preserve<00:03:35.130> for<00:03:35.490> future

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
something we should preserve for future

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:44.740 
something we should preserve for future
generation

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.390 

the<00:03:45.750> instrument<00:03:46.290> water<00:03:46.560> it's<00:03:46.830> important<00:03:47.310> to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
the instrument water it's important to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.670 
the instrument water it's important to
me<00:03:47.550> 10%<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.780> world's<00:03:49.110> water<00:03:49.260> is

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
me 10% of the world's water is

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.740 
me 10% of the world's water is
freshwater<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:50.880> 10%<00:03:51.510> 1%<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.069> is

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
freshwater of that 10% 1% of it is

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.660 
freshwater of that 10% 1% of it is
suitable<00:03:54.750> for<00:03:54.930> trout<00:03:55.140> fishing<00:03:55.459> that's<00:03:56.459> how

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
suitable for trout fishing that's how

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.230 
suitable for trout fishing that's how
rare<00:03:56.880> this<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:59.190> don't<00:03:59.430> realize<00:03:59.850> what<00:04:00.090> you

rare this is you don't realize what you

rare this is you don't realize what you
have<00:04:00.450> until<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.840> lose<00:04:00.930> them<00:04:02.510> these<00:04:03.510> streams
