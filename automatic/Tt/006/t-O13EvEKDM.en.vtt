00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
they've kind of changed their typical

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.529 
they've kind of changed their typical
case<00:00:20.220> series<00:00:20.580> desktop<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.060> they've<00:00:21.210> had<00:00:21.330> for

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
case series desktop that they've had for

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330 
case series desktop that they've had for
so<00:00:21.720> long<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.350> doesn't<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.740> big<00:00:22.830> button

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
so long it doesn't have that big button

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.550 
so long it doesn't have that big button
in<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.490> middle<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.689> h<00:00:24.840> series<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
in the middle this is the h series and

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.929 
in the middle this is the h series and
so<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> little<00:00:26.340> bit<00:00:26.490> different<00:00:26.670> you'll

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
so it's a little bit different you'll

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.220 
so it's a little bit different you'll
notice<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> looks<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.630> lot<00:00:27.750> nicer<00:00:27.960> it's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
notice that it looks a lot nicer it's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.900 
notice that it looks a lot nicer it's
probably<00:00:28.560> meant<00:00:28.769> more<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> college

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
probably meant more for a college

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.609 
probably meant more for a college
student<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.449> business<00:00:30.929> user<00:00:31.170> than<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
student or a business user than the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.020 
student or a business user than the
previous<00:00:31.949> case<00:00:32.189> user<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:32.579> meant<00:00:32.790> kind<00:00:32.969> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
previous case user just meant kind of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.459 
previous case user just meant kind of
for<00:00:33.149> everyone<00:00:33.630> i<00:00:33.809> guess<00:00:34.110> it'll<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.350> getting

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
for everyone i guess it'll be getting

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.049 
for everyone i guess it'll be getting
more<00:00:34.770> specific<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.640> they<00:00:35.790> make<00:00:35.940> their

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
more specific in what they make their

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.090 
more specific in what they make their
models<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.320> as<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.680> tell<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> does

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
models for so as you can tell it does

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.560 
models for so as you can tell it does
look<00:00:38.280> nicer<00:00:38.610> let's<00:00:39.090> talk<00:00:39.300> about<00:00:39.360> what's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
look nicer let's talk about what's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.549 
look nicer let's talk about what's
inside<00:00:39.840> which<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.350> bit<00:00:40.410> more

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
inside which is a little bit more

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
gonna go ahead and let them in here's

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.220 
gonna go ahead and let them in here's
the<00:03:53.000> best<00:03:53.150> part<00:03:53.269> let's<00:03:53.780> say<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:53.959> someone

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
the best part let's say that someone

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.479 
the best part let's say that someone
else<00:03:54.380> comes<00:03:54.560> up<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:54.799> tries<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.010> get<00:03:55.160> into<00:03:55.310> your

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
else comes up and tries to get into your

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.069 
else comes up and tries to get into your
system<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:56.269> ver<00:03:56.510> face<00:03:56.660> technology<00:03:56.870> will

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
system the ver face technology will

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.270 
system the ver face technology will
actually<00:03:57.290> capture<00:03:57.680> an<00:03:57.739> image<00:03:57.799> of<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.130> person

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
actually capture an image of the person

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.069 
actually capture an image of the person
who's<00:03:58.579> trying<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.209> break<00:03:59.389> into<00:03:59.540> your<00:03:59.630> system

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
who's trying to break into your system

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.599 
who's trying to break into your system
so<00:04:00.380> that's<00:04:00.470> pretty<00:04:00.769> cool<00:04:00.920> if<00:04:01.069> you're<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.280> living

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
so that's pretty cool if you're a living

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.069 
so that's pretty cool if you're a living
in<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.760> dorm<00:04:02.030> or<00:04:02.420> your<00:04:02.599> little<00:04:02.840> brothers<00:04:03.049> and

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
in a dorm or your little brothers and

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.059 
in a dorm or your little brothers and
sisters<00:04:03.200> are<00:04:03.560> trying<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.769> get<00:04:03.889> into<00:04:04.010> your

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
sisters are trying to get into your

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.160 
sisters are trying to get into your
stuff<00:04:04.250> pretty<00:04:04.970> annoying<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.780> very<00:04:05.989> face

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
stuff pretty annoying the very face

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.809 
stuff pretty annoying the very face
technology<00:04:06.709> pretty<00:04:07.130> much<00:04:07.250> eliminates<00:04:07.730> that

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
technology pretty much eliminates that

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.870 
technology pretty much eliminates that
problem<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.930> again<00:04:08.959> this<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.980> h2<00:04:10.400> 10<00:04:10.579> by
