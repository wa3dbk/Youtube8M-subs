00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.440
 we had there the first fortnight of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.019
 February 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.540
 in this blocking situation with the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.360
 cold fronts without getting blocked 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.250
 reach the south center of Brazil and this 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.070
 has made us have had a great 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.560
 reducing the possibility of rain 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 especially in the south to the southeast 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.609
 some more storms happened in 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.640
 small areas 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.170
 in there is the lack of rain the deficiency of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.809
 rain is still very big 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.950
 this month of February further complicating 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.170
 plus the situation of the south and southeast 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.989
 How is it going from here? 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.969
 we will even have until the carnival to 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.360
 crossing two cold fronts 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.660
 one of them to go around already that this 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.969
 next weekend to go by the coast 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.160
 Southern Brazil and once in the week 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.620
 come I'll have another cold front that 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.649
 it must even influence the time 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.969
 there in several areas of the country during the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.290
 carnival né 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.720
 but what happens with the passage of these 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.600
 cold fronts and with these damp masses 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.009
 that remain on Brazil, so I 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.020
 I have a condition there until the 26th 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.140
 of this accumulation of instability 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.340
 particularly in the south of the northern region 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.070
 west central parana are several to several 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.100
 areas south of amazonas acre rondônia 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.000
 para same mato grosso mato grosso do 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.600
 south on whom many areas of the Parana 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.150
 Rain estimated the volume of rain 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.409
 estimated until the beginning of this week 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.930
 and until February 26 is more than 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.140
 100mm I have there estimates 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.259
 100 to 200 millimeters of rain 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.210
 Also note this small area here 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.939
 in the far west of the state of são paulo 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.460
 which should also receive its 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.719
 voluminous and largely with this rain 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.550
 will happen until Monday until the 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.780
 February 24th 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.870
 unfortunately the expectation of 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.120
 very few 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.310
 no rain for most of the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.299
 region and also in the north - east 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.540
 Brazil 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.120
 here are small cores of rain has 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.989
 a little bit more here down the coast 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.220
 from Bahia 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.230
 but that earth tone in red earth 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.299
 indicates very little rain then the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.680
 disability will continue large 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:41.409
 still in the northeast in the southeast 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.420
 end of February then picking up the 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.879
 first days of March picking up 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.069
 including Carnival we will have a 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.359
 increased instability in the region 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.590
 southeast 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.540
 here I have it for most 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.319
 areas of the southeast region 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.959
 an expectation of volumes of rain already 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.920
 accumulated from 50 to 70 millimeters of rain 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.629
 for a period of 45 days this in 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.980
 truth is little rain 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:14.260
 it is not completely dry but this 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.530
 this rain that is being estimated there 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.709
 it will happen in small areas not 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.099
 it is again generalized rain in adapting 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.440
 we find that an accumulation of rain 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.989
 particularly for the south-central part 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.329
 east state of São Paulo is the one I 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.519
 I already have the amount of rain that can 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.489
 even exceeding 100 millimeters what 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.129
 It would be very good, does not it, for example? 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.910
 the Greater Santos region are 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.000
 Paulo 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.849
 practically the entire region of the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.669
 Cantareira the region of Campinas Sorocaba 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.280
 so the volume of rain that can 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:55.329
 reach up to 100 mm accumulated 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.780
 This is really cool, is it there, too? 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.819
 central to west central region of the country 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.819
 It gives us realize well that will 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.440
 there is a drop here a dried here 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.579
 in this part west and south of mato grosso 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.040
 which has already received a lot of rain and remains 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.230
 however here it looks at an activity 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.889
 quite a lot of instability a lot 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.959
 rain yet amazon acre rondonia is 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.210
 This is still a pretty rain. 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.810
 concerned that these areas are only 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.720
 completely 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.660
 caterpillars the images we have there 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.710
 from the region of the old port to São 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.690
 awesome 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.530
 We're not talking about bridges. 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.139
 completely submerged almost there 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.100
 water invading 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:46.010
 cities so to roads completely 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.130
 covered by water as a function of the 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.919
 river also wood of river purus and river 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.900
 Juruá and Acre River and unfortunately the 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.470
 forecast is more rain for these 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:01.280
 Areas here are good too. 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.889
 the first days of March 4 to 8 of 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.790
 March there is an expectation that people 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:11.600
 have a period there from quite to drought 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.240
 on the southern region is then just after the 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.120
 in the carnival the expectation that it will stop 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.610
 it rains or it gets very little rain 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.040
 on the south of Brazil and we notice 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.500
 also this decrease to great this 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.870
 large rainfall reduction in areas of weeds 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.950
 Southern Grosseto is also from São Paulo 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.140
 thick right 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.360
 It's good to look at these areas here. 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.430
 South miner mines triangle one 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.390
 plenty of rain, right? 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.520
 to draw attention here and still 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.310
 accumulation of instability over the region 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.100
 north almost the entire northern region 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.669
 of Brazil in areas also of the west in 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.919
 bay 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.050
 An interesting thing to note here is that 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.210
 increased instability in the region of 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.750
 where it rains very little in this 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.120
 area 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.280
 but notice the following looks only the largest 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.070
 part of the northeast in that period from 4 to 8 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.070
 March will also have little rainfall
