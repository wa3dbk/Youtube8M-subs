 happy to meet you for the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.500
 second morning number to stacy and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.540
 so this is the new section that I have 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.710
 created last month where I'm trying a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.280
 short jeans and a conditioner or 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.190
 so a whole range of suede a 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.460
 mark and I tell you what I think 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.189
 this month thanks I confess to the site eekhof 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.960
 who really they are super adorable I 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.189
 am hyper hyper happy that's the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.840
 first time I have a partnership 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.179
 with a site and in addition it is a site of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.990
 singing eyes so I know I'm a 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.290
 like crazy 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 Basically I put you the link vardin must 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.050
 normally the fact that is your 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.100
 godmother is registered in the link 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 but if ever you are asked for your 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.800
 godmother world put you my address 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.899
 mail marion bluff 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.300

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.070
 attached and you will have 5 euros of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.710
 discount on your first order so 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.239
 I wish you a good shopping 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.129
 I was lucky to try 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.960
 finally a brand that I'm talking about 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.690
 since a long time it's the boat 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.829
 ch ti then everyone to pronounce a little 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.449
 as he wants me I say kai because 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.519
 I do not have why there are some who say 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.560
 if it's a little less pretty said 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.320
 kikai i hear i hear a little shy 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.549
 finally here it is otherwise it's shit it's me 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.369
 said it the other day and I do not think it 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.159
 wrong because in the end it's castioni 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.210
 kid reaction intralinks his marks and 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.250
 hop on the logo 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.420
 so there is the what do the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.220
 initials so since it's 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.640
 initials ch y it seems to me not bad 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.520
 as well 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.490
 it's the art range wins over dead 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.880
 higuain and she made me squint from 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.130
 whew 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.729
 especially in parapharmacy and cgt to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.210
 ivory is really I have I feel 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.380
 etc. 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.159
 I was not far from taking the plunge 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 honestly and I was able to get through 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.770
 a headdress 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.939
 so here are obviously these challenges 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.229
 shampoo that are a little bit expensive 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.250
 it's not like you're going to buy 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.229
 your shampoo at 4 euros 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.600
 supermarket it's a little bit more 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.250
 expensive it costs according to you want 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.619
 buy between 15 and 20 euros 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.030
 but you may know that since 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.030
 some time but fluorescent become 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.450
 my obsession is that if I can in 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.850
 take 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.250
 doubly care and that's like I 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.780
 want and I admit it's the kind of 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.039
 sum me I'm ready to put the price 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.629
 more frankly there are quite a few 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.709
 so it's not like you 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.290
 put 15 euros every week 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:18.599
 that's where it spreads what I liked 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.290
 not to repeat everything is that then 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.319
 for the shampoo 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.190
 it takes very little and really 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.599
 well so me people but I do more 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.520
 down like that so yes the only thing that 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.890
 I feel a little sorry for them 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.720
 hard to put the plug back there 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.830
 the other have so I imagine it's 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.530
 maybe just that one who's kidding a 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.849
 little so I put two or three but I 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.220
 believe that I will put it earlier 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.670
 or two because I really do not have 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.800
 need 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.910
 I was told the other day that I had not 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.290
 necessarily need to put shampoo 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.940
 up to my spikes and that as she 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.200
 was very dry and friends may 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.450
 so I was just doing 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.310
 now shampoo of the skull and blow 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.340
 I think one to two pumps is enough 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.890
 so in my opinion frankly there are some 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.040
 500 milliliters think 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.150
 where are you anything 355 mm but 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.519
 frankly there are not bad I think 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.110
 so today for a little while 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.629
 that's great, it's super nice 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.800
 and his princes then one but that one 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.360
 and that's where it's really 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.470
 revolution I promise you it was 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.530
 long time I had not felt my 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.440
 hair as soft under my shower so 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.030
 I do not put the after shampoo on 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.470
 the roots obviously rather on 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.709
 the points so I have not bad when 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.019
 even 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.459
 I leave a little bit laid I take my 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.319
 brush and I have mails while he 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.180
 there is the after shampoo on it 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.120
 mails easily lose but really 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.099
 hyper quickly and then I rinse 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.409
 henry in general passing the hand 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.709
 like that to feel if it worked well 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.480
 also its sweet and the magic of 3g 's 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.909
 the hair care I swear 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.099
 it was amazing the first shampoo 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.210
 that I did with limit was the 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.510
 panic on the shower I understand 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.880
 because it was happening so I love them 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.890
 you understood this mark I'm going 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.630
 the artist and they have one with keratin 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.250
 I think that maybe for my 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.750
 very damaged hair that could be good 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.060
 as well 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.380
 without hesitation I advise you 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.340
 although I realize that all 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.110
 world does not want to put that price there 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.230
 so this may be the only thing where 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.570
 it's the only downside we do not have everything 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.880
 want to put this price there in a 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.930
 shampoo at the level of compositions 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.280
 because I was asked the question 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.530
 national it's true that I have not 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.630
 inevitably the reflex but I find that 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.360
 good to ask the question 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.740
 we have I know more the world of 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.540
 things that are v6 you can me 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.510
 remember like that I go out her and 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.520
 that she was already looking for her marks and 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.210
 before there are no sulphates and 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.860
 no paraben 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.160
 so it's already a good thing 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.600
 and 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.620
 maybe there are snippets of self so 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.970
 that's pretty good because it 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.700
 sweetly sweeten the choices I think 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.640
 that's what works great 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:58.100
 and him too at Gand and maury of guys 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.360
 I think it does not hurt 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.710
 girl I know nothing frankly I 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.400
 will tell you anything you I 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.050
 say a few at the pyme benzyl 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.150
 banizette obando must be written 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:13.760
 so big with my lynx eyes 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:16.310
 is not it belzile satis silat good 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.260
 that I would not even read there are any 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.710
 fruit extracts too it's funny 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:25.160
 I would not have thought 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:28.220
 dissal diom so chloride is made 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.240
 thrash site to nole that one game it me 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.810
 seems that I have already heard but I do not 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.490
 know more so do not hesitate to tell me 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.650
 which they seek you to know 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.000
 so kind of go if nikon and that's it 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.800
 which of course they will allow if the 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.970
 codes no it would be much too much 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.120
 it's a bit of a pity 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.590
 short so here I hope it'll help 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.080
 a little bit and especially that you 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.140
