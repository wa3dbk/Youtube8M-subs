well<00:04:03.960> on<00:04:04.960> top<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.320> this<00:04:05.380> we've<00:04:05.620> also<00:04:05.740> got<00:04:06.010> a

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
well on top of this we've also got a

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.190 
well on top of this we've also got a
brand<00:04:06.280> new<00:04:06.340> material<00:04:06.520> it's<00:04:07.450> an<00:04:07.630> evolution<00:04:08.110> of

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
brand new material it's an evolution of

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.710 
brand new material it's an evolution of
our<00:04:08.320> synthetic<00:04:09.100> fiber<00:04:09.340> knife<00:04:09.610> material<00:04:10.150> we've

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
our synthetic fiber knife material we've

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.960 
our synthetic fiber knife material we've
just<00:04:10.900> put<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.110> fiber<00:04:11.320> night<00:04:11.530> -<00:04:15.150> it's<00:04:16.150> tougher

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
just put it fiber night - it's tougher

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.199 
just put it fiber night - it's tougher
he<00:04:18.660> resists<00:04:19.230> killing<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.680> lot<00:04:19.920> better<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.940> takes

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
he resists killing a lot better it takes

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.610 
he resists killing a lot better it takes
the<00:04:21.390> color<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.660> lot<00:04:21.810> better<00:04:22.019> it's<00:04:22.230> more<00:04:22.350> hard

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the color a lot better it's more hard

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.220 
the color a lot better it's more hard

the<00:04:25.350> top<00:04:25.560> layer<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:26.220> canvas<00:04:26.670> here<00:04:27.050> came<00:04:28.050> up

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
the top layer of canvas here came up

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.660 
the top layer of canvas here came up
with<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.350> bit<00:04:28.860> of<00:04:28.890> fabric<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.520> we've

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
with a bit of fabric so we've

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.090 
with a bit of fabric so we've
incorporated<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.420> straightaway<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.650> those

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
incorporated that straightaway so those

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.470 
incorporated that straightaway so those
are<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.310> new<00:04:32.460> items<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.000> we've<00:04:33.210> got<00:04:33.330> at<00:04:33.420> the
