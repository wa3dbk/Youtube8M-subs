put the protein filler on and you really

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.959 
put the protein filler on and you really
been<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.110> 20<00:00:52.379> minutes

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
been on for about 20 minutes

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.790 
been on for about 20 minutes
it<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.780> helps<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.379> hair<00:00:55.559> was

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it just helps because your hair was

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.459 
it just helps because your hair was
blonde<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.670> you're<00:00:57.480> basically<00:00:58.230> going

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
blonde and so you're basically going

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
blonde and so you're basically going
from<00:00:58.590> having<00:00:58.829> no<00:00:59.070> pigmentation<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.879> trying<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
from having no pigmentation to trying to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.360 
from having no pigmentation to trying to
deposit<00:01:00.690> pigmentation<00:01:01.590> into<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.920> hair<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
deposit pigmentation into your hair and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.410 
deposit pigmentation into your hair and
so<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.820> important<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so it's really important to have a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.780 
so it's really important to have a
protein<00:01:03.629> filler<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.769> make<00:01:04.799> sure<00:01:04.979> hair<00:01:05.250> grasps

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
protein filler to make sure hair grasps

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
protein filler to make sure hair grasps
the<00:01:05.850> color<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.330> takes<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> color<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the color it takes the color and that

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.740 
the color it takes the color and that
all<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.430> hair<00:01:08.490> looks<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
all of your hair looks like it's the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
all of your hair looks like it's the
same<00:01:09.900> color<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.560> spottier<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.670> doesn't

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
same color it's not spottier it doesn't

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.090 
same color it's not spottier it doesn't
turn<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.299> my<00:01:12.600> muddy<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.560> anything<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:14.040> that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
turn out my muddy or anything like that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.300 
turn out my muddy or anything like that
um<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.530> first<00:01:16.770> step<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
um so that was the first step in the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.480 
um so that was the first step in the
second<00:01:17.640> step<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.710> applying<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.860> color<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
second step is applying your color so

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
second step is applying your color so
you're<00:01:20.640> gonna<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.030> protein<00:01:21.509> filler<00:01:21.689> on

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you're gonna have the protein filler on

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.190 
you're gonna have the protein filler on
still<00:01:22.770> your<00:01:23.070> heads<00:01:23.250> gonna<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.490> damp<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.780> went

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
ahead and went against probably what

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.810 
ahead and went against probably what
every<00:01:28.500> professional<00:01:28.710> hair<00:01:29.220> stylist<00:01:29.640> would

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
every professional hair stylist would

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.789 
every professional hair stylist would
tell<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.200> went<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> box
