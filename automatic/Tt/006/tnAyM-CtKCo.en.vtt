is I only think I bought in the
beginning<00:00:48.670> of<00:00:48.820> this<00:00:48.879> is<00:00:49.059> I<00:00:49.089> just<00:00:49.420> got<00:00:49.570> the

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
beginning of this is I just got the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.329 
beginning of this is I just got the
quick<00:00:49.839> revive<00:00:50.110> cuz<00:00:50.830> that's<00:00:50.980> basically<00:00:51.220> the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
quick revive cuz that's basically the

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:52.710

only<00:00:51.460> thing<00:00:51.580> you're<00:00:51.790> gonna<00:00:51.879> really<00:00:52.120> need<00:00:52.390> if

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
only thing you're gonna really need if

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.500 
only thing you're gonna really need if
you<00:00:53.290> have<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:53.440> decent<00:00:53.650> strategy<00:00:54.309> like<00:00:55.000> if<00:00:55.269> you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
you have a decent strategy like if you

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.850 
you have a decent strategy like if you
don't<00:00:55.629> have<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.839> strategy<00:00:56.050> then<00:00:56.350> I<00:00:56.379> recommend

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
don't have a strategy then I recommend

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.869 
don't have a strategy then I recommend
getting<00:00:56.949> juggernaut<00:00:57.489> but<00:00:57.610> it's<00:00:57.699> gonna<00:00:57.820> make

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
getting juggernaut but it's gonna make

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.149 
getting juggernaut but it's gonna make
it's<00:00:58.239> gonna<00:00:58.420> make<00:00:59.409> getting<00:00:59.620> this<00:00:59.860> achievement

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
it's gonna make getting this achievement

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.060 
it's gonna make getting this achievement
much<00:01:00.699> harder<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:01.440> only<00:01:02.440> thing<00:01:02.650> I<00:01:02.769> really

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
much harder so only thing I really

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.070 
much harder so only thing I really
bought<00:01:03.220> was<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.760> mp5<00:01:04.180> off<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.600> wall<00:01:04.780> which<00:01:04.960> is

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
bought was the mp5 off the wall which is

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.100 
bought was the mp5 off the wall which is
straight<00:01:05.320> ahead<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:07.240> basically<00:01:07.690> tried<00:01:08.020> to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
straight ahead and I basically tried to

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.440 
straight ahead and I basically tried to
just<00:01:08.260> rack<00:01:08.440> up<00:01:08.619> as<00:01:08.740> much<00:01:08.860> points<00:01:09.190> as<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:09.369> get

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450

when<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.159> link<00:02:00.670> all<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:00.909> teleporters<00:02:01.539> try<00:02:02.200> to

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
when you link all the teleporters try to

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.370 
when you link all the teleporters try to
go<00:02:02.950> back<00:02:03.189> I<00:02:03.520> recommend<00:02:04.329> using<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.600> going<00:02:05.259> to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
go back I recommend using the going to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.319 
go back I recommend using the going to
PhD<00:02:05.829> flopper<00:02:05.979> that's<00:02:06.399> gonna<00:02:06.549> be<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.999> easiest

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
PhD flopper that's gonna be the easiest

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.040 
PhD flopper that's gonna be the easiest
thing<00:02:07.509> probably<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.910> if<00:02:10.119> in<00:02:10.840> case

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
thing probably because you if in case

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.420 
thing probably because you if in case
you<00:02:11.170> get<00:02:11.290> fucked<00:02:11.590> by<00:02:11.680> zombies<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.190> can<00:02:12.280> just

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
you get fucked by zombies you can just

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.040 
you get fucked by zombies you can just
use<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.790> nade<00:02:12.970> strap<00:02:13.300> that<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.540> did<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:13.930> a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
use the nade strap that I did in a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.900 
use the nade strap that I did in a
previous<00:02:14.200> video<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.709> mine<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.610> if<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.790> haven't

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910
