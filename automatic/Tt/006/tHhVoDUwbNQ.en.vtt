00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.360
 what I went up 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.309
 by josé speakers they josé plains in 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.680

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.009
 passed like stuck on the shirt over 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.890
 of the lines and they realize what 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.020
 they removed from my property what I am the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.989
 barcelona shirt looks so 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.910
 lines coincide and there are never problems 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.460
 with this area the superposition of a 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.770
 shirt over another have not asked 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.590
 how did I achieve this that I am going to explain 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.130
 below and you can see it 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.760
 colors which use the design for 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.410
 the lines of the main shirt a 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.690
 design 1 on 3 on 4 and I think I did it 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.079
 first option of this stamping then 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.150
 go to the chest logo and what is done 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.160
 this data is important 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.230
 you keep the surprise and the past 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.840
 in playstation3 and copy it as an image 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.210
 here for example I have the six of 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.640
 several players and some shirts 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.280
 madrid is for example the barça that 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.680
 happened in the one she had put on but 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.159
 I have a barça shirt png or 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.560

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.369
 those squeeze x and it is imported from the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.210
 pendrive here and so is that shirt 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.310
 as they see in the images 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.390
 I hope you understood quite easily 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.760
