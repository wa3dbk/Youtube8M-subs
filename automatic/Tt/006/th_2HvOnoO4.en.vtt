00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.540 
different styles of lettering today and
I'm<00:00:16.199> working<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.100> watercolor

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
I'm working on just a watercolor

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.970 
I'm working on just a watercolor
postcard<00:00:18.119> I'm<00:00:18.300> starting<00:00:18.690> with<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.990> sumo<00:00:19.680> grip

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
postcard I'm starting with a sumo grip

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.000 
postcard I'm starting with a sumo grip
pencil<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.029> I'm<00:00:21.630> dividing<00:00:22.109> my<00:00:22.260> paper<00:00:22.529> into

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
pencil and I'm dividing my paper into

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.429 
pencil and I'm dividing my paper into
six<00:00:23.400> one-inch<00:00:24.060> sections<00:00:24.630> because<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.199> six

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
six one-inch sections because I have six

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.710 
six one-inch sections because I have six
letters<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.430> each<00:00:26.730> one<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.510> an

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
letters and I want each one to be an

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.160 
letters and I want each one to be an
inch<00:00:28.140> wide<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.029> then<00:00:30.029> I'm<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.449> sketching<00:00:31.019> in

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
inch wide and then I'm just sketching in

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
inch wide and then I'm just sketching in
so<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> first<00:00:31.650> letter<00:00:31.800> s<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.340> an<00:00:32.640> extra

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
so the first letter s is just an extra

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.930 
so the first letter s is just an extra
curvy<00:00:33.540> S<00:00:33.840> with<00:00:34.170> some<00:00:34.290> flourishes<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.730> two

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
curvy S with some flourishes my a is two

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.150 
curvy S with some flourishes my a is two
parallel<00:00:36.480> lines<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> little<00:00:37.920> foot

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
parallel lines I then get a little foot

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.729 
parallel lines I then get a little foot
the<00:00:38.760> K<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> little<00:00:39.360> more<00:00:39.540> extravagant<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the K is a little more extravagant and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.590 
the K is a little more extravagant and
it<00:00:40.800> does<00:00:40.950> extend<00:00:41.370> into<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.760> space<00:00:42.239> which<00:00:42.480> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
it does extend into the a space which is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
it does extend into the a space which is
fine<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.350> I'm<00:00:43.410> gonna<00:00:43.530> draw<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> big

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
fine and then I'm gonna draw a big

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.700 
fine and then I'm gonna draw a big
circle<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.670> gonna<00:00:44.820> put<00:00:44.910> my<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
circle which I'm gonna put my you in and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.680 
circle which I'm gonna put my you in and
notice<00:00:47.129> how<00:00:47.250> extends<00:00:47.640> into<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> case<00:00:48.300> space

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
notice how extends into the case space

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.000 
notice how extends into the case space
but<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.050> okay<00:00:49.289> because<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.590> already<00:00:49.710> there

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
but it's okay because it's already there

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.580 
but it's okay because it's already there
now<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.730> love<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.230> use<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
now I don't love that a you can use the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.200 
now I don't love that a you can use the
pencil<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> sumo<00:00:53.309> grip<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.000> said

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pencil in the sumo grip but I just said

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.959 
pencil in the sumo grip but I just said
it<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.420> too<00:00:54.660> small<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> went<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> bigger

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it was too small so I went for a bigger

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
it was too small so I went for a bigger
eraser<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> work<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.620> pencil

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
eraser and I like to work in pencil

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
eraser and I like to work in pencil
because<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> keep<00:00:59.699> erasing<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
because I like to keep erasing and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.560 
because I like to keep erasing and
trying<00:01:00.780> until<00:01:01.050> I'm<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.649> happy<00:01:02.030> with<00:01:03.030> what

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
trying until I'm really happy with what

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
trying until I'm really happy with what
I<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.680> go<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.250> spend<00:01:05.610> all

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
I have and then I go in and spend all

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
I have and then I go in and spend all
that<00:01:05.850> time<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> R<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> big<00:01:07.710> chunk

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that time so the R is just a big chunk

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.880 
that time so the R is just a big chunk
ER<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> final<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> curse<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
ER and then the final a is a curse of a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.060 
ER and then the final a is a curse of a
and<00:01:11.250> again<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.540> fix<00:01:12.750> anything<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.890> look

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and again I can fix anything I can look

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590 
and again I can fix anything I can look
at<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.030> I'm<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.270> add<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> little

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
at it I think I'm going to add a little

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.649 
at it I think I'm going to add a little
more<00:01:15.780> bulk<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.590> first<00:01:16.860> s<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:18.330> when<00:01:18.540> I'm

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
more bulk to that first s and when I'm

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.020 
more bulk to that first s and when I'm
ready<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.960> take<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> pigma<00:01:19.619> micron<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.820> size

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
ready I take a pigma micron and the size

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.030 
ready I take a pigma micron and the size
is<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> end<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.380> edge<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> pen

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
is on the end and on the edge of the pen

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.160 
is on the end and on the edge of the pen
and<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.460> taking<00:01:23.790> an<00:01:23.909> O<00:01:24.119> H<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and I'm taking an O H which is the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.130 
and I'm taking an O H which is the
largest<00:01:25.530> size<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:27.270> gonna<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.630> ahead<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
largest size and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.719 
largest size and I'm gonna go ahead and
I'm<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.380> gonna<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> call<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> clean

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I'm just gonna do what I call a clean

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.090 
I'm just gonna do what I call a clean
trace<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.720> means<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.500> try<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:31.950> as

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
trace that means that I try to be as

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.520 
trace that means that I try to be as
steady<00:01:32.400> as<00:01:32.579> possible<00:01:32.900> tracing<00:01:33.900> those<00:01:34.049> pencil

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
steady as possible tracing those pencil

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
steady as possible tracing those pencil
lines<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> really<00:01:35.220> beautiful<00:01:35.960> result<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
lines for a really beautiful result and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.899 
lines for a really beautiful result and
if<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.680> great<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.400> know<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.759> we're

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
if it's not great you know what we're

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.700 
if it's not great you know what we're
gonna<00:01:38.970> cover<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.570> lots<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.049> pens<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
gonna cover it up with lots of pens and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.780 
gonna cover it up with lots of pens and
paints<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> once<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.799> finished<00:01:44.189> doing<00:01:44.399> all

paints so once I have finished doing all

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.179 
paints so once I have finished doing all
of<00:01:44.820> my<00:01:45.119> outlining<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:46.770> gonna<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.070> ahead

something like that and they look wet
even<00:03:48.110> when<00:03:48.230> they're<00:03:48.350> dry<00:03:48.590> they<00:03:48.800> do<00:03:48.860> take<00:03:49.130> a

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
even when they're dry they do take a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.250 
even when they're dry they do take a
little<00:03:49.340> time<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:49.730> dry<00:03:49.900> but<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:50.990> other<00:03:51.110> nice

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260

thing<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.560> they<00:03:51.680> really<00:03:51.950> pool<00:03:52.250> now<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.090> was<00:03:53.450> just

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
thing is they really pool now I was just

thing is they really pool now I was just
holding<00:03:53.930> up<00:03:54.110> a<00:03:54.290> souffle<00:03:54.890> pen<00:03:55.190> which<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.460> what

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
holding up a souffle pen which is what

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.970 
holding up a souffle pen which is what
we're<00:03:55.790> gonna<00:03:55.850> color<00:03:56.300> in<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.810> U<00:03:56.990> with<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.590> it's

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
we're gonna color in the U with and it's

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.560 
we're gonna color in the U with and it's
also<00:03:58.190> what<00:03:58.430> we<00:03:58.520> used<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.730> do<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.970> dots<00:03:59.210> on<00:03:59.450> the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
also what we used to do the dots on the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.680 
also what we used to do the dots on the
a<00:03:59.600> and<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.860> difference<00:04:01.370> is<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.730> souffle<00:04:02.270> pen

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
a and the difference is the souffle pen

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.680 
a and the difference is the souffle pen
is<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.960> matte<00:04:03.470> raised<00:04:03.920> surface<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.480> can

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
is a matte raised surface so you can

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.660 
is a matte raised surface so you can
tell<00:04:05.960> from<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.230> caps<00:04:06.500> they<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:06.860> souffle<00:04:07.430> pens

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
tell from the caps they a souffle pens

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.550 
tell from the caps they a souffle pens
have<00:04:07.820> Matt<00:04:08.090> caps<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.870> glaze<00:04:09.050> pens<00:04:09.320> have

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
have Matt caps and the glaze pens have

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.510 
have Matt caps and the glaze pens have
shiny<00:04:09.980> caps<00:04:10.570> now<00:04:11.620> into<00:04:12.620> those<00:04:12.890> circles<00:04:13.340> I'm

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
shiny caps now into those circles I'm

shiny caps now into those circles I'm
just<00:04:13.880> using<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.270> pigma<00:04:14.660> micron<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:15.380> color<00:04:15.650> in

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
pigma micron and I'm just drawing some

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.860 
pigma micron and I'm just drawing some
lines<00:04:22.390> into<00:04:23.390> my<00:04:23.870> R<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.590> now<00:04:25.430> I'm<00:04:26.419> just<00:04:26.720> using

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
soft look and now the coolest moment

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.180 
soft look and now the coolest moment
that's<00:04:40.460> right<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.270> gold<00:04:41.690> pen<00:04:42.199> once<00:04:42.770> it's<00:04:42.979> dry

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
that's right that gold pen once it's dry

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.969 
that's right that gold pen once it's dry
axes<00:04:43.759> are<00:04:43.880> resist<00:04:44.449> and<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.289> resists<00:04:45.889> the

watercolor<00:04:46.639> now<00:04:46.940> I'm<00:04:47.090> drawing<00:04:47.300> this<00:04:47.509> with<00:04:47.630> a

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
watercolor now I'm drawing this with a

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.240 
watercolor now I'm drawing this with a
heat<00:04:47.900> gun<00:04:47.930> simply<00:04:48.410> because<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:48.740> want<00:04:48.979> to<00:04:49.130> add

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
heat gun simply because I want to add

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.969 
heat gun simply because I want to add
another<00:04:49.280> layer<00:04:49.970> of<00:04:50.270> ink<00:04:50.509> to<00:04:50.569> that<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.440> I

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
another layer of ink to that you and I

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.230 
another layer of ink to that you and I
would<00:04:52.039> normally<00:04:52.430> have<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.639> wait<00:04:52.789> about<00:04:52.910> five

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
would normally have to wait about five

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.059 
would normally have to wait about five
minutes<00:04:53.539> so<00:04:53.840> I'm<00:04:53.960> adding<00:04:54.199> a<00:04:54.440> second<00:04:54.889> layer<00:04:55.039> of

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
minutes so I'm adding a second layer of

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.230 
minutes so I'm adding a second layer of
all<00:04:56.349> three<00:04:57.349> colors<00:04:57.740> it's<00:04:58.130> to<00:04:58.460> glaze<00:04:58.759> pens<00:04:59.060> and

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
all three colors it's to glaze pens and

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.670 
all three colors it's to glaze pens and
a<00:04:59.300> souffle<00:04:59.660> and<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.900> reason<00:05:00.169> for<00:05:00.199> the<00:05:00.380> second

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
a souffle and the reason for the second

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.020 
a souffle and the reason for the second
layer<00:05:00.830> is<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.130> second<00:05:01.610> time<00:05:01.759> through<00:05:01.940> I'm

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
layer is the second time through I'm

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.510 
layer is the second time through I'm
just<00:05:02.090> gonna<00:05:02.300> get<00:05:02.509> a<00:05:02.539> lot<00:05:02.870> more<00:05:03.320> dimension<00:05:03.919> and

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
just gonna get a lot more dimension and

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.670 
just gonna get a lot more dimension and
that's<00:05:05.090> what<00:05:05.419> I'm<00:05:05.570> really<00:05:05.780> going<00:05:06.110> for<00:05:06.440> I

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
that's what I'm really going for I

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.839 
that's what I'm really going for I
always<00:05:06.830> think<00:05:07.070> that<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.190> first<00:05:07.460> layer<00:05:07.610> sort

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.770 
the way to remember how to do a shadow
is<00:05:30.710> just<00:05:30.860> pick<00:05:31.039> two<00:05:31.069> sides<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.360> goes<00:05:32.630> on

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
is just pick two sides and it goes on

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.570 
is just pick two sides and it goes on
every<00:05:33.110> letter<00:05:33.289> on<00:05:33.380> those<00:05:33.620> two<00:05:33.830> sides<00:05:34.099> in<00:05:34.460> this

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
every letter on those two sides in this

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.029 
every letter on those two sides in this
case<00:05:34.820> I'm<00:05:35.090> doing<00:05:35.659> anywhere<00:05:35.960> that's<00:05:36.139> under<00:05:36.770> or

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
case I'm doing anywhere that's under or

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.640 
case I'm doing anywhere that's under or
below<00:05:37.340> and<00:05:38.000> anywhere<00:05:38.750> that's<00:05:38.930> on<00:05:39.139> the<00:05:39.289> right

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
so under below or right gives a little

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.129 
so under below or right gives a little
wash<00:05:42.889> of<00:05:43.130> blue<00:05:43.159> watercolor<00:05:43.909> and<00:05:44.180> it's<00:05:44.330> amazing

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
makes it really just pops the whole
