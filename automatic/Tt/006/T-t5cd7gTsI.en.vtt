okay<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:35.260> what<00:02:35.440> we've<00:02:35.590> done<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.850> we've<00:02:36.850> split

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
okay so what we've done is we've split

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.380 
okay so what we've done is we've split
the<00:02:37.510> channel<00:02:38.670> we've<00:02:39.670> split<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.000> headphone

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
the channel we've split the headphone

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
often find this on some mixers where you

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.610 
often find this on some mixers where you
can<00:02:45.310> hire<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:45.940> blend<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.780> both

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620

we're<00:02:53.320> doing<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.560> using<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.920> alternate

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
we're doing is using the alternate

I'll turn the main volume up obviously
what<00:03:24.880> we<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.090> hear<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.420> we<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.110> track<00:03:26.320> on

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
what we can hear is we have the track on

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.550 
what we can hear is we have the track on
this<00:03:26.650> day<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.840> then<00:03:29.020> we've<00:03:29.140> got<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.380> master

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
this day and then we've got the master

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.880 
this day and then we've got the master
day<00:03:30.540> okay<00:03:31.540> they<00:03:31.960> do<00:03:32.020> swap<00:03:32.440> over<00:03:32.740> in<00:03:32.830> the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
day okay they do swap over in the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.080 
day okay they do swap over in the
headphones<00:03:33.250> when<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.520> move<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.820> cross<00:03:34.000> fader

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
headphones when you move the cross fader

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.850 
headphones when you move the cross fader
okay<00:03:37.500> right<00:03:38.550> that's<00:03:39.550> it<00:03:40.380> box<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.590> move<00:03:41.680> in

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
okay right that's it box and move in

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.850 
okay right that's it box and move in
isn't<00:03:42.070> air<00:03:42.989> that's<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.140> wiring<00:03:44.380> in<00:03:44.620> here<00:03:44.650> is

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
isn't air that's a wiring in here is

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.550 
isn't air that's a wiring in here is
very<00:03:44.890> simple<00:03:45.280> all<00:03:45.700> we<00:03:46.540> do<00:03:46.750> is<00:03:46.900> we've<00:03:47.050> got<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.320> go

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
very simple all we do is we've got to go

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.610 
very simple all we do is we've got to go
an<00:03:47.620> input<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.220> output<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.000> an<00:03:49.630> output<00:03:50.020> so

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
an input and output and an output so

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.640 
an input and output and an output so
what<00:03:50.739> we<00:03:50.860> do<00:03:51.070> is<00:03:51.310> we<00:03:51.550> take<00:03:51.820> a<00:03:52.060> ground<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:53.410> all

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
what we do is we take a ground to all

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.920 
what we do is we take a ground to all
four<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.280> these<00:03:54.580> units<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:55.150> there's<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.690> ground

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
four of these units so there's a ground

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.710 
four of these units so there's a ground
the<00:03:56.230> ground<00:03:56.410> runs<00:03:56.770> from<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.670> input<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.540> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
the ground runs from the input to the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.470 
the ground runs from the input to the
output<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.709> also<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.610> this<00:04:00.730> potentiometer

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
output and also to this potentiometer

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.050 
output and also to this potentiometer
which<00:04:01.570> is<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.780> single<00:04:02.440> gang<00:04:02.709> linear<00:04:04.410> 10k<00:04:06.060> we

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
which is a single gang linear 10k we

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.100 
which is a single gang linear 10k we
then<00:04:07.300> take<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:08.050> left-hand<00:04:09.570> input<00:04:10.570> from<00:04:10.930> the

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
then take the left-hand input from the

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.009 
then take the left-hand input from the
input<00:04:11.739> socket<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.340> send<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.239> directly<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
input socket and send it directly to the

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.120 
input socket and send it directly to the
master<00:04:14.800> out<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.880> we<00:04:16.870> send<00:04:17.140> it<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.590> inputs

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
master out and we send it to the inputs

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.060 
master out and we send it to the inputs
of<00:04:18.549> one<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.419> inputs<00:04:19.690> on<00:04:19.900> the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
of one of the inputs on the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.250 
of one of the inputs on the
potentiometer<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.970> then<00:04:22.150> travels<00:04:22.600> across<00:04:22.840> to

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
potentiometer it then travels across to

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.450 
potentiometer it then travels across to
the<00:04:23.440> right-hand<00:04:24.510> output<00:04:25.510> for<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.810> headphones

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
the right-hand output for the headphones

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.920 
the right-hand output for the headphones
the<00:04:27.460> reason<00:04:27.730> for<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.060> right-hand<00:04:28.480> output<00:04:28.810> for
