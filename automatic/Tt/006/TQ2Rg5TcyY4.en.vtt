and<00:01:58.880> striker<00:01:59.660> here<00:02:00.080> which<00:02:00.260> you<00:02:00.380> can<00:02:00.530> use<00:02:00.560> that

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
and striker here which you can use that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.300 
and striker here which you can use that
tried<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.340> out<00:02:01.430> once<00:02:01.700> made<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.060> lot<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.420> sparks

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
tried it out once made a lot of sparks

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.130 
tried it out once made a lot of sparks
so<00:02:04.310> definitely<00:02:04.730> a<00:02:04.850> very<00:02:05.330> good<00:02:05.510> fire<00:02:05.720> starter

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
so definitely a very good fire starter

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.380 
so definitely a very good fire starter
and<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.650> other<00:02:06.800> thing<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.040> in<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> end<00:02:08.149> of

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
and the other thing is in the end of

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.010 
and the other thing is in the end of
this<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.989> actually<00:02:09.229> has<00:02:09.610> storage<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:11.090> spire

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
this it actually has storage for spire

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.620 
this it actually has storage for spire
tender<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.100> actually<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.640> wet

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
tender and this is actually the wet

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.900 
tender and this is actually the wet
I<00:02:14.990> think<00:02:15.260> it's<00:02:15.380> called<00:02:15.500> wet<00:02:15.710> fire<00:02:15.950> tender<00:02:16.430> it's

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
I think it's called wet fire tender it's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.490 
I think it's called wet fire tender it's
actually<00:02:17.090> enclosed<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:17.900> did<00:02:18.050> it's<00:02:18.170> waterproof

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
actually enclosed so did it's waterproof

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.980 
actually enclosed so did it's waterproof
but<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.490> says<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.060> will<00:02:20.210> start<00:02:20.450> even<00:02:20.870> if

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
but it says that it will start even if

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.470 
but it says that it will start even if
it's<00:02:21.170> wet<00:02:21.410> if<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.220> use<00:02:22.520> this<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.150> needed<00:02:23.330> to

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
it's wet if I use this and I needed to

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.970 
it's wet if I use this and I needed to
put<00:02:23.630> something<00:02:23.840> else<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.620> didn't<00:02:24.860> have

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
put something else in if I didn't have

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.620 
put something else in if I didn't have
this<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.490> could<00:02:25.640> put<00:02:25.820> cotton<00:02:26.030> balls<00:02:26.360> or

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
this I could put cotton balls or

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.720 
this I could put cotton balls or
something<00:02:26.690> else<00:02:27.140> as<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.350> tender<00:02:27.710> inside<00:02:28.070> here

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
something else as a tender inside here

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.510 
something else as a tender inside here
so<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.940> really<00:02:29.270> like<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:30.100> okay<00:02:31.100> so<00:02:31.160> that's

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
so I really like that okay so that's

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.430 
so I really like that okay so that's
that<00:02:31.700> item<00:02:32.530> next<00:02:33.530> thing<00:02:33.710> I<00:02:33.890> got<00:02:34.070> was<00:02:34.100> aqua<00:02:34.790> Mira

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
that item next thing I got was aqua Mira

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.560 
that item next thing I got was aqua Mira
frontier<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:37.070> an<00:02:37.310> emergency<00:02:37.970> water

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
frontier this is a an emergency water

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.960 
frontier this is a an emergency water
filtration<00:02:39.110> system<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:40.190> actually<00:02:40.490> just<00:02:40.820> a

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
filtration system is actually just a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.970 
filtration system is actually just a
straw<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.900> would<00:02:42.050> suck<00:02:42.380> through<00:02:42.740> and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
straw that you would suck through and

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.090 
straw that you would suck through and
this<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.270> supposedly<00:02:44.840> good<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.560> about<00:02:45.740> 20

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
this is supposedly good for about 20

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.980 
this is supposedly good for about 20
gallons<00:02:46.490> of<00:02:46.640> water<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.540> thought<00:02:47.720> this<00:02:47.870> is

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
gallons of water so I thought this is

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.890 
gallons of water so I thought this is
really<00:02:48.020> nice<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.620> weighs<00:02:48.770> one<00:02:49.070> ounce<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.670> I

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
really nice it weighs one ounce and I

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.730 
really nice it weighs one ounce and I
was<00:02:50.900> pretty<00:02:51.080> impressed<00:02:51.260> with<00:02:51.620> this

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
was pretty impressed with this

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.900 
was pretty impressed with this
definitely<00:02:52.250> something<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.550> throw<00:02:52.610> in<00:02:52.790> my

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
definitely something to throw in my

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.500 
definitely something to throw in my
miniature<00:02:53.330> survival<00:02:53.780> kit<00:02:54.730> also<00:02:55.730> ten<00:02:56.120> dollars

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
miniature survival kit also ten dollars

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.590 
miniature survival kit also ten dollars
so<00:02:56.810> that's<00:02:56.990> pretty<00:02:57.170> good<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.940> next<00:02:59.180> thing<00:02:59.360> is

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
so that's pretty good the next thing is

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.290 
so that's pretty good the next thing is
the<00:02:59.750> bigger<00:03:00.050> item<00:03:00.410> it's<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:01.010> k-bar<00:03:01.400> knife<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:02.150> I

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
knives already court including the US

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.310 
knives already court including the US
Marine<00:03:07.490> Corps<00:03:07.520> knife<00:03:07.910> but<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.690> liked<00:03:09.110> this

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
Marine Corps knife but I liked this

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.980 
Marine Corps knife but I liked this
knife<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.980> website<00:03:10.460> it<00:03:11.390> does<00:03:11.600> have<00:03:11.750> the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
knife on the website it does have the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.640 
knife on the website it does have the
rounded<00:03:12.950> blade<00:03:13.190> which<00:03:13.520> is<00:03:13.670> good<00:03:13.910> as<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> chopper

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
rounded blade which is good as a chopper

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.200 
rounded blade which is good as a chopper
but<00:03:15.650> my<00:03:15.740> initial<00:03:15.950> impression<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:16.970> it's

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
but my initial impression of it is it's

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.520 
but my initial impression of it is it's
a<00:03:17.300> little<00:03:17.540> bit<00:03:17.630> smaller<00:03:17.960> than<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.380> was

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
a little bit smaller than I was

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.890 
a little bit smaller than I was
expecting<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:19.370> was<00:03:20.150> thinking<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.510> knife<00:03:20.660> might

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
expecting I was thinking the knife might

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.760 
expecting I was thinking the knife might
be<00:03:20.990> a<00:03:21.020> little<00:03:21.170> bigger<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:21.470> should<00:03:21.680> have

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
be a little bigger I should have

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.140 
be a little bigger I should have
probably<00:03:21.950> paid<00:03:22.280> closer<00:03:22.580> attention<00:03:22.700> to

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
probably paid closer attention to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.020 
probably paid closer attention to
specifications<00:03:24.080> on<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.290> internet<00:03:24.620> site<00:03:25.030> the

I<00:03:44.240> would<00:03:45.020> probably<00:03:45.200> prefer<00:03:45.500> something<00:03:46.040> maybe

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550
