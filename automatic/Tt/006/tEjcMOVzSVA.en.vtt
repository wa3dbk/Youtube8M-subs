00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.809
 I welcome tankers with you Jos 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.719
 we are going to review today 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:12.809
 Soviet tank of the second level kv-1s 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.549
 cannon and here 5 and traditionally short 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.500
 let's go over his tth 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.510
 weight 44 tons engine power 550 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.840
 Horse power 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.640
 maximum speed of 41 kilometers per hour 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.130
 booking body 100 millimeters in 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.580
 frontal projection and along the sides and 70 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.230
 millimeters in the stern booking tower 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.990
 75 millimeters try angles 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 vertical guidance down minus 6 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.400
 degrees up +25 gun of seventy 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.100
 six millimeter cannon here 5 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.110
 ammunition 116 shells and now more 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.370
 consider in detail the advantages and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.430
 disadvantages of this machine in this video 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.190
 it will be about the KV-1 tank with the installed 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.650
 on him gun zis-5 gun is not the same 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.080
 powerful well yet still generally allowing 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.729
 more or less comfortable to play on this 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.240
 car unlike his 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.670
 predecessor kv-1s l-11 gun 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 the main purpose of the car in the game 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.149
 war thunder 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.249
 is a breakthrough of enemy tank defense 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.590
 able to hold one's enemy forces 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.630
 With competent tanking a diamond and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.999
 reverse the attack on diamond 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.429
 enemy positions it is advisable to cooperate 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:28.469
 with medium allied tanks since 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.539
 due to poor maneuverability is high 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.539
 probability of entering enemy averages 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.060
 tanks in the stern square-1 armor in this 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.149
 tank's pretty strong so many 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.509
 machines 1 and 2 era forehead head on 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.579
 Apt-1 will not be so easy but still not 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.009
 you must underestimate the enemy and be alert 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.880
 if there is a shootout with such 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.939
 tanks like German pz 4 liters f2 and 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.700
 pieces 3 letter e as listed 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.920
 machines cost guns with more penetrating 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.619
 ability than millimeters in your 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.139
 armor as the above machines 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.509
 will be able to pierce you up to medium 

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:08.910
 distances of 500-600 meters 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.560
 armor piercing shells naturally 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.950
 apply substantial 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.930
 ron speaker in q-1 is not self-best 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.739
 therefore it can be called a tank of one 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.599
 directions 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.400
 quickly change flank or during 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.370
 return from one capture point to 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.620
 the other will not work so I advise you 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.470
 the beginning of the battle to choose the direction 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.569
 which you will push another one 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.700
 minus the car is slow 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.010
 turn the tower so how are you easy in 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.200
 melee will be able to spin more 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.030
 mobile tanks a due to lack of 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.670
 good vertical alignment angles 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.340
 guns need to constantly adjust 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.010
 under the terrain and choose such 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.610
 areas of the battlefield where there are no ravines and 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.100
 the hills 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.950
 if we talk about the pros then you need 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.349
 note the good durability of apt-1 which 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.110
 allows you to focus on the fire 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.140
 adversary thereby saving the lungs and 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.810
 medium tanks of their allies fighting 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.239
 the machine is not the most dynamic and fast but 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.090
 all this is compensated for decent fire 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.549
 power and good armor on the pros and 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.130
 cons we finished and then we look at 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:19.829
 booking and layout of the surveyed 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:23.640
 technique for reviewing the reservation of the tank 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:26.670
 KV -1 modification ZIS-5 I took a 3d model 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.829
 usually in apt-1 because their booking 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.319
 similar to each other except 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.810
 the fact that the square-1 here were five 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.420
 installed an additional twenty five 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.019
 millimeter screens on the screenshots they 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.989
 highlighted in red so given 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.540
 all this will start the review 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.299
 frontal projection upper armor plate here 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.060
 indicated 75 millimeters but do not forget 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.670
 pro screens and in total goes 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.430
 about 100 millimeters of face 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.440
 bottom armor liner 75 millimeters also 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.720
 I would like to note strong enough 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.440
 part of the frontal projection of the tank here this 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.019
 shelf 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.880
 it alone is 40 millimeters but 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.280
 being at an excellent slope 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.810
 reduced armor is about a hundred 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.720
 twenty three millimeters 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.480
 the forehead of the car is pretty strong 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.530
 there are weak points there is a hatch and 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.650
 machine gun 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.680
 radio operators arrow lists the zones in total 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.600
 60 millimeters in terms of armor 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.110
 turret mask guns 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.360
 95 millimeters cheek mask 90 millimeters 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.550
 and the edging of the tower itself 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.250
 75 millimeters of a board and a forage of a tower on 75 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.610
 millimeters further consider the layout 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.310
 tank crew modules and so frontal 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.220
 projection in front of the car are sitting 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.280
 mechanic wizard and radio operator shooter as I have already 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.530
 spoke earlier in the forehead there are weak zones this 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.990
 driver and machine gun slots 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.390
 radio operator's nest 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.970
 shooting at these zones you can kill 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.190
 these tankers well say more 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.440
 shooting the arrow is radioman 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.930
 the likelihood of arson tank as for 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.710
 the back of this crew member are 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.860
 tanks further side projection in front 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.590
 parts are the tank right behind him still 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.979
 one bar and as we see the part sticks out 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.130
 ammunition yellow back area 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.080
 the car is the engine 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:29.040
 opposite board under the towers are 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.140
 aft rear engine tanks 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.380
 I think projections do not need much to sharpen 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.530
 attention because everything is clear here 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.169
 engine here transmission now 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.930
 consider the tower there are three 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.930
 crew member on the right gunner on the left 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.419
 the commander and right after him sits loader 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.470
 of the modules here is only 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.250
 ammunition 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:56.550
 in the back of the tower on both sides here 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.770
 here and here accordingly on 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.680
 Today I have everything if this video was 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.630
