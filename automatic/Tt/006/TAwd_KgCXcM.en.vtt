kind of a really cool caterpillar and I

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.510 
kind of a really cool caterpillar and I
just<00:00:31.050> held<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.500> behind<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.130> just<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.489> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
just held that behind it just so you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060 
just held that behind it just so you
could<00:00:32.759> kind<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> sense<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.590> without

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
so much backlight but it looks like his

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
so much backlight but it looks like his
head<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.149> over<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> left<00:00:39.960> side<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.440> the
