OC lb frames I'd like to talk about a
couple<00:02:02.759> features<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.689> make<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.110> bike<00:02:04.439> so

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
couple features that make this bike so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.340 
couple features that make this bike so
unique<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.840> really<00:02:06.840> stiff<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
unique and so really stiff and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.760 
unique and so really stiff and
responsive<00:02:07.950> first<00:02:08.250> thing<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.780> BB<00:02:09.780> 90<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.709> is

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
responsive first thing is BB 90 this is

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.000 
responsive first thing is BB 90 this is
a<00:02:10.950> 90<00:02:11.520> millimeter<00:02:12.000> wide<00:02:12.270> bottom<00:02:12.900> bracket

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
a 90 millimeter wide bottom bracket

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.450 
a 90 millimeter wide bottom bracket
extremely<00:02:15.180> stiff<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.570> responsive<00:02:17.440> this<00:02:18.280> bike

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
extremely stiff and responsive this bike

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.730 
extremely stiff and responsive this bike
doesn't<00:02:18.670> do<00:02:18.910> anything<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.720> go<00:02:19.900> forward<00:02:20.530> when

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
doesn't do anything but go forward when

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.250 
doesn't do anything but go forward when
you<00:02:20.860> step<00:02:21.130> on<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.370> pedals<00:02:21.730> it's<00:02:22.570> really<00:02:23.020> an

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
you step on the pedals it's really an

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.990 
you step on the pedals it's really an
amazing<00:02:23.530> experience<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.400> ride<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.880> these

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
amazing experience to ride one of these

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.150 
amazing experience to ride one of these
bikes<00:02:25.290> another<00:02:26.290> thing<00:02:26.500> if<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.650> look<00:02:26.800> at<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
bikes another thing if you look at the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.430 
bikes another thing if you look at the
seat<00:02:27.460> tube<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.240> see<00:02:28.480> how<00:02:28.690> wide<00:02:29.110> it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
seat tube here you can see how wide it

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.520 
seat tube here you can see how wide it
gets<00:02:29.800> right<00:02:30.190> here<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:31.510> just<00:02:31.750> helps<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.320> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
gets right here that just helps in the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.010 
gets right here that just helps in the
lateral<00:02:33.370> stiffness<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.240> stability<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.780> this

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
lateral stiffness and stability of this

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.230 
lateral stiffness and stability of this
bike<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:36.010> other<00:02:36.160> thing<00:02:36.400> if<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.580> look<00:02:36.790> at<00:02:36.970> this

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240

what's which means it's comfortable

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.490 
what's which means it's comfortable
riding<00:03:36.640> bike<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.270> one<00:03:38.140> of<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.320> ways<00:03:38.470> that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
riding bike and one of the ways that

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.680 
riding bike and one of the ways that
this<00:03:38.740> is<00:03:38.920> achieved<00:03:39.090> if<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.120> look<00:03:40.390> at<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
this is achieved if you look at the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.040 
this is achieved if you look at the

tapered head tube on this bike which is
pretty<00:04:07.120> standard<00:04:07.270> on<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.720> lot<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:08.020> bikes<00:04:08.170> right

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
pretty standard on a lot of bikes right

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.860 
pretty standard on a lot of bikes right
now<00:04:08.620> trucks<00:04:09.459> taking<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:10.000> one<00:04:10.180> step<00:04:10.240> further

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
now trucks taking it one step further

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.430 
now trucks taking it one step further
they<00:04:11.770> have<00:04:11.830> an<00:04:12.070> e<00:04:12.310> 2<00:04:12.550> tapered<00:04:13.300> steer<00:04:13.930> tube<00:04:14.200> on

Shimano crew came in and showed us the
stuff<00:05:04.270> we<00:05:05.110> were<00:05:05.230> all<00:05:05.410> very<00:05:05.950> skeptical<00:05:06.820> we<00:05:07.810> had

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
stuff we were all very skeptical we had

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.680 
stuff we were all very skeptical we had
seen<00:05:08.110> some<00:05:08.290> electronic<00:05:08.770> shifting<00:05:09.690> earlier

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
seen some electronic shifting earlier

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.100 
seen some electronic shifting earlier
years<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.500> uh<00:05:11.610> but<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:12.640> tell<00:05:12.850> ya<00:05:13.030> half<00:05:13.900> hour

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
years and uh but I tell ya half hour

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.290 
years and uh but I tell ya half hour
after<00:05:14.380> we<00:05:14.980> had<00:05:15.130> ridden<00:05:15.700> and<00:05:15.940> looked<00:05:16.090> at<00:05:16.210> this

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
after we had ridden and looked at this

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.570 
after we had ridden and looked at this
stuff<00:05:16.420> we<00:05:16.780> all<00:05:16.900> had<00:05:17.050> huge<00:05:17.500> smiles<00:05:18.040> on<00:05:18.280> her<00:05:18.370> face

because this stuff is amazing it is

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.930 
because this stuff is amazing it is
dialed<00:05:21.970> it's<00:05:22.690> a<00:05:22.990> hundred<00:05:23.620> percent<00:05:23.940> precise

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
dialed it's a hundred percent precise

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.420 
dialed it's a hundred percent precise
shifting<00:05:25.510> a<00:05:25.720> hundred<00:05:26.560> percent<00:05:26.770> of<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.890> time<00:05:27.130> I

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
shifting a hundred percent of the time I

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.090 
shifting a hundred percent of the time I
mean<00:05:27.760> just<00:05:28.060> simply<00:05:28.510> amazing<00:05:28.630> so<00:05:29.260> let's<00:05:29.890> take<00:05:30.070> a
