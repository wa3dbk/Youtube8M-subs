non<00:01:52.460> each<00:01:52.759> side<00:01:53.119> that<00:01:53.750> way<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:53.990> know

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
non each side that way I know

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.830 
non each side that way I know
everything's<00:01:55.069> kind<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:55.490> evened<00:01:55.850> up<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.360> then

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
everything's kind of evened up and then

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.320 
everything's kind of evened up and then
I<00:01:56.869> just<00:01:57.170> have<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.319> pin<00:01:57.770> kind<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.550> fill<00:01:58.789> in<00:01:59.000> the

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
I just have to pin kind of fill in the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.290 
I just have to pin kind of fill in the
pinning<00:01:59.750> that<00:02:00.020> makes<00:02:00.319> sense<00:02:00.940> okay<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.000> there

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
pinning that makes sense okay so there

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.150 
pinning that makes sense okay so there
we<00:02:02.330> have<00:02:02.450> our<00:02:02.600> first<00:02:02.750> pin<00:02:03.319> which<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.740> just<00:02:03.920> on

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
we have our first pin which is just on

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.919 
we have our first pin which is just on
the<00:02:04.190> back<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.789> shoulder<00:02:05.179> I'm<00:02:05.569> going<00:02:05.780> to

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
the back of the shoulder I'm going to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.020 
the back of the shoulder I'm going to
flip<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:06.289> so<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.190> we're<00:02:07.369> dealing<00:02:07.520> with<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
flip this so that we're dealing with the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.669 
flip this so that we're dealing with the
section<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:08.539> is<00:02:08.869> right<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:09.229> top<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
section that is right on top of the

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.480 
section that is right on top of the
shoulder<00:02:10.510> again<00:02:14.650> bring<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.680> hem<00:02:16.069> at<00:02:16.250> 1<00:02:16.459> inch

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
shoulder again bring that hem at 1 inch

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.640 
shoulder again bring that hem at 1 inch
and<00:02:16.910> then<00:02:17.030> I'm<00:02:17.090> placing<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:18.020> my<00:02:18.910> pin<00:02:20.650> alright

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
and then I'm placing in my pin alright

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.620 
and then I'm placing in my pin alright
so<00:02:21.830> I'm<00:02:21.920> just<00:02:22.100> going<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.550> continue<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:23.060> pin

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.590 

so<00:02:29.290> what<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.680> also<00:02:30.040> did<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.910> went<00:02:30.940> along<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
so what I also did is I went along the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.000 
so what I also did is I went along the
very<00:02:31.810> edge<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.490> use<00:02:34.030> my<00:02:34.240> pinking<00:02:34.660> shears<00:02:35.010> so

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
very edge and I use my pinking shears so

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.730 
very edge and I use my pinking shears so
that<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.520> fabric<00:02:36.820> wouldn't<00:02:37.330> fray<00:02:37.750> now

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
that the fabric wouldn't fray now

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.590 
that the fabric wouldn't fray now
there's<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.310> couple<00:02:39.580> things<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.210> can<00:02:40.360> do

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
there's a couple things that you can do

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.260 
there's a couple things that you can do
for<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.140> armholes<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:42.310> suggests<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.090> you

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
for the armholes it suggests that you

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.710 
for the armholes it suggests that you
can<00:02:43.480> either<00:02:43.720> do<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.580> seam<00:02:45.580> binding<00:02:45.880> which<00:02:46.510> is

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
can either do a seam binding which is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.250 
can either do a seam binding which is
which<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:48.040> which<00:02:48.700> essentially<00:02:49.240> is<00:02:49.600> just

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
which is this which essentially is just

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.030 
which is this which essentially is just
fabric<00:02:50.680> folded<00:02:51.130> over<00:02:51.310> which<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.820> open<00:02:52.270> up<00:02:53.040> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
fabric folded over which you open up and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.690 
fabric folded over which you open up and
wrap<00:02:54.220> around<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:56.320> edge<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.740> your<00:02:56.800> fabric<00:02:57.160> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
wrap around the edge of your fabric and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.000 
wrap around the edge of your fabric and
then<00:02:57.820> stitch<00:02:58.240> down<00:02:58.510> our<00:02:59.290> neck<00:02:59.500> line<00:02:59.710> doesn't

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
then stitch down our neck line doesn't

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.740 
then stitch down our neck line doesn't
have<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> black<00:03:00.550> binding<00:03:01.000> around<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.690> I

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
have a black binding around it so I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.120 
have a black binding around it so I
think<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.050> would<00:03:02.140> look<00:03:02.290> silly<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:02.920> don't

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
think it would look silly so I don't

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.980 
think it would look silly so I don't
want<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.340> do<00:03:03.460> that<00:03:03.490> so<00:03:04.300> I'm<00:03:04.600> going<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.840> go<00:03:04.960> with

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
want to do that so I'm going to go with

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.940 
want to do that so I'm going to go with
just<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.560> standard<00:03:06.070> hem<00:03:07.060> on<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.440> what

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
just the standard hem on this so what

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.060 
just the standard hem on this so what
I'm<00:03:09.070> going<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.430> do<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:11.440> am<00:03:11.980> going<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:15.390> fold<00:03:16.390> my

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
I'm going to do is I am going to fold my

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.180 
I'm going to do is I am going to fold my
cut<00:03:18.070> edge<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.990> towards<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:21.420> folded<00:03:22.420> area<00:03:22.840> and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
cut edge in towards the folded area and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:31.270 
cut edge in towards the folded area and
then<00:03:24.510> I'm<00:03:25.510> going<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.870> pin<00:03:26.110> that

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.850 

and<00:03:31.640> then<00:03:32.030> when<00:03:32.390> we<00:03:32.420> stitch<00:03:33.080> this<00:03:33.440> we're<00:03:33.770> going

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
and then when we stitch this we're going

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.510 
and then when we stitch this we're going
to<00:03:33.920> stitch<00:03:34.250> as<00:03:34.400> close<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:35.090> our<00:03:36.080> folded<00:03:37.010> edge<00:03:37.220> as

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
to stitch as close to our folded edge as

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.300 
to stitch as close to our folded edge as
possible<00:03:38.530> because<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:39.740> will<00:03:39.860> give<00:03:40.040> us<00:03:40.130> a

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
possible because that will give us a

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.850 
possible because that will give us a
nice<00:03:40.490> finished<00:03:41.450> edge<00:03:41.660> there<00:03:42.110> we<00:03:42.560> won't<00:03:42.680> have

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
nice finished edge there we won't have

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.640 
nice finished edge there we won't have
to<00:03:42.980> worry<00:03:43.160> about<00:03:43.250> fraying<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.410> on<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.500> other

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
to worry about fraying and on the other

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.340 
to worry about fraying and on the other
side<00:03:46.040> will<00:03:46.310> have<00:03:46.490> a<00:03:46.790> nice<00:03:47.060> black<00:03:47.870> stitch

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
side will have a nice black stitch

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.229 
side will have a nice black stitch
detail<00:03:48.890> here<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.180> again<00:03:50.630> all<00:03:50.959> I'm<00:03:51.230> doing<00:03:51.620> is

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
detail here so again all I'm doing is

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.600 
detail here so again all I'm doing is
taking<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:55.660> fabric<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.810> we<00:03:56.989> just<00:03:57.230> trimmed

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
taking that fabric that we just trimmed

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.400 
taking that fabric that we just trimmed
chucking<00:03:58.610> it<00:03:58.730> inside<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:01.130> scene<00:04:01.520> and<00:04:02.410> then

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
chucking it inside the scene and then

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.020 
chucking it inside the scene and then
pinning<00:04:03.830> it<00:04:06.370> alright<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:07.610> I'm<00:04:07.700> going<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:07.880> do

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
pinning it alright so I'm going to do

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.780 
pinning it alright so I'm going to do
that<00:04:08.180> all<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.390> way<00:04:08.630> around<00:04:08.870> both<00:04:09.350> of<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.980> arm

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
that all the way around both of the arm

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.490 
that all the way around both of the arm
holes<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.510> then<00:04:11.660> we're<00:04:12.019> going<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.200> get<00:04:12.350> to

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
holes and then we're going to get to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.080 
holes and then we're going to get to
stitch<00:04:12.739> in<00:04:12.890> this<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:13.519> what<00:04:13.640> I<00:04:13.670> did<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:13.970> make

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
stitch in this so what I did to make

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.140 
stitch in this so what I did to make
things<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.450> little<00:04:14.540> bit<00:04:14.750> easier<00:04:14.930> is<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.769> took

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
things a little bit easier is I took

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.449 
things a little bit easier is I took
this<00:04:17.150> section<00:04:17.630> off<00:04:17.840> my<00:04:18.079> sewing<00:04:18.290> machine<00:04:18.459> so

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
this section off my sewing machine so

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.740 
this section off my sewing machine so
that<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.760> would<00:04:19.910> be<00:04:20.030> easier<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.540> fit<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.550> arm

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
that it would be easier to fit the arm

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.840 
that it would be easier to fit the arm
around<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.530> what<00:04:24.680> I'm<00:04:24.770> going<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:24.950> do<00:04:25.130> is<00:04:25.430> I'm

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
around so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.900 
around so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.470> slide<00:04:27.470> out<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.860> couple<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.460> my<00:04:28.610> pins

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
going to slide out a couple of my pins

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.530 
going to slide out a couple of my pins
here<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:30.740> am<00:04:30.770> going<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.400> place<00:04:31.669> my<00:04:31.700> fabric

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
here and I am going to place my fabric

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.600 
here and I am going to place my fabric
right<00:04:34.870> there<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.380> bring<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:37.010> needle<00:04:37.190> down

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
right there and bring the needle down

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.219 
right there and bring the needle down
and<00:04:38.330> again<00:04:38.800> right<00:04:39.800> on<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.280> very<00:04:40.850> edge<00:04:41.150> of

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
and again right on to the very edge of

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.000 
and again right on to the very edge of
our<00:04:42.229> folded<00:04:42.830> edge<00:04:43.010> there<00:04:44.500> very<00:04:45.500> edge<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.950> that

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
our folded edge there very edge of that

00:04:46.010 --> 00:05:00.550 
our folded edge there very edge of that
sold<00:04:46.490> right<00:04:46.760> there

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.080 

reaching<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.650> bit<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.889> a<00:05:01.949> tricky<00:05:02.220> part<00:05:02.580> in<00:05:02.819> this

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
reaching a bit of a tricky part in this

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.969 
reaching a bit of a tricky part in this
stitch<00:05:03.569> and<00:05:04.520> that<00:05:05.520> is<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.449> armpit<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.680> very

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
stitch and that is the armpit the very

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.230 
stitch and that is the armpit the very
very<00:05:08.340> bottom<00:05:08.849> of<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.180> armpit<00:05:09.660> where<00:05:11.030> we<00:05:12.030> meet

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
very bottom of the armpit where we meet

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.879 
very bottom of the armpit where we meet
this<00:05:12.419> other<00:05:12.599> stitching<00:05:13.169> because<00:05:13.380> as<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:13.680> see

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
this other stitching because as you see

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.290 
this other stitching because as you see
our<00:05:15.410> pinning<00:05:16.410> goes<00:05:16.710> up<00:05:16.949> this<00:05:17.130> way<00:05:17.430> so

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
our pinning goes up this way so

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.809 
our pinning goes up this way so
essentially<00:05:18.930> what<00:05:19.229> we're<00:05:19.410> going<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:19.650> do<00:05:19.889> is

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
essentially what we're going to do is

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.370 
essentially what we're going to do is
you<00:05:21.000> just<00:05:21.030> want<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.389> peel<00:05:21.750> back<00:05:21.780> all<00:05:22.229> those

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
you just want to peel back all those

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.790 
you just want to peel back all those
layers<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:23.669> that<00:05:23.699> you<00:05:23.940> can<00:05:24.090> see<00:05:24.440> where<00:05:25.440> that

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
layers so that you can see where that

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.960 
layers so that you can see where that
turn<00:05:26.789> takes<00:05:27.240> place<00:05:29.990> and<00:05:30.990> just<00:05:31.110> go<00:05:31.289> really<00:05:31.500> slow

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
turn takes place and just go really slow

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.550 
turn takes place and just go really slow
and<00:05:32.970> then<00:05:33.720> as<00:05:34.020> you<00:05:34.229> approach<00:05:34.620> that<00:05:34.979> the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
and then as you approach that the

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.460 
and then as you approach that the
intersection<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:38.690> manually<00:05:39.690> turn<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.139> wheel

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.320 

until<00:05:46.470> I<00:05:46.680> get<00:05:46.889> right<00:05:47.130> at<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.460> center<00:05:48.060> point

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
until I get right at the center point

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.580 
until I get right at the center point
and<00:05:49.080> then<00:05:49.229> I<00:05:49.259> lift<00:05:49.770> my<00:05:49.919> foot<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:51.050> I<00:05:52.050> shift<00:05:52.440> my

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
and then I lift my foot and I shift my

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.140 
and then I lift my foot and I shift my
fabric<00:05:54.500> so<00:05:55.500> that<00:05:55.530> I<00:05:55.830> am<00:05:55.889> now<00:05:56.220> pointed<00:05:56.909> in<00:05:57.060> the

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
fabric so that I am now pointed in the

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.899 
fabric so that I am now pointed in the
right<00:05:57.270> direction<00:05:57.330> now<00:05:58.400> still<00:05:59.400> a<00:05:59.430> bit<00:05:59.729> of<00:05:59.849> a

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
right direction now still a bit of a

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.830 
right direction now still a bit of a
tricky<00:06:00.180> area<00:06:00.479> here<00:06:01.169> so<00:06:02.009> I'm<00:06:02.340> going<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.729> do<00:06:03.690> the

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
tricky area here so I'm going to do the

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.629 
tricky area here so I'm going to do the
foot<00:06:04.080> a<00:06:04.259> couple<00:06:04.289> times<00:06:07.250> manually<00:06:08.250> spend<00:06:08.550> the

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
foot a couple times manually spend the

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.709 
foot a couple times manually spend the
wheel<00:06:08.759> a<00:06:08.789> couple<00:06:09.240> times<00:06:10.909> before<00:06:11.909> taking<00:06:12.599> up

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
wheel a couple times before taking up

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:16.430 
wheel a couple times before taking up
the<00:06:13.710> regular<00:06:13.830> stitching<00:06:14.460> all<00:06:14.940> right<00:06:15.440> citing

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
the regular stitching all right citing

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.709 
the regular stitching all right citing
the<00:06:16.710> times<00:06:17.219> we<00:06:17.909> have<00:06:18.180> our<00:06:19.759> top<00:06:20.759> is<00:06:21.180> pretty

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
the times we have our top is pretty

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.399 
the times we have our top is pretty
close<00:06:21.900> to<00:06:21.960> being<00:06:22.380> done<00:06:22.409> and<00:06:23.599> now<00:06:24.599> we<00:06:24.659> are<00:06:25.110> going

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
close to being done and now we are going

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.700 
close to being done and now we are going
to<00:06:25.590> move<00:06:25.770> on<00:06:25.860> to<00:06:26.190> the<00:06:26.310> Scorch<00:06:26.990> so<00:06:27.990> we're<00:06:28.530> going

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
to move on to the Scorch so we're going

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.950 
to be take pieces 6 and 7 and I'll lay
them<00:06:34.259> out<00:06:34.759> want<00:06:35.759> the<00:06:35.940> right<00:06:36.180> sides<00:06:36.599> facing

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
them out want the right sides facing

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.250 
them out want the right sides facing
each<00:06:37.530> other<00:06:37.789> well<00:06:38.789> we<00:06:39.000> are<00:06:39.150> going<00:06:39.509> to

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
each other well we are going to

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.130 
each other well we are going to
match<00:06:40.590> up<00:06:40.830> the<00:06:40.860> size<00:06:41.220> of<00:06:41.550> our<00:06:41.700> skirt<00:06:42.150> start<00:06:42.960> on

that<00:06:43.290> side<00:06:43.350> by<00:06:43.860> matching<00:06:44.310> up<00:06:44.430> the<00:06:44.460> notches

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
that side by matching up the notches

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.770 
that side by matching up the notches
that<00:06:45.360> we<00:06:45.540> made<00:06:46.790> was<00:06:47.790> fine<00:06:48.030> that's<00:06:48.240> the<00:06:48.420> easiest

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
that we made was fine that's the easiest

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:56.270 
that we made was fine that's the easiest
way<00:06:49.020> to<00:06:49.080> get<00:06:49.560> things<00:06:49.890> up<00:06:50.250> Roman<00:06:54.860> and<00:06:55.860> then<00:06:56.040> what

way to get things up Roman and then what

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.630 
way to get things up Roman and then what
I<00:06:56.310> like<00:06:56.400> to<00:06:56.790> do<00:06:56.910> is<00:06:57.150> I<00:06:57.540> like<00:06:57.570> to<00:06:57.720> match<00:06:57.960> up<00:06:58.170> Rob

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
I like to do is I like to match up Rob

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.220 
I like to do is I like to match up Rob
then<00:06:59.640> you<00:07:00.540> got<00:07:00.690> it<00:07:01.250> unit<00:07:02.250> the<00:07:02.430> top<00:07:03.110> and<00:07:04.110> then

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.230 
then you got it unit the top and then

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.340 
then you got it unit the top and then
we're<00:07:04.590> going<00:07:04.800> to<00:07:04.980> in<00:07:05.430> size<00:07:05.730> here<00:07:06.300> and<00:07:06.540> then<00:07:06.870> we

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
we're going to in size here and then we

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.980 
we're going to in size here and then we
are<00:07:07.470> going<00:07:07.710> to<00:07:08.190> go<00:07:08.460> ahead<00:07:08.700> and<00:07:08.850> finish<00:07:09.720> up

are going to go ahead and finish up

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.380 
are going to go ahead and finish up
kanang<00:07:10.410> besides<00:07:10.800> and<00:07:11.010> sings<00:07:11.280> on<00:07:11.910> this<00:07:12.150> side
