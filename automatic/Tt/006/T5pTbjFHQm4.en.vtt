00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
 O 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.430
 the first game we are about 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.520
 people already had an idea of what they 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.070
 that their games went well and activate the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.989
 select people practically predicted without 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.250
 to get them to do so by finding him 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.279
 band jana that we did what 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.540
 means we did everything very fast 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.070
 both they have no chance of thinking 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.690
 much and we were 100% of the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.719
 what would we do the game went 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.820
 exactly the way he thought about 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.560
 there are some slips that people 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.480
 should have joined drier than 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.970
 better protected by ensuring that 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.470
 pulled more run like win strawberry 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.910
 staying a little unsure 17 years should 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.170
 close the pss 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.030
 but after we managed to adjust 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.600
 our game straight we have 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.780
 Kiss the first game we missed 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.379
 quite a lot in the draft when we arrived 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 I think we should have played. 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.899
 passed by homicide is our plan 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.789
 and the hubble allow a part of and 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.039
 simply catch an easy competition 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.679
 we did not get a touchdown anymore 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.899
 cry and eventually the game 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.429
 how we could not fight and she 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.920
 ended up getting too strong and not 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.469
 to be able to explain is the agent did not have 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.329
 how to clean the wave for me 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.149
 could eventually get six 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.270
 items and who knows how to kill her was 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.259
 basically it was the thrash where i got the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.299
 We had a game, people. 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.090
 I could fight with who we do not 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.560
 I could not even be pop 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.890
 the second game 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.740
 the media basically only accept it 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.299
 get airy our lenses have fallen 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.460
 quite early in the game but not 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.159
 knew during the game what ended up 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.159
 was happening involving became very 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.409
 behind and failed to do anything is not 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.360
 I issued the form quite a lot until we 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.770
 giving enough damage to the tracks only 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.450
 it was too big for us not to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.310
 had as happened the dredge the film the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.340
 game them stronger number since only 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.930
 It was said after the river school . 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.990
 destroyed while Rene as already 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.110
 I could do anything since 1978 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.490
 We only saw it and got myself there. 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.350
 eventually lost a lot of advantage 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.830
 giving brave because dragon 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.280
 that makes leads' objective and fast 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.840
 it was the second game he was more 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.580
 complicated who did not have much idea of the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.040
 which they would do active in select 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.510
 we tried to fit more or 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.930
 unless we thought some peaks 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.170
 were unexpected type jaxa oriana but 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.470
 even then we were able to cross 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.270
 this and was mom was actually a lot 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.290
 better than the first game was very 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.480
 simpler 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.300
 the rain was very strong they were 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.940
 a little of everything to win the country and 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.230
 people gotta force my game 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.080
 changed a lot until we 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.850
 started with a very new game and had 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.709
 little time to assemble in the two 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.600
 first weeks there was no internet 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.550
 some computers had not arrived 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.290
 so we had the notion that the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.780
 beginning of the band that would not be much 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.150
 It's just that we did not leave it in the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.250
 base people 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.709
 we are thinking about the customer's right to 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.709
 do and we can enforce our game
