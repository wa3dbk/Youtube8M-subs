I<00:01:10.660> think<00:01:11.660> what<00:01:11.780> I<00:01:11.810> notice<00:01:12.140> most<00:01:12.350> about<00:01:12.530> this

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
I think what I notice most about this

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.670 
I think what I notice most about this
team<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.580> ease<00:01:13.880> with<00:01:13.910> which<00:01:14.420> they<00:01:14.750> cover

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
team is the ease with which they cover

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
team is the ease with which they cover

but<00:01:19.670> I<00:01:19.700> must<00:01:19.939> say<00:01:20.119> mom<00:01:20.299> I<00:01:20.420> don't<00:01:20.570> think<00:01:20.810> it's<00:01:20.930> a

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
but I must say mom I don't think it's a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.139 
but I must say mom I don't think it's a
dance<00:01:21.290> well-suited<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.310> them<00:01:22.610> I<00:01:22.729> think<00:01:23.000> they

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
dance well-suited to them I think they

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.929 
dance well-suited to them I think they
gave<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.600> better<00:01:23.780> tango<00:01:24.409> or<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.649> better

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
gave you a better tango or a better

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.520 
gave you a better tango or a better
quick<00:01:25.939> step<00:01:26.240> but<00:01:26.479> this<00:01:26.600> particular<00:01:26.810> dance<00:01:27.350> a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
quick step but this particular dance a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.609 
quick step but this particular dance a
waltz<00:01:27.770> for<00:01:28.189> them<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:29.000> not<00:01:29.509> their<00:01:29.960> Forte<00:01:30.289> in

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
waltz for them it's not their Forte in

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
waltz for them it's not their Forte in
my<00:01:30.770> opinion

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990 

their<00:01:55.990> first<00:01:56.350> competitive<00:01:56.619> skeet<00:01:57.280> as<00:01:57.520> Olympic

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
flattop or Chris you mentioned the fact

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.100 
flattop or Chris you mentioned the fact
that<00:02:03.189> is<00:02:03.460> their<00:02:03.670> first<00:02:03.880> skate<00:02:04.270> as<00:02:04.450> Olympic

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
that is their first skate as Olympic

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.919 
that is their first skate as Olympic
champions<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.039> almost<00:02:06.189> sense<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.929> those

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
champions and I almost sense that those

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.719 
champions and I almost sense that those
who<00:02:08.140> become<00:02:08.530> olympic<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.039> world<00:02:09.099> champions
