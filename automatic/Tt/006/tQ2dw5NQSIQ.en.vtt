00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.869
 Quiz question what do you get when you 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.970
 yoshi's island joschi story and kirby 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.910
 and the magical yarn together in one 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.399
 pot lies the answer is yoshi's july 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:33.110
 world because the new job just around the 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.149
 little dino is at first sight 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.980
 actually like an extremely successful one 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.680
 mix from the aforementioned play 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.870
 so you control as in July story 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.090
 on the internet 64 one of many 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.370
 different yoshi's and have to be renewed 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.210
 came with dinos from the claw of nasty 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.609
 I free 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.499
 the almost all yoshi's in their well 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.289
 has disassembled items and cut off 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.210
 is probably items you ask exactly 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.940
 because as with kirby and that 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.760
 magic yarn shows yoshi's july world 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.739
 a unique graphic style on the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.020
 entire game world together with characters 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.060
 and adversaries is made of wool and that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.190
 is the job in extremely good and gives 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.900
 the game a distinctive look 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.210
 which pulls you immediately in the spell 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.729
 By the way, Yoshi's new adventure 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.770
 a lot of that evolves from the studio 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.590
 also for kirby and the magical 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.509
 yarn was responsible and believed me 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.520
 At the time, curry was graphically extreme 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.430
 appealing is the yoshi's whole world 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.560
 even more colorful and playful and thus 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.049
 even more beautiful and I thought that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.509
 Ultra sweet picture book style by Yoshi 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.789
 story nothing more would be wrong 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.920
 said that you only go with yoshi alone 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.979
 On the way is also the only point of the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.780
 otherwise reminiscent of the n64 litter 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.520
 orientates the platformer gameplay 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.340
 technically strong at the yoshi's island 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.500
 series that took on the snes its beginning 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.960
 armed with up to six eggs 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.880
 her six level plus special level in 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.679
 six worlds make us unsure 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.549
 at best, all hidden items 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.619
 consequences 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.479
 while jumping on platforms and 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.039
 opponent throws in a known manner with 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.380
 your eggs and make of yours 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.330
 ability to use with wool 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.460
 existing world to interact 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.410
 this can be done, for example 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.490
 apply impress or even completely 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.620
 unravel 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.570
 that makes scary fun 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.400
 that you understand your surroundings more closely 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.290
 the magnifying glass takes and brings enough fresh 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.330
 wind to enthuse to the end 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.220
 and who thinks now that yoshi's willi 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.290
 Wild as easy as that can calm down 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.970
 his only wanted to be the end of a level 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.310
 may even be true 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.480
 but woe to all in one level 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.670
 wants to collect 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.980
 in the studios are all sorts of things 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.140
 hidden things that starts with the aussie 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.940
 Silent known flowers goes on 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.310
 Energy stamp or ball pieces 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.560
 especially the latter you need if you 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.960
 wanted to free your dino cronies 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.730
 you collect all 50 pieces in 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.680
 a level is at the end of it 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.320
 of the level a new joschi him whole 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.990
 individual design together vodka gin 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.030
 and that 's really how to gather that 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.610
 new yoshi's that you can play then 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.290
 generates such a high addiction factor 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.610
 that I visited level several times though 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.370
 I do not pick the pieces straight away 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.050
 found and find the items is with 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.240
 every new world harder as they do 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.190
 by the way , they are very well hidden 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.590
 you need the flowers of each one 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.020
 levels at the end of the world the special 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.090
 level unlock and this one has it 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.740
 really playful in itself and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.390
 should the game be someone of you too 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.310
 be heavy then stand with the 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.730
 play mode relaxes an alternative 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.160
 ready 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.420
 Turns her from classic relaxed 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.190
 by the way, to the running game 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.620
 you're working with one 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.150
 winged joschi and could 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.070
 about difficult passages just like that 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.300
 fly away 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.620
 In addition, the buttons will turn off 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.540
 free you different bonuses 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.160
 you should give some help 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.750
 and last but not least you can do that 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.700
 contest adventure with a friend 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.560
 and share your tasks 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.860
 unfortunately I could do the multiplayer though 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.970
 lack of second player did not test 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.560
 By the way, joschi can also 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.750
 transform that works something like that 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.700
 as in kirby and the magical yarn in 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.740
 certain levels are transformed 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.390
 dino for example in an umbrella or a 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.310
 motorcycle was another prize 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.230
 Variation brings with you 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.069
 So I'm really excited about yoshi 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.140
 small world 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.030
 it's just a game that's incredible 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.769
 a lot of fun makes the optics true 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.569
 soundtrack is great and the controls 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.789
 nintendo is familiar very direct 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.130
 taxation you can play with the game 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.410
 view gamepads with the rio pro controller 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.470
 with a transversely held remote or 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.180
 I play with a classic controller 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.610
 used during a test phase the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.380
 Video control and can it at this 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.570
 really highly recommend this game 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.789
 what else is there to yoshi's july world 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.680
 to say that itunes seeks 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.419
 whimsy the bosses are 40 and they 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.490
 wanted matic extremely well in the game 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.050
 I have integrated negative points 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.639
 This time really no but that is 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.930
 maybe also on my fan glasses the 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.400
 I have this time on 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.979
 that's why i have a perfect one 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.900
 Appraising every you owner should consider this 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.180
 have played the optics of the game 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.789
 soundtrack and the gameplay everything fits 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.419
 That's why I have five out of five 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.419
 possible points
