hi<00:00:00.989> in<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:02.040> episode<00:00:02.280> of<00:00:02.639> GIMP<00:00:03.149> beginner's

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
hi in this episode of GIMP beginner's

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.099 
hi in this episode of GIMP beginner's
guide<00:00:03.689> will<00:00:04.170> reach<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.710> our<00:00:04.830> pencil<00:00:05.609> tool<00:00:06.109> now

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
guide will reach to our pencil tool now

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.509 
guide will reach to our pencil tool now
this<00:00:07.830> tool<00:00:08.210> has<00:00:09.559> exactly<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.769> same<00:00:11.099> options

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
this tool has exactly the same options

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.499 
this tool has exactly the same options
as<00:00:11.610> our<00:00:12.059> paintbrush<00:00:12.929> tool<00:00:13.700> now<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.730> think<00:00:15.330> that

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
as our paintbrush tool now I think that

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.599 
as our paintbrush tool now I think that
you'll<00:00:15.719> be<00:00:16.049> better<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.619> discuss<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.369> option

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
you'll be better to discuss this option

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.330 
you'll be better to discuss this option
with<00:00:18.390> our<00:00:18.600> print<00:00:19.050> paintbrush<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.890> because

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
with our print paintbrush to because

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.080 
with our print paintbrush to because
this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.359> two<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.840> you're<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.650> use

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
this is the two that you're going to use

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.310 
this is the two that you're going to use
probably<00:00:24.260> most<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> time<00:00:26.189> most<00:00:27.109> of<00:00:28.109> you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
probably most of the time most of you

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.420 
probably most of the time most of you
will<00:00:28.590> probably<00:00:28.730> never<00:00:29.730> use<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.359> pencil<00:00:30.689> tool

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
will probably never use this pencil tool

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
will probably never use this pencil tool
now<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.820> explain<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> difference

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
now just explain what is the difference

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.760 
now just explain what is the difference
between<00:00:34.230> these<00:00:34.890> two<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:36.290> here<00:00:37.290> with<00:00:37.590> your

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
between these two now here with your

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.440 
between these two now here with your
brush<00:00:38.399> tool<00:00:39.290> let's<00:00:40.290> first<00:00:40.760> select<00:00:41.760> our<00:00:41.910> pencil

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
brush tool let's first select our pencil

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.139 
brush tool let's first select our pencil
tool<00:00:43.430> select<00:00:44.430> our<00:00:44.610> brush<00:00:46.399> select<00:00:47.399> our<00:00:47.579> scale

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
tool select our brush select our scale

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.049 
tool select our brush select our scale
and<00:00:49.370> let's<00:00:50.370> draw<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> line<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.789> then

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and let's draw a line like that and then

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.580 
and let's draw a line like that and then
go<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.300> our<00:00:54.570> brush<00:00:54.840> tool<00:00:56.539> scale<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
go to our brush tool scale it up and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.660 
go to our brush tool scale it up and
draw<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> line

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.930 

now<00:01:04.670> as<00:01:04.879> you<00:01:05.000> can<00:01:05.120> see<00:01:05.180> here<00:01:06.160> what<00:01:07.160> our<00:01:07.310> pencil

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
now as you can see here what our pencil

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.690 
now as you can see here what our pencil
to<00:01:08.420> did<00:01:08.690> is<00:01:08.900> created<00:01:09.860> these<00:01:10.040> jagged<00:01:10.430> edges

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
to did is created these jagged edges

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.080 
to did is created these jagged edges
hard<00:01:11.420> edges<00:01:11.660> in<00:01:11.990> our<00:01:12.680> brush<00:01:13.040> tool<00:01:13.340> has

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
hard edges in our brush tool has

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.770 
hard edges in our brush tool has
smoother<00:01:14.810> edges<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.850> this<00:01:16.850> is<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.240> main

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
smoother edges and this is the main

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.500 
smoother edges and this is the main
difference<00:01:18.080> between<00:01:18.950> these<00:01:19.340> tools<00:01:19.760> this

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
difference between these tools this

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.380 
difference between these tools this
pencil<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.400> always<00:01:22.400> has<00:01:22.960> hard<00:01:23.960> edges<00:01:25.240> even<00:01:26.240> if

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
pencil to always has hard edges even if

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.500 
pencil to always has hard edges even if
I<00:01:26.510> choose<00:01:26.780> here<00:01:27.110> fuzzy<00:01:27.560> brush<00:01:28.060> like<00:01:29.060> I<00:01:29.180> said<00:01:29.240> we

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
I choose here fuzzy brush like I said we

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.000 
I choose here fuzzy brush like I said we
will<00:01:29.600> discuss<00:01:29.960> this<00:01:30.140> option<00:01:30.350> in<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.770> next

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
will discuss this option in the next

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.700 
will discuss this option in the next
video<00:01:31.280> with<00:01:32.150> our<00:01:32.300> brush<00:01:32.570> tool<00:01:32.780> but<00:01:33.260> even<00:01:33.530> if<00:01:33.590> i

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
video with our brush tool but even if i

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.389 
video with our brush tool but even if i
select<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.130> fuzzy<00:01:34.460> words<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:35.410> work<00:01:36.410> here<00:01:36.740> it

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
select a fuzzy words to work here it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.249 
select a fuzzy words to work here it
doesn't<00:01:37.820> work<00:01:37.880> i<00:01:38.270> selected<00:01:39.080> with<00:01:39.259> mine

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
doesn't work i selected with mine

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.230 
doesn't work i selected with mine
paintbrush<00:01:42.259> tool<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:43.369> see<00:01:43.610> how<00:01:43.759> i<00:01:43.790> get<00:01:44.060> this

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
paintbrush tool you see how i get this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.410 
paintbrush tool you see how i get this
small<00:01:44.600> for<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.500> edges<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:48.560> this<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.039> primarily

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
small for the edges so this is primarily

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.540 
small for the edges so this is primarily
the<00:01:50.420> big<00:01:50.600> difference<00:01:51.050> here<00:01:51.920> i<00:01:51.979> can<00:01:52.310> show<00:01:52.520> you

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
the big difference here i can show you

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.170 
the big difference here i can show you
this<00:01:52.850> animated<00:01:53.390> brush<00:01:53.950> hell<00:01:54.950> even<00:01:55.250> with<00:01:56.030> that

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
this animated brush hell even with that

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.050 
this animated brush hell even with that
animated<00:01:56.720> brush<00:01:57.050> our<00:01:57.350> pencil<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.369> applies

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
animated brush our pencil to applies

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.740 
animated brush our pencil to applies
this<00:01:59.330> dark<00:02:00.080> hard<00:02:00.890> edges<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.520> if<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.360> have<00:02:02.570> our

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
this dark hard edges and if we have our

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.050 
this dark hard edges and if we have our
with<00:02:02.990> our<00:02:03.110> brush<00:02:03.410> tool<00:02:03.680> we<00:02:04.640> don't<00:02:04.820> have<00:02:05.000> that

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
with our brush tool we don't have that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.680 
with our brush tool we don't have that
dark<00:02:06.039> hard<00:02:07.039> edges<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.239> is<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.540> main

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
dark hard edges so this is the main

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.380 
dark hard edges so this is the main
difference<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.769> what<00:02:10.090> makes<00:02:11.090> these

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
difference and this is what makes these

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.580 
difference and this is what makes these
two<00:02:11.690> most<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.830> time<00:02:13.070> unusable<00:02:14.290> but<00:02:15.290> just

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
two most of the time unusable but just

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.979 
two most of the time unusable but just
know<00:02:15.769> it's<00:02:15.950> here<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.489> if<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.730> need<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.090> make

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
know it's here and if you need to make

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.250 
know it's here and if you need to make
something<00:02:18.350> with<00:02:18.709> hard<00:02:19.040> dark<00:02:19.670> hedges<00:02:19.989> you<00:02:20.989> get

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
something with hard dark hedges you get

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.709 
something with hard dark hedges you get
to<00:02:21.500> do<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.070> with<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.459> tool<00:02:23.410> bye<00:02:24.410> for<00:02:24.680> now
