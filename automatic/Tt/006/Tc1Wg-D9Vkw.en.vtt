00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
do believe it's used for instruments

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.810 
do believe it's used for instruments
because<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.049> picks<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.500> from<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.189> areas<00:01:41.610> of

because it picks up from all areas of
the<00:01:41.939> microphone<00:01:42.509> setting<00:01:43.200> number<00:01:43.380> two<00:01:43.680> picks

the microphone setting number two picks

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760 
the microphone setting number two picks
up<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.939> see<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.750> that's<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.619> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
up what you see here and that's it it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.929

that's<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:53.850> way<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.360> say<00:01:55.009> basically

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that's the right way to say basically

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.660 
that's the right way to say basically
this<00:01:56.549> gets<00:01:56.820> rid<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.060> those<00:01:57.950> noises<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.340> or

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
this gets rid of those noises if or

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.560 
this gets rid of those noises if or
those<00:02:00.320> those<00:02:01.320> s<00:02:01.530> noises<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:03.180> really

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
those those s noises those really really

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.639 
those those s noises those really really
annoying<00:02:04.790> sounds<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:07.439> your

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
annoying sounds that your that your

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.199 
annoying sounds that your that your
letters<00:02:08.129> when<00:02:08.429> you're<00:02:08.550> speaking<00:02:08.789> make

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
letters when you're speaking make

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.550 
letters when you're speaking make
sometimes<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:11.280> doesn't<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:11.970> completely

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
sometimes it doesn't like completely

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.190 
sometimes it doesn't like completely
rid<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.709> them<00:02:12.800> but<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.130> definitely<00:02:13.310> helps<00:02:14.200> it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
rid of them but it definitely helps it

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.440 
rid of them but it definitely helps it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
basically just blocks off a lot of the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.790 
basically just blocks off a lot of the
sound<00:02:17.750> before<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.230> actually<00:02:18.349> hits<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
sound before it actually hits the

and<00:03:37.329> that<00:03:38.329> basically<00:03:38.810> kind<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.739> evens

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
and that basically kind of evens

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.379 
and that basically kind of evens
everything<00:03:40.280> out<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:40.670> gives<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.120> this<00:03:41.209> nice

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
everything out and gives it this nice

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.720 
everything out and gives it this nice
crisp<00:03:41.810> sound<00:03:42.079> but<00:03:43.010> if<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.190> don't<00:03:43.340> want<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.579> go

don't really suggest getting this

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.050 
don't really suggest getting this
program<00:04:12.380> because<00:04:12.590> it's<00:04:12.739> really<00:04:13.040> old<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.519> it's

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
program because it's really old and it's

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.539 
program because it's really old and it's
kind<00:04:14.299> of<00:04:14.389> buggy<00:04:14.680> but<00:04:15.680> I've<00:04:15.920> been<00:04:16.039> using<00:04:16.280> this

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
kind of buggy but I've been using this

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.370 
kind of buggy but I've been using this
for<00:04:16.609> many<00:04:17.030> years<00:04:17.419> now<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.169> just

these you see all these wave files how
they're<00:04:59.300> all<00:04:59.450> kind<00:04:59.780> of<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:01.310> just<00:05:01.550> just<00:05:01.790> take<00:05:01.940> a

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
they're all kind of you just just take a

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.750 
they're all kind of you just just take a
look<00:05:02.180> at<00:05:02.300> them<00:05:02.450> now<00:05:02.600> and<00:05:02.890> then<00:05:03.890> now<00:05:04.370> take<00:05:04.730> a

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
look at them now and then now take a

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.700 
look at them now and then now take a
look<00:05:04.850> at<00:05:05.120> them<00:05:05.300> once<00:05:05.480> they're<00:05:05.630> finished<00:05:05.810> boom

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
look at them once they're finished boom

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.920 
look at them once they're finished boom
see<00:05:07.340> how<00:05:07.490> they<00:05:07.610> got<00:05:07.730> bigger<00:05:07.970> there<00:05:08.240> what<00:05:08.840> it

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
see how they got bigger there what it

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.620 
see how they got bigger there what it
does<00:05:09.140> is<00:05:09.350> it<00:05:09.380> levels<00:05:10.040> everything<00:05:10.700> out<00:05:10.850> and<00:05:11.060> it

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
does is it levels everything out and it

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.700 
does is it levels everything out and it
gives<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.960> a<00:05:12.020> nicer<00:05:12.620> crisper<00:05:13.280> sound<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:14.710> this

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
gives it a nicer crisper sound and this

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.040 
gives it a nicer crisper sound and this
is<00:05:15.890> something<00:05:16.040> that<00:05:16.250> I've<00:05:16.520> always<00:05:16.550> used<00:05:17.270> now

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
is something that I've always used now

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.780 
is something that I've always used now
like<00:05:18.229> I<00:05:18.350> said<00:05:18.380> you<00:05:18.770> don't<00:05:19.130> have<00:05:19.280> to<00:05:19.520> do<00:05:19.640> this

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
like I said you don't have to do this

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.580 
like I said you don't have to do this
process<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.510> just<00:05:20.810> makes<00:05:21.080> it<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.290> little<00:05:21.440> bit

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
process it just makes it a little bit
