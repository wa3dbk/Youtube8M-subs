00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hi today I have once again a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.980
 motive pie for you to show me though 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.240
 you how to conjure this harry potter 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.130
 Of course we need one for that first 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.440
 cake and I just have one here 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.270
 The chocolate cake I made with 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.730
 have some chocolate gage 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.050
 you later stick well with the condor 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.390
 and how to get these chocolates 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.329
 I'll leave you ganache 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.590
 a recipe in the infobox 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.750
 First, you just take something 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.399
 starch flour and sprinkle yours 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.630
 work with it so that he thorn 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.399
 sticking next or he takes 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.739
 just like a silicone mat like me 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.780
 here and then you want the blue one 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.810
 from dong and I have this here 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.310
 but always measured that 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.230
 I then also in the further course 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.270
 leave because somehow not 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.740
 So I've got a lot 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.680
 simply cut out a rectangle and 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.990
 so that the bottom third of the cake 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.340
 set and I have just 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.520
 from there over the pie 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.700
 laid and then nice at the ends 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.230
 pressed or pressed and served 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.629
 then I just cut with one 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.880
 shear off and then together 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.689
 and the rest of you can 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.689
 just cut it off 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.840
 then I have something blue again 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.250
 from unrolled around the top one 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.250
 third also to stock up 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.450
 Of course I'll cut that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.680
 rest from there as well 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.330
 and of course you can do it again 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.979
 roll up and reuse so 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.070
 do not have to throw away the remains 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.020
 because that's really waste now 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.700
 that is, something white of dor and roll 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.530
 just like that and cut that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.670
 also in the rectangle like the blue one 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:47.090
 before that and I just use that 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.640
 middle thirds so that the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.729
 whole cake ma lin of the set 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.729
 is 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.170
 I have one for the details 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.210
 template and I have 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.729
 Just google the picture of me 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.990
 Haribo starmix picked out and then with 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.620
 a sheet of paper 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.020
 the rocket and hwb scripts 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.450
 repainted and simply cut out 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.460
 Now we need something surrendered by 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.900
 village and we want that, of course 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.100
 again and then I just take 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.720
 my template for the rocket and one 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.570
 very fine mesters i have so here 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.160
 a kind of stanleymesser and then cut 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.540
 I free the rocket and I have one 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.370
 they made something bigger here than that 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.060
 stencil because it's something to me 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.060
 was small 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.700
 I do with the rest of Dom 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.439
 then just more details and 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.120
 I told him what I did 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:53.319
 have a slight curve here 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.909
 cut and then I have 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.280
 just on the side of the rocket 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:01.200
 just given to me a bit 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.200
 to demand more definition 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.460
 so that the parts also stick together 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.170
 stay just takes very little 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.780
 water and start are the bottom 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.630
 share it and then keep it all 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.420
 also pretty good now i roll one 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.660
 little ball of white from job and 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.890
 press that with my thumb something like that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.170
 together and that just makes that then 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.450
 window of the rocket now something 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.640
 yellow from there and could such a 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:33.000
 then snake out of this window 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.000
 so just surround details details 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.960
 for the top and the wings of the rocket 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.180
 Do you say that so I think so myself 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.800
 I cut something red from barnes and 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.730
 I always do triangles for that 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.070
 or 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.810
 So for the tip of a triangle and for 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.570
 the lower wings simply a triangle 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.620
 where on one side something is rounded 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.940
 you see her here 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.940
 how I did that 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.200
 I'll just have the parts again 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.970
 glued with water and I have then 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.920
 even a small crown 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.680
 cut out normally stands below 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.660
 at the rocket number one but that was 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.670
 me a bit too physics work 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.160
 That's why I just have a crown 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.590
 made 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.380
 from the rest of the red of Dorsch envy 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.440
 I then strip two equally thick 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.140
 and then I glue that on the 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.160
 white from there again with the help of 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.160
 some water, mind you 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.180
 dogs rocket even more details about 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.000
 I just give one 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.210
 taken black food pen 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.610
 and painted too small dots and that 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.860
 window just outlines the whole 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.760
 to make it look more alive and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.700
 Make sure you really 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.520
 food donor used 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.930
 in the next step I take mine 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.540
 cut out letters and put the 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:07.060
 on some of the village and cuts 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.060
 then the one from up there 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.270
 when I say all 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.280
 have cut recently 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.830
 back again with some water and 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.539
 glue on the upper third of the 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.550
 cake before I go to the red part 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.940
 I took care of the letters 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.280
 rocket on my cake 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.210
 then position it with water 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.210
 glued 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.780
 then again I have some white from 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.129
 was rolled out and a small one 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.529
 exhaust gas made the rocket 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.240
 just look more alive and 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.719
 So that looks like it's going straight 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.719
 fly away 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.460
 I have these with something again 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.050
 water positioned on my rocket 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.810
 or glued on the cake 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.680
 and again with my food pen 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.680
 umrannte 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.009
 after their chain is then ready 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.750
 I'll take care of that again 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.810
 Lettering and for this I just take 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.699
 again my templates and cuts 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.610
 the letters from eighth hereby 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:43.360
 the fact that they this time a little less 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:46.449
 are the man most of the yes over 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.370
 see the red and then you click 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.039
 just again with the help of very little 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.620
 the red letters on the water 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:55.930
 the white ones and we see that through 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.710
 every little one is nice to see one 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.229
 white border then I still with 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:05.320
 yellow from there some stars stuffed 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:08.860
 a few stars gouged out and the ans 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.840
 lower third clicked now missing 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.370
 only a lot of mini haribo and me 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.360
 have caused me here for mini haribo 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.699
 because I thought that the 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.280
 normal size something would be too large 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:21.039
 and I 'm just brushing those 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.680
 white surface with water and glue then 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:27.160
 all gummy bears all cola bottles and 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:30.340
 any haribo just stuffed up 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.170
 my cake so that just realer 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.270
 looks 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.680
 and that's how the finished pies look like 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.170
 think they've become pretty cool 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.810
 Of course there are one or the other 

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.480
 improvement possibilities for improvement 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.000
 but like i said i'm not profi and 

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.380
 it's supposed to be just an inspiration 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.980
 I hope I had the video 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.930
 like 

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.250
 thanks for seeing thank you for coming to 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.050
 end to see if her now 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.560
 has seen and we'll see you at 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.560
 next time again
