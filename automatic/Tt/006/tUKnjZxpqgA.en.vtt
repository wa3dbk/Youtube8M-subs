within the squad the funds will see the
impact<00:01:55.529> on<00:01:55.709> the<00:01:55.770> pitch<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.279> fact<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
impact on the pitch the fact that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.669 
impact on the pitch the fact that
they're<00:01:56.819> missing<00:01:57.209> from<00:01:57.959> from<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.289> team<00:01:58.499> who
