00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 pure relief there he is finally the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 long-awaited liberation strike for the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.120
 artland dragons celebrate after three 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.010
 defeats resulted in a 79 77 victory in 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.469
 siena and can thus on the track of success 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.870
 Back for the tbb, it was against 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.789
 game of missed opportunities in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.279
 otherwise very handsome 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.560
 pointy game with spectacular offensive 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.920
 actions by both teams but the series 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.070
 to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.050
 over 4600 fans hope for the arena 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.539
 a premature christmas present for her 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.940
 guys the tbw came in well too 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.309
 party with me in pure oats and anni 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.620
 Seifert provided for a 6 to 2 run 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.480
 The host was Gomez scored the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.250
 first four quakenbrücker points 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.870
 but in the end it was one sooner 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 mixed performance of the six 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.460
 nba-profis at the beginning also defensive 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 but could put in the end with 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.140
 weak hit rate and only nine 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.910
 the journey back home recounts facts 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.059
 in the first few minutes not at the height 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.420
 basti dorit from coast to coast to 13 too 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.420
 8th 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.060
 and also the powerful yoshi's almut 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.690
 to 15 12 with too easy points 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.180
 quakenbrück 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.490
 but then the answer of the dragons or 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.880
 better of a hot running one 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.000
 kite marquez haynes only with the 3 1 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.010
 nice in and out match then with 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.260
 the style and the simple points to 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:35.700
 first tour of the guests against the block 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.850
 yoshi's and finally the buzzer 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.410
 three beater for 15 to 21 at the end of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.110
 first quarter that was the final point 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.140
 a 10 0 run of the guests within 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.780
 only two minutes 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.910
 the tbb visibly shocked sergio perez 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.450
 from the bank with five points in a row 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.280
 here with the basket maker to 18 to 28 and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.860
 thus the first two-digit leadership 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.080
 the guests on top of it, there were five in part to 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.350
 disputed 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.270
 referee decisions to the disadvantage 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.800
 by trier in series 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.660
 Trier did not go that way anymore 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.910
 aggressive in defense to the point 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.400
 what especially peter popovic under the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.320
 basket exploited the quakenbrücker center 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.019
 as unleashed with eleven of its total 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.540
 15 points in the second quarter three 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.000
 assists and also two steals in the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.190
 defense my personal popovic 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.830
 highlights were but these magnificent 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.720
 grimaces after wolfen against back to 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.170
 play and the beautiful off in under 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.440

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.130
 in front of his eyes from berlin 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.940
 arrived family with 13 points 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.650
 career highlight on the parquet magic 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.430
 garrett received the tbb with two 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.459
 important three here to the 33 to 42 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.739
 at least in the game no matter what henrik rödl 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.410
 he also tactically tried his team 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.150
 Push the dragons were excellent 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.980
 set and had both on the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.840
 zone as well as on the trier 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.900
 field press the right answers 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.760
 street with the assist on popovic and 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.440
 finally with his single field basket 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.299
 this evening and the last 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.370
 quakenbrücker score the first half 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.709
 to flood to the 49th 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.900
 Thanks to Vita Coco, the backlog was to 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.660
 half-time with 7 points loose daily 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.040
 from a trier view, 49 permitted points 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.810
 but are against one 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.160
 offensive opponents like quakenbrück 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.170
 for trier relationships too 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.850
 whatever henrik rödl the boys in 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.430
 The half-time break had it said 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.530
 the tbb fruited quakenbrück 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.570
 goes with inspirational offensive fun 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.850
 because the fans ripped off the seats 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.150
 nate smiles with her eyes and at the 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.400
 Seifert lets it crack 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.540
 jared l with 13 points and three out of four 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.550

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.390
 State to auszeit 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.940

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.680

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.040
 move to the basket the trier defense 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.470
 torn apart the us american the 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.080

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.350
 of the guests 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.450
 on the other side, joschi ceibo showed 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.710
 the montmeló where the frog lures 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.390

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.430
 just two minutes before the end of the third 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.950
 Quietly crackle 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.180
 quakenbrück stumbled guido grünheid 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.580
 did not fit into anything 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.500
 austria just could not do it 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.450
 to turn game because it is always tight 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.460
 could the dragons on the 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.890
 individual strength of their players 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.120
 leave anthony king with the and one 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:50.820
 was about 58 to 63 before the last quarter 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.310
 the tbb still only three points 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.950
 What happened next is hard in the back 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.990
 words to grasp the tbb got offensive 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.000
 nothing but nothing at all on the 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.040
 were even the easiest opportunities 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.020
 omitted also get quakenbrück 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.120
 only after just under three minutes by three 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.780

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.880
 to 60 66 the first points of the last one 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.880
 quarter tbb left with bad luck 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.010
 hair-raising ball losses and 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.410
 defensive misses a 7 0 run too 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.600
 Brian Harper after nearly five minutes 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.780
 the folder took in the hand and the fans 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.140

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.120
 and the points to the 63 to 75 four 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.580
 minutes before the decision 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.680
 Harper braced himself with five points 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.630
 Follow against the impending defeat 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.760
 the otherwise frighteningly weak 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.540
 Barry Stewart met the desperate 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.820
 Threesome to 73 to 78 trier conquered 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.870

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.400
 from jared to the 77 79 was only created 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.830
 still cosmetic results 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.780
 the tbb slips behind the dragons 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.790
