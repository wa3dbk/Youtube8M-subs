00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.060
 friends all greetings from the sunny valley 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.269
 California today drove in the morning in 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.510
 shop and attacked such a crazy 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.960
 sale 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.120
 meat and poultry in general honestly 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.880
 she said she was surprised I already 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.740
 showed many times especially the first 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.760
 time when we just arrived i 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.910
 showed 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.560
 that how do we save on products from me 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.510
 there are a lot of these videos last 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 time something stopped doing it somehow 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.850
 so already know all got used accustomed 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 plot to and everything gets nothing 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
 special as they say but today 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.120
 again decided to make a video because 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.270
 really bought a lot of meat 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.090
 products and at very, very good prices 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.329
 but it's as always as I start 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 make a video my dog asks to go out 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.510

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.640
 ok let's continue so look at me 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.930
 by the way again, too many times already 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.460
 asked there wrote such 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.950
 viewers who are probably very very 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.009
 know a lot about america 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.950
 living not in america well something like this 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.240

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.390
 will sell the missing overdue here 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.270
 imprisoned for this and shut down the business 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.450
 no one is playing with this here see 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.119

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.520

 can be done generally as they say 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:15.540
 took two packs here it is ordinary 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:18.840
 The price of this stuffing with seven coppers there well, 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.150
 almost 8 dollars yes here I bought for three 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.629
 dollar see what a crazy discount 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.349
 and here is a pound but 453 grams 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.349
 1st 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.450
 I bought two packs at once, then we 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.569

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.660
 I have already noticed that the Americans 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.400
 Probably few though again can not 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.530
 so for everyone to say but at least here 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.290
 least of those Americans whom i see they 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.280
 not many people like this here 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.880

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.750

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.500

 here's a flat iron steak through as i already 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.780
 told me that in America all the meat 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:27.690
 subdivided yes by category person 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:30.330
 this is not the highest highest prime 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.550
 this is now before the prime is a little something 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.140
 there is but it is considered good quality 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.800
 meat and here too see here it was worth 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.480
 959 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.030
 with a card like this 9 I bought here for 6 something 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.820
 eat fine we grill it 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.890
 generally super here and here too 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.430
 I also bought two packages of this 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.780
 meat here for $ 3, too, here it is 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.810
 it cost five well it's almost 5 yes that's it 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.170
 the price is also meat I use it you 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.330
 in a goulash and nabi planers and mince 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.390
 make there some chops 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.690
 shuffle general anything I do not know 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.920
 I think that is a great price 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.080
 for me too we love this one very much 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.180
 minced chopped it will you 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:27.380
 this 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:30.650
 veal ground killed here I look 5 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.699
 I think that I shoot too, there is no price here but 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.590
 It was an action by which the action was because 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.389
 what will i tell you because here 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.220
 use as written 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.669
 use or freeze up 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.970
 today's number is the regular price of this 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.199
 minced meat here, too, half a kilo regular 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.770
 the price of this stuffing 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:55.099
 9 dollars I bought it for a dollar this 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.720
 it was generally 99 cents so I took 2 to 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.150
 the fact that it is two which only 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.030
 remained there seen disassembled because 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.349
 that the empty counter was completely 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.330
 disassembled you can see everything but really well 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.699
 how can you not buy veal for a dollar? 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.340
 I'll freeze again and everything will be 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.199
 fine here and see in general 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.630
 amount in total what 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:19.699
 huge amount of meat i'm generally already 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.580
 what I wanted to say in the end 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.820
 end up here ultimately what a great 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:30.770
 the amount of meat I bought new meat we 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.810

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.030
 fish we sony too very once a week 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.760
 surely we eat fish we try 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.400
 more often but it doesn't matter overall see this 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.060
 I'll put everything in the freezer now and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.699
 I will not know for week 2 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.220
 probably I will have something to eat well 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.110

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.020
 freezer Well folks here is 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.650
