00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.359
 the horizons of brazil are 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.140
 once again expanding the company eb rr 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.109
 shipyards of brazil is investing 1.2 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.220
 billions of reais in a very 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.220
 Special 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.800
 starting with the place both world are 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.989
 northern joseph and rio grande are 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.050
 forming the largest naval pole in Brazil 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 which already has three shipyards and one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.649
 located at the outlet 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.770
 of the duck pond its flat topography 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.969
 with warm water and an excellent canal 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.969
 navigation system 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.910
 with an area of 1 million and 500 thousand 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.220
 square meters, the project will be 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.830
 a modern building 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.770
 platforms 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.050
 processing support vessels and other 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.729
 marine equipment for the production of 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.670
 oil and gas 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.119
 The plant includes a dry dock with two 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.490
 each 11 850 tonnes of 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.250
 lifting capacity which in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.430
 can raise one thousand and six hundred 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.940
 tons a wharf long enough 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.940
 to mount two fpso simultaneously 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.250
 following the automated concept of 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 the expectation is to create up to 5 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:56.849
 thousand direct jobs in the peaks 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:59.869
 activity will be to build 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.869
 processing modules 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.709
 the second phase scheduled for 2013 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.160
 the yard will perform 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.160
 integration of the platform modules 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
 fuck 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.359
 the complete cycle will start operating at 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:36.310
 from 2014 when they will also be 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.310
 built platforms 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.490
 ae 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:03.879
 the yard is br will be one of the largest 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:08.729
 of Brazil with the ability to process 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:08.729
 110 thousand tons of steel per year 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.230
 to change your education scenario 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.020
 health and sanitation are northern josé 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.620
 need more employment income and 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.620
 training 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.780
 the yard is br will bring more 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.210
 quality of life for many 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.300
 Brazilians will build a large 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:35.210
 future for são josé do norte showing 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:38.890
 for those who believe that horizons are 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.890
 always infinite
