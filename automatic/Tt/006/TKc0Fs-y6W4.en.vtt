00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.830
 for van persie aan it is a nice evening for the six new teaching method soon 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.210
 the ban mia rightful victory may ultimately also be higher 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.549
 drop out yes but 6 0 I am very satisfied with it 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:14.839
 and 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.080
 We had hoped that the quick goal would make it because of the past 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.869
 matches 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.749
 this did not happen 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.099
 we also got a boat trailer so that is still difficult to play and then you see 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.169
 also what that does with a climb button the quick goal does 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:34.260
 everyone knows what's in dexter I have a little more peace where the ball keeps better 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.740
 in possession and if you find out if you do 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.710
 what it is sometimes a little more nervous so from that point of view it was delicious 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.170
 we have quietly finished the extended iris coming 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 hamme taal think of a very nice adventure with a little tension in advance 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.000
 and play yourself and others 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.180
 hell yes 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.180
 I was more nervous today than normal 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.030
 that's why it's pretty busy on the streets 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.370
 different ways and that there was nutrition name a little lower abdomen 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.899
 therefore very keen that the tea just run well 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.459
 to step into a somewhat different role for you with your profession we played well it is 

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:12.090
 something that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.390
 or maybe in the future can see more often with jari yes something behind huntelaar 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.270
 so can be so could it was if we beat me because i am real not 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 had played behind the striker 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 but I did like it 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.960
 It is a different kind of games as striker only needs more 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.890
 to 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.650
 look around you you still have to be busy with what's the other way around 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.650
 happens when the striker you know a bit that would sit down 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.540
 next to the team I'm out of, they can stand for you on the left and on the right 18 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
 you really have to look really well constantly 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.999
 and there the right time so that I can also do business bankrupt 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.180
 of camps and 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.530
 For years it went well for me it is a different kind of game with a longer one 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.240
 distances gold 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.240
 we were better off myself 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.799
 and but complain with the old-fashioned Dutch team to sit and wait 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.530
 the peace was on orange returns now 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.310
 I hope so that is what I think we have based on vague 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.440
 I think I've earned a lot of criticism 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.799
 I often have to say the judge 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.319
 but it is barred is nice if we now also for the trainer 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.869
 the players have also hopefully created a bit more peace after this victory 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.829
 finally robin we are not going to treat so many people a mix is ​​between one 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:21.759
 posted photo 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.219
 by the dutch team they play dark boys die article 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.739
 discriminatory texts undertake finding 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.739
 I have also responded extensively 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.189
 I am very sad and I think it sounds like that in 2014 still 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.139
 happens 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.859
 In addition, nowadays all one would stand but in my color completely 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.099
 nothing out 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.169
 and yes apparently a number of people do fit for her and I really like that 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.189
 Fortunately, those people have a full body in their profile 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.360
 that they must be tackled hard and 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.799
 preferably at the highest level 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.200
 and I also think that they should be set as an example for other people 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.159
 to the other people who already 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.709
 those thoughts might have that they just don't react that way from now on 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:15.099
 I can't get my head with you that you keep it and say so 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:21.519
 mh so separate from it that these guys behave regardless of skin color also for orange 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.730
 I also think it is incredible that preservation is still in the plan in it 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.679
 normal life happens 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:29.609
 and that is a fact it happens 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.149
 but 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.079
 yes you have to tackle that hard, I think
