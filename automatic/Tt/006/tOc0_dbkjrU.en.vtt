00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.159 
think he's been playing a lot so

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.019 
think he's been playing a lot so
hopefully<00:06:58.159> he<00:06:58.279> can<00:06:58.399> show<00:06:58.580> some<00:06:58.729> good<00:06:58.879> results

hopefully he can show some good results

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:01.209 
hopefully he can show some good results
he's<00:06:59.629> a<00:06:59.749> good<00:06:59.809> player<00:06:59.990> his<00:07:00.740> group<00:07:00.949> is<00:07:01.069> very

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:01.219 
he's a good player his group is very

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:02.950 
he's a good player his group is very
hard<00:07:01.430> to<00:07:01.460> though<00:07:01.729> I<00:07:01.759> think<00:07:02.059> his<00:07:02.389> group<00:07:02.629> and<00:07:02.839> the

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
hard to though I think his group and the

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.420 
hard to though I think his group and the
tours<00:07:03.289> and<00:07:03.439> group<00:07:03.589> probably<00:07:03.949> the<00:07:04.129> hardest

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
tours and group probably the hardest

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.969 
tours and group probably the hardest
groups<00:07:05.240> in<00:07:05.419> the<00:07:05.509> first<00:07:05.749> round<00:07:05.899> but<00:07:06.740> if<00:07:06.889> he

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:06.979 
groups in the first round but if he

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:08.409 
groups in the first round but if he
makes<00:07:07.129> it<00:07:07.279> through<00:07:07.339> there<00:07:07.580> he<00:07:07.999> can<00:07:08.149> do<00:07:08.270> good

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419 
makes it through there he can do good

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.179 
makes it through there he can do good
