but for 2k11 the one that I'm going to
be<00:04:06.739> using<00:04:07.099> today

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
be using today

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.309 
be using today
the<00:04:08.870> serial<00:04:09.379> number<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:09.680> 0<00:04:10.280> 0<00:04:10.340> 0<00:04:11.139> 1<00:04:12.139> 9<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.949> 9<00:04:13.910> 0<00:04:14.419> so

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
the serial number is 0 0 0 1 9 a 9 0 so

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.839 
the serial number is 0 0 0 1 9 a 9 0 so
I'm<00:04:15.379> just<00:04:15.530> gonna<00:04:15.709> scroll<00:04:16.130> up<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:18.849> now

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
I'm just gonna scroll up to that now

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:20.410 
I'm just gonna scroll up to that now
these<00:04:20.090> take

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
these take

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.000 
these take
while<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:20.900> go<00:04:21.050> through<00:04:21.550> but<00:04:23.590> once<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.740> find

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
while to go through but once you find

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.170 
while to go through but once you find
them<00:04:26.050> then<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.170> could<00:04:27.350> start<00:04:27.560> mining<00:04:28.180> I'm

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
them then you could start mining I'm

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.600 
them then you could start mining I'm
almost<00:04:29.570> there<00:04:29.870> right<00:04:30.140> now<00:04:30.350> as<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:31.280> see<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
almost there right now as you see the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.330 
almost there right now as you see the
numbers<00:04:31.940> going<00:04:32.150> through<00:04:32.420> right<00:04:33.410> here<00:04:33.470> zero

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
numbers going through right here zero

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.480 
numbers going through right here zero
zero<00:04:34.670> zero<00:04:34.700> one<00:04:35.630> nine<00:04:35.660> eight<00:04:36.140> nine<00:04:36.560> zero<00:04:36.590> you

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
zero zero one nine eight nine zero you

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.900 
zero zero one nine eight nine zero you
get<00:04:37.670> two<00:04:38.120> pairs<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.510> zeros<00:04:38.930> then<00:04:39.830> at<00:04:40.010> two<00:04:40.340> seven

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
get two pairs of zeros then at two seven

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.080 
get two pairs of zeros then at two seven
one<00:04:41.600> zero<00:04:42.040> another<00:04:43.040> two<00:04:43.400> pairs<00:04:43.670> of<00:04:43.730> zeros<00:04:44.060> and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
one zero another two pairs of zeros and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.880 
one zero another two pairs of zeros and
then<00:04:44.480> two<00:04:44.720> seven<00:04:45.080> one<00:04:45.230> zero<00:04:45.260> and<00:04:45.740> then<00:04:45.860> the

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
then two seven one zero and then the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.920 
then two seven one zero and then the
rest<00:04:46.190> will<00:04:46.340> be<00:04:46.460> zeros<00:04:46.820> we're<00:04:47.570> going<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.810> want

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
rest will be zeros we're going to want

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.660 
rest will be zeros we're going to want
to<00:04:47.990> do<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.230> start<00:04:48.290> off<00:04:48.590> as<00:04:48.800> click<00:04:49.100> in<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.340> front

I'm<00:05:45.680> gonna<00:05:45.800> take<00:05:46.010> my<00:05:46.100> fourteen<00:05:46.640> faster<00:05:47.030> that's

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
I'm gonna take my fourteen faster that's

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.510 
I'm gonna take my fourteen faster that's
EMG<00:05:47.780> and<00:05:47.900> open<00:05:48.260> up<00:05:48.320> another<00:05:48.470> program<00:05:49.250> in<00:05:49.430> this
