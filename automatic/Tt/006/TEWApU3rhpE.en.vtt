00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.730
 today I bring you a very small creepy 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.460
 pasta since I do not know if I can upload another 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.130
 type of video since as I was already done 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.170
 custom makes me sick and I can not record 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.600
 the pokemon errors but I do not know 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.910
 worry if they like the errors of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.369
 pokemon I promise that I will hardly recover 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.500
 I will record and upload that video while 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.960
 let's go to the crepe and pasta 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.679
 before I start I want to tell you that the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.510
 information shown here is 75 real already 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.590
 that appeared on a newscast of the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.989
 angels usa but it's still not confirmed in 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.329
 If the information provided in said 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.000
 news the news that could be 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.100
 listen in almost the entire country of the USA 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.739
 said like this October 13, 2013 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.289
 a few hours ago there was a statement 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.879
 of the company nintendo and pokemon in the 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.039
 which are demarcated from all 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.859
 responsibility but from which 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.899
 responsibility speak for it they 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.180
 I will tell you how the hours were before 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.430
 the output of the video game pokemon x 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.310
 hours before the departure of this so 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.500
 famous game there were already thousands of people 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.659
 which are called otakus which 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.180
 They were anxiously waiting to get 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.580
 said video game only in two hours 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.940
 before the pokemon xy exit and already 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.710
 they had recorded 35 deaths of people 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.710
 that they were trained to 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.690
 acquire the game and the Japanese police 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.080
 he did not know what to do and these homicides 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.460
 they are unpunished but that is not all 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.159
 hours after the departure of 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.380
 video game that exceeded 4 million 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.090
 copies sold worldwide in such 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.729
 only 48 hours there were 683 deaths 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.920
 which is curious since adding the 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.229
 amount of deaths in the presale 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.649
 of pokemon plus those that occurred after 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.430
 of the output of the video game total 718 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.700
 madness 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.370
 here is that so far there are 718 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.580
 existing pokemon without counting mega 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.410
 evolutions according to specialists and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.539
 researchers determined that the 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.970
 deaths occurred because people 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.640
 now deceased were playing more 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.830
 of 10 hours in a row which caused a 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.530
 small hemorrhage in your brain already 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.750
 others caused them a sudden epilepsy and 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.970
 that this video game contains very colorful 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.120
 bright and its 3-d gameplay is 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.880
 harmful to human sight without 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.580
 However, as mentioned at the beginning 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.680
 pokemon and the nintendo company sent 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.020
 an international statement in which 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.030
 they wash their hands saying that their 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.120
 video game is harmless and good 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.640
 quality rumors say that the news 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.230
 past was a lie to cover the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.080
 true facts that actually 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.630
 they passed it is said that after 12 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.700
 of the night of October 12th 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.980
 pokemon had a small event which 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.170
 it consisted in discovering one of the three 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.630
 unlockable caves in pokemon x 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.370
 whereas in PokÃ©mon ye was almost the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.019
 same dynamic alone 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.019
 the pokemon caves were already 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.420
 underground the event was announced 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.700
 only five minutes before 12 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.519
 night of October 12 as had 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.159
 mentioned before and this was quota 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.799
 limited to only 1000 people 500 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.750
 per version which found the 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.120
 event information in the forums of 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.180
 pokemon in it is said that the dynamics was 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.380
 The next 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.930
 name of the event 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.040
 pokemon ghost hunter 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.129
 instructions 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.810
 and find one of the three caves 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:41.480
 unlockable according to its version 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.760
 the second thing was to find a pokemon 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.220
 ghost which had not been observed 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.520
 before they had not even given 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.790
 news about him and third was 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.800
 mega evolve what is rumored is 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.620
 that the event was not official of the 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.660
 pokemon company but he was infiltrated 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.269
 by some hackers that somehow 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.519
 they managed to enter the database of 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.620
 pokemon and they started the event that 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.220
 supposes should have been celebrated 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.220
 October 31st in the USA and days 1 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.560
 and November 2 in Mexico but to 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.630
 difference from the official pokemon event 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.450
 the event that was made by the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.370
 hackers aimed at something else it 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.160
 says that when you entered one of the 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.710
 three caves you would hear the song of 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.870
 people the band instead the hackers 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.960
 they put the so-called music of death 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.000
 which is mentioned has 21 notes with 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.310
 a tone and sharpness that at the moment of 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.800
 listening to them all causes you great pain 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.169
 head that does not leave you in peace since 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.540
 for some strange reason it was found that 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.690
 the human brain can not erase or 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.090
 the note of this music of the thousand 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.170
 people who entered the contest in 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.540
 effects 718 died for some reason is 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.510
 the number of pokemones that exist up 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.640
 this sixth generation and although the 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.890
 owners of nintendo and pokemon have already 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.260
 his statements apparently do not 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.350
 they find guilty and this crime is going 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.600
 to be forgotten is rumored also 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.090
 that the nintendo company is indecisive 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.760
 about whether to officially hold the event 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.060
 but certainly I am one of the witnesses of the 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.400
 ghost hunter event pokemon performed 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.620
 on October 12 honestly no 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.640
 would participate in the event if it is 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.130
 perform and you would enter the event and well 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.560

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.750
