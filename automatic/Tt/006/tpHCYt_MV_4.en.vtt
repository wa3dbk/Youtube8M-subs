 here to him 11% cpi including 357 l ambiance in the group 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.040
 not for a live commented video of the rating if the new rules 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.149
 proposed 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:16.119
 but rather for a video of some on the moon 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.269
 because I know it would be a good 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.460
 so why is it just because the project was going 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.199
 to receive 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.109
 birthday that I made with my friends 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.419
 announced as a threat at the start of the season we were debated 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.310
 If you want 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.580
 it's my birthday 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.470
 laughs m 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.470
 repeated criticisms 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.470
 q how is it done 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.800
 but what did I receive on my birthday 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 the asse 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 in this sense because we have to 4 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.530
 it's a bit weird anyway 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 having a very happy birthday 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.390
 I thank her again said 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 gold for which I chose flirtatious and not anything else 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.870
 difficulty cliff 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.870
 he was missing 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 why not the case 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.990
 because the corner 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.400
 so she gave martyrdom 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.970
 later I'm really happy at all 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.930
 so why not the case because they are in great demand on the one hand it is 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.770
 born 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.770
 when a quarrel 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.520
 in this clip that she really understands 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.090
 and then I knew how to do 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.370
 the bulson species 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.510
 44 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.920
 a kind of arm 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.590
 ballmer 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.980
 a kind of small survey 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.420
 I have my facebook page 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
 and the man 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.050
 bienne 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.379
 it's still overweight 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.829
 so the man 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.829
 what do I mean 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.479
 in addition as a small influence on them 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.109
 about the next video 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.149
 and it pleases 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:25.449
 5 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.589
 you will return 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.699
 but for all of europe 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.699
 at banfora 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.799
 they could be disappointed because red-legged 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.789
 reassured moubarak that only women 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.799
 currently i am 5th 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.889
 according to m 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.569
 pity it was still a nice series to 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.569
 pretty much still lived on 24 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.049
 This is especially true 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.049
 henry has not got to say it's great it takes yesterday's training 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.639
 thankfully that I propose 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.639
 - the other markers that saint-cloud 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.729
 so the flows that are a little 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.989
 but who are often deadly 4 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.719
 it's weird 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.219
 emilio botin says she 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.289
 and that every day a juggernaut that is really drunk 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.009
 gold 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.009
 two years in a row called two visions costa is perceived money 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.939
 StÃ©phane Levildier 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.519
 because martyrs 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.519
 it is definitely the weak point 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.469
 the quartet everybody because if we're going to prepare the quarterback match 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.469
 final 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.620
 hello my name is gerard and why not 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.620
 the tahrir square 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.379
 I did not want programs and projects on video too 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.680
 still next video I'm doing it with my brother on to 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.449
 reserves so again a mark 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.529
 most of my subscriptions not 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.099
 so it's going to be nice enough and we'll try to go the highest 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.370
 possible 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.370
 and after all i went back on basa 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.360
 vincent debaty 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.340
 this kids initiative 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.159
 bars outlets 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.330
 I think this video 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
 skymark airlines hanged 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:05.309
 so today passed a video 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:10.099
 in the video of commands to avoid zombies I think to put online 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.189
 put it online 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.639
 strong Saturday this weekend 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.080
 and after as I said 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.000
 and there I have a lot of common duty next week if the fans the 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.249
 video clip possible 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:24.939
 the week starts when I will not be 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.939
 I will try to do as much as possible next week 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.639
 to be able to put them 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.639
 and we continue we continue 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.439
 in front of martin laval and repentigny 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.379
 j 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.439
 this is a case since a few seasons at this time to pass no 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.949
 while the money I recognize that it 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.550
 everybody 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:04.400
 the part remembers that ended so if you held up the end on 

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:05.229
 this part 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.360
 finally know that the discount 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.860
 you go to our facebook page 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.330
 and for good reason the machine is not the most complicated 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.169
 I like to comment on them 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:16.219
 3:40 p.m.
