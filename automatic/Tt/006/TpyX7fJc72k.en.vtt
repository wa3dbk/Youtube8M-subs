00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.620
 hello is Tuto Tuesday again so 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 let's start creating 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.230
 today I'm going to draw a fairy 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.240
 first some quick stroke of the head 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.240
 and the arms 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.400
 then the torso and so on 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.010
 already having the forms then 1 and 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.010
 tuned 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.790
 it occurred to me to put on a mask and I 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.420
 I think this mask I'm going to paint 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.509
 blue color 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.509
 I make her pointy ear of course 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.159
 now I start to shade 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.159
 I'm going to make a top 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.979
 ah 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.090
 Blurred the shadow with a brush 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.670
 and now the hands start with the finger 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.299
 fat that she does not have it very fat and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.299
 then the others 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.320
 I do the hair and then reinforcement 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.320
 some shadows 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.310
 like a hand I'm half big 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.310
 do not you think I'm going to make it smaller 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.010
 that's better 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.140
 traced her dress and then the wings of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.140
 butterfly 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.170
 now yes with watercolor he painted his mask 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.170
 blue and some spots on the wings 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.300
 like I think it would look better if 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.670
 coloring the rooms 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.530
 I'm going to do but I worry a 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.990
 little that as I had not thought this 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.740
 originally I'm not doing it on 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.510
 watercolor paper to see if it holds well 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.910
 already with the wings painted now the woman 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.560
 It looks very pale I'll finish painting 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.110
 all 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.550
 first I give a clear tone that then 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.500
 I will reinforce for the shadows 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.500
 she painted her red dress 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.200
 as the light color of the skin I did not 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.800
 cold or that skin tone tends 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.170
 towards a bluish greenish 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.980
 then I will do the shadows 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.990
 warm or in this case tend towards 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.180
 the reddish 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.700
 in painting it is very good to have a 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.300
 temperature contrast if there are 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.880
 cold lights the warm shadows or if 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.230
 there are warm lights then the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.480
 cold shadows 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.569
 this is not a rule that you have to 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.420
 always follow however gives a very 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.209
 good contrast effect and especially 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.230
 on the skin makes it vibrate and look more 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.230
 real and natural 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.980
 I'm going to give more detail to the healthy ones 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:07.280
 one side because you would see more parents and 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.069
 on the other to camouflage a bit those 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.650
 stains that came from not using paper 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.540
 of watercolor does not worry me if in the end 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.609
 they look a little bit because the wings of 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.970
 butterfly have spots and different 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.970
 tones 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.530
 reinforcement some parts of the blue and then 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.530
 I will do it with the reds of the dress 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:45.659
 as I feel that the wings are not 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:49.560
 integrating so much to the figure so is that 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:51.710
 I'm going to give them a reddish hue too 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.710
 I 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.190
 normally I have everything solved and 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.190
 calculated from before starting to 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.260
 paint or draw but in this case the 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.230
 work was transformed on the 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.800
 march which is also worth tell me what 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.800
 you thought 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.470
