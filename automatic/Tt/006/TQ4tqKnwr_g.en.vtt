00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.190
 the defeated boy defeated boy 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.260
 I was hit, I ran away 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.470
 I'm standing here, unnoticed 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.640
 the one to whom all crave, a hero 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.740
 I want to be, but I can't 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.650
 so much, it's not enough to reach it 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.850
 yet, I realized that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.160
 the defeated boy sings a song of reality 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.330
 we can't fly across the sky with this wind 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.700
 if there is sense to be found on such a night 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.210
 we'll crawl on the ground 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.720
 there is a sound (scampanellio) in my ears 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.160
 I pray for a miracle 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.700
 "I will try to be the hero you yearn for, as fast as I can" 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.510
 like with a piece of candy, you've held out your hand 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.450
 but I'm not entirely happy 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.890
 the defeated boy sings a song of existence 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.960
 I can't become someone dazzling like you 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.360
 if there is any sense of being found on such a night 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.830
 we'll crawl on the ground 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.300
 we will continue to crawl on the ground 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.140
 I feel my heartbeat 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.290
 I draw my breath 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.270
 "I'm hesitating." 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.890
 the defeated ... 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.010
 the defeated boy sings an ordinary song 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.080
 unfortunately there are those who do not believe in God 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.520
 it's a story about passing each other 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.850
 goodbye 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.120
 the defeated boy sings a song of reality 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.930
 we are the ones who crawl through the dirt 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.730
 if there is beauty in being found this night 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.170
 we'll crawl on the ground 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.740
 just crawling on the ground 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.010
 thank you, we will meet again one day.
