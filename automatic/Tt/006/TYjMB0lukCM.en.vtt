00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.019
 how is it that in 15-20 years only more 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.059
 A video this time is a choi that gives 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.420
 in two minutes and thirty minutes I went to play 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.460
 bits and something happens is that I blitz 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.039
 has a round just left I made the first 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.600
 part made a strange game in which 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.269
 and the second port that will show in another 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.170
 wave scheme will look like my record 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.920
 because it was 2030 and there is a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.809
 Dodge pause A break in the game is time 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.480
 be pauses wait I was putting us 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.030
 President and to have made a further 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 fast but frontal blitz and that's what 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.739
 happens to the wheel scenes for doing nothing 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.960
 against this but the top this video and the same 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.329
 class that has few show only me 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.539
 I was using this video and I'm going 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.879
 lay bare and crepe and it's best class is 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.100
 It would be the anthem and I do not know how 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.410
 it will be one said that this is mine 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 class is to have to show that power 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.040
 is Strix is a jungle that uses one that I 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.470
 I know it's a class that has to 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.130
 think and and meadow makes sense also a 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.740
 class that has only two parts to 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.909
 trumpets as you could see and not 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.340
 It was a mistake, it's a purpose and what 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.970
 that I am therefore these two parts for 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 year 3 you were all fish with 78 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.020
 kilos ha and tests and another one of fish 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.530
 much faster 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.900
 one thing I saw in the year chaos quepe 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.790
 that they show that they are slower and 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.829
 Why paths that brings us 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.390
 and because it's harder for her to have 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.280
 that status because it targets 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.470
 Maybe it's even the ones who are here. 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.229
 slower than the furniture and certainly 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.720
 sure at that point in the smov stretch 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.130
 much lighter faster motorcycles of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.979
 now wants to show that it is only 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 there is why, because of fish and 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.680
 people sometimes take a long time to 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.320
 the fish at this time everything I want to be 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.110
 here is the fish because the stretch is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.820
 everything much faster and bye and by 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.069
 that 's exactly what pulls it with two parts 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.239
 the spectrum do not watch the losses 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.550
 with eight kilos 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.110
 there what what is lost with this class 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.030
 It's nothing at all that I 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.400
 The difference is that there was 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.570
 premier class who wore which is always 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.430
 what ever cost is an ex tent that netto 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.820
 had asked and now has no merit 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.210
 and merit is not crucial people here strike 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.100
 help but it's not very good trip ready 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.080
 there is no big difference is that there is no 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.690
 difference both use this class is very 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.690
 good is maybe today is better kos 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.010
 Who's here to strip you and 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.770
 for making trains faster 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.620
 and japan, for example, I already showed this 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.580
 Wednesday, several friends and I think you 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.530
 I at least groove it turned out m 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.180
 ready but 80 mother for example I do not 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.120
 I know if you know me I will 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.890
 leave the registration channel my friend 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.200
 snow that the fan has already collected we have 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.739
 that watching his fan has already raced and 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.830
 honest with this class of 99 in the game 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.640
 so soon you see this class as 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.810
 I do not play anything you do much honey is 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.769
 still play very good staff 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.060
 if use is my class for me 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.670
 dispatches and show that 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.170
 less Alexis faster but it was the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.900
 video to have a stadium the government and 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:33.769
 is is winning is not materialize in 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.769
 story said yesterday be sun and bye
