00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I remember like in i think it was like

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.100 
I remember like in i think it was like
GTA<00:01:02.940> vice<00:01:03.180> city<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.660> something<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.049> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
GTA vice city or something like that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.070 
GTA vice city or something like that
there<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> bank<00:01:05.189> robbery<00:01:05.549> mission<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.900> was

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
so horribly done it was like the worst

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.420 
so horribly done it was like the worst
thing<00:01:09.240> ever<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.229> idea<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.010> was<00:01:11.159> cool

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
thing ever but the idea of it was cool

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.789 
thing ever but the idea of it was cool
and<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:12.240> far<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.510> i<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.350> may<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.619> able

will I'm planning on like doing some
some<00:02:44.980> playthroughs<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.850> where<00:02:46.180> we

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
some playthroughs of this where we

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.860 
some playthroughs of this where we
hopefully<00:02:47.470> successfully<00:02:48.459> heist<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.330> bank<00:02:49.570> or

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
hopefully successfully heist a bank or

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.290 
hopefully successfully heist a bank or
do<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.769> there's<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.010> jewelry<00:02:51.459> heist<00:02:51.550> one<00:02:52.030> as

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
do that there's a jewelry heist one as

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.509 
do that there's a jewelry heist one as
well<00:02:52.480> stuff<00:02:52.900> like<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.410> they're<00:02:54.280> kind<00:02:54.459> of

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
well stuff like that and they're kind of

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.800 
well stuff like that and they're kind of
long<00:02:54.700> but<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.030> think<00:02:55.209> it'd<00:02:55.300> be<00:02:55.390> kind<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.600> cool<00:02:55.660> to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
long but I think it'd be kind of cool to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.590 
long but I think it'd be kind of cool to
post<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.739> entire<00:02:57.040> thing<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.519> just<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:58.480> know

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.150 
heist or whatever so I think it would be
pretty<00:03:04.330> sweet<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:05.380> yeah<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.800> said<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:06.100> is
