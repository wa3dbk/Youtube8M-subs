00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
think gives you so much life experience

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.440 
think gives you so much life experience
and<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.530> makes<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.799> tough<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.340> be<00:03:22.459> able<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.880> to

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
and it makes you tough to be able to to

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.509 
and it makes you tough to be able to to
deal<00:03:23.630> with<00:03:23.810> adversity<00:03:24.019> adversity<00:03:24.980> because

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
deal with adversity adversity because

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.550 
deal with adversity adversity because
you<00:03:26.000> know<00:03:26.120> it's<00:03:26.570> not<00:03:26.780> handed<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.380> on<00:03:27.410> a

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
you know it's not handed to you on a

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.979 
you know it's not handed to you on a
platter<00:03:27.799> it's<00:03:28.160> it's<00:03:28.459> really<00:03:28.640> about<00:03:28.850> not<00:03:29.810> the

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
platter it's it's really about not the

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.960 
platter it's it's really about not the
more<00:03:30.530> talented<00:03:30.709> person<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.459> think<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.760> person

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
more talented person I think the person

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.360 
more talented person I think the person
that<00:03:32.120> works<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.080> hardest<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.739> will<00:03:33.980> keep

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
that works the hardest and will keep

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.130 
that works the hardest and will keep
getting<00:03:34.700> up<00:03:34.820> every<00:03:35.000> time<00:03:35.299> they<00:03:35.450> fall<00:03:35.600> down<00:03:35.810> or

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
getting up every time they fall down or

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.570 
getting up every time they fall down or
that<00:03:36.530> there's<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.799> challenge<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.310> their<00:03:37.370> way

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
that there's a challenge in their way

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.340 
that there's a challenge in their way
that's<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.060> great<00:03:38.180> takeaway<00:03:38.660> lesson<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.200> it's

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
that's a great takeaway lesson that it's

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.979 
that's a great takeaway lesson that it's
not<00:03:39.500> about<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.640> most<00:03:40.910> talented<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.690> about

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
not about the most talented it's about

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.170 
not about the most talented it's about
that<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.590> one<00:03:42.739> who<00:03:42.769> can<00:03:43.130> stick<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.910> out<00:03:44.030> or

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
that the one who can stick it out or

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.180 
that the one who can stick it out or
sedan<00:03:44.420> yeah<00:03:44.780> yeah<00:03:45.290> that's<00:03:45.590> that's<00:03:45.890> very

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
sedan yeah yeah that's that's very

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.110 
sedan yeah yeah that's that's very
important<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.579> mean<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.790> takes<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:47.030> certain

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
important I mean it takes a certain

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.240 
important I mean it takes a certain
amount<00:03:47.269> of<00:03:47.450> maturity<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.650> come<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.100> that

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
amount of maturity to to come to that

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.400 
amount of maturity to to come to that
realization<00:03:50.150> do<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:50.930> think<00:03:51.140> that<00:03:51.260> there<00:03:51.380> are

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
realization do you think that there are

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.069 
realization do you think that there are
lots<00:03:51.709> of<00:03:51.860> 16<00:03:52.670> year<00:03:52.940> old<00:03:53.090> 17<00:03:53.630> year<00:03:53.780> olds<00:03:53.989> out

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
lots of 16 year old 17 year olds out

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.870 
lots of 16 year old 17 year olds out
there<00:03:54.230> competing<00:03:54.530> who<00:03:54.829> have<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.220> kind<00:03:55.579> of

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
there competing who have that kind of

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.360 
there competing who have that kind of
maturity<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.960> think<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.590> learned<00:03:57.800> so<00:03:58.190> much

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
maturity I think you learned so much

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.850 
maturity I think you learned so much
through<00:03:58.990> your<00:03:59.990> own<00:04:00.110> experience<00:04:00.710> you<00:04:00.830> learn

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
through your own experience you learn

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.890 
through your own experience you learn
how<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.190> handle<00:04:01.670> things<00:04:01.850> you<00:04:02.060> learn<00:04:02.240> what

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
how you handle things you learn what

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.770 
how you handle things you learn what
stuff<00:04:03.230> for<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.740> you<00:04:03.830> learn<00:04:03.950> how

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
stuff for you and you learn how

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.150 
stuff for you and you learn how
something<00:04:05.780> can<00:04:05.930> feel<00:04:06.170> impossible<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:07.010> then

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
something can feel impossible and then

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.620 
something can feel impossible and then
once<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.460> do<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:07.940> how<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.060> feel<00:04:08.510> like

once you do it and how you feel like
you've<00:04:08.810> conquered<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:09.710> how<00:04:10.000> amazing<00:04:11.000> it

you've conquered it and how amazing it

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.700 
you've conquered it and how amazing it
