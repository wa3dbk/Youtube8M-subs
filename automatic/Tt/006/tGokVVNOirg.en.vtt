00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
get the best now the reason why I showed

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.510 
get the best now the reason why I showed
off<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> little<00:02:03.750> bit<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.899> grid<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.409> play<00:02:05.159> back<00:02:05.369> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
off a little bit of grid to play back I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.340 
off a little bit of grid to play back I
wanted<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.850> show<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.000> variance<00:02:06.569> of<00:02:07.080> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
wanted to show a variance of the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.130 
wanted to show a variance of the
differences<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.509> could<00:02:09.630> see<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:10.080> you

and<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.879> can<00:02:29.030> tell<00:02:29.239> just<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.840> way<00:02:29.959> it

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
and and you can tell just the way it

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.309 
and and you can tell just the way it
looks<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.769> know<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.310> they<00:02:32.239> didn't<00:02:32.629> expect

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
looks you know that they didn't expect

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.289 
looks you know that they didn't expect
enough<00:02:33.920> people<00:02:34.159> to<00:02:34.430> actually<00:02:34.670> be<00:02:35.060> able<00:02:35.150> to

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
enough people to actually be able to

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.170 
enough people to actually be able to
represent<00:02:35.569> these<00:02:36.049> particular<00:02:36.739> graphics<00:02:37.310> so

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
represent these particular graphics so

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.699 
represent these particular graphics so
just<00:02:38.629> think<00:02:38.810> about<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.139> this<00:02:39.260> way

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
just think about it this way

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.849 
just think about it this way
what<00:02:39.950> will<00:02:40.159> grid<00:02:40.519> 3<00:02:41.030> offer<00:02:41.689> I<00:02:41.719> think<00:02:42.319> grid<00:02:42.560> 3

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
what will grid 3 offer I think grid 3

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.339 
what will grid 3 offer I think grid 3
will<00:02:43.099> look<00:02:43.340> even<00:02:43.879> better<00:02:44.269> than<00:02:44.659> grid<00:02:45.109> 2

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
will look even better than grid 2

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.190 
will look even better than grid 2
because<00:02:45.920> now<00:02:46.129> they'll<00:02:46.370> say<00:02:46.519> okay<00:02:46.969> grid<00:02:47.750> 3<00:02:48.049> is

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
because now they'll say okay grid 3 is

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.410 
because now they'll say okay grid 3 is
gonna<00:02:48.379> run<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.799> xbox<00:02:49.340> one<00:02:49.609> it's<00:02:49.939> gonna<00:02:50.030> run<00:02:50.269> on

the ps4 now the bar is set higher you

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.809 
the ps4 now the bar is set higher you
know<00:02:54.319> it's<00:02:54.500> it's<00:02:54.769> no<00:02:54.950> longer<00:02:55.159> this<00:02:55.519> low

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
anymore now we can start to stretch our

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.909 
anymore now we can start to stretch our
graphics<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.599> bit<00:02:59.780> now<00:03:00.049> we<00:03:00.109> can<00:03:00.439> say<00:03:00.650> hey<00:03:00.859> you

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
graphics a bit now we can say hey you

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:01.509 
graphics a bit now we can say hey you
know<00:03:01.129> what

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
somewhat capable on next-gen hardware so

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.550 
somewhat capable on next-gen hardware so
I<00:03:13.669> don't<00:03:14.030> know<00:03:14.120> what<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.329> guys<00:03:14.480> think<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.109> just

strictly on graphics there has to be a

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:36.849 
strictly on graphics there has to be a
better<00:03:36.319> reason

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
better reason

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.839

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
graphics card in my PC is three times

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.730 
graphics card in my PC is three times
more<00:04:05.770> powerful<00:04:06.010> than<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.820> ps4<00:04:07.410> just<00:04:08.410> putting

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
more powerful than the ps4 just putting

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.620 
more powerful than the ps4 just putting
it<00:04:08.830> out<00:04:08.950> there<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:10.090> putting<00:04:10.390> it<00:04:10.480> out<00:04:10.570> there

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
it out there just putting it out there

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.840 
it out there just putting it out there
next<00:04:11.260> generation<00:04:12.160> when<00:04:12.340> they<00:04:12.430> released<00:04:12.730> the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
next generation when they released the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.780 
next generation when they released the
790<00:04:13.540> it's<00:04:13.780> gonna<00:04:13.930> be<00:04:14.170> 30%<00:04:14.590> more<00:04:15.160> powerful<00:04:15.610> than

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
790 it's gonna be 30% more powerful than

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.940 
790 it's gonna be 30% more powerful than
my<00:04:15.940> current<00:04:16.300> card<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:17.230> know<00:04:17.350> what<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.650> makes

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
my current card you know what that makes

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.250 
my current card you know what that makes
that<00:04:18.280> sets<00:04:18.550> the<00:04:18.700> bar<00:04:18.820> even<00:04:18.880> higher<00:04:19.120> for<00:04:19.630> PCs

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
that sets the bar even higher for PCs

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.770 
that sets the bar even higher for PCs
and<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:21.660> forces<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.690> console<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.350> play<00:04:23.380> catch
