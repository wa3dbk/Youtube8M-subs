00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.640
 since they finished I know 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.899
 I do not know can meet 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.449
 the centuries with the statements 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:11.929
 equally to face 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.809
 boyle second year of high school 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.250
 i in a podcast for those who do not know that they are few insurance no longer dress 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.980
 they are on the left side 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.050
 percent of serra because he rented it because he would because this video would be like 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.039
 television programs radio programs 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.420
 but this I mean in terms of the way it is used to make 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.720
 the difference of a post since the planned 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.230
 that you can write and that your house arrives instead of having to go to the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.170
 corner shop buy them then you subscribe to the podcast and instead of 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 that you have to be allowing the page to see if something new is coming out 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.500
 Automatically it's going to explode I talk about issues that strikes me 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.850
 that he did not lend it, leaving me very fixed 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 I'm complaining about education in Mexico 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.450
 sometimes feel the people who believe that the photographer willy and they say they are neither things 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.690
 that they are not like that prepare to the mother country that procreated next to Jorge to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.749
 next to jorge garcía lemos foto ap ap 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.429
 aquesta gent I mean I hope I can find and I decided to enter 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:11.319
 sites because then there are things that I want to say i in the aforementioned video and 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:14.890
 because in the podcast I can put myself I have why it has actually served 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.080
 but I prefer to do it in virtue because maybe you have heard the phrase 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.940
 hit the body 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.370
 I think YouTube is the tool by which we can make known 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.750
 our ideas and share them with other people 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.360
 ikechi I think that also from this we can meet new people feel 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.320
 as well as me or like you that also maybe assistant videoblogs 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.430
 you can share 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.830
 your thoughts with the people you are seeing and create new friendships 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.320
 through youtube before deprived them to talk about a topic that 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.100
 I have not tried in pots yet 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.220
 the since he considered that this one is more common for videoblog I do not know if they have 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.289
 realized but there are many people who do not know how to use 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.289
 the following list of words 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.259
 the word there is used to point out an object to a little alerted person 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.470
 plus 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.049
 the state to make it 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.649
 the truth 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.299
 when it's special because they stepped on it, not because you dropped it, something says it's 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:15.899
 there 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:17.070

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.239
 lima may 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.469
 when I asked if there is still something 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.040
 tell yourself the trend is still there pie you're talking about alert 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.019
 to the gazette 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.270
 all the people say I have not eaten 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.380
 is here because we are speaking through the verb to have I have not 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.380
 eaten and when you do not understand is something that they did to you say be 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.559
 way to finish 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.860
 when you say it is possible that I go I will insist with lukewarmness not with double ele 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.099
 because he goes with double ele 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.099
 it's a battle 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.680
