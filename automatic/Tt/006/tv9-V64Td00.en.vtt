00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.980
 oh well then welcome to 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.620
 press conference after the game of the fc 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.509
 erzgebirge aue against the fc st pauli the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.460
 final day of the round so seen 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.320
 parallel to the games of karlsruher 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.359
 sc against bochum 0 0 and arminia 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.150
 Bielefeld separated from Dynamo 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.670
 dresden at the end of 1 1 the result known 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.210
 both trainers are there and look st 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.180
 pauli coach roland wilsdorf 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.950
 yes I think we have a lot today 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.390
 seen an intense fight-oriented game 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.879
 where my team is safe in the beginning 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.219
 of the game with the held eleven meters 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.920
 Good luck had good goalkeeper 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.780
 maybe also in the situation and the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.020
 us then immediately held in play 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.110
 in return we make out of seeon 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.480
 city ​​situation the 1 0 what us 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.090
 bit security and then 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.420
 later also the second goal 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.090
 and I think that we are today 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.090
 I've done that well 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.360
 we had planned 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.119
 previously discussed that we Erzgebirge 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.950
 Leave the ball to the ball 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.240
 that we are a bit more defensive 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.590
 that we are a bit more compact 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.290
 because we do not run into the open knife 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.090
 wanted to lose the ball and that we 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.630
 have made it over the whole game 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.150
 To keep this order very well for sure 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.159
 we had at some situations 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.720
 luck with standard situations 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.329
 for example, on a good one 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.850
 Goalkeeper keeps us there in the game 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.030
 has held and in the end I think 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 We do not necessarily deserve it, but 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.350
 luckily I keep winning the game 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.689
 and were of course overjoyed 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.909
 Three points home and happy 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.020
 first on the christmas party tomorrow 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.810
 which now has a positive start 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.520
 can be 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.250
 All the best continues 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.829
 the round and good luck in the next 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.780
 play thank you to beautiful was the 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.119
 View of the 90 minutes from St Pauli 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.000
 Coach Roland past the coach 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.569
 2 kug that's right first at the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.970
 Colleagues and FC St Pauli crew around 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.349
 Congratulations I admit yes I can only 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.299
 also stressed that was a very intense 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.239
 game 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.700
 Well what should I say today it is 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:33.690
 sunday the boys have given full throttle 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.319
 but we have a lot of bad luck today 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.060
 and so I can actually 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.790
 just explain because I say we 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.519
 have the first chance with the eleven-meter 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.260
 get a sunday shot in return 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.579
 purely we place him now eight 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.970
 Let's go and if he does that again 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.280
 meets the one really good at 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.440
 politically after with the 2 0 and then 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.049
 Do you run after but I have to go all the way 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.359
 honestly say how we did it then 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.359
 I have to say was absolutely in 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.159
 okay we have fought we have 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.280
 bitten we won battles 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.930
 and if you look at the statistics 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.579
 everything is absolutely fine and 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.799
 I must also compliment ours 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.870
 fans give because they have now a 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.639
 had a fine sense that the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.400
 team really wants to cut everything out 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.079
 that she is absolutely fighting for this 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.620
 play in this game again 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.819
 find with a connection gate and then 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.959
 I have my colleagues has also 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.220
 give it a try with one 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.599
 average goalie would you have 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.400
 certainly more problems today 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:37.260
 get and therefore compliment to the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.199
 art guys and as I liked 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.919
 but we stand there have no points 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:45.569
 that is not good and that is obligatory 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.699
 us of course next week against 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.889
 Ingolstadt again to give full can 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:52.739
 here at home with the same 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.269
 support and hopefully this time 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.799
 of course with another game 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.019
 Thank you very much 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.090
 Thanks a lot Madam Doris and so is the 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.049
 open questionnaire 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.160
 1/10 corpse is no rule of the 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.780
 free press continues to apply that 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.199
 player himself trusts the elfmeter 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.199
 should shoot 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.350
 yes what should I say now we have 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.440
 set three protect this is zlatko 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.300
 janjic that's jacobs silvestre and that 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.700
 is thomas paulus 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.980
 I can not say who before the game 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.460
 those in the game feel safe and secure 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.639
 that is why the one decision is the 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.570
 player in the field and we expect 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.360
 always empathy 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.250
 we expect the players to say that 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.960
 also take responsibility 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.730
 last week with zlatko it worked 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.280
 This week, unfortunately, not God 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.960
 worked but still no reproach 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:55.150
 Cuba, he certainly does not participate 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.150
 intention in the fired in the sense 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:05.090
 and more questions output butcher 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.290
 could be that decide with game 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:12.470
 today this was relatively middle field 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:17.479
 little has happened to the sea or 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:20.260
 wise an hour also fink is with the 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.510
 got soccer near came 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.919
 i dont know what you are for a game 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.080
 I saw that completely 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.650
 seen differently because I think so 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.700
 just our central midfield today 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.580
 had to do hard labor 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:38.180
 above all things offensively defensive 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:42.020
 I 'm just saying in the reverse game and if 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.390
 I remember correctly has finch 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.000
 as a defensive six a huge chance 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.430
 So that means he's trying 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.289
 also has the team to power with 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.419
 to work out opportunities yourself 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.950
 So I have to say quite honestly there 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.950
 I disagree a little differently than you 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.890
 There's freedom too 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:06.560
 Staffing is good coaches already 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.440
 somehow in turkey holiday or see 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.490
 they do it differently today too 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.490
 a bit provocative on it 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.730
 there is with us after sandhausen 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.260
 play and da guido both on a daily basis 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.220
 training participates as well as in the 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.660
 Duties is still there, I think 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.810
 again, that speaks your statement 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.580
 it 's certainly one of those too 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.270
 or other opponents of our games 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.590
 observed and you also currently, 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.800
 a bit different against military 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:41.490
 and I think 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.140
 that in its evolution 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.180
 certainly very important is that he is with 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.790
 such facts comes clear and if he does 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.600
 then he will be able to prevail 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.810
 certainly also positive 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.810
 advanced 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.820
 they will be happy to see us before the sacred 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.680
 firmly 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.190
 but make you happy with one 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.810
 Doppelspitze to talk only the joy 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.600
 they had the last ones today 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.460
 minutes I had the pleasure of them 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.380
 think we have a system recorded 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.850
 from this system we can always 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.620
 again variable on scores 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:23.250
 that will certainly work 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.250
 stay there are other questions 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.900
 not the case 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:32.500
 the fc st pauli monday play on 16 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.150

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.810
 the back lap prelude quasi that the 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.180
 both teams much success the st 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:44.010
