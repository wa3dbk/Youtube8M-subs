00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 it is a very large left and left 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.940
 but what is the difference 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.290
 I am interested in these men 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.870
 out of shot 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.580
 have large miscalculated they are 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.110
 they are too much to blame 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.110
 little concerned with turning for profit 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.180
 of course those are two you can see 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.560
 for that you you me can not crimes 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.670
 then drive fast 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.430
 you ca n't go any faster than you go 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.720
 just to the bend 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.640
 That is that the style past the piece 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.680
 side is still good for that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.790
 a hefty sprint 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.730
 this is where the mountain on the final part starts 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.399
 so indeed red rose with 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.829
 a good chance of fog 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.480
 they must sit down at the wheel 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.190
 van valverde 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 micah that made temple is that another one 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.050
 the attempt of reverse 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.330
 Roach away from the Samuel Sanchez is true 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.370
 that difference big enough 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.490
 and I think that will thereby doing 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.230
 is what that quality is about 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.180
 hatch-bastaken-hatch with the nuts 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.010
 concept art 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.510
 in other words perfect time know me 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.450
 where your caesar's name can go 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.180
 last full there he goes 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.740
 she can still and the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.050
 three times too was afraid but how 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.790
 I come out it is there that fall there 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.630
 goes to the head and falls I have the idea 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.700
 that we win 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:28.420
 pray for him and for standing timing is like 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.370
 He wants them to tell us how we are going today 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.000
 we will go with you again 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.250
 view the cabinet piece of the fall vertÃ© 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.410
 So the timing now know it 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.840
 moment because otherwise I might be able to 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.729
 arrive late and then it goes strong 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.740
 enough to make it difficult for the rest 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.690
 to get to the wheel 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.340
 So lose that hope that it will come 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.140
 still the hand 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.540
 there he comes to the wheel but not 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.649
 it fell so strongly that it can 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.899
 parry 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.979
 and then the financial is there 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.420
 the offing 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.259
 Allah is a dbc comb with you 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.660
 this image is not in the picture 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.840
 roach would still be 30 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.590
 I think no moreno is third and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.590
 roach tenant
