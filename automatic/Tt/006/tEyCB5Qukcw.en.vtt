 for all kris urs the level of care 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.029
 of this species is for beginners it is 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 native to the Caribbean Atlantic Ocean 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.579
 that goes from florida and the bermuda shorts 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.009
 to Brazil including the Caribbean when 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.289
 this species is juvenile can inhabit in 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.660
 small aquariums but once it arrives 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.699
 to been adult your requirements of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.820
 space will be very important to 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.500
 consider aquariums from 200 onwards 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.600
 liters will be necessary for the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.030
 comfort of the fish since it is usually very 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.859
 territorial and males can reach 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.829
 to 21 centimeters in length 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.440
 total the temperature can go from 22 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.940
 at 26 degrees Celsius the density 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.949
 from 1.0 20 to 1.0 25 are omnivores and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.859
 will accept any commercial food 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.749
 as well as live food so with 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.610
 quality water we will not have problems 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.340
 in this aspect it is compatible with 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
 reef aquariums and only fish 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.360
 most important of this aspect 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.829
 to meet the aquarium companions 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.899
 that he will have since his classmates 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.360
 they need to be of good size and 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.909
 temperament to avoid a pain of 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.159
 head with this damsel remember that 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.460
 except the damsel chrome and all the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.770
 other damsels are very territorial 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.030
 there are even those who recommend 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.069
 preferably not have damsels in 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.100
 our aquariums and this is recommended 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.960
 because most of us 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.909
 aquariums and we want to have them in 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.420
 our aquariums a perc clown fish 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.450
 seahorses flame or purple gobies 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.970
 butterfly fish and even surgeons 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.520
 juveniles can be attacked 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.409
 by territorial damsels so they 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.899
 if your intention is to have a damsel 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.360
 like this one just looking for companions 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.399
 adequate and you will avoid many problems 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.250
 in his youthful stage this dark cloak 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.049
 with very bright blue dots when 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.329
 reaches its adult stage can become 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.579
 yellowish coffee has more spots 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.319
 small and fuzzy as well as the tail 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.150
 yellow in its adult stage is 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.519
 considered one of the most damsels 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.560
 Aggressive you can keep several 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.209
 damsels of this type but 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.430
 it is recommended for aquariums what 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.620
 large enough for each 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.720
 damsel believes her territory there is no 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.670
 distinctive characteristics between 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.340
 female and the male and can be 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.470
 successfully raised in captivity their 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.630
 family is hermaphrodite by nature 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.480
 that is , each fish can become 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.370
 male or female as required I want 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.440
 thank for the amount of emails and 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.510
 messages that arrive to the mail of 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.900
 marine aquariums mx 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.959
 gmail.com as well as twitter and facebook 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.330
 club aquariums mx thanks for the quantity 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.790
 of questions and comments that arrive and 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.709
 I'm honest, we read each and every one 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.720
 of the comments and questions that 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.790
 they arrive unfortunately we can not 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.010
 answer all since many of the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.260
 questions we have are very questions 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.269
 simple with very elaborate answers 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.790
 so in the videos I'm going to opt for 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.099
 go reading a question and try 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.680
 solve it for what I also ask the 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.569
 support and participation of you if it is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.819
 that can complement us 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.120
 answer for example I have a quantity 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.800
 huge questions about how 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.560
 do to eliminate the algae 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.510
 brown from our aquarium friends if you already 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.180
 we got into this we have no more than 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.970
 investigate and know the reasons why 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.830
 that the brown seaweed grows in an aquarium and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.710
 the reasons why it grows are 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.900
 many the main one aquariums 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.420
 new two aquariums with many 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.990
 Nutrients 3 aquariums with a lot of load 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.000
 biological 4 too much light and so on and 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.280
 all these issues have their development 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.850
 so answer it in a single video 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.040
 it would be difficult in an impossible post what 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.590
 What remains is to investigate in which case 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.140
 we fall and from there look for the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.570
 solution general solutions and that we 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.910
 can they help with these are they use 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.010
 reverse osmosis water place 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.140
 wave generators or a generator 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.450
 more waves introduce and armies 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.750
 cleaners like snails and crabs 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.420
 hermit sand gobies and eat seaweed and 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.609
 as I have told you to use a very 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.310
 good screamer it does not matter that it's expensive 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.560
 the important thing is that in the long run these 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.780
 headaches will be avoided what 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.310
 important in this case is not to lose the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.620
 calm and report 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.630
 to make the right decision that you 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.790
 will help with the problem and not 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.130
 to extend more, it only remains for me to wish you 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.800

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.910
 as possible solutions and if you like

 it helps us reach more people and 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.600
 As you may have noticed, we are 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.720

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.260
 concerning the phyllian string as well as 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.270
 also today we can say that our 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.640
 audience level has a very wide range 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.190
 great since we're not only happy to 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.950

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.710
 from children young adults and people 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.570
 older so I thank you for
