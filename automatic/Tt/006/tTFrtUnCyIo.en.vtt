mr. mo-mo became terribly interested in
the<00:00:13.549> molecular<00:00:13.910> structure<00:00:14.719> of<00:00:14.870> water<00:00:15.110> and

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
the molecular structure of water and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.060 
the molecular structure of water and
what<00:00:16.490> effects<00:00:16.880> it<00:00:17.119> now<00:00:18.080> water<00:00:18.380> is<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.860> most

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
what effects it now water is the most

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.349 
receptive of the four elements mr. Emoto
thought<00:00:23.210> perhaps<00:00:23.690> it<00:00:24.110> would<00:00:24.260> respond<00:00:24.740> to

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
thought perhaps it would respond to

thought perhaps it would respond to
non-physical<00:00:26.359> events<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.440> he<00:00:27.619> set<00:00:27.859> up<00:00:27.890> a

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
non-physical events so he set up a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.150 
non-physical events so he set up a
series<00:00:28.609> of<00:00:28.640> studies<00:00:28.990> applied<00:00:29.990> mental<00:00:30.590> stimuli

not put any information then we take the

not put any information then we take the
water<00:01:18.320> with<00:01:18.619> information<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.430> do<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.670> same

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
water with information and do the same

water with information and do the same
procedure<00:01:20.090> just<00:01:20.659> describe<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:23.390> take<00:01:23.570> those

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
procedure just describe you take those

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.440

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.300 

i<00:01:35.750> when<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.840> projected<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.530> feeling<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.070> love

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
i when we projected the feeling of love

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
i when we projected the feeling of love
and<00:01:38.369> thanks<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.970> water<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.479> made<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> most

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and thanks to water it made the most

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.330 
and thanks to water it made the most
beautiful<00:01:40.229> crystal<00:01:42.560> times<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
beautiful crystal times like this I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.880 
beautiful crystal times like this I
