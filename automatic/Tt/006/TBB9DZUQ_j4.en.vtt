00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
playing the Soares hitch is quite

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.090 
playing the Soares hitch is quite
similar<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.670> tying<00:00:51.909> a<00:00:52.059> prusik<00:00:52.420> hitch<00:00:52.750> a<00:00:53.409> major

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
similar to tying a prusik hitch a major

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.299 
similar to tying a prusik hitch a major
difference<00:00:54.519> is<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:55.059> need<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:55.719> use<00:00:55.960> an

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
difference is that you need to use an

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.369 
difference is that you need to use an
eye-to-eye<00:00:57.309> piece<00:00:57.549> of<00:00:57.699> cord<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.600> can't<00:00:58.869> use<00:00:59.140> a

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
eye-to-eye piece of cord you can't use a

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.569 
eye-to-eye piece of cord you can't use a
loop<00:00:59.619> for<00:01:00.219> this<00:01:00.339> knot<00:01:02.070> firstly<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:03.339> want<00:01:03.489> to

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
loop for this knot firstly you want to

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.100 
loop for this knot firstly you want to
come<00:01:03.760> across<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.390> front<00:01:04.539> of<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.839> stunning

come across the front of the stunning
part<00:01:05.439> of<00:01:05.530> your<00:01:05.649> climbing<00:01:06.070> line<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:08.009> we're

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
part of your climbing line then we're

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.760 
part of your climbing line then we're
going<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.159> go<00:01:09.310> around<00:01:09.399> the<00:01:09.580> back<00:01:09.729> in<00:01:09.970> a

going to go around the back in a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
going to go around the back in a
anti-clockwise<00:01:11.850> direction<00:01:12.850> for<00:01:13.750> one<00:01:13.929> turn

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
anti-clockwise direction for one turn

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.889 
anti-clockwise direction for one turn
then<00:01:17.170> going<00:01:17.799> up<00:01:18.420> above<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.600> bridge<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.340> then

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
then going up above the bridge and then

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.699 
then going up above the bridge and then
changing<00:01:22.899> direction<00:01:23.049> to<00:01:23.729> clockwise<00:01:24.729> and

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:25.709 
changing direction to clockwise and

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:35.630 
changing direction to clockwise and
making<00:01:27.659> four<00:01:28.860> more<00:01:29.860> turns<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.069> gives<00:01:33.280> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.210 

five<00:01:36.640> wraps<00:01:37.030> in<00:01:37.209> total<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:41.039> take<00:01:42.039> the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
five wraps in total then take the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.100 
five wraps in total then take the
carabiner<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:45.390> clip<00:01:46.390> both<00:01:46.569> the<00:01:46.629> eyes<00:01:46.869> through

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
carabiner and clip both the eyes through

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.259 
carabiner and clip both the eyes through
there<00:01:47.289> and<00:01:47.500> then<00:01:47.679> you<00:01:47.800> can<00:01:47.979> address<00:01:48.879> the<00:01:49.119> knot

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:49.269 
there and then you can address the knot

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:52.259 
there and then you can address the knot
so<00:01:49.899> it's<00:01:50.050> nice<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.289> even<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.789> that<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.149> the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:52.269 
so it's nice and even and that is the

00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:56.339 
so it's nice and even and that is the
swab<00:01:52.599> --is--<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:53.530> not<00:01:53.940> like<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.300> VT<00:01:55.899> or<00:01:55.929> the

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
swab --is-- this not like the VT or the

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.889 
swab --is-- this not like the VT or the
distal<00:01:56.769> can<00:01:57.489> be<00:01:57.610> used<00:01:57.849> in<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.179> system<00:01:58.569> with<00:01:58.869> a

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
distal can be used in a system with a

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.589 
distal can be used in a system with a
micro<00:01:59.259> pulley<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.619> tend<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.009> if<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:00.879> like

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
micro pulley to tend it if you like

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.440 
micro pulley to tend it if you like
