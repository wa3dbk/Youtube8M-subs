happened I get the feeling that the
batch<00:03:00.459> DC<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.600> think<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.110> batch<00:03:02.260> is

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
batch DC I think the batch is

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.780 
batch DC I think the batch is
disconnected<00:03:03.010> like<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.220> don't<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.489> think<00:03:03.700> on

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
disconnected like I don't I think on

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.370 
disconnected like I don't I think on
both<00:03:03.970> sides<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.540> probably<00:03:04.840> told<00:03:04.989> us<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.230> we

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
both sides it probably told us that we

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.199 
both sides it probably told us that we
won<00:03:05.620> cuz<00:03:06.400> there's<00:03:06.549> no<00:03:06.670> way<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:06.940> he<00:03:07.030> was<00:03:07.150> just

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
won cuz there's no way that he was just

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.759 
won cuz there's no way that he was just
standing<00:03:07.510> there<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:09.160> was<00:03:09.280> retarded<00:03:10.769> that

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
standing there that was retarded that

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.450
