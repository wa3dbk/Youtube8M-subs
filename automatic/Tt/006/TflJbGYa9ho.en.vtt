00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 to wear the national shirt because it's a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.020
 proud to defend your country 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.179
 sportingly speaking represent your 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.250
 country and defend it on a court the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.400
 triumph of your country from your selection 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.690
 it is a pride for anyone and not 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.910
 I'm talking about a Mexican section I'm talking about 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.800
 any selection everyone wants to go to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.300
 a selection then it 's obvious that 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.300
 I do not think anyone is not here 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.640
 present we understand why so much 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.930
 negative will not be nothing I do not know what is 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.690
 going through the candle head I think 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.550
 that the first the first negative was 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.589
 understandable medium understandable 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.360
 because there was audio there has been a team 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.879
 that the real society that is going to look for 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.949
 by he buys it and starts to see it and 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.300
 begins to earn a position and then to 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.280
 the best talking to technician I have to 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.980
 to say that I love you here I need you 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.350
 here if you go to a tournament that 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.500
 obligation does not have to be there because 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.299
 maybe he did not finish convincing me anymore 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.549
 the best in that moment then talked 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.250
 with the selection technician can 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.350
 can be given that possibility but good 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.610
 I am today but I do not understand is already playing 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.740
 proven is a game that is 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.060
 going through a great moment that 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.009
 obviously the selection would have to 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.689
 take advantage of it and they look for it for that 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.430
 but good you decision 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.320
 completely from him hopefully and support 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.229
 someone wants me to go into 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.579
 because then also in the son of 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.350
 great footballers who are also 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.640
 going through good time case of oribe 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.430
 peralta 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.170
 and gray without a doubt the 'chicharito' 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.450
 Although it is not sometimes we 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.510
 initialist is always there and makes 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.610
 goals and gives goal passes and can be a 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.740
 undeniable holder that for what it does 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.570
 within the selection only appears with 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.100
 the opportunity raúl jiménez not then 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.500
 Well, you will not always have that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.090
 opportunity to be sought and 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.729
 be given the chance to refuse 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.700
 and go back to look for it I do not 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.530
 I understand I do not accept it I do not understand why 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.729
 the player's refusal because he can 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.440
 to be able to decipher that I do not want to be 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.850
 the selection and already and not every 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.000
 seeks to refuse and good for the next 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.950
 for feels good because it would give rise 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.380
 that every opportunity is being given 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.869
 I'm not busy in knowing if we 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.940
 praise they did not speak to us if they recognize no 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.459
 they recognize I'm busy and the team 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.070
 score points win convince the fans 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.450
 the managers are calm we 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.030
 in the group we are happy 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.820
 with what we do in the work of the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.540
 court with that is more than enough in that 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.849
 occupation I am 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.870
 if they recognize or not good, well, we do not 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.870
 we show for that
