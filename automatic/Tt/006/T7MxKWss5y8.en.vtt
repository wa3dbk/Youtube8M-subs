00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:02.840 

microfilaments<00:00:01.949> are<00:00:02.070> found<00:00:02.429> in<00:00:02.700> the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
microfilaments are found in the

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.140 
microfilaments are found in the
cytoplasm<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:03.990> they<00:00:04.890> are<00:00:05.130> composed<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:06.060> a

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
cytoplasm and they are composed of a

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.169 
cytoplasm and they are composed of a
protein<00:00:06.600> known<00:00:06.629> as<00:00:06.839> actin<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.179> many

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
protein known as actin and many

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.089 
protein known as actin and many
molecules<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.750> actin<00:00:10.170> will<00:00:10.320> join<00:00:10.590> together<00:00:10.740> to

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
molecules of actin will join together to

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.480 
molecules of actin will join together to
form<00:00:11.309> an<00:00:11.490> actin<00:00:11.910> polymer<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.929> then<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:14.070> actin

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
form an actin polymer and then the actin

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.430 
form an actin polymer and then the actin
polymers<00:00:14.940> will<00:00:15.089> twist<00:00:15.480> around<00:00:15.660> each<00:00:15.990> other<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
polymers will twist around each other to

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.210 
polymers will twist around each other to
form<00:00:16.470> an<00:00:16.949> actin<00:00:17.850> filament<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
form an actin filament and

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.460 
form an actin filament and
microfilaments<00:00:20.220> are<00:00:20.580> mainly<00:00:21.449> involved<00:00:22.289> in

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
microfilaments are mainly involved in

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.259 
microfilaments are mainly involved in
the<00:00:22.619> gross<00:00:23.039> movement<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> cell<00:00:27.890> and

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
the gross movement of the cell and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.240 
the gross movement of the cell and
microfilaments<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.630> dynamic<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.130> we

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
microfilaments are dynamic and what we

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.889 
microfilaments are dynamic and what we
mean<00:00:35.399> by<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.000> they<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.480> lengthen

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
mean by that is that they can lengthen

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
mean by that is that they can lengthen
and<00:00:36.989> shorten<00:00:37.050> very<00:00:37.590> frequently<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.879> that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and shorten very frequently and in that

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.990 
and shorten very frequently and in that
sense<00:00:39.360> they're<00:00:39.899> similar<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.379> microtubules<00:00:41.370> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
sense they're similar to microtubules so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.180 
sense they're similar to microtubules so
they<00:00:42.420> become<00:00:42.719> longer<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.469> process<00:00:43.890> known<00:00:44.040> as

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
they become longer in a process known as

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.990 
they become longer in a process known as
actin<00:00:44.700> polymerization<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.730> they<00:00:50.730> become

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
actin polymerization and they become

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880 
actin polymerization and they become
shorter<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> process<00:00:52.079> known<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.440> act<00:00:52.680> in

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
shorter in a process known as act in

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.569 
shorter in a process known as act in
deep<00:00:53.129> bloomers<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.730> ssin<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
deep bloomers a ssin and it's the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.520 
deep bloomers a ssin and it's the
polymerization<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.480> depolymerization<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
polymerization and depolymerization that

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.910 
polymerization and depolymerization that
helps<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.550> move<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> cell<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.350> example<00:01:04.500> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
helps to move the cell so one example of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
helps to move the cell so one example of
where<00:01:05.070> microfilaments<00:01:05.760> help<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> gross

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
where microfilaments help with the gross

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.100 
where microfilaments help with the gross
mood<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> cell<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.010> during<00:01:08.549> cell<00:01:08.820> division

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
mood of a cell is during cell division

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.899 
mood of a cell is during cell division
so<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> cell<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.710> some<00:01:10.950> point<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.850> be

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
so the cell at some point is going to be

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.000 
so the cell at some point is going to be
pinched<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.750> way<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.380> eventually

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
pinched in that way and then eventually

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.920 
pinched in that way and then eventually
it'll<00:01:14.189> separate<00:01:14.820> into<00:01:15.090> two<00:01:15.299> separate<00:01:15.720> cells

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it'll separate into two separate cells

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.410 
it'll separate into two separate cells
and<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.680> microfilaments<00:01:17.549> help<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> cell

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and the microfilaments help the cell

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.660 
and the microfilaments help the cell
make<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.320> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> pinched<00:01:20.040> shape<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.580> then

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
make that kind of pinched shape and then

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.010 
make that kind of pinched shape and then
move<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.740> create<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:23.009> separate<00:01:23.520> cells

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
move to create two separate cells

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
move to create two separate cells
another<00:01:25.020> example<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.680> where<00:01:25.860> microfilaments

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
another example of where microfilaments

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310 
another example of where microfilaments
helped<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> movement<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> cell<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.720> in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
helped with the movement of a cell is in

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.789 
helped with the movement of a cell is in
an<00:01:29.220> amoeba<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.659> let's<00:01:30.840> say<00:01:30.960> here's<00:01:31.259> our<00:01:31.409> muta

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
an amoeba so let's say here's our muta

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.490 
an amoeba so let's say here's our muta
cell<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.930> we're<00:01:33.930> gonna<00:01:34.049> say<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.380> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
cell and we're gonna say that it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.289 
cell and we're gonna say that it's
trying<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> capture<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.700> piece<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.180> food

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
trying to capture this piece of food

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.999 
trying to capture this piece of food
right<00:01:36.540> over<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.259> order<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> do

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
right over here so in order for it to do

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.460 
right over here so in order for it to do
that<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.340> has<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.520> extend<00:01:39.270> its<00:01:39.540> pseudopods

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that it has to extend its pseudopods

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.280 
that it has to extend its pseudopods
in<00:01:40.579> that<00:01:41.579> direction<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.270> move<00:01:42.659> around<00:01:43.020> that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
in that direction and move around that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.740 
in that direction and move around that
food<00:01:43.590> molecule<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:45.149> helps<00:01:45.509> those

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
food molecule and what helps those

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.940 
food molecule and what helps those
pseudopods<00:01:46.470> move<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.310> microfilaments<00:01:48.950> let's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
pseudopods move the microfilaments let's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.670 
pseudopods move the microfilaments let's
move<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.399> intermediate<00:01:51.210> filaments<00:01:51.720> so

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
move on to intermediate filaments so

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.240 
move on to intermediate filaments so
intermediate<00:01:53.399> filaments<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.000> contrast<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
intermediate filaments in contrast to

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
intermediate filaments in contrast to
microtubules<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.399> microfilaments

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
microtubules and microfilaments

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.539 
microtubules and microfilaments
are<00:01:57.509> made<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.290> many<00:01:58.560> different<00:01:58.710> types<00:01:59.219> of

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
are made up of many different types of

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.310 
are made up of many different types of
proteins<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.299> strung<00:02:00.600> together<00:02:00.750> into

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
proteins that are strung together into

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.370 
proteins that are strung together into
polymers<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.070> then<00:02:02.759> these<00:02:02.969> polymers<00:02:03.570> twist

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
polymers and then these polymers twist

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.200 
polymers and then these polymers twist
together<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.009> make<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.430> intermediate

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
together to make the intermediate

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.080 
together to make the intermediate
filaments<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.520> intermediate<00:02:08.520> filaments<00:02:08.970> are

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
filaments and intermediate filaments are

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.059 
filaments and intermediate filaments are
different<00:02:09.899> than<00:02:10.080> microtubules<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
different than microtubules and

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.750 
different than microtubules and
microfilaments<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:12.030> that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
microfilaments in that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.710 
microfilaments in that
are<00:02:12.819> pretty<00:02:13.120> much<00:02:13.299> permanent<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:16.239> once

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
are pretty much permanent so once

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.000 
are pretty much permanent so once
they're<00:02:16.959> made<00:02:17.079> by<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.290> cell<00:02:17.560> they<00:02:17.680> kind<00:02:17.920> of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
they're made by the cell they kind of

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.420 
they're made by the cell they kind of
stay<00:02:18.250> put<00:02:18.549> as<00:02:18.730> opposed<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.590> microtubules<00:02:20.590> just

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
stay put as opposed to microtubules just

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.949 
stay put as opposed to microtubules just
gonna<00:02:21.579> be<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.909> like<00:02:22.000> breathing<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.569> like<00:02:22.750> that

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
gonna be it like breathing it like that

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.910 
gonna be it like breathing it like that
and<00:02:23.849> microfilaments<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.989> we<00:02:26.260> explained<00:02:26.709> our

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
and microfilaments that we explained our

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.680 
and microfilaments that we explained our
dynamic<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:30.040> constantly<00:02:30.760> change<00:02:31.060> depending

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
dynamic they constantly change depending

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.130 
dynamic they constantly change depending
on<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.019> needs<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.500> cell<00:02:33.629> so<00:02:34.629> what<00:02:35.049> do

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
on the needs of the cell so what do

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.800 
on the needs of the cell so what do
intermediate<00:02:35.739> filaments<00:02:36.159> do<00:02:36.390> well<00:02:37.390> they

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
intermediate filaments do well they

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.140 
intermediate filaments do well they
provide<00:02:38.260> structural<00:02:38.980> support<00:02:39.040> for<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:39.790> cell

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.399 

or<00:02:46.150> another<00:02:46.420> way<00:02:46.569> to<00:02:46.599> see<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.019> is<00:02:47.230> they

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
or another way to see this is they

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:54.240 
or another way to see this is they
resist<00:02:47.950> mechanical<00:02:48.700> stress<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.159> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
resist mechanical stress and in the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.619 
resist mechanical stress and in the
picture<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.670> almost<00:02:54.819> looks<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.299> the

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
picture it almost looks like the

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.059 
picture it almost looks like the
intermediate<00:02:56.290> filaments<00:02:56.769> are<00:02:56.859> this

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
intermediate filaments are this

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.270 
intermediate filaments are this
supporting<00:02:57.909> wire<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.569> if<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.739> recall<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.190> our

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
supporting wire and if you recall in our

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.430 
supporting wire and if you recall in our
introduction<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.849> cytoskeleton<00:03:01.720> we

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
introduction to cytoskeleton we

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.190 
introduction to cytoskeleton we
mentioned<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:04.200> intermediate

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
mentioned that the intermediate

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.050 
mentioned that the intermediate
filaments<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.829> be<00:03:05.950> compared<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.670> springs

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
filaments can be compared to the springs

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.629 
filaments can be compared to the springs
inside<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.780> mattress<00:03:08.099> so<00:03:09.099> if<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.400> were<00:03:09.519> to

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
inside of a mattress so if you were to

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.250 
inside of a mattress so if you were to
sit<00:03:09.909> down<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.209> mattress<00:03:10.599> you<00:03:10.629> might<00:03:10.780> squish

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
sit down on a mattress you might squish

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.140 
sit down on a mattress you might squish
it<00:03:11.379> a<00:03:11.440> little<00:03:11.650> bit<00:03:11.769> but<00:03:11.980> once<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.609> stand<00:03:12.940> up

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
it a little bit but once you stand up

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.539 
it a little bit but once you stand up
the<00:03:13.720> mattress<00:03:14.139> will<00:03:14.290> revert<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:15.010> its<00:03:15.040> original

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
the mattress will revert to its original

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.030 
the mattress will revert to its original
shape<00:03:15.579> shape<00:03:16.239> thanks<00:03:17.079> to<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.379> springs<00:03:17.709> inside

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
shape shape thanks to the springs inside

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.400 
shape shape thanks to the springs inside
so<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.940> intermediate<00:03:19.510> filaments<00:03:19.959> in<00:03:20.079> blue<00:03:20.290> in

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
so the intermediate filaments in blue in

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.269 
so the intermediate filaments in blue in
this<00:03:20.530> picture<00:03:20.859> act<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.699> the<00:03:21.790> same<00:03:22.060> way
