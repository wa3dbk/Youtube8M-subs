00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:11.660
 Began to ask comments of course well 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.999
 I think that you will agree that the first half 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.259
 and dominated playing that football 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.760
 who planned 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:21.369
 second half from the first seconds of growth was 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:28.699
 more aggressive apparently 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:32.630
 slightly out of the break more such 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.789
 salt with a cool therefore and 11 then we 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.820
 added breaks it again the second goal 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.879
 Well, they scored and the standard is certainly not needed 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.820
 which we brought ourselves 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.780
 I want a result of 22 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.989
 thanks please questions 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.410
 introduce yourself have questions yes 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.410
 you are welcome 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.660
 firstly we are at it how it is calm all 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.090
 corner perceived professionally because 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.520
 what will he point to away from the moment 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.979
 when he fails to score and the fact that he scored at 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.770
 It honestly did not surprise me that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.860
 the last games he already spends on such 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.090
 emotional good level will score or 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.090
 no, it was just business time 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.590
 Well, the people with the team was another coach 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.320
 the other it was the first game in my 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.110
 how much i remember the season 1 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.910
 it was a year ago we consider a lot of seating 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.890
 in terms of the same 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.850
 because I changed the system will win 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.350
 how were you a little bit in simplified football 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.940
 which apparently can also bring 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.130
 result 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.130
 I'm just Russian 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.360
 well on the game 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.850
 I think that fair rice dough 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.070
 result unhappy because and 1 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.320
 developed 2 breeding kept well 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.520
 naturally the table obliged us 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.570
 win because if we want 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.890
 get as high as possible in the tournament 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:33.270
 the table should have been still there 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.270
 poll if no thank you 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.380
 Kurban Bekievich Berdysh the main thing you and 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.090
 teams basis traditional first 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.890
 question please your comment 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.770
 Kurban Bekievich 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.440
 In the course of a match of the century, its result is generally 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.740
 the match is satisfied except 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.610
 the second half of the first then somewhere she 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:06.290
 had full primus we are not prime 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.140
 rebuilt thank you guys that 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:15.970
 they did everything right after the break 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:20.080
 and not lost heart and played as it should 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.080
 thanks, please , there is a question 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.020
 these are the questions why this is my decision 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.340
 if you explain it for a long time I do not 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.530
 want this is my decision 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.060
 who is stronger today someone 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.060
 plays they know it 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:56.370
 candles the next team is very active 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:59.540
 if there is no person, they themselves have waited or 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.720
 group active 1 ma therefore we 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.390
 moved 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.780
 emphasis defense on the other half that is 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.530
 then start piercing you a little us 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.720
 succeeded but here's the second half of the first 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.580
 the half already there is a rebuilding wrong 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.940
 I was the same therefore I am dynamo 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.410
 enjoyed it quite well 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.540
 upscale football players phrase widget 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.240
 error tactical positional error 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.410
 Mistake Mistake Look thank God that 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.750
 These 2 entries would be much quieter 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.270
 thanks, please, another question yes 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.130
 please gospel russian alliance and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.670
 what is capable of but in the first david and the beginning 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.569
 the second half tandoor will be listed often 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.610
 won 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.369
 struggle well there was no selection like you 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.740
 think what is the reason and the second question 

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:48.889
 our colleague Stanislovas she would say 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.449
 that the result is logical today 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.339
 The result is a regular screen 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.689
 ended the night with this result 

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:59.550
 pleased with your relationship for the first part 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:02.849
 question but i agree with you there 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.219
 for a long time to move the congar on the pick and 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:09.119
 instead of tarppei than with this dangerous 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:11.490
 in this regard, quite good top and 

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:13.529
 verge although there are two central well 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.809
 plays head us a group of attack 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:18.869
 good enough to play on had 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:21.349
 moments even in the first the garden after 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:24.259
 selection regarding the second question in 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.809
 In principle, I agree with Kalinga 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.719
 but the points are not given 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:33.649
 rather because we need 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:40.249
 series maximum leg to sprite why 

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:40.249
 thanks, yes, please, today is profitable 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:52.200
 certainly showed 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.930
 his playing style is cut where he is 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.760
 skilled enough plays but you 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.500
 you understand that such a football player 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.780
 level unpredictable with him very 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.150
 hard to play so tried as 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.630
 You can play with him unconditionally 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:11.100
 there were violations on our part but 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:13.140
 dismiss the player so thanks thank you 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.650
 if there are no more questions see you on 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.650
 stadium key
