you're going to want to get a shell and

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.100 
you're going to want to get a shell and
drag<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.420> onto<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.620> background<00:00:53.780> ok<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.840> this

drag it onto the background ok so this
you'll<00:00:55.289> show<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.340> text<00:00:56.760> edit

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you'll show that going to the text edit

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
you'll show that going to the text edit
and<00:00:57.660> choose<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.260> want<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.949> to

and choose the one you want I'm going to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
and choose the one you want I'm going to
do<00:00:59.129> both<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.640> I'll<00:00:59.789> take<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> top<00:01:00.300> processes

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
do both so I'll take the top processes

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.390 
do both so I'll take the top processes
first<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:01.620> underneath<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:04.100> i<00:01:05.100> will

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
first I think underneath it and i will

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.020 
first I think underneath it and i will
paste<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.280> as<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.580> i

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
paste that in there and as you can see i

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.410 
paste that in there and as you can see i
get<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> list<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> top<00:01:11.520> processes<00:01:12.210> are

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
get a list of what the top processes are

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.149 
get a list of what the top processes are
and<00:01:13.640> i<00:01:14.640> am<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> change<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.750> fun<00:01:16.350> let's

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and i am going to change that fun let's

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
and i am going to change that fun let's
say<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:18.890> 18<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.909> were<00:01:21.030> wondering<00:01:21.060> what

say to 18 and if you were wondering what

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
say to 18 and if you were wondering what
top<00:01:22.140> processor<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.979> what's<00:01:23.310> taking<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
top processor is what's taking up the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.330 
top processor is what's taking up the
most<00:01:24.210> cpu<00:01:26.390> ok<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.170> let<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.350> one<00:01:28.650> done<00:01:28.890> you're

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
most cpu ok so let that one done you're

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.249 
most cpu ok so let that one done you're
going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> need<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.880> drag<00:01:30.240> another<00:01:30.630> shell<00:01:31.020> on
