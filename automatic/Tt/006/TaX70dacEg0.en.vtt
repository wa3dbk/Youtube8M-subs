00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.590
 hello friends a small question 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.600
 reads svetlana 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.760
 let's hello you do 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.180
 education mask tell with this 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.830
 terms of prevalence 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.400
 attractiveness of online events 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.289
 dinars and teleconference panic or what 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.779
 have a webinar license 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.960
 because it's costly lego 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 I have to use it I look at 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.409
 directions astarta 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.539
 these gods but I have to 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:40.059
 use three times a week because 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:45.150
 that we conduct online lessons we have three 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:47.310
 classes per week tapout license 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.980
 up to 15 users for nothing at all 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.690
 worth up to 100 users worth 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.750
 some really funny money from me 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.680
 the license for 500 users is she 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.030
 not expensive but I don't know a couple thousand 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.030
 so what I want to say is the last 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.220
 years some kind of exponential literally 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.600
 Now this growth in online learning 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.030
 pencil case seminars universities by the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.760
 for various reasons but the most important thing is that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 happens changing mentality as it were 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.390
 in society the paradigm is changing and people 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.510
 start to online education 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.619
 treat both tenants and citizens 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.530
 how to adequate so to speak 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.700
 getting an education and i think that in 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.210
 to a large extent this happens behind 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.550
 account of the fact that the traditional system 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.080
 university education yourself 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.100
 largely discredited the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.890
 and the very expensive large part 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.960
 the cost of this there benefits pension 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.610
 there that people get there 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.220
 busy and ultimately the value of it 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.080
 no wearing education but opens 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.190
 no door so a piece of paper got it 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.929
 sculpt to deliver so here's changing 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.880
 is all to go when you can pass 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.470
 empty and on this stanford 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.350
 university just watch videos in 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.030
 online posted where it was not given 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.630
 but this can pass 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.400
 or you can go online and again 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.920
 many years it's all happening this is not 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.709
 first year is unconditional about it i 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.290
 on the mountain yes this is not the first year 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.840
 happens and quietly 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.170
 improved toolkit i remember 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.459
 so we went a couple of years ago 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.830
 such a startup incubator is there 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:47.520
 call plug and play and there is an event 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.319
 such conferences that there is a stop signal 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.180
 20-30 startups they were there investors listened 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.370
 and there such exhibitions were 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.819
 Pavilions we stood there with ours too 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.250
 but I can say that 10 percent 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.790
 because there were these were startups 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.239
 who exactly tried to do something in 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.150
 In terms of online training, I think that 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.489
 there is virgin virgin land 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.200
 despite the fact that much has already been done 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.069
 surely they flew 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.130
 conferencing 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.140
 and all sorts of tools there type 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.090
 but I'm not in vain, so I take hunger 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.560
 webinar before that there are small 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.069
 the number of users we had there 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.130
 year rally and in the company citrix 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.590
 but there are such things from different companies 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.600
 not only is the secret there still there and very 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.959
 good very big so i will give more 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.700
 there will be a lot there and judging because how much 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.670
 there are startups I feel there are many 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.190
 room for imagination for creativity and 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.380
 so on now in general 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.690
 I forgot some name I read about 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.730
 them israelis such a university 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.380
 online growth there for some funny 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.160
 money you can get a higher education 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.370
 and decently it is not trash that is 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.320
 however everything is fair 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.630
 much more will still be if you 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.270
 have an idea for a startup in this area i 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.430
 I think you're in 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.030
 right direction think that is 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.980
 it is a good direction where there is 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.350
 say a lot of gold ore and in this 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.610
 mine go with your startups skim 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:31.710
 Kayle and scold this gold-bearing rock 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.710
 such a wish for you happy
