provides a sense of protection and it
actually<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.740> mean<00:04:29.009> if<00:04:29.250> we're<00:04:29.430> he's<00:04:29.550> pretty

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.129 
actually I mean if we're he's pretty
well<00:04:29.910> definitely<00:04:30.360> definitely<00:04:30.720> doesn't<00:04:30.990> feel

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
well definitely definitely doesn't feel

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.469 
well definitely definitely doesn't feel
too<00:04:31.320> good<00:04:31.440> as<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.490> saw<00:04:32.639> with<00:04:32.729> our<00:04:32.820> carjacker

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
too good as you saw with our carjacker

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.320 
too good as you saw with our carjacker

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
again I love how loud this thing is

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.339 
again I love how loud this thing is
because<00:04:36.330> that's<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.630> deterrent<00:04:36.930> in<00:04:37.139> and<00:04:37.259> of

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
because that's a deterrent in and of

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.629 
because that's a deterrent in and of
itself<00:04:37.650> just<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:38.039> be<00:04:38.130> able<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.310> do<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.520> to

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
itself just to be able to do that to

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.140 
itself just to be able to do that to
somebody

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
somebody

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.120 
somebody
hopefully<00:04:40.110> not<00:04:40.410> even<00:04:40.560> having<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.800> shock<00:04:40.979> them

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
hopefully not even having to shock them

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.730 
hopefully not even having to shock them
at<00:04:41.220> all<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:42.120> again<00:04:42.509> it's<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.720> great<00:04:42.870> non-lethal

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
at all and again it's a great non-lethal

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.129 
at all and again it's a great non-lethal
deterrent<00:04:44.160> so<00:04:44.729> yeah<00:04:45.539> I<00:04:45.570> really<00:04:45.630> like<00:04:45.960> this
