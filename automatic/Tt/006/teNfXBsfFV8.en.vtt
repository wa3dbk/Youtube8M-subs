00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.489

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.180

 good and all this I have in this 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.819
 tupper to see girls that is not 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.650
 that is, they do not have to have a big 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:21.830
 variety of things to do bijouterie 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.800
 and to house them they also sell in this 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.600

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.850
 and 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.240
 and the closures that I'm going to 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:40.300
 show that this is for 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.500
 good human is to seal 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:48.060
 Dance 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:51.209
 to seal the stay you notice that 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.370
 this plastas those costs and are left 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.480
 A) Yes 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.480

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.350

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.590

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.720
 great dates and little ones but this 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.720
 all this I bought it in a single day 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.530
 and what happens is that I 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.849
 gave for example all the samples 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.470
 and I have already reached my mother 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:41.170

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.759
 complex names we can also 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.520

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.110

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.890

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:17.960
 can use on bracelets or on 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:22.030
 rings that are bigger and you can make 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.030
 hanging rings or things like that 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:31.040
