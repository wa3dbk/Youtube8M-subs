the<00:00:29.310> first<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.750> two<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.619> 4j<00:00:32.099> gave<00:00:32.309> us<00:00:32.520> is

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the first of the two that 4j gave us is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.389 
the first of the two that 4j gave us is
one<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.780> creative<00:00:34.200> menu<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:34.980> basically

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
one of the creative menu which basically

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.940 
one of the creative menu which basically
gives<00:00:35.730> us<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.360> picture<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.050> all<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.590> blocks

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
gives us a picture of all the blocks

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.910 
gives us a picture of all the blocks
which<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:39.180> helpful<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.800> know

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
which is really helpful and you know

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.170 
which is really helpful and you know
just<00:00:41.160> lets<00:00:41.340> us<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> side-by-side

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
just lets us do a side-by-side

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.959 
just lets us do a side-by-side
comparison<00:00:42.980> with<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> default<00:00:44.520> texture<00:00:44.940> pack

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
comparison with the default texture pack

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.080 
comparison with the default texture pack
so<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.930> go<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.969> we<00:00:47.969> can

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
so if we go like this we can go we can

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.330 
so if we go like this we can go we can
like<00:00:48.239> flick<00:00:48.570> between<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.989> two<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:50.190> know

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
like flick between the two you know

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.549 
like flick between the two you know
default<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.390> new<00:00:51.600> texture<00:00:52.020> pack<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.469> we

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
default and the new texture pack and we

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.590 
default and the new texture pack and we
can<00:00:52.710> compare<00:00:53.129> blocks<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.390> see

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
can compare blocks now you can see

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.689 
can compare blocks now you can see
actually<00:00:54.899> quite<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> lot<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.160> blocks<00:00:56.430> are

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
actually quite a lot of the blocks are

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.869 
actually quite a lot of the blocks are
darker<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:59.460> why<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> feel<00:00:59.820> like

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
darker you know that's why I feel like

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.490 
darker you know that's why I feel like
it's<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> very<00:01:00.570> bright<00:01:00.750> texture<00:01:01.230> pack<00:01:01.379> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it's not a very bright texture pack is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.110 
it's not a very bright texture pack is
actually<00:01:01.800> quite<00:01:02.010> dark<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.640> maybe<00:01:02.850> even

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
actually quite dark and maybe even

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.980 
actually quite dark and maybe even
gloomy<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.430> best<00:01:05.790> thing<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> can

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
gloomy but the best thing is that I can

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.770 
gloomy but the best thing is that I can
say<00:01:07.229> from<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> blocks<00:01:09.270> do

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
say from this is that all the blocks do

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.570 
say from this is that all the blocks do
resemble<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:10.860> meant<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.460> know

building<00:01:45.090> blocks<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> mean<00:01:46.170> by<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
building blocks you know I mean by the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.469 
building blocks you know I mean by the
menu<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> user<00:01:47.310> interface<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> has

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
menu the user interface so that has

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.050 
menu the user interface so that has
changed<00:01:48.720> color<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.079> little<00:01:49.229> bit<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.619> well<00:01:50.060> also

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
changed color a little bit as well also

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.920 
changed color a little bit as well also
if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> look<00:01:51.720> behind<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.189> menu<00:01:53.750> into<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
if you look behind the menu into the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.469 
if you look behind the menu into the
actual<00:01:55.290> game<00:01:55.490> then<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> sand

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
actual game then you can see the sand

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.889 
actual game then you can see the sand
and<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.350> sand<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.040> wavy<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.420> wavy

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
and the sand is wavy and this wavy

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.230 
and the sand is wavy and this wavy
pattern<00:02:01.290> really<00:02:01.890> reminds<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.939> pure

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
pattern really reminds me of the pure

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.389 
pattern really reminds me of the pure
Biddy<00:02:03.630> crafts<00:02:03.990> texture<00:02:04.829> pack<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
Biddy crafts texture pack because you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
Biddy crafts texture pack because you
know<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> wavy<00:02:06.509> pattern<00:02:06.780> in

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
know they kind of have a wavy pattern in

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.660 
know they kind of have a wavy pattern in
that<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.170> well<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> really<00:02:08.489> like

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
that as well but you know I really like

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.430 
that as well but you know I really like
that<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.660> look<00:02:09.899> into<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> distance

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that and if you look into the distance

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440 
that and if you look into the distance
the<00:02:10.800> water<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.580> roughly<00:02:12.180> this

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
the water is roughly this

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.270 
the water is roughly this
same<00:02:12.599> shade<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.110> blue<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:13.650> not<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.860> light<00:02:14.040> blue

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
same shade of blue it's not a light blue

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.979 
same shade of blue it's not a light blue
it's<00:02:14.459> not<00:02:14.520> darker<00:02:15.030> blue<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.690> roughly<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
it's not darker blue it's roughly the

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.990 
it's not darker blue it's roughly the
same<00:02:16.200> shade<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.620> blue<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.670> know<00:02:17.790> other

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
same shade of blue but you know other

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.580 
same shade of blue but you know other
than<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.239> all<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.840> blocks<00:02:19.050> look<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.379> same

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
than that all the blocks look the same

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.190 
than that all the blocks look the same
and<00:02:20.069> all<00:02:20.970> not<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.239> same<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.810> know<00:02:21.930> they

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
and all not the same but you know they

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.949 
and all not the same but you know they
re<00:02:22.379> textured<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.879> think<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.420> main<00:02:24.629> thing

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
re textured and I think the main thing

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.479 
re textured and I think the main thing
to<00:02:24.989> take<00:02:25.260> away<00:02:25.470> from<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.280> just

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
to take away from this is that it just

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.830 
to take away from this is that it just
it<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:26.670> looks<00:02:26.970> more<00:02:27.120> detailed<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.780> it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
it just looks more detailed and it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.870 
it just looks more detailed and it
really<00:02:28.050> really<00:02:28.650> reminds<00:02:29.190> me<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.670> John

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
really really reminds me of the John

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.150 
really really reminds me of the John
Smith<00:02:30.150> texture<00:02:30.569> pack<00:02:30.780> which<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.560> said<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.069> my

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
Smith texture pack which I said in my

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.940 
Smith texture pack which I said in my
speculation<00:02:32.760> video<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.780> know<00:02:33.959> again<00:02:34.319> I'd

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
speculation video so you know again I'd

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.680 
speculation video so you know again I'd
say<00:02:35.190> my<00:02:35.400> guesses<00:02:35.849> were<00:02:36.060> pretty<00:02:36.390> successful

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
say my guesses were pretty successful

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.589 
say my guesses were pretty successful
right<00:02:37.349> now<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.519> last<00:02:38.790> screen<00:02:38.970> shot<00:02:39.420> of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
of the nether and basically this

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.259 
of the nether and basically this
screenshot<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.170> showcases<00:02:46.980> what<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.640> ghast

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
will look like in the new natural

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.900 
will look like in the new natural
texture<00:02:50.760> pack<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.810> ghast<00:02:52.280> looks<00:02:53.280> really<00:02:53.670> sad

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910

texture pack the ghast looks really sad
you<00:02:54.239> know<00:02:54.360> he's<00:02:54.780> proper<00:02:55.140> crying<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.890> it's

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
just more detailed as you can see he's

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.400 
just more detailed as you can see he's

just more detailed really and it looks

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.970 
just more detailed really and it looks
more<00:03:03.239> realistic<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.170> mean<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.470> keep<00:03:04.680> using<00:03:04.829> that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
more realistic I mean I keep using that

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.039 
more realistic I mean I keep using that
word<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.910> know<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.090> looks<00:03:06.239> realistic<00:03:06.599> it's

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
word you know it looks realistic it's

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.100 
word you know it looks realistic it's
more<00:03:07.230> detailed<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.940> bricks<00:03:09.569> they<00:03:09.870> never

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
more detailed the bricks they never

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.509 
more detailed the bricks they never
bricks<00:03:10.440> they<00:03:10.680> look<00:03:10.860> very<00:03:11.099> nice<00:03:11.250> as<00:03:11.489> well

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
bricks they look very nice as well

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.030 
bricks they look very nice as well
they've<00:03:12.000> got<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.299> bit<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.599> shade<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.500> them<00:03:13.739> bit

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
they've got a bit of shade to them bit

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.729 
they've got a bit of shade to them bit
of<00:03:14.130> toning<00:03:14.610> rather<00:03:15.269> than<00:03:15.569> just<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.170> load<00:03:16.349> of<00:03:16.380> pix

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
of toning rather than just a load of pix

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.680 
of toning rather than just a load of pix
also<00:03:17.160> looks<00:03:17.370> less<00:03:17.609> let's<00:03:18.000> pixely<00:03:18.450> more

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
also looks less let's pixely more

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.620 
also looks less let's pixely more
detailed<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.850> yeah<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:20.970> just<00:03:21.150> looks<00:03:21.329> nicer

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
detailed and yeah it just looks nicer

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.990 
detailed and yeah it just looks nicer
looks<00:03:22.290> more<00:03:22.769> realistic<00:03:23.010> again<00:03:23.639> I'm<00:03:23.880> just

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
looks more realistic again I'm just

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.370 
looks more realistic again I'm just
using<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.329> same<00:03:24.510> words<00:03:24.750> over<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.079> over<00:03:25.290> again

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
using the same words over and over again

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.750 
using the same words over and over again
but<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.829> best<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.190> describe<00:03:26.400> it
