of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> features<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.570> light<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.250> firstly

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
of the features of this light is firstly

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.320 
of the features of this light is firstly
it<00:00:24.510> runs<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.960> three<00:00:25.230> Triple<00:00:25.619> A<00:00:25.710> batteries

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
it runs on three Triple A batteries

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.800 
it runs on three Triple A batteries
which<00:00:27.330> sits<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> back<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.060> will<00:00:30.510> run

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
which sits at the back and that will run

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.639 
which sits at the back and that will run
for<00:00:31.109> about<00:00:31.320> 50<00:00:31.710> hours<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:32.099> usage<00:00:33.260> it<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
for about 50 hours of usage it is a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.970 
for about 50 hours of usage it is a
hundred<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.340> eighty<00:00:35.640> lumens<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> very

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
hundred and eighty lumens so it's a very

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.090 
hundred and eighty lumens so it's a very
bright<00:00:38.250> light<00:00:38.760> now<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:40.020> light<00:00:40.350> things<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
bright light now that light things to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979 
bright light now that light things to
about<00:00:41.370> 80<00:00:41.670> metres<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.360> distance<00:00:42.780> which<00:00:42.960> is

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
about 80 metres in distance which is

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
about 80 metres in distance which is
quite<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> long<00:00:43.680> way<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.789> other<00:00:44.940> great

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
quite a long way and the other great

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.790 
quite a long way and the other great
thing<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.930> beam<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> hundred<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
thing is the beam is a hundred and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
thing is the beam is a hundred and
twenty<00:00:47.129> degrees<00:00:47.250> wide<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.360> lights<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
twenty degrees wide so it lights up a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.130 
twenty degrees wide so it lights up a
large<00:00:49.590> surface<00:00:49.890> area<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:51.510> light<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> water

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
large surface area this light is water

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
large surface area this light is water
resistant<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.460> you're<00:00:53.640> using<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.360> it's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
resistant so if you're using it and it's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
resistant so if you're using it and it's
raining<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> gets<00:00:55.440> wet<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
raining or it gets wet it's not going to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.760 
raining or it gets wet it's not going to
wreck<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> light<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.050> think<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> coolest

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
wreck the light but I think the coolest

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.939 
wreck the light but I think the coolest
feature<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> only

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
feature of all is that it is the only

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.549 
feature of all is that it is the only
hand<00:01:02.309> motion<00:01:02.820> sensored<00:01:03.510> light<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> world

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
hand motion sensored light in the world

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.530 
hand motion sensored light in the world
which<00:01:05.189> gives<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> ability<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.119> turn<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
which gives you the ability to turn it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
which gives you the ability to turn it
off<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.960> without<00:01:07.260> actually<00:01:07.950> having<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
off and on without actually having to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.539 
off and on without actually having to
press<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> button<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.290> let's<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.130> how<00:01:11.369> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
press the button so let's see how it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
talked before which was the sensor if

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.630 
talked before which was the sensor if
you<00:01:51.420> want<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> activate<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> sensor<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.920> just

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you want to activate the sensor you just

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
you want to activate the sensor you just
press<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.299> button<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> red
