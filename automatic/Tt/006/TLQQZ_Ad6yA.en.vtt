on the whole map that requires wall

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.719 
on the whole map that requires wall
running<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.460> gonna<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.700> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
running that's not really gonna be a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.550 
running that's not really gonna be a
factor<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.240> obviously<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
factor it's obviously going to be the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.920 
factor it's obviously going to be the
strategy<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.250> skill<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.240> team<00:01:39.390> works<00:01:39.689> I

made the crazy part is you see the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.999 
made the crazy part is you see the
hardpoint<00:01:41.939> yeah<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.320> no<00:01:43.409> longer<00:01:43.649> win

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
hardpoint yeah you can no longer win

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.800 
hardpoint yeah you can no longer win

I'm<00:04:50.520> getting<00:04:50.820> at<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.060> early<00:04:51.240> even<00:04:51.540> though

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
I'm getting at this early even though

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.390 
I'm getting at this early even though
it's<00:04:51.930> like<00:04:52.110> ninety-nine<00:04:52.800> percent<00:04:52.920> of<00:04:53.220> pervs

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
it's like ninety-nine percent of pervs

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.040 
it's like ninety-nine percent of pervs
still<00:04:53.730> what<00:04:53.850> percent<00:04:54.120> missing<00:04:54.360> that's<00:04:54.840> not

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
still what percent missing that's not

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.720 
still what percent missing that's not
that's<00:04:55.440> not<00:04:55.590> put<00:04:55.890> on<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.040> ps4<00:04:56.250> yet<00:04:56.550> cuz

percent<00:04:57.870> but<00:04:58.140> about<00:04:58.290> 99<00:04:58.620> per<00:04:58.710> second<00:04:58.950> part

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
percent but about 99 per second part

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.470 
percent but about 99 per second part
which<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.220> almost<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.550> same<00:04:59.640> thing<00:04:59.700> is<00:05:00.270> the

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480
