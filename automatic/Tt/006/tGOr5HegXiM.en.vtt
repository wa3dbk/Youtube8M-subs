00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
manager and no I think that Manchester

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.910 
manager and no I think that Manchester
United<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.830> Arsenal<00:00:14.389> draw<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.710> difficult<00:00:16.710> game

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
United and Arsenal draw a difficult game

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.630

and<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.310> maintain<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.760> top<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.270> list<00:00:19.640> with

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and we maintain the top of the list with

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.160 
and we maintain the top of the list with
one<00:00:20.910> game<00:00:21.150> less<00:00:21.650> on<00:00:22.730> Manchester<00:00:23.730> United<00:00:24.269> this

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
one game less on Manchester United this

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.310 
one game less on Manchester United this

dangerous for the title Arsenal is very
close<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.100> us<00:00:53.899> but<00:00:55.760> if<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.030> possible<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.809> have

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
close to us but if it's possible we have

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.920

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
Arsenal low with more point and then we

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.630

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.320 
think that is very dangerous team
because<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> lot<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> quality<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.330> lot

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
because they have a lot of quality a lot

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.399

of players with strong quality we have

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.760 
of players with strong quality we have
to<00:01:28.500> pay<00:01:28.650> attention<00:01:29.090> sometimes<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:31.530> things

enough<00:02:42.070> before<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.330> game<00:02:43.570> is<00:02:43.780> not<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:44.080> problem

enough before the game is not a problem

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.310 
enough before the game is not a problem
I<00:02:44.800> think<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.580> they<00:02:46.360> don't<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.020> drink

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
I think that they don't like to drink

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.770 
I think that they don't like to drink
wine<00:02:47.650> before<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> game<00:02:48.910> they<00:02:49.300> like<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.690> drink

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780

difficult to to train because the pitch

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.780 
difficult to to train because the pitch

week also we had a good atmosphere

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.080 
week also we had a good atmosphere
because<00:03:36.790> snow<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.160> good<00:03:39.310> atmosphere<00:03:39.489> when

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
because snow is a good atmosphere when

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.710 
because snow is a good atmosphere when
there<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.360> no<00:03:40.570> Sandra<00:03:41.350> is<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.620> good<00:03:41.800> team<00:03:42.010> with<00:03:42.430> a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
there is no Sandra is a good team with a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.009 
there is no Sandra is a good team with a
good<00:03:43.720> coach<00:03:43.959> we<00:03:44.560> did<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.769> fantastic<00:03:45.180> match<00:03:46.180> the

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
good coach we did a fantastic match the

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:53.840 
good coach we did a fantastic match the
last<00:03:48.000> when<00:03:49.000> we<00:03:49.150> played<00:03:49.540> away<00:03:52.350> against<00:03:53.350> them<00:03:53.530> I

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
last when we played away against them I

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.759 
last when we played away against them I
think<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.000> they<00:03:55.239> after<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.350> game<00:03:56.560> they

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
think that they after that game they

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.860 
think that they after that game they
improved<00:03:57.190> they<00:03:57.850> are<00:03:58.110> improve<00:03:59.110> and<00:04:00.600> will<00:04:01.600> be

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
improved they are improve and will be

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.460 
improved they are improve and will be
more<00:04:02.500> difficult<00:04:02.739> tomorrow<00:04:03.959> because<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:04.989> think

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
more difficult tomorrow because I think

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.130 
more difficult tomorrow because I think
that<00:04:06.150> are<00:04:07.739> more<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.799> more<00:04:09.250> compact<00:04:09.850> as<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.750> team

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
that are more a more compact as a team

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.979 
that are more a more compact as a team
they<00:04:11.950> put<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.280> lot<00:04:12.489> of<00:04:12.549> strong<00:04:13.360> pressure<00:04:13.660> in

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
they put a lot of strong pressure in

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.650 
they put a lot of strong pressure in
midfield<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:17.370> we<00:04:18.370> have<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.640> play<00:04:18.880> fast

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
midfield and we have to play fast

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.830 
midfield and we have to play fast
tomorrow<00:04:20.320> because<00:04:21.039> we<00:04:21.850> want<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.240> avoid<00:04:22.510> this

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
tomorrow because we want to avoid this

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.450
