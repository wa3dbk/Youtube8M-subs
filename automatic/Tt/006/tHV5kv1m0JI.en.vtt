hand does not change it stays the exact

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.240 
hand does not change it stays the exact
same<00:00:51.840> speed<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.070> take<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
same speed and you can just take the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.400 
same speed and you can just take the
right<00:00:53.460> hand<00:00:53.489> away<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.879> would<00:00:54.149> sound<00:00:54.420> exactly

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
right hand away and would sound exactly

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.540 
right hand away and would sound exactly
the<00:00:55.620> same<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:57.230> really<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the same so really that's one of one of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.349 
the same so really that's one of one of
the<00:00:59.870> real<00:01:00.870> keys<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.469> loose<00:01:01.649> plank<00:01:02.359> here's

blues has three if we're going to do in

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
blues has three if we're going to do in
the<00:01:22.080> key<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> C<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:22.979> translate

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the key of C here and you can translate

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.429 
the key of C here and you can translate
to<00:01:23.670> other<00:01:23.700> keys<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> key

to other keys if you want to but the key

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
to other keys if you want to but the key
of<00:01:25.560> C<00:01:25.799> we're<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.670> three<00:01:26.850> chords

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
of C we're going to have three chords

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
of C we're going to have three chords
we're<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.900> C<00:01:28.140> chord<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> M<00:01:28.680> more<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the G chord then we use and this is the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.539 
the G chord then we use and this is the
pattern<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.860> those<00:01:32.009> bass<00:01:32.250> lines<00:01:32.579> so

so<00:02:00.140> I'm<00:02:00.229> using<00:02:00.409> this<00:02:00.619> base<00:02:00.890> line<00:02:02.110> with<00:02:03.110> the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
so I'm using this base line with the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.680 
so I'm using this base line with the
left<00:02:03.229> for<00:02:04.450> same<00:02:06.189> pattern<00:02:07.189> there<00:02:07.399> now<00:02:07.939> for<00:02:08.630> the

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
left for same pattern there now for the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.660 
left for same pattern there now for the
number<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.110> all<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.470> do<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:09.769> take<00:02:10.220> this<00:02:10.369> one<00:02:10.580> an

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
number to all you do is take this one an

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:26.410 
number to all you do is take this one an
A<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:10.940> B<00:02:11.060> flat<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.720> then<00:02:11.840> next<00:02:12.050> time<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:26.000> put<00:02:26.330> up

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
A to B flat and then next time I put up

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.560 

okay<00:03:10.720> swing<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:12.190> uh<00:03:12.270> bumpin<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.360> where's

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
okay swing it but uh bumpin and where's

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.130 
okay swing it but uh bumpin and where's
the<00:03:13.600> gene<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.180> third<00:03:16.480> base<00:03:16.720> one<00:03:16.990> you

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
the gene that's the third base one you

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:34.540 
the gene that's the third base one you
can<00:03:17.290> use<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.530> fourth<00:03:17.830> baseline<00:03:18.370> is

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.110 

so<00:03:35.550> on<00:03:35.820> your<00:03:35.850> three<00:03:36.180> chords<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.570> just<00:03:37.100> pop<00:03:38.120> and

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
so on your three chords you just pop and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.670 
so on your three chords you just pop and
it's<00:03:39.270> kind<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.540> syncopated<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.350> makes<00:03:40.500> it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
it's kind of syncopated so it makes it

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.200 
it's kind of syncopated so it makes it
kind<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:40.950> difficult<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.490> get<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:41.790> right<00:03:42.000> hand

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
kind of difficult to get that right hand

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.150 
kind of difficult to get that right hand
in<00:03:42.420> there<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.720> keep<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.990> left<00:03:43.200> hand<00:03:43.440> straight

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
in there and keep the left hand straight

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:59.730 
in there and keep the left hand straight
now<00:03:45.150> fifth<00:03:45.690> one<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:47.100> can<00:03:47.250> do<00:03:47.310> this

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.640 

now<00:04:00.740> up<00:04:01.600> on<00:04:02.600> that<00:04:02.780> one<00:04:02.990> you<00:04:03.350> can<00:04:03.500> have<00:04:03.620> a

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
now up on that one you can have a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.350 
now up on that one you can have a
variation<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.400> can<00:04:04.430> put<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.760> scene<00:04:05.090> between

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
variation you can put a scene between

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.270 
variation you can put a scene between
egos

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
in there in between single single single

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.080 
in there in between single single single
