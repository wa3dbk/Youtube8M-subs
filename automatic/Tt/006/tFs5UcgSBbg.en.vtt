00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
pounds so that's a good thing actually I

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.270 
pounds so that's a good thing actually I
didn't<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.350> have

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
didn't think that I was going to have

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.810 
didn't think that I was going to have
lost<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.820> much<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.890> this<00:00:46.890> first<00:00:47.370> month

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
lost that much because this first month

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.170 
lost that much because this first month
for<00:00:48.120> me<00:00:48.300> has<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.829> been<00:00:50.070> about<00:00:50.899> just<00:00:53.180> taking

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
for me has really been about just taking

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.490 
for me has really been about just taking
some<00:00:54.539> assessments<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:56.460> habits<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.500> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
some assessments of my habits and of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.869 
some assessments of my habits and of
activities<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> things<00:01:01.609> recognizing<00:01:02.609> where

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
activities and things recognizing where

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.990 
activities and things recognizing where
some<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> my<00:01:03.300> weaknesses<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:04.580> in<00:01:05.580> some<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
some of my weaknesses are in some of the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
some of my weaknesses are in some of the
areas<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.659> need<00:01:06.869> improvement<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
areas that I need improvement on so I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.219 
areas that I need improvement on so I
really<00:01:09.390> haven't<00:01:09.630> done<00:01:09.869> very<00:01:10.530> much<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> much<00:01:15.229> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
really haven't done very much so much I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.640 
really haven't done very much so much I
haven't<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:17.009> gone<00:01:17.189> gungho<00:01:17.700> yet<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:19.380> this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
haven't really gone gungho yet with this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.240 
haven't really gone gungho yet with this
I'd<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:19.979> started<00:01:20.700> walking<00:01:21.240> some<00:01:21.509> more<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I'd have started walking some more so I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.120 
I'd have started walking some more so I
have<00:01:23.610> been<00:01:23.909> working<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:25.130> periodically

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
have been working on that periodically

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.450 
have been working on that periodically
throughout<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> weeks<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.799> I've<00:01:28.799> cut<00:01:29.130> back

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
on the amount of soda that drink instead

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.510 
on the amount of soda that drink instead
of<00:01:32.700> drinking<00:01:33.680> regular<00:01:34.680> soda<00:01:35.070> I've<00:01:35.369> been

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
of drinking regular soda I've been

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.390 
of drinking regular soda I've been
drinking<00:01:35.700> diet<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:37.500> course<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> next<00:01:38.220> goal

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
drinking diet of course the next goal

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.550 
drinking diet of course the next goal
will<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.000> eliminate<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.990> subjects

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
will be to eliminate the subjects

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.090 
will be to eliminate the subjects
completely<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:43.200> give<00:01:43.350> me<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> little<00:01:43.680> more

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
completely but give me a little more

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.330 
completely but give me a little more
time<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
time on that and I will that is one of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.649 
time on that and I will that is one of
the<00:01:47.399> goals<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.850> i<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.409> i've<00:01:49.409> also<00:01:49.590> been

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
the goals that i have i've also been

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.910 
the goals that i have i've also been
trying<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:53.060> watch<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.479> portion<00:01:55.049> intake<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
trying to watch my portion intake and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
trying to watch my portion intake and
eat<00:01:56.430> more<00:01:56.640> fruits<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.820> has<00:02:00.090> probably

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
eat more fruits so that has probably

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.319 
eat more fruits so that has probably
been<00:02:01.259> some<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.860> has<00:02:01.979> helped<00:02:02.460> me<00:02:03.030> at<00:02:03.119> least

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
been some of what has helped me at least

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.740 
been some of what has helped me at least
drop<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.780> first<00:02:04.049> nine

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
drop the first nine

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.130 
drop the first nine
so<00:02:05.740> I'm<00:02:06.070> kind<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.370> excited<00:02:06.640> about<00:02:07.030> this<00:02:07.720> just

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
so I'm kind of excited about this just

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.980 
so I'm kind of excited about this just
for<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.440> fact<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.740> i<00:02:08.860> have<00:02:09.100> lost<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:10.420> little

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
for the fact that i have lost a little

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.870 
for the fact that i have lost a little
bit<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.170> weight<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.740> this<00:02:12.400> just<00:02:12.640> goes<00:02:12.850> to

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
bit of weight and this just goes to

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.390 
bit of weight and this just goes to
prove<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.630> without<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:14.200> really<00:02:14.650> even<00:02:14.830> trying

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
prove it without we really even trying

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.200 
prove it without we really even trying
very<00:02:15.850> hard<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.600> yet<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.970> I've<00:02:19.090> already

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
very hard just yet that I've already

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.570 
very hard just yet that I've already
lost<00:02:19.450> nine<00:02:19.750> pounds<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.650> do<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.830> you

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
lost nine pounds so if I can do it you

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.020
