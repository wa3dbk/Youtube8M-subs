atmosphere this shape of wave is often
formed<00:00:28.529> by<00:00:28.619> something<00:00:28.830> called<00:00:29.070> a

different speeds or densities for
example<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.059> clouds<00:00:36.390> yes<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.820> one<00:00:38.820> layer

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
example in clouds yes you have one layer

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.750 
example in clouds yes you have one layer
where<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> cloud<00:00:40.050> ok<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.219> then

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
where there is a cloud ok and then

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.569 
where there is a cloud ok and then
higher<00:00:42.570> layer<00:00:42.899> where<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> jet<00:00:44.250> stream

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
higher layer where you have a jet stream

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.549 
higher layer where you have a jet stream
so<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> boundary<00:00:45.899> between<00:00:46.079> these<00:00:46.379> two

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
so with the boundary between these two

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.220 
so with the boundary between these two
regions<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.640> start<00:00:47.969> seeing<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.989> cloud

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
regions you start seeing this cloud

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.260 
regions you start seeing this cloud
rolling<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.340> look<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.579> water<00:00:50.879> waves

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
rolling up if you look at water waves

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
rolling up if you look at water waves
the<00:00:51.690> wind<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.199> sort<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.680> cause<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.370> roll

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the wind will sort of cause it to roll

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.970 
the wind will sort of cause it to roll
up<00:00:53.760> into<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> bigger<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.780> bigger<00:00:54.930> wave<00:00:55.230> but

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
up into a bigger and bigger wave but

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.310 
up into a bigger and bigger wave but
eventually<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.879> way<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.300> break<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
eventually this way will break this is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
eventually this way will break this is
very<00:00:58.530> similar<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> chemical<00:00:59.879> stability

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
very similar to the chemical stability

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.959

that takes place on the Sun where we

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.240 
that takes place on the Sun where we
have<00:01:03.180> erupting<00:01:03.840> plasma<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.129> have

have erupting plasma and we have

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.789 
have erupting plasma and we have
