00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.519
 when week 48 did you get yours tuned we knot it into play a 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.859
 blues girl all that is more classic in second position of 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.009
 driving on the time of a few hours 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.739
 and only accompanied 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.119
 m it will be set to 50 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.929
 so I played this flu with first of all added effects like 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.699
 talking 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.469
 and then I then played the flu by isolating that everyone can be followed 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.300
 soon to be 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.250
 and it's measuring the accounts before you start on the fourth beat of the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.350
 second measure 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.740
 possession of the tempo is complicated to follow the area correctly 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.110
 so it's gone 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.110
 on the theme like second 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 at 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 in Japan 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.549
 as always accompanied by a ball 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.549
 but this time in the clear 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.379
 3 practice you will be able to stomp at the same time as putting forward is 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.939
 50% 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.349
 and that this tablet above and then then you can replay cb like these 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.529
 sites joan their days one last time with a room 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.179
 I start on the 4th beat 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.849
 no 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.849
 no 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.989
 nothing but 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:20.039
 music of course but not less than 48 that of its water flow
