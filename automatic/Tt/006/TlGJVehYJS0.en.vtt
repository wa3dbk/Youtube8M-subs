00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.010
 since I was little, I've always been 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.700
 passionate in the years I grew up 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.139
 with 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.000
 it's true that for me it was 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.340
 obvious that my work is related 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.900
 with friends having managed to make my 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.880
 passion my job I think it's great 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 I spend my day drawing the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.670
 animals of people who ask me 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.400
 when group x 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.529
 this is the first tank that I took two 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.420
 I'm at my parents' house then fell 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 on this little ball of apricot hair 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.019
 and today we really have a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.600
 reaction I think that's enough I call it 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.699
 he comes to talk to him he answers I took 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.229
 another cat a long time ago that you 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.710
 also parakeets 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:45.299
 I have surprisingly dogs these guys ya 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.220
 there more independent who is the most 

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:50.720
 close to the dogs sewage fixed by cons 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.720
 he is close to the man that two dogs 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.510
 I always had animals in my life 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.650
 annoying cats I never had 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.900
 dog so when I left home 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.610
 my parents touched caught a dog or 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.080
 frisbee take me my dog ​​who has a 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.710
 sacred character but that's what makes 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.840
 His charm 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.630
 and a year ago came so free in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.159
 axon tube to the little brother who brings costs 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 especially now so both 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.729
 get along really well since forever 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.020
 and they are always in the process of 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.759
 play shopping chases 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.710
 especially in the evening we go to bed because 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.820
 that it's too cool actually these two 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.170
 goal pots so these are both 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 always stuck to us so I'm 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.679
 very fusional with my animals they 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.420
 occupy an immense place we would see 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.350
 not our license 2 and that's all 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.350
 the love I give them 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.350
 socrates i believe i will remember 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.670
 always the first time I have them 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.710
 seen and I went on a walk with 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.390
 the chain of my brother he came and he 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.310
 did not ask for more and yet he 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.390
 was skeletal but he was there with 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.100
 someone he was happy 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.500
 however, what happened is that 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.940
 Socrates is a hyperactive dog and that's 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 like that I started reading some 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.450
 books interest me in behavior 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.610
 canine and I wanted to always know 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.280
 more if I was a moment in my life where 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.510
 my pool I liked I could really 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.610
 wanted to do something else but what 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.530
 I have a psychological course at the base so 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.470
 I did a baby educator 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.480
 canine and then ferrari arrival and mithaq 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.700
 happened and once the bp ben I 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.510
 I started my account 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.340
 Socrates 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.780
 he changed my life that figure the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.160
 relationship with a dog it's first 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.260
 create a relationship of trust 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.490
 in fact often to take the 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.380
 things they know what are we going to do 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.740
 even before we are conscious 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.740
 can do it 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.440
 therefore b boy is one of our survivor 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.420
 massacre of romania and he was saved 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.920
 via the mocking association of his wife 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.690
 practically a year he was coming to 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.980
 me at first it was complicated there 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.170
 had me who could approach him and 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.460
 then mysteries and under the sofa there 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.410
 wanted to move more famous parents they 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.820
 have taken months to be able to approach 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.320
 it's a tool that really has it 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.790
 help to adapt in fact they are 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.050
 totally different both but they 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.490
 they complement so dumb 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.620
 are mutually assisted to be able to 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.240
 live in harmony here then a bone that goes 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.310
 to arrive in 2014 then the same is a 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.510
 second rescue via the association new 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.560
 kids it took us as a family 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.910

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.510
