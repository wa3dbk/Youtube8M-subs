from planting that little tiny seed

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.920 
from planting that little tiny seed
until<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:19.980> have<00:00:20.190> a<00:00:20.220> finished<00:00:20.850> equal<00:00:21.510> pet<00:00:21.690> game

seeds<00:00:26.160> grow<00:00:26.640> into<00:00:27.210> their<00:00:27.360> long<00:00:27.540> vines<00:00:27.900> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
seeds grow into their long vines and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.740 
seeds grow into their long vines and
during<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.430> process<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.540> watch

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
during that process we have to watch

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.810 
during that process we have to watch
them<00:00:31.110> for<00:00:31.470> buds<00:00:31.770> and<00:00:32.279> things<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.610> might

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
them for buds and things that might

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.600 
them for buds and things that might
attack<00:00:33.150> them<00:00:33.650> and<00:00:34.650> get<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> leaves<00:00:35.160> damaged

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
attack them and get the leaves damaged

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.710 
attack them and get the leaves damaged
the<00:00:35.790> stems<00:00:36.150> eat<00:00:36.930> those<00:00:37.230> seeds<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.770> stinger<00:00:38.250> but

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
the stems eat those seeds or stinger but

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.810 
the stems eat those seeds or stinger but
baby<00:00:39.720> gourds<00:00:40.290> sting<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> baby<00:00:40.860> gourd<00:00:41.220> they

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
baby gourds sting the baby gourd they

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.210 
baby gourds sting the baby gourd they
have<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.300> fuzzy<00:00:43.020> down<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.680> them<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:43.950> if

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
have a little fuzzy down on them and if

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.520 
have a little fuzzy down on them and if
that<00:00:44.370> gets<00:00:44.550> damaged<00:00:45.150> then<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.050> equal<00:00:46.379> will

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that gets damaged then the equal will

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.030 
that gets damaged then the equal will
rot<00:00:46.770> before<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.400> it<00:00:47.520> even<00:00:47.760> grows<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
rot before it it even grows up so the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.790 
rot before it it even grows up so the
plants<00:00:50.400> must<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.790> carefully<00:00:51.240> tended<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:52.050> then

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
plants must be carefully tended and then

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.780 
plants must be carefully tended and then
when<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.820> grow<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.560> build<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> trellis<00:00:56.100> so

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
when they grow we we build a trellis so

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.210 
when they grow we we build a trellis so
that<00:00:57.030> they<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.720> nice<00:00:57.960> shape<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.010> that

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
that they have a nice shape so that

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.040 
that they have a nice shape so that
people<00:00:59.790> are<00:00:59.970> watched<00:01:00.210> carefully<00:01:00.540> through

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
people are watched carefully through

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
people are watched carefully through
their<00:01:01.140> whole<00:01:01.320> growing<00:01:01.560> cycles<00:01:02.130> disease<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
their whole growing cycles disease and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.560 
their whole growing cycles disease and
then<00:01:03.540> but<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.259> time<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> harvest<00:01:04.920> them<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:06.420> we

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
then but it's time to harvest them if we

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
then but it's time to harvest them if we
want<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> make<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> equal<00:01:07.440> puppet<00:01:07.890> hey

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
want to make it equal puppet hey

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.180 
want to make it equal puppet hey
decorated<00:01:09.030> where<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.690> skin<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.960> carved<00:01:10.560> at

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
decorated where the skin is carved at

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.950 
decorated where the skin is carved at
that<00:01:11.399> point<00:01:11.759> we<00:01:12.000> carve<00:01:12.300> them<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> then

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that point we carve them and then

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480 
that point we carve them and then
they're<00:01:13.110> soaked<00:01:13.410> in<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> load

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
they're soaked in the load

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.859 
they're soaked in the load
the<00:01:14.880> taro<00:01:15.150> patch<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.920> if<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.210> don't<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the taro patch and if we don't want to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.550 
the taro patch and if we don't want to
decorate<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
decorate it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.330 
decorate it
then<00:01:20.360> we

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
then we

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.660 
then we
and<00:01:22.610> dry<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:22.939> out<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:24.110> takes<00:01:24.409> some<00:01:24.619> time<00:01:24.920> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
and dry it out that takes some time the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.139 
and dry it out that takes some time the
inside<00:01:26.149> is<00:01:26.479> carefully<00:01:27.079> polished<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:28.880> it

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
inside is carefully polished so that it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.550 
inside is carefully polished so that it
will<00:01:29.299> be<00:01:29.450> smooth<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.140> give<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.350> best

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
will be smooth and give the best

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.800 
will be smooth and give the best
possible<00:01:31.070> tone<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:32.600> will<00:01:32.659> be

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
possible tone and so that it will be

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.520 
possible tone and so that it will be
beautiful

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
beautiful

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.370 
beautiful
and<00:01:33.860> feel<00:01:34.039> nice<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.549> handle<00:01:34.789> we<00:01:35.780> polish<00:01:36.049> the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
and feel nice to handle we polish the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.270 
and feel nice to handle we polish the
outside<00:01:36.979> by<00:01:37.640> tan<00:01:37.939> we<00:01:38.570> only<00:01:38.750> use<00:01:39.049> natural<00:01:39.350> oils

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
outside by tan we only use natural oils

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.300 
outside by tan we only use natural oils
such<00:01:40.549> as<00:01:40.580> coconut<00:01:40.729> or<00:01:41.509> Kukui<00:01:42.020> on<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.799> outside

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
such as coconut or Kukui on the outside

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.840 
such as coconut or Kukui on the outside
of<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.729> equal<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.619> then<00:01:45.619> we<00:01:46.399> join<00:01:46.670> them

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
of the equal and then we join them

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.100 
of the equal and then we join them
together<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:48.470> I've<00:01:49.280> developed<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.390> putty<00:01:50.659> that

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
together the I've developed a putty that

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.710 
together the I've developed a putty that
I<00:01:51.140> like<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:51.799> think<00:01:52.130> every<00:01:52.640> person<00:01:53.420> who<00:01:53.539> makes

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
I like I think every person who makes

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.169 
I like I think every person who makes
equal<00:01:54.110> Heke<00:01:54.440> has<00:01:54.649> their<00:01:54.890> own<00:01:54.920> special<00:01:55.490> formula

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
equal Heke has their own special formula

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.559 
equal Heke has their own special formula
but<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.110> feel<00:01:57.440> that<00:01:57.709> mine<00:01:57.950> has<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.759> similar

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
but I feel that mine has a similar

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.639 
but I feel that mine has a similar
texture<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.500> strength<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.450> equal<00:02:03.140> itself

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
texture and strength to the equal itself

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.100 
texture and strength to the equal itself
and<00:02:04.039> so<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.640> don't<00:02:04.880> get<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.090> crap<00:02:05.420> line<00:02:05.720> from

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
and so you don't get a crap line from

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.020 
and so you don't get a crap line from
having<00:02:06.500> an<00:02:06.619> epoxy<00:02:06.979> resin<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:07.670> might<00:02:07.819> be<00:02:08.000> a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
having an epoxy resin it might be a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.690 
having an epoxy resin it might be a
little<00:02:08.239> too<00:02:08.509> hard<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:10.190> doesn't<00:02:10.549> sound

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
little too hard and it doesn't sound

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.660 
little too hard and it doesn't sound
mushy<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.450> some<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.840> this

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
mushy like some of this

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
mushy like some of this
after<00:02:14.450> both<00:02:14.830> might<00:02:15.830> sound<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.700> little<00:02:17.240> on<00:02:17.540> the
