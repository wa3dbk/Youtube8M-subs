00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
you paint this thicker paint like this

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.490 
you paint this thicker paint like this
instead<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.190> using<00:01:52.640> your<00:01:52.970> brushes<00:01:53.510> you<00:01:54.290> have<00:01:54.470> a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
tendency to pull away and the thick pain

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.280 
tendency to pull away and the thick pain
babies<00:01:57.760> really<00:01:58.760> ugly<00:01:59.210> like<00:01:59.840> if<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.080> put<00:02:00.260> your

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
babies really ugly like if you put your

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.870 
babies really ugly like if you put your
toothbrush<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.520> pull<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.030> away<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:03.880> so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
toothbrush on it and pull it away and so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.280 
toothbrush on it and pull it away and so
you<00:02:04.940> don't<00:02:05.120> want<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.479> do<00:02:05.659> that<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:06.080> want<00:02:06.260> to

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
you don't want to do that you want to

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.559 
you don't want to do that you want to
kind<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.590> make<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:06.830> look<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.549> little<00:02:08.360> bit

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.610 
kind of make it look a little bit
smoother<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.099> can<00:02:10.360> stroke<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.720> then<00:02:12.349> your

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
smoother so you can stroke and then your

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.350 
smoother so you can stroke and then your

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
to a stroke it comes to nice and smooth

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.150 
to a stroke it comes to nice and smooth
and<00:02:17.540> then<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.380> it's<00:02:18.530> when<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:18.890> lift

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160

I'm<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:21.800> painting<00:02:22.070> on<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.460> side<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:23.450> this

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.030 
I'm just painting on the side on this
side<00:02:24.470> this<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.430> then<00:02:25.610> back<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:26.420> way<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:28.010> I

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
side this and then back this way so I

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.860 
side this and then back this way so I
really<00:02:28.370> could<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.760> could<00:02:29.000> put<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.300> pain<00:02:29.570> either

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
really could I could put the pain either

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.860 
really could I could put the pain either
on<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.380> side<00:02:30.650> over<00:02:30.950> on<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.250> bottom<00:02:31.610> side<00:02:31.880> so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
on this side over on the bottom side so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.370 
on this side over on the bottom side so
I'm<00:02:32.990> just<00:02:33.200> going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:34.030> paint<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.080> just

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
I'm just going to paint this and just

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.590 
I'm just going to paint this and just
kind<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.800> fill<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.370> in<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.090> no

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
kind of fill that in just like that no

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.110 
kind of fill that in just like that no
so<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:39.050> thinking<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.500> thinner<00:02:39.770> i<00:02:39.910> went<00:02:40.910> to

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
so I just thinking the thinner i went to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.930 
so I just thinking the thinner i went to
the<00:02:41.150> point<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> knife
