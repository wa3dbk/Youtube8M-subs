now<00:00:17.670> we've<00:00:17.820> got<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> whole<00:00:18.300> range<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:19.100> 3d<00:00:20.100> assets

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
now we've got a whole range of 3d assets

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.519 
now we've got a whole range of 3d assets
here<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.029> don't<00:00:21.779> if<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:21.960> see<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.439> we

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
here but don't if you can see but we

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.439 
here but don't if you can see but we
can't<00:00:22.710> from<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:22.980> angle<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.460> these<00:00:23.730> two<00:00:24.090> are

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
can't from this angle that these two are

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.420 
can't from this angle that these two are
a<00:00:24.510> little<00:00:24.689> unusual<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.410> tip<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.859> you

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
a little unusual if I tip them up you

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.019 
a little unusual if I tip them up you
can<00:00:26.580> see<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.390> both<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> them<00:00:28.609> have<00:00:29.609> got<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
can see that both of them have got a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.900 
can see that both of them have got a
super<00:00:30.539> big<00:00:30.830> hatch<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.219> back<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.730> is

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
super big hatch on the back and that is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.380 
super big hatch on the back and that is
to<00:00:33.090> house<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.829> Mugen<00:00:34.829> battery<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.180> going

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to house a Mugen battery that is going

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
to house a Mugen battery that is going
to<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.690> triple<00:00:37.260> maybe<00:00:37.440> quadruple<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
to I think triple maybe quadruple the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.510 
to I think triple maybe quadruple the
battery<00:00:38.700> life<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.840> devices<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:41.250> does

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
battery life of these devices so it does

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.549 
battery life of these devices so it does
make<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> bit<00:00:42.000> more<00:00:42.030> unwieldy<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.379> new

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
make it a bit more unwieldy the new

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.310 
make it a bit more unwieldy the new
freely<00:00:43.860> S<00:00:43.980> version<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.820> they're

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
freely S version you can see they're

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.430 
freely S version you can see they're
whipping<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.530> standard<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:48.230> you've<00:00:49.230> got<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
whipping up a standard one you've got a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340 
whipping up a standard one you've got a
lot<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> extra<00:00:50.070> protrusion<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:52.050> color

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
lot of extra protrusion the color

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.490 
lot of extra protrusion the color
matching<00:00:52.860> isn't<00:00:53.430> perfect<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.930> this

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
matching isn't perfect on this on this

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.959 
matching isn't perfect on this on this
version<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> moving<00:00:56.370> battery<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
version of the moving battery and the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.080 
version of the moving battery and the
hatch<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.770> quite<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.789> fact<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
hatch here so I quite like the fact that

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.720 
hatch here so I quite like the fact that
their<00:01:00.270> previous<00:01:00.920> colors<00:01:01.920> were<00:01:02.039> at<00:01:02.219> an<00:01:02.309> exact

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
their previous colors were at an exact

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
their previous colors were at an exact
match<00:01:03.030> whereas<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> white<00:01:04.559> isn't

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
match whereas here the white isn't

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.539 
match whereas here the white isn't
spot-on<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.630> does<00:01:06.810> make<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.229> heavy

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
spot-on and it does make it more heavy

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.140 
spot-on and it does make it more heavy
but<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.630> extra<00:01:09.900> battery<00:01:10.260> life<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.150> know

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
but for that extra battery life you know

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.550 
but for that extra battery life you know
it's<00:01:12.299> still<00:01:12.450> usable<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.960> still<00:01:13.170> feels<00:01:13.380> nice

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it's still usable it still feels nice

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
it's still usable it still feels nice
and<00:01:13.740> portable<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.369> you've<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.360> massive

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and portable and you've got that massive

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.570 
and portable and you've got that massive
battery<00:01:16.049> whose<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.799> last<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.310> lot<00:01:17.520> longer

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
battery whose going to last a lot longer

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.660 
battery whose going to last a lot longer
you<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> same<00:01:19.350> product<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.220> equivalent

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you have the same product the equivalent

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.950 
you have the same product the equivalent
products<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.810> new<00:01:22.560> 3ds<00:01:23.280> XL<00:01:26.150> again<00:01:27.150> makes

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
products on the new 3ds XL again makes

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
products on the new 3ds XL again makes
it<00:01:28.080> really<00:01:28.320> chunky<00:01:28.650> quite<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.579> actually

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it really chunky quite like it actually

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.240 
it really chunky quite like it actually
on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.420> XL<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.530> match<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.040> color

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
on the XL and they match the color

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.420 
on the XL and they match the color
matching<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.930> much<00:01:33.930> nicer<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.979> XL<00:01:35.250> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
matching is much nicer on the XL that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.520 
matching is much nicer on the XL that
same<00:01:35.729> shiny<00:01:36.799> smooth<00:01:37.799> Sheen<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.930> looks<00:01:43.200> like

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
same shiny smooth Sheen so it looks like

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
same shiny smooth Sheen so it looks like
it's<00:01:43.770> part<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> device<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.729> has<00:01:45.180> been

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
it's part of the device that has been

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.010 
it's part of the device that has been
bought<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.950> hand<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:48.329> doesn't<00:01:48.540> sort<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
bought in the hand it doesn't sort of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.980 
bought in the hand it doesn't sort of
affect<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> quite<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.799> much<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> thing<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
affect it quite as much a thing as the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.300 
affect it quite as much a thing as the
smaller<00:01:51.990> new<00:01:52.409> food<00:01:52.649> yes<00:01:52.829> because<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.189> is

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
smaller new food yes because this is

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.700 
smaller new food yes because this is
already<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.549> big<00:01:53.759> unit<00:01:54.060> anyway<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.079> you're<00:01:55.590> not

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
already a big unit anyway so you're not

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.560 
already a big unit anyway so you're not
losing<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.820> also<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.119> quite<00:01:57.420> like

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
losing so much and also I quite like

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.690 
losing so much and also I quite like
there's<00:01:57.750> been<00:01:57.869> some<00:01:57.930> design<00:01:58.700> improvements

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
there's been some design improvements

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.969 
there's been some design improvements
previously<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.540> had<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> same<00:02:01.140> Mugen<00:02:01.530> battery

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
previously we had the same Mugen battery

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.480 
previously we had the same Mugen battery
for<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.049> original<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.920> yes

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
for the original for yes

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.359 
for the original for yes
which<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.360> nice<00:02:06.840> again<00:02:07.380> gave<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.100> massive

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
which was nice again gave you a massive

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.249 
which was nice again gave you a massive
battery<00:02:08.520> life<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.330> had<00:02:09.450> quite<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.660> hard<00:02:09.959> edge

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
battery life but had quite a hard edge

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.720 
battery life but had quite a hard edge
here<00:02:10.740> if<00:02:11.100> you<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> look<00:02:11.640> at<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.900> new<00:02:13.730> VDS

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
here if you have a look at the new VDS

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.730 
here if you have a look at the new VDS
version<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.120> our<00:02:15.209> moving<00:02:15.390> battery<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.560> it's

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
version of our moving battery and it's

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.800 
version of our moving battery and it's
got<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> camphor<00:02:17.630> much<00:02:19.160> more<00:02:20.160> beveled<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:21.090> so

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
got a camphor much more beveled here so

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.280 
got a camphor much more beveled here so
that<00:02:21.959> means<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.650> hand<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:24.540> feels<00:02:24.870> it

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
that means that in the hand it feels it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.290 
that means that in the hand it feels it
feels<00:02:25.319> much<00:02:25.590> nicer<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.430> see<00:02:26.670> your

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
feels much nicer so you can see your

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.960 
feels much nicer so you can see your
fingers<00:02:27.630> sort<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.840> wrap<00:02:28.440> around<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.950> now<00:02:29.850> it's

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
fingers sort of wrap around it now it's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.190 
fingers sort of wrap around it now it's
obviously<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.300> be<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.420> trade<00:02:30.660> off<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:30.959> isn't

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
obviously to be a trade off this isn't

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.360 
obviously to be a trade off this isn't
going<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.380> be<00:02:31.440> there's<00:02:31.650> something<00:02:31.890> for

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
going to be there's something for

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.390 
going to be there's something for
everyone<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:33.290> just<00:02:34.290> compared<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.280> can

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
everyone I just compared this you can

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.360 
everyone I just compared this you can
see<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.760> difference<00:02:36.120> between<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:37.050> original

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
see the difference between the original

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.820 
see the difference between the original
3ds<00:02:38.370> XL<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.150> nucleus<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.870> XL<00:02:40.410> with<00:02:40.650> that

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
3ds XL and the nucleus and XL with that

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.220 
3ds XL and the nucleus and XL with that
big<00:02:41.010> battery<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.510> course<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.989> main<00:02:43.200> thing

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
big battery but of course the main thing

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.620 
big battery but of course the main thing
the<00:02:43.860> big<00:02:44.310> difference<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.880> battery<00:02:45.330> life<00:02:45.510> and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
the big difference is battery life and

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.500 
the big difference is battery life and
we<00:02:45.750> want<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.019> know<00:02:46.200> how<00:02:46.860> how<00:02:47.730> different<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
we want to know how how different the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.890 
we want to know how how different the
battery<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.050> with<00:02:49.560> these<00:02:49.830> extra<00:02:50.730> super<00:02:51.150> Mugen

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900

battery is with these extra super Mugen
batteries<00:02:52.320> plugged<00:02:52.800> in<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.519> we've<00:02:53.730> got<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.330> of

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
batteries plugged in so we've got one of

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.840 
batteries plugged in so we've got one of
each<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.230> food<00:02:55.890> yetis<00:02:56.220> we've<00:02:56.310> got<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> 2d<00:02:56.760> s

it's<00:03:10.290> going<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.470> be<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> Mougins<00:03:11.010> but<00:03:11.610> how

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
it's going to be the Mougins but how

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.150 
it's going to be the Mougins but how

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
much longer do you get so as we start

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.710 
much longer do you get so as we start
this<00:03:14.280> time-lapse<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:15.030> clock<00:03:15.209> powering

battery out and the capacity here we can

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.840 
battery out and the capacity here we can
see<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:34.040> 1750<00:04:35.750> milliamps<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:38.550> we're<00:04:38.670> going<00:04:38.790> to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
see is 1750 milliamps and we're going to

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.450 
see is 1750 milliamps and we're going to
be<00:04:38.910> replacing<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:40.490> with<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.520> battery<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:43.020> is

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
be replacing it with a battery that is

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.160 
be replacing it with a battery that is
way<00:04:44.460> way<00:04:45.000> bigger<00:04:45.260> 6<00:04:46.260> 250<00:04:47.250> milliamps<00:04:47.730> and<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:49.050> do

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
way way bigger 6 250 milliamps and to do

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.750 
way way bigger 6 250 milliamps and to do
that<00:04:49.370> we<00:04:50.370> just<00:04:50.750> slot<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:52.490> it's<00:04:53.490> useful<00:04:53.730> to

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
that we just slot it in it's useful to

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.130 
that we just slot it in it's useful to
have<00:04:53.910> taken<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.300> pen<00:04:54.480> out<00:04:54.510> first<00:04:54.960> because

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
have taken the pen out first because

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.700 
have taken the pen out first because
obviously<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:57.300> cover<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:58.110> needs<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.440> go<00:04:58.560> over

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
obviously the cover it needs to go over

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.880 
obviously the cover it needs to go over
that<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.270> then<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:00.960> just<00:05:01.260> clips<00:05:01.530> over<00:05:01.680> the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
that and then this just clips over the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.580 
that and then this just clips over the
top<00:05:04.820> has<00:05:05.820> two<00:05:06.030> screws<00:05:06.360> screws<00:05:07.200> here<00:05:07.320> which<00:05:07.470> you

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
top has two screws screws here which you

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.020 
top has two screws screws here which you
can<00:05:08.330> fix<00:05:09.919> but<00:05:10.919> actually<00:05:11.280> you<00:05:11.640> know<00:05:11.700> once<00:05:11.880> it's

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
can fix but actually you know once it's

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.750 
can fix but actually you know once it's
clicked<00:05:12.270> on<00:05:12.860> this<00:05:13.860> plastic<00:05:14.100> it's<00:05:14.550> going<00:05:14.700> to

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
clicked on this plastic it's going to

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.149 
clicked on this plastic it's going to
stay<00:05:14.910> on<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.950> ready<00:05:16.950> to<00:05:17.250> be<00:05:17.850> used

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.939 

so<00:05:20.789> that<00:05:21.029> the<00:05:21.179> extra<00:05:21.779> super<00:05:22.020> big<00:05:22.139> moon<00:05:22.469> battery

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
so that the extra super big moon battery

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.790 
so that the extra super big moon battery
to<00:05:23.249> the<00:05:23.369> new<00:05:23.610> foo<00:05:24.239> yes<00:05:24.479> you<00:05:25.110> need<00:05:25.199> to<00:05:25.439> take<00:05:25.619> the

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
to the new foo yes you need to take the

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.529 
to the new foo yes you need to take the
vehicle<00:05:26.069> off<00:05:26.459> as<00:05:26.669> we've<00:05:26.969> done<00:05:27.179> here<00:05:27.239> the

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
vehicle off as we've done here the

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.869 
vehicle off as we've done here the
battery<00:05:28.050> here<00:05:28.229> just<00:05:29.009> pops<00:05:29.249> out<00:05:29.459> and<00:05:29.669> you<00:05:29.729> can

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:29.879 
battery here just pops out and you can

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.820 
battery here just pops out and you can
see<00:05:30.089> that<00:05:30.239> this<00:05:30.360> battery<00:05:30.619> that<00:05:31.619> we<00:05:31.739> were

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
see that this battery that we were

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.529 
see that this battery that we were
placing<00:05:32.069> is<00:05:32.459> only<00:05:33.619> 1400<00:05:34.619> milliamps<00:05:35.519> and<00:05:36.179> we're

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
placing is only 1400 milliamps and we're

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.509 
placing is only 1400 milliamps and we're
going<00:05:36.659> to<00:05:36.689> be<00:05:36.779> putting<00:05:37.080> in<00:05:37.289> the<00:05:37.769> Mugen<00:05:38.099> battery

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:38.519 
going to be putting in the Mugen battery

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:43.429 
going to be putting in the Mugen battery
which<00:05:38.759> is<00:05:40.639> 5,000<00:05:41.639> milliamps<00:05:42.179> so<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.989> simply

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:43.439 
which is 5,000 milliamps so you simply

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:47.269 
which is 5,000 milliamps so you simply
slot<00:05:44.429> it<00:05:44.580> into<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:44.849> same<00:05:45.029> place<00:05:45.649> because<00:05:46.649> it's

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:47.279 
slot it into the same place because it's

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.429 
slot it into the same place because it's
protrudes<00:05:47.729> here<00:05:48.059> and<00:05:48.239> it<00:05:48.569> comes<00:05:48.809> with<00:05:49.080> its<00:05:49.289> own

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:49.439 
protrudes here and it comes with its own

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.719 
protrudes here and it comes with its own
its<00:05:50.339> own<00:05:50.459> cover<00:05:52.009> which<00:05:53.009> you<00:05:53.039> just<00:05:53.309> clip<00:05:53.550> in

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
its own cover which you just clip in

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.730 
its own cover which you just clip in
like<00:05:54.319> any<00:05:55.319> other<00:05:55.529> cover<00:05:56.509> has<00:05:57.509> screws<00:05:58.259> that

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
like any other cover has screws that

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.619 
like any other cover has screws that
come<00:05:58.919> with<00:05:58.979> it<00:05:59.189> which<00:05:59.339> we<00:05:59.490> can<00:05:59.699> open<00:06:00.149> there

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
come with it which we can open there

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.029 
come with it which we can open there
there<00:06:01.289> you<00:06:01.379> go<00:06:01.580> that's<00:06:02.689> ready<00:06:03.689> to<00:06:03.749> go<00:06:04.039> much
