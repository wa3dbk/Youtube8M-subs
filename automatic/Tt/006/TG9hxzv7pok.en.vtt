00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.549
 hello guys to the girls that just like 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.250
 this is already back in minecraft and 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.580
 today we are going to talk about pauner in particular 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.560
 of spawn ers customized according 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.840
 surely it will have happened that 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.060
 you said so I want to have a 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.509
 spam of skeletons near my house to 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.699
 get bones or a spam of what you 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.919
 fancy you have already said so look I'm going to 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.410
 take this although there is around here where 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.300
 Christ lost the chancla I'm going to copy it 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.530
 in creative and I'm going to take it and here 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.380
 has happened is that it has become a 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.880
 pork and spam has not helped 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.010
 the same is used in motorcycles as by 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.290
 example the too many there are temps and nothing 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.080
 comes out pork spawn so let's see 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.210
 how it is done how we can use it is very 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.790
 simple very easy and you will love it 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.220
 we really need to use a 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.990
 external tool is called in 7 in the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.960
 description of the video you have the link to 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.980
 his download and I say is very simple 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.630
 it seems hard to not talk 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.430
 then the first thing that we have to 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.299
 to do is have our world where 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.299
 we want to do things 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.420
 let's save let's go out and we 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.790
 we see within a second in the in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.850
 series so far so good this way 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.120
 in 7 specifically in the 0.1 point version 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.070
 7.1 64 bit if you go to this video 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.420
 within a time by the will 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.730
 updated nothing happens the same 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.380
 then what are we going to do? 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.940
 world we select the world that we have 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.790
 Edit 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.040
 okay, this seems a bit dangerous 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.810
 but nothing by clicking right click and without 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 drop we can look for a site to 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.160
 other 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.520
 and with the arrow forgiveness with ws after 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.890
 we move in space then we go 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.180
 to create a first space we are going to create 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.010
 here 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.800
 we click once with the button 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.820
 left are marked and now if 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.410
 we move the mouse as we can 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.270
 select all the area that we want 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.490
 we only want a block a single block 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.950
 so we will click and it stays 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.340
 selected that we do now we give 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.580
 to replace and we want to replace this 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.780
 with that with a spanair of monsters 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.820
 we go though there are and we give to fill 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.030
 we already have our pauners but 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.070
 it's pig we put the mouse on and 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.709
 you see that it tells us double click to edit 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.569
 we double click and tells us what 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.940
 you want this spam because we're going to want it 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.750
 the pto scale 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.370
 and then next we're going to make another voucher 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.370
 and this we are going to do 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.220
 and what basis on this basis of 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.450
 poyete 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.450
 I do support that we have one so much 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.560
 something aggressive as something peaceful 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.920
 control s to save 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.599
 perfect and to efe 4 to close see you 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.890
 in minecraft so far so good because 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.410
 we are here you have seen how little 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.390
 We have taken a long time to load our 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.340
 map and hopefully we will explode in 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.739
 a thousand pieces to see where they are good 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.269
 pauner you have to look at it there we have the 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.920
 skeleton going around and here we have 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.720
 the one of poyatos that is already giving everything 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.940
 I was already releasing the first one there to the limit 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.970
 the runway obviously does not work 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.850
 because there is a lot of light we are going to put it 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:24.170
 for first we activate the tricks and 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.940
 let's put the times &amp; night at night 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.830
 it's night and the skeletons are going to 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.540
 start to leave it if I do not have it 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.590
 a pee because I have it to put it 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.590
 normal for them to come out 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.170
 here 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.069
 do not estimate breast 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:51.920
 It does not kill me It kills me I kill the rage 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.260
 and well I'm already in creative let's 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.340
 remove the middle ones let's go back to 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.939
 do this in peaceful and let's go back 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.939
 to do day 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.480
 ok let's explain something else these 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.150
 are the typical spawn is normal but 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.600
 If you want, you can make a 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.180
 Spoiler of any entity I remember 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.620
 there is another way to do it is one for 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.810
 things so they came initialist 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.630
 but for example you want to make a 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.630
 spoiler of whatever we have here 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.180
 to see which entities for example village 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.490
 you do not feel like doing a village spanair 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.099
 not worth 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.389
 and you go to a town I'm not going to 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.970
 stop to look for a town but good 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.560
 you find a villager worth say hey he says 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.070
 I would like to make a villager's back 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.140
 you for your villager is near 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.930
 three minecraft rooms again and we 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.789
 we see again in 7 so far 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.729
 Okay , we're around here again, load 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.159
 the world we carry our world 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.139
 we had a little bit where it is and here 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.900
 our villager is worth and you will say 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.030
 where is the villager that I do not see him here 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.610
 you see this thing here red 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.140
 the red things are entities of agreement 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.630
 this here and this here if I do not 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.990
 wrong they are two for seven but this of 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.900
 here was our villager then yes 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.700
 we want to create a spoiler from 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.350
 an entity that already exists instead of 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.230
 do it like we have done it beforehand 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.480
 You can do it the following way 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.390
 we take and select around the 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.870
 entity agreement 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.610
 a little circle that surrounds him and now he 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.449
 We give instead of filling we give 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.479
 filter 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.990
 and the type of filter we select to create 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:46.409
 is to put in addition to create spanair we give to 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.800
 filter and touching you have realized 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.230
 and this has become a spam of 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.840
 villager 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.610
 how do you stay 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.680
 because we have done it that way because 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.330
 better I wanted to do it from an entity that 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.550
 for example if I do here now double 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.460
 click 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.560
 for example it tells you here for stairs 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.200
 spider such and such and I do not know what already 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.150
 better specifically I support myself in concrete 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.680
 I think villagers do not come here if at 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.990
 better come I do not see it because I'm a 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.620
 little blind 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.200
 we do not think it's coming we've created a 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.410
 spam from entities that were not going 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.880
 to test the controls s to f 4 and we 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:29.000
 we see minecraft again so far 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.610
 because it just ran the 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.590
 movement that I said ok we are of 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.330
 turn again and there you see them that are 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.980
 giving everything and leaving a lot of 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.140
 villager let's do radio before we 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.040
 this one goes crazy and we go out there that 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.420
 They are making me nervous eating 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.410
 then because I've taught this second 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.300
 method because you can spam 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.580
 of any kind of entity does not 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.520
 missing that you pass in the classic filter 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.920
 of spider skeletons and little else you can 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.200
 make a spam of creepers you can do it 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.890
 you can spam what you want 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.830
 fireworks you can do 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:09.200
 tnt you can do what you 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.990
 fancy so nothing as you can see has 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.320
 been very very simple does not have ya 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:17.690
 I say it seems that he touches himself to see if 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.180
 is that I'm going to no no it's not very simple anymore 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.380
 you have seen it and I do not expect anything 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.720
 liked and see you in the next 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.320
 video 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.320
 goodbye
