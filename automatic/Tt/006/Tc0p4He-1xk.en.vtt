a couple screenshots but this technology

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.930 
a couple screenshots but this technology
is<00:02:57.420> crazy<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.950> was<00:02:59.070> thinking<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.370> myself<00:02:59.490> if

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
is crazy and I was thinking to myself if

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.360 
is crazy and I was thinking to myself if
we<00:03:00.120> were<00:03:00.270> at<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.750> point<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.530> Technology

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
we were at this point of Technology

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.760 
we were at this point of Technology
think<00:03:02.970> about<00:03:03.240> five<00:03:03.900> years<00:03:04.200> from<00:03:04.380> now<00:03:04.470> what

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
think about five years from now what

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.530 
think about five years from now what
they<00:03:04.890> can<00:03:05.070> really<00:03:05.340> do<00:03:05.580> with<00:03:05.760> Holograms<00:03:06.330> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
they can really do with Holograms you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.140 
they can really do with Holograms you

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
like that technology seems like it could

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.370 
like that technology seems like it could
be<00:03:19.950> here<00:03:20.430> within<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.270> next<00:03:21.450> couple<00:03:21.540> years<00:03:21.810> now

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380

hologram took about four months to make
but<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.640> was<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:26.790> thinking<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.180> myself<00:03:27.240> this

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
but I was just thinking to myself this

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.110 
but I was just thinking to myself this
technology<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.590> be<00:03:28.650> implemented<00:03:29.340> into<00:03:29.490> video

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
technology can be implemented into video

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.890 
technology can be implemented into video
games<00:03:30.180> into<00:03:31.250> tablets<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.820> projectors<00:03:33.510> at

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
games into tablets and to projectors at

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900 
games into tablets and to projectors at

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
in the next couple years I had this

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.390 
in the next couple years I had this
hologram<00:04:28.930> technology<00:04:29.800> or<00:04:30.039> anything<00:04:30.250> like
