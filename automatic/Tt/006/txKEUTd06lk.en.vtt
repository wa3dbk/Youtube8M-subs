00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.549
 After national olympics we won in the month of September by the way 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.110
 organized a miraflores school 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.699
 that's where team came from all over the country 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.349
 We won the national Olympics 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.359
 and that does not give the right to represent Peru in the world Olympiad 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.070
 it was not that already the second year that we are going for world olympics 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.070
 and it is the second year of Peru will participate with her 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.240
 in the world Olympiad comes in 2004 the organist what 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.599
 education ministry of Asian teams was not stopped like japan 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.840
 china korea 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.900
 all of them have united to justly organize this world olympiad of 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.750
 robotics in this category 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.110
 45 Indian team countries participated 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.600
 per cent we got to be between sixth place we had in the eight 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.260
 top 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.270
 its category 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.380
 the category is called strong regulatory is going from the age of 16 until 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.780
 the 19 years 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.050
 that was the theory 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.620
 in berna is a championship where technology peace together with no 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.600
 because because it supposes a mistreatment of technology obviously japan you would win 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.310
 forever 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.230
 it's a championship as the author uses molo leo's feet where there's more 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.250
 difficult is creativity and the ability to solve problems 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.640
 all have the same tools all countries all students 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.150
 have the tools 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.320
 it was a challenge 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.310
 all kinds you do not have to 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.289
 design it 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.200
 future and program it prove it and compete 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.090
 all are in the same conditions 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.290
 with this year's event were two pillars 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.840
 where the robbery was on top of each pillar 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.730
 someone some ball the theft had to go up 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.270
 pick up the ball 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.900
 after the recent the dark and pick it up or three but in less time possible 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.490
 them when assembling and robots with prefabricated pieces like leo shade 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.330
 those same witnesses are going to be able to fight later with real pieces 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.220
 but from now on they already know what the mechanisms are for what 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 as point 1 bull as a promoter as schedule 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.900
 All this 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.550
 to scale they are seeing others to do later only as parrals 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.330
 to design to use everything to design the same here there is a 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.319
 Beautiful feeling for designing robots 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.869
 they are already getting into everything that the mechatronics itself
