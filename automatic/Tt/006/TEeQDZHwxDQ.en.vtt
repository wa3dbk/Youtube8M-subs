I<00:02:13.140> like<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.290> think<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.590> I've<00:02:14.739> gotten<00:02:15.040> better

just gotten better at hiding it like I

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.479 
just gotten better at hiding it like I
still<00:02:20.260> will<00:02:20.500> subtly<00:02:20.709> compete<00:02:21.250> with<00:02:21.370> people

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
still will subtly compete with people
