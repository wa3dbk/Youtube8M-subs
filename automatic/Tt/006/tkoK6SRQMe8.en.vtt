00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.399
 hello everyone here to ride on the southern half are you okay 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:15.850
 we follow him furrier and 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.910
 she is today we commented villeneuve the third part of the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.210
 his team's office 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.210
 between two clubs so will 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.150
 do not see it 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.260
 and for him 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.269
 so here is biya 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.039
 in e2 0 for claudette 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.229
 this places the league 1 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.349
 dede of hope for you says 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.569
 who should really win this match 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:37.780
 on this score he comes out of this hen c the cape 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.590
 to say that we only have the match we do not know 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.890
 it does not remain that is not the morning yes cinema of the situation 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.920
 and so for the mambas discovered it in edinburgh actually they did at the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.330
 hand for the h-cup actually 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.410
 other age I feel like I have the impression that they made the map for 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.120
 the h-cup while I'm not sure said we in the comments if a 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.330
 sion may be mistaken, I feel that it seems to me a little dedicated to 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.290
 kabacouma a b2 here 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.550
 finally the passage that is there there is a slope to go north 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.010
 to a possible b3 franches I think it's a natural screen 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.100
 finally, that's what we'll see 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.600
 and the question that we are asking is actually a poor fit to move us 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
 can we put tanks in seat mode here or what we can put 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.240
 units in the rows of that that the toya pipes also 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.250
 1 caveman that escapes from this small fireplace this optics 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 and little warning to the cyclone I wonder if they go not without a break even 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.780
 if I had married or ghosts 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.869
 I personally recommended it 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.960
 six soldiers were deployed in the south he would not complain 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.900
 mamane mario bros a score but for that but I wonder if we scratch there my 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.510
 buddy it's like in August broodwar with shadows all the groups and 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.750
 just kostitsyn and pennyroy which is really the kind for you 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.160
 it would be for us a very thin coat what I like 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.750
 she became a brand is not going to either 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.350
 and for that you can see by the route of the program kevin in the end they 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.100
 are still powerful enough close in crp 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.690
 cc would say that if it's not going to change by implementing to go from a base to 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.550
 autumn I feel that I do not want to throw up 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.870
 the best for the future because what is still very small but I think 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.919
 that whitera will release a patron makes quite fast 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.259
 because the five message on this kind of match it can be 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.309
 kate booth steene not what he can leave on 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.589
 cabaret stimpaks so an attack very very very quickly 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.999
 um I think I think that whitera not really really have interest in 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.760
 get them from the info 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.980
 in the future this coup d'état reduced at one point what happens in the base 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.339
 before the lunch break 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.320
 since the volley one passes to his fight 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.099
 gold by this kind of numbers and especially 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.689
 alas he erases an opponent who has 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.159
 who has rabies 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.620
 he hates% and he has to do everything to win so 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.639
 a bad girl 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.529
 in front of the political office 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.679
 you know very strange things like wind power or things like that 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.569
 a dozen marines all is necessary christmas 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.349
 I do not think that 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.740
 is that what these guys who are doing olive trees is really 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.729
 sleeve but yielded 1 46% 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:10.219
 who plays very very defensive but we saw on the first part that he was 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.429
 able to do a very quick aggression and that's what's 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.599
 to come to search for the goal bobby ray ability in addition to it to build a 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.049
 first marauder obi-1 ability ans who will finish in six seconds 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.040
 so in 6 worlds dilate dead 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.160
 a pilot test as offered more or less the same delusion as on the merits 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.980
 the party actually they are trying to make a 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.689
 a relegation with 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.989
 1 the marauder amariné abandoned less on the first part of the year 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.989
 had put the same case here in celebration to really know his opponent 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.899
 that's what cost him his life m it was this program 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:41.789
 6% had come to make a pylon of aircelle even not finding the same ma 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.559
 part but basically it's the same configuration a pioneer at the reminder of 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.409
 units and the beast team with myself 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.549
 he could not make a card fall 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.349
 so what will we see if martin the same this time he will try to make a good 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.730
 gap at the top of the thing 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.540
 but there it will take a lot of legitimacy can not see that white-ra 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.540
 a very very very unusual 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.090
 - thanks to take back of this mineral to help it against the attacks 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.250
 partisans for work to come tame if mayweather has tired of the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.310
 success 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.250
 among these villages where he has very very well we say tells us who are managing 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.110
 very good but I think he should have asked me his bonus because there is 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.730
 not a lot of laurent dard it's really playing to micro-management on it 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.600
 there is a constant stream of marauders behind at La la la la la 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.180
 more luck the marauder 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 but before we get there he took a huge advantage 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.740
 he caught at 3,400 meters 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.199
 and she's mostly tied in the mud his opponent and reunite more than 10 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.659
 employees in 13 of marseille 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.759
 he is arriving 46 'paris 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.940
 alalalala and he sees his opponent by jean-marc aubert 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.729
 probably to tell the truth she decides to leave the power 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.330
 Longueuil and Laval 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.710
 this is the deficit problem that jean-marc houdard and wake up the 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.259
 to return in effect over what 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.150
 could then high level before the level is sentenced to death there is 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.360
 not lost so much to the Israelis will come so threw his butt 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.180
 for Christians before taking against 23 6% for you say it's 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.029
 really very very very tense 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.509
 and therefore to actually% 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.180
 the spaghetti will soon be finished I think we will have a beautiful and true 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.850
 the dummy who is asked since this time abou diab understood that they 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.470
 could be taken against the base of pylons very very very fast and 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.099
 I think it will be very useful to him wants to be different 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.419
 so he adds defensive alas he's probably starting out on a 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.529
 6 month bond this is what he's used to drag a player 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.849
 who likes to travel this kind of aggression he noted he even has in China and in 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.770
 general once he is there they play very very very defensive and 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.319
 for 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.949
 when he goes on football fr 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.120
 he does not like the 2 go the wifi okay 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.779
 melanoma say that that 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.479
 that contradicts a little bit what was said earlier that this out of three 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.929
 parties we still have two parts of the boudigau my membership the assaults of 

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:50.959
 say things rather than rather interesting early in the game 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.439
 and the happiness here and there alas alas there there it smells molasses 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.589
 at least 500 the 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:01.149
 6 it feels the conclusion of our expectations where she lived three marines for a 

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:04.299
 stop project so if I'm wrong I think it's like being marine 

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:06.619
 for a regret game 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:10.470
 I think it'll be funny especially from 29 cradle a few hours 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.069
 but the cvjr 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.300
 and the four and six victims claim to protect or obviously so that 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.210
 it's things 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.610
 we invite you to reproduce the spa 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.210
 prepare for the role repair with three four and six cities it takes 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.780
 that I saw every day they must already be there the veil 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.530
 which is open 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.419
 energy prices on the magic dimension 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.770
 sure poker is on the bridge 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.990
 ipo targeting 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.259
 gold these countries and Russia will look too far 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:37.849
 the big jobs 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.809
 he beat two who are going to hurt very badly 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:43.769
 the city of Lille on purpose because the winner conceived and directed by a 

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.760
 fine for maybe having a little more important 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.730
 because he knows what he did when he put his winners to defend the 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.000
 foundation even because just lagarde is going to be exciting well over three 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.630
 marine 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.780
 here is more of jean-marie pajot marine 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.530
 there was pretty dense and shot gold shuttle in the schaffhouse area 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.580
 yes to pass in his ranks is in the process of liquidating a meeting that goes 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.139
 go out who can possibly change the win 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.949
 the goal here for do you want 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:10.389
 think it will improve the volume of traded 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.910
 envy who may not know enough about all the civilians coming out of 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:15.610
 the finish line 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.259
 tarradellas the problem is he is being attacked it's going 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.380
 end of the second period Saturday at a meeting that falls and there it 

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:25.379
 begins to feel the German player 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.159
 flighty 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:30.669
 gg 2010 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.800
 I'm glad it's unusual in this esl that a passage of klaus 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.460
 baur lamented that he is coming back in force 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.770
 didier lucine shows that there are 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.759
 during a panel of 

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:44.080
 the strategy in his possession and she had rather rather good 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.729
 so 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:45.660
 So here is 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.700
 judged too many players to thank you for having followed thanks to you and the intox 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.260
 not soon
