00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
out first is the the metal servo arm

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.870 
out first is the the metal servo arm
nice<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.259> blue<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:04.069> odorous<00:02:05.049> look<00:02:06.049> of<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.880> not

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
because on for second bits to come out

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.229 
because on for second bits to come out
mostly<00:02:15.310> grommets<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:19.519> screws<00:02:19.910> for
