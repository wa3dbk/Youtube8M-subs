00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
these - oh this is the one I thought

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.260 
these - oh this is the one I thought
they<00:01:22.229> had<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.830> had<00:01:23.010> round<00:01:23.340> openings<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.060> here

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
they had they had round openings in here

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.810 
they had they had round openings in here
for<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.510> Trangia<00:01:24.979> this<00:01:25.979> one<00:01:26.190> has<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.520> square

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
for the Trangia this one has two square

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.499 
for the Trangia this one has two square
one

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
one

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.999 
one
I<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.950> newest<00:01:29.360> version<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
I think this is the newest version of it

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.680 
I think this is the newest version of it
but<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.250> Trangia<00:01:32.520> fits<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.180> there<00:01:33.330> just<00:01:33.540> like

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
but the Trangia fits in there just like

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.590 
but the Trangia fits in there just like
that<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> cool<00:01:36.920> now<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:39.180> looks<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that so cool now this looks like a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600 
that so cool now this looks like a
little<00:01:39.810> bit<00:01:40.020> different<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.440> far<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.680> putting

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
little bit different as far as putting

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.310 
little bit different as far as putting
this<00:01:41.790> together<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.570> haven't<00:01:42.869> done<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.170> so

I<00:03:16.540> thought<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.810> on<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.440> other<00:03:18.590> kits<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.640> tool

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
I thought the on the other kits the tool

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.180 
I thought the on the other kits the tool
bowls<00:03:20.150> are<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.540> same<00:03:20.810> but<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:21.890> one's<00:03:22.099> a

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
bowls are the same but this one's a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.160

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
both of them made from titanium cool so

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.830 
both of them made from titanium cool so
that<00:03:29.569> gives<00:03:29.780> me<00:03:29.930> two<00:03:30.109> titanium<00:03:30.680> bowls<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.840> a

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
that was on an earlier video that I did

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.999 
that was on an earlier video that I did
where<00:05:15.639> I<00:05:15.940> said<00:05:16.720> in<00:05:16.840> my<00:05:16.930> earlier<00:05:17.139> test<00:05:17.710> where<00:05:17.979> I

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
where I said in my earlier test where I

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.600 
where I said in my earlier test where I
let<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.430> burner<00:05:18.669> run<00:05:19.270> out<00:05:19.479> burn<00:05:20.199> out<00:05:20.610> those

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
let the burner run out burn out those

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.840 
let the burner run out burn out those
ones<00:05:21.880> seem<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.210> have<00:05:22.360> cracks<00:05:22.750> in<00:05:22.990> them<00:05:23.759> so<00:05:24.759> I'm

ones seem to have cracks in them so I'm

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.939 
ones seem to have cracks in them so I'm

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
some tests and suppleness and I'll

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.110 
some tests and suppleness and I'll
probably<00:05:32.729> be<00:05:33.729> using<00:05:33.760> this<00:05:34.270> when<00:05:34.479> we<00:05:34.630> go<00:05:34.810> out

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
probably be using this when we go out

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.700 
probably be using this when we go out
hiking<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.449> camping<00:05:37.660> where<00:05:38.199> we<00:05:38.289> have<00:05:38.470> meals

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710

this<00:05:39.310> is<00:05:39.490> supposed<00:05:39.820> to<00:05:39.940> be<00:05:40.000> from<00:05:40.210> what<00:05:40.360> I

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
this is supposed to be from what I

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.620 
this is supposed to be from what I
understand<00:05:40.930> a<00:05:41.139> one<00:05:41.770> or<00:05:41.889> two<00:05:42.100> man<00:05:42.340> set<00:05:42.729> up<00:05:42.910> it's

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
understand a one or two man set up it's

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.930 
understand a one or two man set up it's
mighty<00:05:43.900> big<00:05:44.260> for<00:05:44.620> any<00:05:44.770> kind<00:05:45.039> of<00:05:45.100> a<00:05:47.940> that

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
mighty big for any kind of a that

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.129 
mighty big for any kind of a that
doesn't<00:05:49.270> really<00:05:49.419> fit<00:05:49.690> in<00:05:49.810> there<00:05:49.990> it's<00:05:50.110> like

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
doesn't really fit in there it's like

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.029 
doesn't really fit in there it's like
that's<00:05:50.470> too<00:05:50.740> small<00:05:52.530> I'm<00:05:53.530> gonna<00:05:53.680> have<00:05:53.770> to<00:05:53.860> check

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
that's too small I'm gonna have to check

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.620 
that's too small I'm gonna have to check
on<00:05:54.250> that<00:05:54.400> I<00:05:54.610> guess<00:05:55.090> it'll<00:05:55.300> fit<00:05:55.539> there<00:05:55.949> but<00:05:57.630> the

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
on that I guess it'll fit there but the

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.629 
on that I guess it'll fit there but the
bigger<00:05:58.840> one<00:05:59.050> works<00:05:59.289> better<00:05:59.560> so<00:06:00.190> anyway<00:06:00.460> this

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
bigger one works better so anyway this

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.490
