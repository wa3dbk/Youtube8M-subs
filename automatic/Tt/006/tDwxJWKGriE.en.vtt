00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.179
 hello welcome to all that complete 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.470
 this being here with you my name is 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 josefina I'm here to teach you 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.640
 how to comb with a lot of wave and a lot 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.890
 Today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.050
 braid and not any braid this braid 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.449
 what you have here is called braid and aries 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.429
 easier to do than it seems 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.140
 Braid is very fashionable and you can use it 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.669
 to go to the faculty to go for a meal 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 even hollywood people use it in the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.600
 red carpet so go ahead and do it 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.489
 because not only is it very easy but 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.110
 the first thing that is also very durable is 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.149
 let's do is grab the hair 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.040
 take it to one side I go to 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.230
 choose this side and once you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.460
 we have on one side separate it in two 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.460
 equal parts 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.199
 if you never made a spy braid it is 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.440
 the first one that you're going to try I have a tip 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.320
 to give you a rubber band or 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.109
 a finite gummie and you make a tail 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.119
 Once you have your tail done you go to 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.369
 separate the tufts in this way you go to 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.120
 be able to control it much better without 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.160
 your hair escapes 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.860
 what we have to do is take out a 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.340
 strand of each piece of hair and cross it 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.420
 I pull a piece of this piece I cross it and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.420
 I do the same with the other 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.570
 and a very important thing to have in 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 account is that the more finite they are 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.830
 the strands that we will make more eared 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.780
 do the braid and at the same time if 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.760
 we have little hair we can give it a 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.380
 feeling much more volume how much 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.380
 more finite is what we grab 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.929
 you saw how easy it is we're almost there 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.550
 ending once we finish what 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.459
 let's do is grab a rubber band like 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.290
 it is well chiquitita sai of colors 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.940
 transparent the one that I chose is 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.370
 transparent so it does not look that much and 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.380
 do not call much attention once 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.209
 we have it we are going to tie the end of the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.980
 braid with this rubber band we are going to give it 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.980
 many laps so that we do not escape 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.930
 and then make a certain braid is 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.569
 grab some fixative and spray the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.459
 braid so that no pelito us 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.870
 move you see how much progress was left 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.480
 The last thing you have to do is grab 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.900
 a scissors and the rubber band that we put on 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.060
 principle of everything cut 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.060
 and if you notice that I did it with gummy 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.340
 and if you are of mine and you like a 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.020
 style a little more sloppy you 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.000
 I propose this idea to not be so 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.340
 neat and be a bit more canchera a 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.320
 little bigger I propose to make a 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.360
 braid just like it is on it 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.400
 base only that tousled the little bit 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.569
 what we are going to do is take out the gummy 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.990
 that we already put 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.670
 hold the hair 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.740
 and once we have the hair like that 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.260
 we grab a tail comb like this one that 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.410
 we have here and what we are going to do is 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.180
 beat the tip of the braid this is going to 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.180
 do not leave for nothing 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.210
 spray to fix and then we continue 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.210
 disheveled all the tense 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.170
 and although easy so fast I have this 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.939
 much more sloppy style and much more 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.530
 canchero and now the only thing that is missing is 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.530
 that you want to make them try 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.820
 chau chau see you next time in 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.820
 you woman 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.009
 Y 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.009
 yes 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 yes 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.410
 i 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.110
 wrong
