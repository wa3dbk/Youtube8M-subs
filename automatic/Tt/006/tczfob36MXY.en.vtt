00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.170
 hello and welcome until chapter 13 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.950
 of this course to learn how to weave step 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.019
 Step 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.810
 in this chapter we are going to start 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.539
 learn the subject of decreases 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.750
 to eliminate points in the tissues that 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.300
 let's perform let's do it two 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.180
 ways usually once closing 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 points and the other is knitting two stitches 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.850
 together 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.860
 normally it is decreased to narrow 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.860
 garments like for example the part 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.650
 top of the caps or to perform 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.680
 the armhole of the sleeves or the opening of the 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.620
 neck but let's start practicing 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.650
 the decreases at the beginning the tissue 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.309
 they will always make closing points is 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.250
 say that we are going to perform or work 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.980
 two points in the way we are 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.970
 working the tissue is to say or to 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.970
 right backwards 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.820
 and then we'll get the point the first 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.250
 point that we work above this 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.060
 second product and we take it out of the 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.090
 so we will have eliminated a point 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.000
 this way of decreasing eliminating the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.610
 start of the fabric also serves to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.610
 decrease more points at a time 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.770
 if we are knitting with dots inside out 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.840
 to decrease at the beginning of the tissue with 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.210
 points of the reverse is done from the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.790
 next way we leave the thread that 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.610
 wool comes ahead of the work 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.770
 we did two points inside out and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.900
 we pulled out the same way we had 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.710
 removed before the first point that 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.880
 we work on the second one taking it out of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.880
 the needle of the right hand 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.000
 decrease closing points at the beginning of 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.880
 tissue will help us to make 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.190
 in the sleeves of the sleeves or the shape 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.910
 curved that have sleeves in the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.910
 upper part 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.830
 let's decrease points inside 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.370
 that is, we are weaving the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.460
 usual way is to decrease by joining or 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.220
 working two points together is to say yes 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.250
 we were working right points 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.580
 let's take two points together equal 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.180
 that if we worked one and we're going to 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.480
 perform of the right so we will decrease 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.880
 a point inside the tissue we're going 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.030
 to repeat so that you see it and we take 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.280
 two points we put the needle in the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.680
 inside or in the center of them 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.450
 we went clear thrown and we took them out 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.330
 forming a new point 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.989
 if we are working with points from 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.129
 backwards let's do the same work 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.550
 two points together but how do you work 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.680
 reverse points ie by 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.700
 in front of the work we are going to introduce 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.480
 the needle pass the loop and remove the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.480
 new point 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.360
 let's now decrease to points in the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.020
 inside the tissue but closing them is 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.740
 say eliminating those completely these 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.110
 will serve us for example to perform 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.080
 pants or to perform some 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.370
 neck opening that we want to do in 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.710
 Jersey as points are decreased 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.420
 eliminating the inside of the tissue 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.300
 Well what we do is when we get there 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.200
 to the point that we want to eliminate let's 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.099
 knit two more stitches 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.560
 then let's take the first point 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.500
 that we work is the point that 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.859
 we want to eliminate in this case and what 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.040
 let's get the needle helping us 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.400
 with the left hand and we passed it 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.760
 on top of the last point worked up 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.150
 that we finally eliminate that point and 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.780
 we left the gap of the points in the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.360
 means of labor 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.730
 once we have removed some 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.820
 interior points we will work the 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.980
 Work each side of the point separately 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.289
 that is first we will work one of the 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.229
 sides leaving the other waiting 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:52.559
 the decreases at the end of the tissue do not 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:56.369
 they are made properly so but in the 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:59.460
 reverse of the work at the beginning of the turn 

00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:01.979
 let's make the decrease closing in 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.559
 the first point with the points that we 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.889
 indicate the pattern we can also close 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:10.740
 at the end of the work working two 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.439
 points together but usually what is 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.409
 does for armholes is that at the beginning of 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:19.319
 the work is done by closing the points 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.419
 of the armhole and when we reach the end it 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:25.729
 we turn around and on the reverse of the 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.729
 labor we closed the same points 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.730
 to practice closures and decreases 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.250
 of all kinds I have left you the pattern of 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.100
