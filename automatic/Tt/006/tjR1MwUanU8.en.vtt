four-point-oh orders the latest Android
version<00:00:31.730> basically<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.930> our<00:00:34.110> platform

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
version basically that so our platform

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.880 
version basically that so our platform
has<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.280> corners<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> our<00:00:37.170> connectivity

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
has the corners and our connectivity

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.639 
has the corners and our connectivity
swans<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.780> since<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.440> ice<00:00:40.620> cream

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
swans so since when we have ice cream

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.540 
swans so since when we have ice cream
sandwich<00:00:41.719> just<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.930> month<00:00:43.590> ago<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.340> they

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
sandwich just a month ago they are they

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.790 
sandwich just a month ago they are they
released<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> late<00:00:45.360> November<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.410> our

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
released it the late November and our

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.880 
released it the late November and our
development<00:00:47.370> teams<00:00:47.840> were<00:00:48.840> able<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.170> pour<00:00:49.649> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
development teams were able to pour this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.209 
development teams were able to pour this
in<00:00:50.190> mineral<00:00:50.730> public<00:00:51.410> basically<00:00:52.410> what<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.890> just

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
in mineral public basically what we just

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.000 
in mineral public basically what we just
one<00:00:53.399> or<00:00:53.489> two<00:00:53.520> weeks<00:00:53.730> favorite<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:54.750> what

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
one or two weeks favorite then what

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.540 
one or two weeks favorite then what
instead<00:00:56.460> you're<00:00:56.820> improving<00:00:58.460> optimizing<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
instead you're improving optimizing the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.630 
instead you're improving optimizing the
solution<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.890> basically<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.399> some

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
solution and basically there's some

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460 
solution and basically there's some
other<00:01:02.879> features<00:01:03.089> that<00:01:03.390> need<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> like

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
other features that need for it like

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.330 
other features that need for it like
HDMI<00:01:05.060> working<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.149> it<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> basically<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.130> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
HDMI working on it so basically is that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.010 
HDMI working on it so basically is that
I'll<00:01:08.549> show<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.899> version<00:01:10.830> number<00:01:11.930> just<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
I'll show you the version number just to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
I'll show you the version number just to
prove<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.680> ice<00:01:13.979> cream<00:01:14.250> sandwich

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
prove that this ice cream sandwich

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.749 
prove that this ice cream sandwich

hardware<00:02:01.560> reference<00:02:01.920> pattern<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.850> many<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
hardware reference pattern so many of

hardware reference pattern so many of
these

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
these

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.520 
these
this<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:04.909> just<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.210> development<00:02:06.020> platform<00:02:06.200> that

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
this is just a development platform that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.980 
this is just a development platform that
we<00:02:06.740> share<00:02:07.490> with<00:02:07.640> our<00:02:07.759> customers<00:02:08.300> until<00:02:08.810> they

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
we share with our customers until they

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.830 
we share with our customers until they
come<00:02:09.200> up<00:02:09.319> with<00:02:09.350> their<00:02:09.530> own<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:11.030> know<00:02:11.150> solution

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
come up with their own you know solution

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.340 
come up with their own you know solution
under<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:13.400> basically<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.569> antenna<00:02:14.989> you

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
under so basically that this antenna you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.330 
under so basically that this antenna you
know<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.920> do<00:02:16.069> all<00:02:17.560> participant<00:02:18.560> antennas

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
know just to do all participant antennas

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.710 
know just to do all participant antennas
and<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:19.819> can<00:02:20.239> improve<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.989> reception<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.450> this

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and we can improve the reception so this

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.550 
and we can improve the reception so this
is<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.290> camera<00:02:28.720> yes<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.900> can<00:02:30.050> put<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.380> with

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
is just a camera yes you can put it with

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.250 
is just a camera yes you can put it with
the<00:02:30.590> game<00:02:31.130> brownie

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the game brownie

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.250 
the game brownie
it's<00:02:32.590> also<00:02:32.830> working<00:02:33.159> but<00:02:33.459> anyway<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.260> so

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
it's also working but anyway so so

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.800 
it's also working but anyway so so
basically<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.769> know<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:37.390> Ice<00:02:37.540> Cream<00:02:37.780> Sandwich

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
basically you know so Ice Cream Sandwich

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.949 
basically you know so Ice Cream Sandwich
fully<00:02:38.620> smooth<00:02:39.269> exactly<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:40.390> now<00:02:40.540> i<00:02:40.569> can<00:02:40.659> show

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
fully smooth exactly so now i can show

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.270 
fully smooth exactly so now i can show
