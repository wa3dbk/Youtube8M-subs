00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.099 
Fantasy 14 now I mentioned the
difficulty<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.579> instance<00:03:09.880> earlier<00:03:10.299> or<00:03:10.900> at

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
difficulty of the instance earlier or at

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.310 
difficulty of the instance earlier or at
least<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.680> lack<00:03:12.070> of<00:03:12.310> difficulty<00:03:13.320> personally

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
least the lack of difficulty personally

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.930 
least the lack of difficulty personally
I<00:03:14.350> think<00:03:14.530> this<00:03:14.799> instance<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.370> meant<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.820> be

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
I think this instance is meant to be

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.940 
I think this instance is meant to be
really<00:03:16.239> really<00:03:16.450> easy<00:03:16.660> if<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.410> think<00:03:17.739> back<00:03:17.920> to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
really really easy if you think back to

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.590 
really really easy if you think back to
this<00:03:18.250> first<00:03:18.519> few<00:03:18.760> question<00:03:19.150> in<00:03:19.299> your<00:03:19.390> home

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
this first few question in your home

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.300 
this first few question in your home
city<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.109> ones<00:03:20.260> where<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.530> emoted<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.130> bunch

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
city the ones where you emoted a bunch

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.300 
city the ones where you emoted a bunch
of<00:03:21.430> NPCs<00:03:22.000> it's<00:03:22.870> like<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.950> game<00:03:24.100> is

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
of NPCs it's like that the game is

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.800 
of NPCs it's like that the game is
basically<00:03:24.519> teaching<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.269> how<00:03:25.359> to<00:03:25.390> play<00:03:25.690> in

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
basically teaching you how to play in

basically teaching you how to play in
here<00:03:26.019> one<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.829> simplest<00:03:27.130> ways<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.370> do<00:03:27.609> that

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
here one of the simplest ways to do that

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.220 
here one of the simplest ways to do that
is<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:28.030> show<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.450> tank<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.780> spank<00:03:28.870> which

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
is to show you the tank and spank which

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.530 
is to show you the tank and spank which
is<00:03:29.350> basically<00:03:29.769> what<00:03:30.040> chopper<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:31.299> only

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
is basically what chopper is the only

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.910 
is basically what chopper is the only
thing<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.900> have<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.079> look<00:03:32.290> out<00:03:32.380> for<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.769> this

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
thing you have to look out for is this

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.610 
thing you have to look out for is this
point-blank<00:03:33.280> AoE<00:03:33.760> or<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.420> angry<00:03:35.049> red<00:03:35.230> circle

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
point-blank AoE or the angry red circle
