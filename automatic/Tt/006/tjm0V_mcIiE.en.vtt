00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.059
 Speaks, people, beauty , welcome, more. 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.430
 of talking games with you is 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.010
 rafa off, people asked me a lot 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.080
 to make a video on the locked screen 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.210
 and also the screen says then locked that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 here one is a service to you that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
 asked a lot of people even asked for it there 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.029
 So let's talk a little bit for you. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.040
 about what is fought or not beauty 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.059
 When to start putting what was even 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.550
 locked 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.129
 nothing more is than when your champion 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.770
 it is always centered on the screen if 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.989
 You push the button Beauty you walk 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.350
 and the screen is always centered on your 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.390
 champion even trained as she does with 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.850
 that until its champion moves more 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.039
 the screen stays fixed until you 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.070
 move according to your champion 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.289
 and how do you turn it on or off 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.390
 we have then galera that button here 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.219
 that's just called camera he stays on 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.129
 upper corner of the minimal 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.229
 right and you getting in it you lock and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.150
 by clicking on it you unlock beauty then 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.979
 This is the first one you should know. 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.740
 about the shortcut and another shortcut 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.780
 People have standards, too, are you? 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.390
 press the y entered you press it 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.509
 was then and has the same function as this 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.540
 button and that we also have shortcuts that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.979
 are momentary as well as racca shortcuts 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.220
 however they are shortcuts that you 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.700
 press securely and as soon as you release 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.610
 the button the camera unlock is they f1 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.530
 and also the space bar so if I 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.200
 hit the space bar I'll stay 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.240
 with the camera locked and so I drop the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.939
 spacebar the camera will continue 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.549
 unlocked then understood this is a 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.979
 locked screen mechanism and even 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.409
 that's how it works and now 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.840
 to talk a little to you about the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.700
 importance of the advantages and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.399
 disadvantages of course this is a 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.890
 My opinion is then for you what? 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.540
 speak may not be as valid but for 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.960
 You who have no idea what you 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.270
 prefers or does not know what you do 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.220
 Maybe it will help you, so let's go. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.990
 guys because we call paper is 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.540
 what are the situations 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.660
 I particularly like playing with 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.630
 that caught in farm situations and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.420
 also situations because the fights tim 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.570
 Sometimes I need to know exactly where 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.360
 the champion is located and so can 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.950
 improve my farm and also to my 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.750
 my position is my position 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.640
 during the tracks 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.160
 then these are the only situations that 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.890
 I see myself there really using a 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.800
 fought camera I do not usually use and 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.530
 also some escape is very interesting 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.030
 you use the camera is locked because it 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.650
 You do not use the camera, they work. 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.310
 what to do here with a whole map 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.470
 hour 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.810
 pulling the map down so if you 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.780
 use camera locked you click on the single 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.940
 point and you continue to escape 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.340
 tranquil and enjoying that I am 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.310
 We are talking about that we have to's 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.440
 shortcut keys we have the buttons 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.500
 What are the standards that we have here 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.720
 space bar and also the f 1 you can 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.200
 change if you want, you come here 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.810
 which is shortcut keys to fix camera from 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.300
 champion if you want to exchange you exchange 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.520
 and we have here also the shortcut of 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.500
 that would be one and that 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.720
 for you that you can also change 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.060
 Beauty, come on then 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.640
 if you do not use a camera locked in your 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.120
 champion for you to move screen you 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.220
 have to put the mouse on the edges and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.560
 leave there for a few moments 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.770
 this will cause your screen to fiddle 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.950
 alone between you and when you 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:51.750
 move if you apply it to me 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.150
 here and you want to move the screen to the top 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.700
 You have to see how we're doing. 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.490
 Show you again I'm staying 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.710
 To come here and I want to go up the screen is 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.080
 I just drag the mouse up as if 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.700
 it was getting the screen is seeing this 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.520
 will cause the screen of this or 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.840
 Of course, this rain is practical. 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.850
 since I started playing league 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.730
 talk in your game with the camera says 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.739
 then caught if you do not have that 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.500
 habit if you do not have this custom can 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.330
 seem a bit difficult and the other tip 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.580
 that I have to give you who does not 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.730
 plays with the camera says locked to whoever 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.040
 played with the camera locked is that the 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.270
 They had them work with this movement 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.940
 is seeing 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.980
 I see that my mouse is stopped, but I 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.340
 I can move around for free. 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.980
 the screen says locked because because the arrow 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.390
 is he has this tool his seven 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.160
 Days up down the right side 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.170
 to the left she has these 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.930
 camera drive tools 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.740
 so you can also do it for yourself 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.450
 that your wr writes your fans but says no 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.640
 stay away from your keyboard 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.380
 so you have to be very agile or 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.600
 then you will end up losing the 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.810
 chance to use magic and terrestrial 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.660
 then you have several different ways of 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.450
 playing the flex league the most usual is this 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.670
 camera says locked and you guide only screen 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.320
 with a mouse of course as I said 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.630
 I have enough practice with you 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.310
 because the game has long been with the 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.140
 unlocked camera but I understand that 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.350
 many of you do not have this custom 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.240
 so start playing with the little piece then 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.420
 You move the camera with the arrow 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.550
 beauty makes speech by O here your 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.230
 way to get stuck and when you have 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.530
 a good position you come back because the 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.420
 Aquino magic that we are and something else that 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.010
 talking to you is about the importance of 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.440
 unlocked camera 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.170
 I realize that here I have a ray of 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.100
 vision x let's call this ray of vision 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.710
 x that I am encompassing all this area only 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.520
 that I had with the camera says 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.400
 locked 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.640
 I could be watching the champions 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.070
 who are coming from the tower and then enemy 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.350
 our radius of vision would be another 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.200
 our radius of vision would be this from here 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.100
 would cover a very large area 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.980
 bigger 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.140
 Of course, this part of the island 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.820
 down she would have no vision 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.790
 but in return we could 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.590
 avoid an invasion of the adversary genre 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.810
 by his tower 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.020
 so if I work she realized that I 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.150
 I'm going to cut off the view of the tower, but if I 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.930
 ask for that vision but I would like very much 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.790
 back 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.100
 so you have to know exactly what 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.090
 that you can use when you can 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:35.400
 use the law n if you are there 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.990
 receiving many great I recommend 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.120
 You always had to stay with that one. 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.020
 while you're in the middle of the 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.500
 law nery pa 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.470
 now 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.210
 you have very advanced you have to 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.580
 leave the screen behind the same 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.620
 thing if you have a lot of indented has 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.510
 that leaving the screen ahead is by 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.570
 this I think the unlocked screen is 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.760
 much better to avoid gangs 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.520
 both to be able to form because at the same 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.900
 time you can position yourself 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.060
 directly on the screen you can see the 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.330
 position of your opposing enemy in law 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.640
 n 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.370
 You can know if you will or not. 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.380
 form when you can train with the 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.970
 best place to talk because sometimes 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.550
 you do not have this vision 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.640
 I realize that if I was on camera I lose 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:20.250
 much of the grapevine has a lot of 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.430
 top of the screen so people are 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:26.640
 that I trained enough the screen says caught 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.040
 is good the screen locked is also good every 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.930
 one of them has an exact moment to be 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.780
 used in a more propitious moment 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.970
 Let's say like that because sometimes it's you 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.220
 you benefit from the stalled and sometimes you 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:41.970
 benefit from the screen says locked then 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:45.720
 where it is intermediate the beam and 

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.970
 screen when you feel the urge to 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.940
 unlock the screen also practice the bar 

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:53.130
 practice the practice 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.270
 move the mouse on the screen then 

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.440
 Who is this crowd? 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.240
 thank you for being watching 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.490
 This video I hope it has served. 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.770
 for you it is of course clear that 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.620
 here are my opinions are tips 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:06.210
 lines are my observations 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.729
 so I hope you came back 

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.410

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:12.840
 Do you want to leave your favor and if you like 

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:15.060

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.820
 There until the next video a hug to 

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.540
