just put a coat of under sealer just
over<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> exposed<00:00:49.739> metal<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.120> keep<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
over the exposed metal just to keep it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.430 
over the exposed metal just to keep it
from<00:00:52.520> corroding<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.379> we<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> battery<00:00:56.070> box

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
from corroding and we have a battery box

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.560 
from corroding and we have a battery box
made<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:59.149> three<00:01:00.149> millimeter

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
made I would have three millimeter

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.410 
made I would have three millimeter
aluminium<00:01:01.440> that'll<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.940> so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
aluminium that'll be going in here so

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.350 
aluminium that'll be going in here so
that's<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.409> over<00:01:04.710> there<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:06.979> got<00:01:07.979> some<00:01:08.360> of

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that's it over there and got some of

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
that's it over there and got some of
that<00:01:09.740> underfloor<00:01:10.740> heating<00:01:11.070> mat<00:01:11.430> stuff<00:01:11.760> we're

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that underfloor heating mat stuff we're

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
that underfloor heating mat stuff we're
gonna<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.299> trying<00:01:12.570> out<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.140> battery

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
gonna be trying out for a battery

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
gonna be trying out for a battery
heating<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:16.430> get<00:01:17.430> rid<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> we're

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
heating and get rid of that and so we're

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.870 
heating and get rid of that and so we're
gonna<00:01:21.000> sit<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.479> box<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.189> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
gonna sit that box in there and that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.940 
gonna sit that box in there and that
will<00:01:24.150> hold<00:01:25.909> 11<00:01:26.909> cells

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
will hold 11 cells

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.319 
will hold 11 cells
now<00:01:28.950> hopefully<00:01:29.159> we'll<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.520> able<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.759> see<00:01:30.000> here

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
now hopefully we'll be able to see here

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
now hopefully we'll be able to see here

masses so that's the story they're gonna
sit<00:02:40.190> up<00:02:40.340> at<00:02:40.549> your<00:02:40.730> box<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.680> see<00:02:42.680> how<00:02:42.830> it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
sit up at your box in and see how it

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.380 
sit up at your box in and see how it
looks<00:02:45.130> okay<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:46.459> there's<00:02:46.700> our<00:02:46.850> wheel<00:02:47.120> well

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
looks okay so there's our wheel well

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.520 
looks okay so there's our wheel well
battery<00:02:47.900> box<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:50.170> approximately<00:02:51.170> sitting

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
battery box just approximately sitting

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.350 
battery box just approximately sitting
in<00:02:51.680> there<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:53.500> looks<00:02:54.500> pretty<00:02:54.799> good<00:02:55.330> he's<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
in there and looks pretty good he's a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.050 
in there and looks pretty good he's a
little<00:02:56.750> bit<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.099> twiddling<00:02:58.099> to<00:02:58.370> make<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:59.000> a

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
little bit of twiddling to make it a

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.400 
little bit of twiddling to make it a
perfect<00:02:59.299> fit<00:02:59.750> but<00:02:59.780> a<00:03:00.400> box<00:03:01.400> will<00:03:01.580> hold<00:03:02.080> 11<00:03:03.080> cells

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
perfect fit but a box will hold 11 cells

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.539 
perfect fit but a box will hold 11 cells
and<00:03:05.380> once<00:03:06.380> that's<00:03:06.560> bolted<00:03:07.069> down<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.459> the

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
and once that's bolted down to the

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.580 
and once that's bolted down to the
chassis<00:03:08.709> it's<00:03:09.709> carpeted<00:03:10.280> basically<00:03:11.239> just

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
chassis it's carpeted basically just

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.660 
chassis it's carpeted basically just
fall<00:03:12.590> right<00:03:12.620> down<00:03:12.970> on<00:03:13.970> top<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:15.670> we'll

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
fall right down on top of it and we'll

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.050 
fall right down on top of it and we'll
have<00:03:16.820> do<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.390> other<00:03:17.600> battery<00:03:18.049> box<00:03:18.290> in<00:03:18.530> there

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
have do the other battery box in there

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.259 
have do the other battery box in there
sectioned<00:03:20.060> off<00:03:20.209> carpet<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.930> off<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:22.269> that'll

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
sectioned off carpet it off and that'll

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.750 
sectioned off carpet it off and that'll
be<00:03:23.480> hopefully<00:03:24.350> how<00:03:24.470> it'll<00:03:24.620> all<00:03:24.829> look<00:03:25.130> pretty

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
be hopefully how it'll all look pretty

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.210 
be hopefully how it'll all look pretty
much<00:03:26.680> pretty<00:03:27.680> much<00:03:27.829> standard<00:03:28.609> so<00:03:30.100> see<00:03:31.100> if<00:03:31.160> we

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
much pretty much standard so see if we

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.680 
much pretty much standard so see if we
can<00:03:31.340> go<00:03:31.459> ahead<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:31.850> get<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.410> box<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.739> are<00:03:37.690> see

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
can go ahead and get the box and are see

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:51.790 
can go ahead and get the box and are see
how<00:03:38.870> it's<00:03:39.019> gonna<00:03:39.200> turn<00:03:39.440> out

crap huh be able to section all that off
still<00:04:18.120> have<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:18.479> much<00:04:18.720> boot<00:04:19.019> space<00:04:19.320> and

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
still have that much boot space and

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.159 
still have that much boot space and
still<00:04:19.950> have<00:04:20.239> well<00:04:21.239> over<00:04:21.299> half<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:22.049> required

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
still have well over half the required

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.060 
still have well over half the required
amount<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:23.010> cells<00:04:23.340> back<00:04:23.700> here<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.919> that<00:04:25.919> is

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
amount of cells back here so that is

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.969 
amount of cells back here so that is
just<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.150> forced<00:04:27.510> look<00:04:27.720> at<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.050> battery<00:04:28.590> boxes

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
just a forced look at the battery boxes

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.830 
just a forced look at the battery boxes
and<00:04:30.470> we'll<00:04:31.470> be<00:04:31.790> getting<00:04:32.790> some<00:04:32.970> cells<00:04:33.450> who<00:04:33.690> have

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
and we'll be getting some cells who have

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.440 
and we'll be getting some cells who have
themselves<00:04:34.729> already<00:04:35.729> in<00:04:38.210> using<00:04:39.210> some<00:04:39.419> of

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
themselves already in using some of

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.780 
themselves already in using some of
these<00:04:42.710> underfloor<00:04:43.710> heating<00:04:43.979> mats<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:44.550> there

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
these underfloor heating mats in there

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.600 
these underfloor heating mats in there
with<00:04:45.000> some<00:04:45.680> odds<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.919> sods<00:04:47.070> for<00:04:47.430> doing<00:04:47.580> a

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
with some odds and sods for doing a

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.730 
with some odds and sods for doing a
little<00:04:47.729> bit<00:04:47.910> about<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.360> warming<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:49.440> very

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
little bit about you warming it's very

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.340 
little bit about you warming it's very
important<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:54.090> that'll<00:04:54.360> be<00:04:54.479> -<00:04:54.539> that'll<00:04:55.320> be

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
important and so that'll be - that'll be

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.400 
important and so that'll be - that'll be
the<00:04:55.560> battery<00:04:56.180> box<00:04:57.180> area<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.930> rear<00:04:58.140> of<00:04:58.169> the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
the battery box area in the rear of the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.080 
the battery box area in the rear of the
car<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.890> then<00:04:59.310> one<00:04:59.460> sense<00:04:59.729> is<00:04:59.910> quite

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
car and then one sense is quite

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.940 
car and then one sense is quite
fortunate<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.720> I<00:05:00.840> can<00:05:00.960> get<00:05:01.140> this<00:05:01.289> many<00:05:01.590> cells

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
fortunate that I can get this many cells

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.680 
fortunate that I can get this many cells
in<00:05:02.220> here

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
in here

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.870 
in here
it<00:05:04.050> means<00:05:04.229> I<00:05:04.350> don't<00:05:04.380> have<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.800> do<00:05:05.010> any<00:05:05.190> coating

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
it means I don't have to do any coating

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.980 
it means I don't have to do any coating
it<00:05:06.000> underneath<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:07.520> rear<00:05:08.520> seats<00:05:08.880> don't<00:05:09.810> need

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
it underneath the rear seats don't need

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.020 
it underneath the rear seats don't need
to<00:05:10.110> do<00:05:10.229> that<00:05:10.440> we'll<00:05:11.430> be<00:05:11.460> doing<00:05:11.640> any<00:05:11.940> other

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
to do that we'll be doing any other

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.510 
to do that we'll be doing any other
chassis<00:05:12.870> modifications<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:13.979> car<00:05:14.370> which

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
chassis modifications to the car which

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.409 
chassis modifications to the car which
is<00:05:17.520> quite<00:05:18.200> important<00:05:19.200> so<00:05:19.729> that's<00:05:20.729> it<00:05:20.970> just<00:05:21.330> a

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
is quite important so that's it just a

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.440 
is quite important so that's it just a
little<00:05:21.720> forced<00:05:22.590> taste<00:05:22.860> or<00:05:23.100> on<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.520> battery

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
little forced taste or on the battery

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.350 
little forced taste or on the battery
boxes<00:05:24.840> I<00:05:28.070> just<00:05:29.070> thought<00:05:29.250> I'd<00:05:29.490> go<00:05:29.669> ahead<00:05:29.789> Darren

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
boxes I just thought I'd go ahead Darren

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.260 
boxes I just thought I'd go ahead Darren
just<00:05:30.680> test<00:05:31.680> fit<00:05:31.979> a<00:05:32.010> couple<00:05:32.310> of<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.580> cells<00:05:32.820> into

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
just test fit a couple of the cells into

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.050 
just test fit a couple of the cells into
that<00:05:33.390> battery<00:05:33.870> box<00:05:34.400> as<00:05:35.400> I'm<00:05:35.550> hoping<00:05:35.880> we<00:05:36.030> can

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
that battery box as I'm hoping we can

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.570

Galaxy here just sort of try it out has
to<00:05:49.050> be<00:05:49.139> better<00:05:49.320> than<00:05:49.500> that<00:05:49.590> crappy<00:05:49.979> camcorder

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760

battery box
kind<00:06:00.689> of<00:06:00.809> suspect<00:06:01.259> this<00:06:01.409> is<00:06:01.469> gonna<00:06:01.800> work<00:06:02.069> out

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
kind of suspect this is gonna work out

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.450 
kind of suspect this is gonna work out
on<00:06:04.139> our<00:06:05.119> wheel<00:06:06.119> well<00:06:06.330> battery<00:06:06.779> box<00:06:06.990> down<00:06:07.289> here

on our wheel well battery box down here
so<00:06:08.460> that<00:06:08.490> needs<00:06:08.849> to<00:06:08.999> be<00:06:09.029> installed<00:06:09.240> it's<00:06:09.719> just

00:06:09.859 --> 00:06:09.869 
so that needs to be installed it's just

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.179 
so that needs to be installed it's just
basically<00:06:10.139> sitting<00:06:10.469> there<00:06:10.740> just<00:06:10.979> for<00:06:11.129> a

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:11.189 
basically sitting there just for a

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:16.760 
basically sitting there just for a
