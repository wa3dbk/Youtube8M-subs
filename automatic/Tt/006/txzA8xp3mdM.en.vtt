 hello youtube friends we are in the 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.109
 channel itec and today we're going to see how it has 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.599
 been the evolution of the ipad throughout 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.750
 its existence especially in design 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.519
 functionality and performance as always 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.500
 remind you that you can follow us in 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.090
 our social networks to find out 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.550
 before anyone of the news of the 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.730
 channel and interact with us from a 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.370
 more directly and now if we go with 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.770
 the video 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.470
 the first ipad tran alone for apple has 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.860
 a 9.7 inches with a 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:38.230
 pixel density is 132 dpi on 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.930
 Wi-Fi model weighs 680 grams and 3g 730 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.570
 the thickness of this device is over 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.110
 of a centimeter as a processor has 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.770
 the single-core a4 chip that runs 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.470
 a gigahercio and its ram memory is 256 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.530
 megabytes its design is improved in 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.030
 small details on the ipad2 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.920
 device with which unfortunately 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.640
 we could not count to do this 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.830
 video the ipad2 is much more powerful 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.080
 has a faster processor and counts 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.270
 with more ram memory 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.760
 the rear cameras are added and 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.220
 frontal and little else we could say that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.890
 the light dots is an ipad one retouched 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.230
 because there are not many changes in the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.300
 third generation of the ipad brought many 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.650
 new features including the retina screen 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:29.790
 with a resolution of 2048 x 1536 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.920
 pixels what leaves us 264 pixels by 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.390
 inch twice the generations 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.380
 previous 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.250
 its weight drops to 635 grams and its 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.610
 thickness stays at 9.4 millimeters account 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.490
 with the a5 x chip and a ram memory of 1 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.920
 gb the cameras also include improvements 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.930
 and we can see how the lines 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.130
 squares of the first ipad are going 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.890
 losing and the design is more rounded 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.049
 just six months later apple 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.329
 launches the fourth generation of ipads 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.040
 creating some controversy for the little 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.700
 elapsed time 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.649
 of this generation are the following 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.580
 a6 x processor that doubles the speed 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.170
 ipad 3 wifi faster connectivity 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.200
 4g international 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.930
 The new connector mining improvements in 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.790
 cameras and something very important the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.610
 prices were the same as those of its 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.850
 predecessor 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.580
 the ipad was the most advanced ipad 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.400
 the date its attractive design breaks with 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.070
 the above is considerably more 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.380
 thin with a smaller body due to 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.170
 use of frames and very 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.810
 light its lines are the same as the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.560
 from his younger brother the ipad mini and his 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.780
 thickness is only 7.4 millimeters apart 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.230
 of the face wash with respect to the design 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.140
 learn includes a 7 64 processor 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.840
 bits and the motion processor co m 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.510
 7 the ipad has always been a reference 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.530
 in the tablet world and even if it's not 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.270
 perfect 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.880
 I think the pater is a great device 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.700
 and that the best we can buy if 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.820
 we look for benefits and design something 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.200
 key in the development of the ipad is ios and 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.180
 the ecosystem of apps that have gone 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.280
 creating around this product and 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.290
 I think that is the step there 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.290
 between the tablets of the competition and the 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.510
 of apolo the experience of use is great 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.400
 and I would recommend one hundred percent 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.330
 buy an ipad 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.500
 regardless of whether you are going to use it 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.660
 for leisure or work or both the ipad is 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.120
 a very useful device itself and that 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.920
 also has the support of 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.770
 Many companies that manufacture 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.170
 accessories for the something that opens a 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.050
 world of possibilities to the use that you 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.940
 you can give an ipad to finish me 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.820
 I would like you to leave a comment with 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.390
 Your opinion I hope you liked it 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.490
 it's like that 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.110
 Like it and do not forget to subscribe to
