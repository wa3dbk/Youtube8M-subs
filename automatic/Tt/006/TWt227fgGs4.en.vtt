00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
corner is cut out of the top right easy

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.780 
corner is cut out of the top right easy
to<00:01:51.400> be<00:01:51.520> there<00:01:51.780> same<00:01:52.780> thing<00:01:52.960> on<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.170> adapter

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to be there same thing on the adapter

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.730 
to be there same thing on the adapter
top<00:01:54.790> right<00:01:55.000> corner<00:01:55.180> cut<00:01:55.600> out<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.500> we<00:01:56.590> match

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
top right corner cut out so we match

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.820 
top right corner cut out so we match
those<00:01:56.979> up<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.840> then<00:01:59.260> once<00:01:59.409> we<00:01:59.560> have<00:01:59.710> those

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
those up and then once we have those

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.649 
those up and then once we have those
matched<00:02:00.100> up<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.290> put<00:02:02.440> it<00:02:02.470> back<00:02:02.619> on<00:02:02.680> our<00:02:03.659> SIM

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
matched up and put it back on our SIM

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.320 
matched up and put it back on our SIM

you want to match up the hole right here

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.120 
you want to match up the hole right here
on<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.590> SIM<00:02:41.739> card<00:02:41.920> tray<00:02:42.480> right

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
on the SIM card tray right

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.910 
on the SIM card tray right
put<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.310> there<00:02:45.400> like<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:46.650> gently<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
put it in there like that gently and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.960 
put it in there like that gently and
then<00:02:47.950> you'll<00:02:48.160> notice<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.640> top<00:02:48.790> it's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
then you'll notice that the top it's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.050 
then you'll notice that the top it's
going<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.150> get<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.300> little<00:02:49.450> bit<00:02:49.690> more<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.970> little

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
going to get a little bit more a little

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.350 
going to get a little bit more a little
tougher<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.080> put<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.790> shouldn't<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.210> to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
tougher to put in you shouldn't have to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.610 
tougher to put in you shouldn't have to
totally<00:02:55.570> force<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.290> shouldn't<00:02:56.530> have

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
totally force it in you shouldn't have

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.020 
totally force it in you shouldn't have
to<00:02:56.710> use<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.830> lot<00:02:57.100> of<00:02:57.220> strength<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.670> put<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:57.910> in

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
to use a lot of strength to put it in

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.430 
to use a lot of strength to put it in
you<00:02:58.480> should<00:02:58.660> just<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:58.840> able<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.110> pop<00:02:59.260> your

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
you should just be able to pop your

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.380 
you should just be able to pop your
thumb<00:02:59.650> right<00:02:59.770> on<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.550> push<00:03:01.270> it

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
thumb right on it like this and push it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.530 
thumb right on it like this and push it
down<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:03.190> might<00:03:03.400> take<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.670> little<00:03:03.940> bit<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.210> a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
down it might take a little bit of a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.160 
down it might take a little bit of a
push<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:06.150> you'll<00:03:07.150> be<00:03:07.240> able<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.600> know<00:03:07.870> if

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
push but you'll be able to know if

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.660 
push but you'll be able to know if
you're<00:03:08.560> pushing<00:03:08.890> really<00:03:09.010> hard<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.580> it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
you're pushing really hard and it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.420 
you're pushing really hard and it
doesn't<00:03:09.970> go<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.150> that<00:03:10.240> it's<00:03:10.390> not<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:12.220> SIM

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
doesn't go in that it's not in the SIM

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.840 
doesn't go in that it's not in the SIM
card<00:03:12.670> tray<00:03:12.810> properly<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:14.170> pop<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.440> back<00:03:14.470> out

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
card tray properly just pop it back out

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.060 
card tray properly just pop it back out
and<00:03:15.850> then<00:03:16.000> stick<00:03:16.240> it<00:03:16.270> back<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.950> with<00:03:17.950> these

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
and then stick it back in with these

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.990 
and then stick it back in with these
some<00:03:18.280> adapters<00:03:18.700> if<00:03:19.210> you<00:03:19.420> bend<00:03:19.750> them<00:03:19.960> severely

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
some adapters if you bend them severely

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.670 
some adapters if you bend them severely
like<00:03:22.000> if<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.240> make<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> crease<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.900> them<00:03:23.050> they

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
like if you make a crease in them they

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.710 
like if you make a crease in them they
will<00:03:23.920> no<00:03:24.070> longer<00:03:24.100> work<00:03:24.460> so<00:03:25.120> be<00:03:25.360> careful<00:03:25.630> when

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
will no longer work so be careful when

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.630 
will no longer work so be careful when
you<00:03:25.780> put<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.020> in<00:03:26.140> it's<00:03:27.130> really<00:03:27.340> not<00:03:27.460> that<00:03:27.520> hard

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640
