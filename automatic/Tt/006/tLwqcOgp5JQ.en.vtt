00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
I'm doing very well I've healed very

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.689 
I'm doing very well I've healed very
well<00:00:18.510> from<00:00:19.109> surgery<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.590> think<00:00:19.859> my<00:00:19.980> last<00:00:20.250> video

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
well from surgery I think my last video

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.970 
well from surgery I think my last video
was<00:00:21.000> about<00:00:21.240> four<00:00:21.570> weeks<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:22.020> I've<00:00:22.769> had

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
was about four weeks out I've had

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.390 
was about four weeks out I've had
absolutely<00:00:23.609> no<00:00:23.850> complication<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.400> it's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
absolutely no complication so it's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.070 
absolutely no complication so it's
really<00:00:26.640> hard<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.150> believe<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.630> even<00:00:27.900> had

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
really hard to believe that I even had

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.500 
really hard to believe that I even had
surgery<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.070> very<00:00:29.099> easy<00:00:29.670> surgery<00:00:30.359> with

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
surgery it's a very easy surgery with

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.749 
surgery it's a very easy surgery with
the<00:00:31.109> right<00:00:31.289> surgeon<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.189> follow-up

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the right surgeon in the right follow-up

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.100 
the right surgeon in the right follow-up
care<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.750> been<00:00:33.870> an<00:00:33.989> amazing

today<00:00:39.000> very<00:00:39.660> hard<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> believe<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.129> am<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
today very hard to believe so I am a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
today very hard to believe so I am a
little<00:00:41.640> about<00:00:42.300> three<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> half<00:00:42.690> months<00:00:42.989> out

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
I am down 45 pounds ok which is very

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.430 
I am down 45 pounds ok which is very
very<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:47.219> exciting<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:48.750> weight<00:00:48.930> loss<00:00:49.110> has

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
very very exciting the weight loss has

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.119 
very very exciting the weight loss has
slowed<00:00:49.860> down<00:00:50.160> dramatically<00:00:50.760> which<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.570> okay

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
slowed down dramatically which is okay

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.850 
slowed down dramatically which is okay
it's<00:00:53.180> really<00:00:54.180> about<00:00:54.510> two<00:00:54.930> pounds<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.379> week<00:00:55.530> 1

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
it's really about two pounds a week 1

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.160 
it's really about two pounds a week 1
pound<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> week<00:00:56.370> sometimes<00:00:56.969> 0<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> week<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
pound a week sometimes 0 a week so the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.459 
pound a week sometimes 0 a week so the
ups<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.500> downs<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> mental<00:00:59.489> battle<00:00:59.640> are

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
ups and downs and the mental battle are

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.599 
ups and downs and the mental battle are
really<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> hardest<00:01:01.770> challenges<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.489> I'm

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
really the hardest challenges that I'm

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.149 
really the hardest challenges that I'm
trying<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> overcome<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:04.530> seeing<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
trying to overcome is not seeing the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
trying to overcome is not seeing the
scale<00:01:05.460> drop<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:05.970> quickly<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.450> I'd<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
scale drop as quickly as I'd like but I

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320 
scale drop as quickly as I'd like but I
know<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.860> slow<00:01:08.700> weight<00:01:09.119> loss

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
know this is a very slow weight loss

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390 
know this is a very slow weight loss
process<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.229> want<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.619> permanent<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
process and I want it to be permanent so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.679 
process and I want it to be permanent so
I<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.640> want<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.850> make<00:01:11.909> sure<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.270> I'm<00:01:12.330> losing

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
I just want to make sure that I'm losing

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.830 
I just want to make sure that I'm losing
weight<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.680> safe<00:01:13.950> manner<00:01:14.540> I've<00:01:15.540> come

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
weight in a very safe manner I've come

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
weight in a very safe manner I've come
to<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.020> point<00:01:16.229> where<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.490> don't<00:01:17.700> work

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
to a point where really if I don't work

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.270 
to a point where really if I don't work
out<00:01:18.119> I'm<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.600> losing<00:01:18.810> weight<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.009> it's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
out I'm not losing weight so it's it's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
out I'm not losing weight so it's it's
not<00:01:20.520> easy<00:01:20.880> weight<00:01:21.180> loss<00:01:21.420> people<00:01:22.200> think

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
not easy weight loss people think

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.499 
not easy weight loss people think
sometimes<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.520> falls<00:01:23.850> off<00:01:24.090> but

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
sometimes that it just falls off but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
sometimes that it just falls off but
certainly<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> case<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.310> me

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
certainly that's not the case for me

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.149 
certainly that's not the case for me
right<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.299> exercising<00:01:27.829> for<00:01:28.829> about<00:01:29.009> an

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
right now I'm exercising for about an

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.520 
right now I'm exercising for about an
hour<00:01:29.280> three<00:01:29.850> times<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.210> week<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:31.229> doing

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
hour three times a week just doing

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.980 
hour three times a week just doing
cardio<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.509> feel<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> I'm

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
cardio and so I really feel that I'm

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.950 
cardio and so I really feel that I'm
need<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.710> implement<00:01:35.220> some<00:01:35.700> weights<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
need to implement some weights in that

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260 
need to implement some weights in that
for<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> weight<00:01:37.439> loss<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.829> continue<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.700> i'll

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
for the weight loss to continue so i'll

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.880 
for the weight loss to continue so i'll
be<00:01:39.450> starting<00:01:39.689> weights<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> trainer<00:01:40.590> next

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
