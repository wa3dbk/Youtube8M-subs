00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
yeah I think that's a big key for us to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.580 
yeah I think that's a big key for us to
you<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.390> lot<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> guys<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.780> banged<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you know a lot of guys are banged up and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260 
you know a lot of guys are banged up and
no<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.369> knows<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.149> keep

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
no one really knows it because we keep

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.880 
no one really knows it because we keep
everything<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.930> isolate<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.500> inside<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
everything to isolate it inside the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.859 
everything to isolate it inside the
practices<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.939> think<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> good

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
practices but I think this is a good

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.999 
practices but I think this is a good
time<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.079> everybody<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.649> back<00:01:55.799> healthy

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
time for everybody to get back healthy

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
time for everybody to get back healthy
so<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.460> move<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.790> strength<00:01:57.119> january

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
so we can move for strength january

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.550 
so we can move for strength january
