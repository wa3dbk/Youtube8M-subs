00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the narrow width so I still consider it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.910 
the narrow width so I still consider it
a<00:03:39.330> negative<00:03:39.510> because<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.440> want<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.650> shoe<00:03:40.800> to

as<00:04:16.759> I<00:04:16.849> understand<00:04:17.269> why<00:04:17.509> you<00:04:17.569> have<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.139> maybe

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
as I understand why you have it maybe

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.649 
as I understand why you have it maybe
like<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.530> kick<00:04:19.069> guard<00:04:19.310> something<00:04:19.669> like<00:04:19.819> that<00:04:20.030> it

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
like a kick guard something like that it

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.450 
like a kick guard something like that it
comes<00:04:20.900> back<00:04:21.079> a<00:04:21.139> little<00:04:21.560> too<00:04:21.709> far<00:04:22.039> and<00:04:22.250> I've

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
comes back a little too far and I've

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.999 
comes back a little too far and I've
gotten<00:04:22.909> my<00:04:23.060> big<00:04:23.330> toenail<00:04:23.599> stuck<00:04:24.530> up<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:24.830> it

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
gotten my big toenail stuck up on it

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.189 
gotten my big toenail stuck up on it
before<00:04:25.159> and<00:04:25.669> that<00:04:26.000> hurts<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.629> again<00:04:27.080> the

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
before and that hurts and again the

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.050 
before and that hurts and again the
final<00:04:27.319> dislike<00:04:27.800> is<00:04:28.009> that<00:04:28.159> it's<00:04:28.280> not<00:04:28.430> zero<00:04:28.789> drop

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
final dislike is that it's not zero drop

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.119 
final dislike is that it's not zero drop
