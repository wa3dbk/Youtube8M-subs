00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:01.620
 with blocks in practice it can so I can 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.720

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:11.759

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.440

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:42.030
 they know of a block alarm in minecraft 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:44.100
 in other words, with the processes they go with the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.700
 knife then because he speaks impart 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.520
 very sharp knife with a preone knife 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.750

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.580
