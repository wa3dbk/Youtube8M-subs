game<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:47.800> reason<00:01:48.010> you<00:01:48.070> want<00:01:48.160> the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
game and the reason you want the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.430 
game and the reason you want the
directional<00:01:48.550> buttons<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.060> can<00:01:49.180> then<00:01:49.510> you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
directional buttons so you can then you

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.900 
directional buttons so you can then you
can<00:01:50.590> go<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:50.920> those<00:01:51.070> directions<00:01:51.430> with<00:01:51.760> your

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
can go in those directions with your

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.280 
can go in those directions with your
leap<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:52.360> let's<00:01:52.510> say<00:01:52.600> I'm<00:01:52.690> running<00:01:52.780> forward<00:01:53.230> I

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
keyboard at least when it comes to

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.390 
keyboard at least when it comes to
strafing<00:02:14.080> left<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.560> right<00:02:14.740> moving<00:02:15.100> forward

strafing left and right moving forward

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.110 
strafing left and right moving forward
moving<00:02:15.580> backward

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
moving backward

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.820 
moving backward
and<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:17.230> want<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.470> be<00:02:17.560> doing<00:02:17.709> that

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
and you want to be doing that

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.520 
and you want to be doing that
simultaneously<00:02:18.370> with<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.510> leap<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:19.959> well<00:02:20.380> as

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
simultaneously with a leap as well as

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.440 
simultaneously with a leap as well as
maybe<00:02:20.950> pressing<00:02:21.370> an<00:02:21.459> ability<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:22.360> know

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
maybe pressing an ability you know

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.390 
maybe pressing an ability you know
before<00:02:22.780> or<00:02:22.900> after<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:23.860> very<00:02:24.010> important

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
before or after so it's very important

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.890 
before or after so it's very important
they<00:02:24.489> have<00:02:24.610> more<00:02:24.940> complete<00:02:25.390> control<00:02:25.690> and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
they have more complete control and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.990 
they have more complete control and
those<00:02:26.500> situations<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.459> others<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:27.819> games

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
those situations as in others in games

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.670 
those situations as in others in games
like<00:02:28.180> World<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.420> Warcraft<00:02:28.840> when<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.470> comes<00:02:29.590> to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
like World of Warcraft when it comes to

that any mobility based ability I feel

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.490 
that any mobility based ability I feel
should<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.849> down<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.269> mouse<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:35.380> is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
should be down to the mouse and this is

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.380 
should be down to the mouse and this is
no<00:02:35.650> exception<00:02:36.420> now<00:02:37.420> also<00:02:37.690> when<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.019> comes<00:02:38.230> to

that's default on the DoubleTap to evade
this<00:02:50.319> thing's<00:02:50.530> pretty<00:02:50.680> stupid<00:02:51.060> basically<00:02:52.060> if

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
twice you'll actually leap forward and

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.750 
twice you'll actually leap forward and
stuff<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.100> turn<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.130> off<00:02:57.340> save

yourself the headache also it comes to

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.800 
yourself the headache also it comes to
options<00:03:00.880> here<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.209> know<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:01.330> move<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.690> camera

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
options here you know I move the camera

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.050 
options here you know I move the camera
really<00:03:02.080> fast<00:03:02.380> but<00:03:02.709> when<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.670> first<00:03:03.819> started

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
really fast but when I first started

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.309 
really fast but when I first started
playing<00:03:04.150> game<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.540> rotation<00:03:04.930> speed<00:03:05.110> was<00:03:05.200> all

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
playing game this rotation speed was all

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.770 
playing game this rotation speed was all
the<00:03:05.380> way<00:03:05.500> down<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:06.130> you<00:03:06.790> know<00:03:06.880> I'm<00:03:07.150> moving<00:03:07.450> like

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
the way down so you know I'm moving like

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.680 
the way down so you know I'm moving like
my<00:03:08.500> mouse<00:03:08.680> just<00:03:09.040> as<00:03:09.160> fast<00:03:09.400> as<00:03:09.549> I<00:03:09.640> was<00:03:09.819> earlier

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
my mouse just as fast as I was earlier

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.289 
my mouse just as fast as I was earlier
it's<00:03:11.549> absolutely<00:03:12.549> abysmal<00:03:13.360> like<00:03:14.049> I<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:16.000> fact

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
it's absolutely abysmal like I the fact

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.640 
it's absolutely abysmal like I the fact
that<00:03:16.450> there<00:03:16.569> is<00:03:16.750> an<00:03:16.930> option<00:03:17.290> like<00:03:17.319> this<00:03:17.440> the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
that there is an option like this the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.110 
that there is an option like this the
other<00:03:17.709> game<00:03:17.950> blows<00:03:18.250> my<00:03:18.430> mind<00:03:18.670> but<00:03:18.970> that's

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
other game blows my mind but that's

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.509 
other game blows my mind but that's
that's<00:03:19.360> okay<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.650> know<00:03:20.739> there's<00:03:21.250> many

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
that's okay you know there's many

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.310 
that's okay you know there's many
problems<00:03:21.970> with<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.120> game<00:03:22.299> but<00:03:22.630> uh<00:03:22.660> I'm

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
problems with a game but uh I'm

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.080 
problems with a game but uh I'm
optimistic<00:03:23.739> about<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.370> really<00:03:24.820> like<00:03:24.940> the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
optimistic about it I really like the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.970 
optimistic about it I really like the
game<00:03:25.269> there's<00:03:25.510> so<00:03:25.720> much<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.290> maybe<00:03:26.709> they

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
game there's so much to it so maybe they

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.830 
game there's so much to it so maybe they
just<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.549> know<00:03:27.579> I<00:03:27.670> didn't<00:03:27.850> have<00:03:27.910> enough<00:03:28.690> time

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
just you know I didn't have enough time

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.390 
just you know I didn't have enough time
to<00:03:28.900> polish<00:03:29.260> everything<00:03:29.530> but<00:03:29.769> that's<00:03:29.890> okay<00:03:30.190> so

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
to polish everything but that's okay so

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.099 
to polish everything but that's okay so
basically<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.359> want<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.660> little<00:03:31.780> rotation

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
basically you want that little rotation

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.470 
basically you want that little rotation
thing<00:03:32.500> all<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.950> way<00:03:33.069> up<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.480> possibly

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
thing all the way up and possibly

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.030 
thing all the way up and possibly
there's<00:03:34.989> somewhere<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.410> hack<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.709> game<00:03:35.829> to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
there's somewhere to hack the game to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.250 
there's somewhere to hack the game to
actually<00:03:36.340> turn<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.640> past<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.209> bat<00:03:37.959> value

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
actually turn it past the bat value

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.660 
actually turn it past the bat value
because<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.560> still<00:03:38.769> feel<00:03:38.829> it's<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.160> little<00:03:39.190> slow

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
because I still feel it's a little slow

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.789 
because I still feel it's a little slow
I<00:03:39.700> still<00:03:40.060> feel<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.239> little<00:03:40.359> bit<00:03:40.630> of<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.780> kink<00:03:41.019> and

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
I still feel a little bit of a kink and

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.380 
I still feel a little bit of a kink and
I<00:03:41.950> don't<00:03:42.010> really<00:03:42.280> like<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.459> too<00:03:42.850> much<00:03:43.000> but

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
I don't really like that too much but

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.990 
I don't really like that too much but
that's<00:03:43.810> alright<00:03:44.459> now<00:03:45.459> when<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.760> comes<00:03:45.880> to

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
that's alright now when it comes to

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.970 
that's alright now when it comes to
playing<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> game<00:03:49.620> there<00:03:50.620> really<00:03:50.769> is<00:03:50.950> another

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980
