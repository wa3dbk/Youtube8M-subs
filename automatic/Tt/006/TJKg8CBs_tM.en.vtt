00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.280
 hello with good piss well let's go with the 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.580
 last review of tobaccos today and what is 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.010
 which corresponds to the 1792 flake of 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.200
 samula wave dsg 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.170
 good to say that as an introduction that 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.230
 this is one of the tasks that was 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.920
 withdrawal of 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.440
 for sale in Spain 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.010
 and good me in thanks to God yet 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.190
 I keep a few cans but good 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.940
 a withdrawal of various tasks I 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:41.010
 imagine that yes because no 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.109
 they did not have much sale 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.059
 and good and one of them because it was 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:50.720
 unfortunately this one 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.720
 in 1792 flake of samuel a wave good 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.620
 say that we are facing a tobacco that in 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.500
 As regards its flavor and aroma 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:06.200
 they hardly forget is a 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:10.780
 strong mix of virginia kentucky and ya 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.780
 the pair is flavored with the button k 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.070
 and good that they have a 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.040
 it produces a flavor and has a very 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.380
 special is it keeps a load 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.660
 important nicotinic that added to its 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.390
 nuanced ring that some can 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.360
 consider good cloying 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.210
 make it not a tobacco to smoke to 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.800
 all hours or every day because 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.159
 can end up tiring for people who 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.250
 start not, then maybe I should say that 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.430
 if they approach him they do so with certain 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.430
 caution 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.330
 I particularly trained him in cazones 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.130
 so medium small 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.650
 and not too often 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.230
 it is a tobacco we would say to smoke with 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:11.580
 something in the stomach 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.580
 Well, with regard to pain in the cold 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.250
 well first we will say that the flakes 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.849
 as we can see they are completely 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:28.980
 irregularities as is typical of those of the 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:30.890
 salmon water flex from a very brown 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.580
 Dark 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:39.820
 and good about cold smell 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.740
 It is that it could tonka is 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.590
 unquestionable let's go is a seed 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.580
 used in confectionery mixology 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.680
 perfumery and has an aroma that is 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.470
 hardly describable 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.540
 if anything 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.540
 because something like 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:07.300
 like vanilla cinnamon cloves 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:11.620
 from a certain aspect if there is 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.100
 word in quotes chocolatoso is 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.100
 a 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.890
 special or a seed with a flavor 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.730
 good with a smell better said very 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.730
 particular 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.709
 in the button k contains as flour that 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.920
 it is an anticoagulant that's why in some 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.959
 countries well then the mind 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.550
 marketing of this seed then 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.990
 It is forbidden 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.680
 because in large quantities it can be 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:48.750
 dangerous however good as I have 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.380
 used as a dressing because no it is not 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.380
 good and say 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.210
 Underlies an earthy aroma that is very 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.210
 I presented 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.810
 that's what I take out in the smell in 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.510
 good cold and as you can see it is a 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.510
 Intense and dark brown 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.840
 well 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:22.979
 Regarding the smoke we can say 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.979
 her and this flake 1792 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.780
 Well first of all it's a job what 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.750
 that comes enough humidity 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.630
 as always because I leave it to chant 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.090
 in this particular case of this work 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.590
 from samuel gawith so much more 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.860
 I let you create a couple of hours in 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:50.840
 on top of an absorbent paper 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:55.849
 and good to say that it is a strong tobacco 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.689
 It is powerful but at the same time it is sweet and well 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.430
 tasty 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:04.810
 produces a very dense smoke quite 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.960
 white like movie 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.750
 and smoking quietly because no no 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.360
 degrades and remains practically the same 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.500
 until 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.500
 until the end 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.689
 at times it has certain touches 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.400
 alchorados 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.350
 Y 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.670
 but good the truth that I have smoked 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.170
 slow way 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:34.550
 it's very creamy and I 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.550
 least he got a great game 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.710
 it's a tobacco with great personality maybe 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.000
 therefore it is not a tobacco that 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.670
 we would call at all of diary but 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.700
 it's really rich 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:55.240
 for my taste leaves a white ash 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.240
 Y 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.419
 that combination of virginia and kentucky 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.430
 For my taste it is delicious but as 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.969
 as a curious comment 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.279
 I would say the aroma 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:12.519
 that leaves at least my wife calls 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:14.079
 the smell of emetic tobacco is in fact 

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:15.729
 is the only thing that he does not support and when 

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:18.779
 he founded in the house because they let him the truth 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.779
 that problems always arise 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:25.180
 for my taste it is an excellent 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.180
 flavored virginia and kentucky 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:32.860
 I could say that it is powerful and sweet to 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.349
 the time and that once tested I think not 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.229
 is forgotten because it combines that pink tea and 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:40.330
 dady my delicious strength is with that 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.670
 almost sweetness of cake as of 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:47.310
 candy 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:50.730
 maybe it's not a subtle tobacco 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:55.050
 well I do not know multidimensional as well 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:07:00.150
 say it but it is satisfactory one hundred 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:03.080
 one hundred and I with him enjoyed a few moments 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.080
 of scandal the truth 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:12.370
 a highly recommended tobacco if we already have 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.520
 some experience with certain tobacco 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.520
 force 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.780
 Well, this is the review of 1792 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.750
 flake by samuel gawith I hope that you 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:25.240
 help you like it and many 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.630
 thanks for watching as always and a cut 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.630
 of the greeting
