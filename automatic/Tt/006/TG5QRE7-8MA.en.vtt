chipset and the screen size is a 3.5

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.889 
chipset and the screen size is a 3.5
inch<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> resolution<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> i<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.489> vga<00:00:32.910> so

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
inch and the resolution is i have vga so

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
inch and the resolution is i have vga so
the<00:00:34.140> key<00:00:34.469> thing<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.040> device<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the key thing about this device is that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.160 
the key thing about this device is that
it<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.210> only<00:00:36.739> power<00:00:37.739> x<00:00:38.070> 128<00:00:39.000> megabytes<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.899> ram

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it is only power x 128 megabytes of ram

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.889 
it is only power x 128 megabytes of ram
so<00:00:40.649> which<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> only<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.879> half<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.660> one

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
so which is only one half we're one

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.139 
so which is only one half we're one
