00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello guys and welcome back kitchen in 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.160
 this new video one of my recipes 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.529
 also prefer one of the most requested 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.090
 maybe I'm talking about chicken and parmesan 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.860
 question preview of what you 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.389
 wait but as usual we learn about 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.519
 useless chatter we go to the kitchen 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:23.699
 see how 5 this great crazy parade 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:25.529
 Parmesan ok girl before she doesn't know 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.529
 do is take 4 chicken breasts and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 cut them in half to get eight shares 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.440
 ok you must have gotten pieces of 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.940
 chicken of this size more or less ok 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.670
 at this point we put aside the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.170
 our chicken and see the second phase 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.360
 of our research 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 exactly we have to put 60 g of 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.809
 Parmesan cheese in a bowl in half a cup 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 oatmeal or if you prefer bread 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.539
 grated whole in this case 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.539
 illusion rate of oats 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.339
 at this point it is optional ingredient 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.020
 feel free to put the spaces in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.010
 this case of use of bees up and black 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.880
 of the white pepper said by hook 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.259
 finally a team of extra virgin olive oil wine 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.920
 so at this point there remains only that 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.920
 mix everything 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.420
 ok guys at this point we do not stay 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.610
 which take the eggs exactly white 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.290
 egg and put them this stop for 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 this point all you have to do is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.840
 take your for your countries with 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.909
 long dye them first in egg white 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.450
 then in our our basic compound 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.450
 of avila 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.880
 so let's put everyone on a baking tray from 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.070
 oven and repeat the process with 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.070
 all other pieces of point vectors 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.319
 ok at this point the compound is advanced 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.790
 feel free to put it in center 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.790
 so as to advance nothing 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.330
 at this point our poles are 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.099
 perfectly learned we remain that the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.860
 optional pier put another for 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.480
 another splash of olive oil 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.239
 then close our container 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.430
 aluminum 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.830
 then put in the oven at 180 200 degrees 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.580
 for 30 35 minutes also depending on the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.580
 your type ii 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.550
 ok guys after about 30 35 minutes i 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.790
 our point should be 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.160
 be done from this point to 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.860
 diversify the usual recipes a little 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.200
 my usual advice is usually 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:07.020
 put for this tomato recipe 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.790
 this simple type type from pasta ok 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.350
 finally to make it even more 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.910
 another tasty one is grant 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.510
 absolutely optional of being 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.640
 May write 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.270
 we always put in china over the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.270
 tomato 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.320
 ok to finish we put it in the oven again 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.020
 for 10 minutes to melt 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.810
 blend the cheese well afterwards 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.830
 another ten minutes finally ours 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.080
 our chicken breasts are 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.940
 perfectly ready as you see the 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.170
 cheese is perfectly on top of someone 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.380
 we have nothing left of gold 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.090
 put in a dish portion years in 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.830
 this case I prepared a dish for him 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.360
 with the of the opening exactly are 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.540
 300 grams between the roccoli and bottoms 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.250
 and this guys the end result 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.980
 this chicken is truly exceptional one 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.810
