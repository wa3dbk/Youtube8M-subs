what<00:00:04.049> you<00:00:04.200> see<00:00:04.410> now<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.480> aircraft<00:00:06.480> flying

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
what you see now is the aircraft flying

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.839 
what you see now is the aircraft flying
over<00:00:07.109> life<00:00:07.820> from<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.940> USA<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:10.170> Europe<00:00:10.849> across

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
over life from the USA to Europe across

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.049 
over life from the USA to Europe across
to<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> UK<00:00:13.250> and<00:00:14.250> I'm<00:00:14.340> going<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.580> track<00:00:14.849> them

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
to the UK and I'm going to track them

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.080 
to the UK and I'm going to track them
with<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> cloud<00:00:15.839> formations<00:00:16.940> there<00:00:17.940> are

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
with the cloud formations there are

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.349 
with the cloud formations there are
hundreds<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.810> them<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.710> fleets<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.359> are

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
hundreds of them and the fleets that are

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.950 
hundreds of them and the fleets that are
being<00:00:21.750> used<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.920> know<00:00:23.269> we<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.449> name<00:00:24.660> them<00:00:24.840> all

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
being used we know we can name them all

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.380 
being used we know we can name them all
and<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:26.010> know<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.699> they're<00:00:26.880> having<00:00:26.970> fuel

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and we know that they're having fuel

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.810 
and we know that they're having fuel
additives<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.470> could<00:00:28.740> cause<00:00:29.250> cloud

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
additives that could cause cloud

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.930 
additives that could cause cloud
formations<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.779> they<00:00:31.260> use<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:32.250> part<00:00:32.309> of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
formations and they use this as part of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.110 
formations and they use this as part of
the<00:00:33.120> engineering<00:00:33.920> for<00:00:34.920> geoengineering<00:00:35.610> for

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the engineering for geoengineering for

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540 
the engineering for geoengineering for
weather<00:00:36.360> manipulation<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.550> spraying

weather manipulation and spraying
whatever<00:00:39.000> else<00:00:39.329> they<00:00:39.510> want<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
whatever else they want in the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
whatever else they want in the
atmosphere<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:41.040> manipulate<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:42.270> EMF<00:00:43.070> so

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
atmosphere to manipulate it with EMF so

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.350 
atmosphere to manipulate it with EMF so
let's<00:00:44.309> Luke<00:00:45.829> this<00:00:46.829> was<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> last<00:00:47.309> 24<00:00:47.850> hours

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
let's Luke this was the last 24 hours

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.110 
let's Luke this was the last 24 hours
where<00:00:48.870> previously<00:00:49.280> aircraft<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.700> see

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
where previously aircraft you can see

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.279 
where previously aircraft you can see
around<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.989> area<00:00:52.440> where<00:00:53.190> clouds<00:00:53.520> are<00:00:53.730> formed

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
around this area where clouds are formed

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.020 
around this area where clouds are formed
this<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.469> brought<00:00:55.680> across<00:00:55.980> its<00:00:56.460> across<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
this is brought across its across to the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.590 
this is brought across its across to the
UK<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.420> this<00:01:00.420> was

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
UK so you can see that this was

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.290 
UK so you can see that this was
previously<00:01:01.109> recorded<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> last<00:01:02.100> 24<00:01:02.850> hours

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
previously recorded in the last 24 hours

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.240 
previously recorded in the last 24 hours
in<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.989> area<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.949> guess<00:01:05.700> what<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:08.010> very

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
in this area and guess what the very

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.520 
in this area and guess what the very
next<00:01:08.460> day<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:09.869> appeared

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
next day this is what appeared

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.030 
next day this is what appeared
incredible<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:13.399> is<00:01:13.700> from<00:01:14.060> aircraft

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
incredible this is from aircraft

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.859 
incredible this is from aircraft
hundreds<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.220> them<00:01:16.430> dumped<00:01:17.090> in<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.299> Atlantic

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
hundreds of them dumped in the Atlantic

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.679 
hundreds of them dumped in the Atlantic
which<00:01:18.470> then<00:01:18.710> comes<00:01:19.009> over<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.090> UK<00:01:20.450> and

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
which then comes over to the UK and

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.270 
which then comes over to the UK and
Europe<00:01:22.119> this<00:01:23.119> is<00:01:23.180> deadly<00:01:23.720> serious<00:01:24.280> it's

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
Europe this is deadly serious it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.740 
Europe this is deadly serious it's
provable<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.119> it's<00:01:26.689> going<00:01:27.049> on<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:29.509> there's

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
provable and it's going on so there's

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.960 
provable and it's going on so there's
the<00:01:29.899> latest<00:01:30.289> movement<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.950> them<00:01:31.100> aircraft<00:01:36.970> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
the latest movement to them aircraft and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.389 
the latest movement to them aircraft and
these<00:01:38.149> are<00:01:38.330> examples<00:01:38.929> of<00:01:39.170> where<00:01:39.619> those<00:01:39.830> come

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
these are examples of where those come

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.899 
these are examples of where those come
straight<00:01:40.729> across<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:42.860> rotates<00:01:43.399> we've<00:01:43.759> gotta

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
straight across it rotates we've gotta

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.609 
straight across it rotates we've gotta
have<00:01:44.000> two<00:01:44.119> clockwise<00:01:44.539> it<00:01:44.780> at<00:01:44.959> the<00:01:45.049> moment<00:01:45.229> but

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
have two clockwise it at the moment but

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.039 
have two clockwise it at the moment but
you<00:01:46.340> see<00:01:46.549> how<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:46.850> continues<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:47.810> moves

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
you see how this continues and moves

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.559 
you see how this continues and moves
forward<00:01:48.520> constantly<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.640> see<00:01:49.850> line<00:01:50.209> after

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
forward constantly you see line after

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.809 
forward constantly you see line after
line<00:01:50.600> up<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.140> line<00:01:51.319> coming<00:01:51.950> from<00:01:52.069> this<00:01:52.399> area

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
line up the line coming from this area

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.840 
line up the line coming from this area
so<00:01:53.500> we'll<00:01:54.500> take<00:01:54.830> through<00:01:55.069> the<00:01:55.220> records<00:01:55.640> of

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
so we'll take through the records of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.870 
so we'll take through the records of
this<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.360> we<00:01:57.200> will<00:01:57.409> show<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.310> publicize

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
this and we will show it and publicize

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.380 
this and we will show it and publicize
it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
it

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.380 
it
this<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.289> what<00:02:00.500> we're<00:02:00.679> dealing<00:02:00.920> with<00:02:01.119> this<00:02:02.119> is

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
this is what we're dealing with this is

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.760 
this is what we're dealing with this is
the<00:02:02.929> absolute<00:02:03.770> terrible<00:02:05.140> crap<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.619> they

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
the absolute terrible crap that they

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.770 
the absolute terrible crap that they
point<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.610> can<00:02:07.789> zoom<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.269> and<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.750> can

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
point and you can zoom in and you can

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.509 
point and you can zoom in and you can
see<00:02:09.549> you<00:02:10.549> can<00:02:10.759> see<00:02:10.970> these<00:02:11.470> EMF<00:02:12.519> frequencies

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
see you can see these EMF frequencies

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.370 
see you can see these EMF frequencies
that<00:02:13.819> they're<00:02:13.970> using<00:02:14.180> from<00:02:14.599> loads<00:02:15.019> of

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
that they're using from loads of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.979 
that they're using from loads of
different<00:02:15.769> pieces<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.160> equipment<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:17.150> you

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
different pieces of equipment and you

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.500 
different pieces of equipment and you
can<00:02:18.290> even<00:02:18.470> zoom<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.100> see<00:02:19.549> some<00:02:20.299> of<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
can even zoom in and see some of the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.840 
can even zoom in and see some of the
chemtrails<00:02:21.019> which<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.380> been<00:02:21.500> laid<00:02:21.739> here<00:02:22.100> now

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
chemtrails which have been laid here now

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.819 
chemtrails which have been laid here now
it's<00:02:23.030> all<00:02:23.209> affected<00:02:23.720> all<00:02:23.900> over<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.380> world<00:02:24.590> now

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829
