full-frame or an aps-c Canon or Nikon
and<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:51.870> want<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> 24<00:00:52.410> millimeter<00:00:52.559> it's

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and you really want a 24 millimeter it's

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
and you really want a 24 millimeter it's
now<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> great<00:00:53.789> option<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> comes<00:00:54.840> at

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
now a great option that comes at

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.779 
now a great option that comes at
probably<00:00:55.620> very<00:00:55.800> close<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.219> performance<00:00:56.699> it's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
probably very close to performance it's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
probably very close to performance it's
not<00:00:56.879> better<00:00:57.030> performance<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.410> about

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
not better performance at you know about

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.319 
not better performance at you know about
half<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> price<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.789> gonna<00:00:59.879> retail

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
half the price so this is gonna retail

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.470 
half the price so this is gonna retail
for<00:01:00.719> 849<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.010> hits<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> market<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.940> for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
for 849 when it hits the market and for

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
for 849 when it hits the market and for
comparison<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.019> Canon<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> Nikon<00:01:04.589> versions

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
comparison the Canon and Nikon versions

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.789 
comparison the Canon and Nikon versions
are<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:05.760> around<00:01:05.850> 17<00:01:06.330> 2000<00:01:07.200> dollars<00:01:07.470> brand

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
are right around 17 2000 dollars brand

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.310 
are right around 17 2000 dollars brand
new<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.970> huge<00:01:09.330> price<00:01:09.630> savings<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
new so that's a huge price savings and

if you're India you know landscapes

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.730 
if you're India you know landscapes
$400,000<00:01:12.869> you're<00:01:13.049> gonna<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.229> able<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.409> pick<00:01:13.619> up

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
$400,000 you're gonna be able to pick up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340 
$400,000 you're gonna be able to pick up
a<00:01:13.950> relatively<00:01:14.580> high-end<00:01:14.970> lens<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.900> not<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> lot

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
a relatively high-end lens for not a lot

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
a relatively high-end lens for not a lot
of<00:01:16.380> money<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.070> some<00:01:17.369> third-party<00:01:17.580> lenses<00:01:18.180> are

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
of money so some third-party lenses are

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
of money so some third-party lenses are
usually<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.290> affordable<00:01:19.770> because<00:01:20.070> they're

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
usually more affordable because they're

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.770 
usually more affordable because they're
