00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 now we are the people of anna james 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.569
 puntocom and the podcast reload and we do 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.519
 this pattern to be able to remain so 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.559
 nine and a half years ago we started what 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.900
 it was a project between two pep friends and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.420
 I created a night game dotcom already 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.609
 over the years that has happened to be 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.590
 a hobby to be an occupation to 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 full day and we have been giving 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.310
 form a little bit together what we have 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.019
 always wanted the whole team with 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.390
 nuclear girl and with ping head is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.310
 take us the criticism of video games as 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 something very serious indeed enough 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.930
 serious enough to devote our lives to 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 we have invested in the night time 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 money and we've had our more and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.020
 our less but in general we are 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.390
 very proud of what we have 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.850
 achieved and that's why we want more 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.980
 we want to do it more and better and to 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.460
 to be able to continue informing and entertaining 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.410
 with this mixture of humor and rigor 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.579
 we need your help friends is the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.440
 best time for the media 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.329
 independent that's clear but 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.000
 following the example of critics who 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.719
 we admire and we continue to bet 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.339
 pattern to be able to continue writing in 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.450
 the web and that you can follow 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.850
 reading it by learning 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.009
 of the fantastic community that we have and 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.299
 also bringing the podcast that week to 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.159
 week then we try to make it a 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.899
 conversation between friends with this not 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.729
 we want to become rich and in fact 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.399
 we know we are asking for a lot is 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.840
 difficult but really to follow 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.729
 working we need stability 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.640
 that we do not have right now and 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.679
 pattern allows us to feel that we are 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.920
 closer to you notice that there is 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.509
 people who trust us and who 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.950
 he cares what we have to say here 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.689
 below on our pattern page 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.880
 you have all the information about what 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.899
 we need and that we commit to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.640
 do 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.159
 there are some pretty cool rewards 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.110
 if you like there the podcast reload 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.319
 help us grow and move forward 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.049
 cridland are achievement pepa to the mess that 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.640
 let's do with the pasta then 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.920
 obviously the base is a serious issue 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.500
 we insist is to do the same as now 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.450
 but more and better though if for the first 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.280
 Once we decided to ask for money 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.429
 readers and listeners is because we have 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.519
 plans for the future of the project are 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.679
 important changes, of course, but 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.670
 also exciting for everything that 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.220
 it implies 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.540
 we want to be totally transparent 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.819
 because we are effectively acquiring 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.560
 a commitment to you we what 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.720
 We take very seriously and now we are going to 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.420
 explain exactly what gas we have 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.830
 every euro that the analysis collects 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.750
 We trust our content for 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.400
 on top of all things we like what 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.140
 what we do if we always want to do what 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.480
 best possible that's why in addition to doing 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.190
 News analysis and advances we want 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.900
 post more interviews to people 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.819
 large and medium and small here and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.040
 out we want to make more articles 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.190
 we want to make more opinion columns 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.720
 more retrospective more pc chairs and in 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.350
 general all the texts for the days of 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.580
 you know them 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.319
 we want to use pattern also as 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.900
 tool to establish a dialogue 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.269
 more fluid with readers and power 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.150
 refine the content a little bit more for 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.100
 that in addition to what we seek 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.440
 on the internet to offer to you 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.910
 to know where to investigate what 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.920
 more interested in general we want to 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.230
 night is always the mind but 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.640
 but more and better the irregularity of the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.350
 podcast of recent months should 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.450
 mainly because we do not have a single 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.519
 turkey and free time is less 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.019
 when you have to be thinking about 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.640
 ways to pay bills 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.000
 we prefer to invest the hours that 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.460
 we pay 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.470
 talking with the bank's employers to 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.530
 chat about video games for your 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.150
 use and also enjoy independence 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.370
 what can the employer give us 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.990
 It allows you to do things now 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.480
 lack of resources we could not do 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.970
 have more guests do a podcast with 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.550
 Germanic regularity every week minimum 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.340
 a podcast make it longer 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.500
 call people to participate have 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.290
 public so that you too can 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.150
 see it and also those who help us here 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.460
 in pattern you will have an early access 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.280
 and you can listen to it ahead of time in 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.220
 the air seems to us quite important 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.140
 have diversity of opinions the nucleus 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.090
 hard of the web is very well we work 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.670
 every day and we're happy for what 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.860
 we do but we think it would be very 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.170
 well to have more invented voices more 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.680
 collaborations in general we like 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.840
 to win we would like the diversity that 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.840
 lacks money 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.890
 We are not willing to go asking 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.320
 collaborations 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.590
 without paying people for their work 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.270
 I think that it is not only an incentive but 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.650
 which is also an obligation for 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.920
 our part look for the resources 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.490
 necessary to pay the people who 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.800
 I want to collaborate, we have to do the 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.230
 best license everything is willing to 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.840
 finally develop the version for 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.400
 phones and tablets of the night that we 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.580
 it's been singing for a while that idea 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.140
 also for lack of resources but with 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.030
 the money that we take out of the pattern we're going 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.860
 to allocate part to pay all 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.230
 expenses and infrastructure and on the other hand 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.580
 buy him the collection of dolls 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.680
 the zodiac trucks addicted to 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.620
 short our free programmer so that 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.360
 finally reach no one is the 21st century 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.800
 it's enough to fight with the button 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.260
 activity or juggling 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.660
 put a comment so for a 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.460
 mobile nose and free that mythical version 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.980
 for mobile is the technical priority 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.440
 but we have many other ideas for 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.560
 reform and improve the web blogs 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.300
 the users the forums the achievements all 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.590
 we are the ones who have more time 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.530
 we passed were 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.780
 with which we have a lot of ideas and 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.810
 suggestions on how to improve it but 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.100
 again we lack resources but I 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.630
 I think there is one thing too very very 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.000
 important and that is if we want to continue 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.980
 making nighy reload with the same or 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.950
 not in fact much more intensely than 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.290
 now we have to be able to dedicate 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.660
 all our day to that because behind 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.480
 of a program or article 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.760
 there are many things but we do not want 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.260
 do the least we do not like the 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.700
 alternative to write a couple of 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.460
 items at night and when the girlfriend 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.010
 is sleeping because it is not good and 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.800
 I am also convinced that I can 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.800
 dedicate him without worrying about more things 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.390
 all our attention to this project 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.190
 so that many projects are made 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.110
 alternative many new ideas for 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.120
 sections many new ideas for 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.940
 new programs for specials for 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.660
 I do not know if it's much use but 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.490
 we want that when you read night and 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.620
 listen to the podcast at least 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.630
 have the feeling that we 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.700
 we have tried to do our work what 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.230
 best possible and that that somehow 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.840
 transmit 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.520
 transpires of everything we do and if not 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.800
 you can collaborate in this pattern of 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.960
 do not worry, it 's help 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.420
 enough that you share it with your 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.950
 friends or talk to people you believe 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.650
 who may be interested in our 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.440
 way of writing and talking about the 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.840
 video games we would come to finish 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.670
 we are so scared the first 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.550
 day we launched the web we do not have 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.560
 idea of ​​what is going to happen but yes that 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.300
 we believe that this is the best alternative 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.820
 that we have on the table now 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.620
 same to continue doing the same thing 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.110
 that we have been doing for nine 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.510
 years and a half that is that you 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.940
 help to grow through a 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.390
 monthly collaboration if you sincerely 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.800
 we believe in a humble way that this is 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.170
 what we need but as he says 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.170
 xavi we do not know what we will have so 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:18.380
 Well, we're seeing that between everyone 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:21.010
 these days thank you very much for the help and 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.010
 see you
