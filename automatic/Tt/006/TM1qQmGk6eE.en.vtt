00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
advantage with the sound shape

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.670 
advantage with the sound shape
especially<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.420> music<00:00:39.719> teachers<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.290> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
especially for music teachers is that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.069

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
you can store a lot of them in your

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.990 
you can store a lot of them in your
classroom<00:00:43.379> without<00:00:44.160> them<00:00:44.370> taking<00:00:44.730> too<00:00:44.850> much

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
classroom without them taking too much

classroom without them taking too much
space<00:00:45.559> just<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.789> stack<00:00:48.090> here<00:00:48.120> I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
space just in this in this stack here I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.930 
space just in this in this stack here I
have<00:00:48.600> about<00:00:48.840> maybe<00:00:49.440> 12<00:00:49.890> Sun<00:00:50.250> shapes<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
have about maybe 12 Sun shapes so you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.520 
have about maybe 12 Sun shapes so you
could<00:00:51.270> basically<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.350> each

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
could basically have one for each

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.560 
could basically have one for each
student<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.730> could<00:00:53.940> fit<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
student and that could fit on the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.939 
student and that could fit on the
bookshelf<00:00:55.020> another<00:00:55.379> great<00:00:55.649> advantage

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
bookshelf another great advantage

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.490 
bookshelf another great advantage
especially<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.910> younger<00:00:57.120> kids<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.230> fact

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
especially for younger kids is the fact

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.110 
especially for younger kids is the fact
that<00:00:58.620> their<00:00:58.920> Sun<00:00:59.129> shapes<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.579> coming<00:01:00.000> in

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that their Sun shapes are coming in

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.689 
that their Sun shapes are coming in
different<00:01:00.510> size<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.840> shape<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> for

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
different size and shape so you for

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.219 
different size and shape so you for
instance<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.210> could<00:01:03.359> tell<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> kids<00:01:03.930> only

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
instance you could tell the kids only

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
instance you could tell the kids only
the<00:01:04.470> circles<00:01:04.890> are<00:01:05.010> gonna<00:01:05.189> play<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.850> only

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the squares play a Sun shape I recommend

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.980 
the squares play a Sun shape I recommend
holding<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.299> weaker<00:01:09.540> hands

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
tones you can produce with the Sun shape

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.640 
tones you can produce with the Sun shape
the<00:01:30.390> first<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> open<00:01:31.259> tone<00:01:33.650> and
