00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 and me 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.839
 nobody knows where it starts and where it ends 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.799
 this historic neighborhood the soul of the first 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:17.690
 picture of the city the neighborhood of the 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.540
 mercedes one of the most remote origins 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.300
 from the city of Mexico- the convent of 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.100
 the merceditas and the roldán building 37 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.160
 they are just some of the buildings 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.680
 historic of the area today accompanies us 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.530
 jesus rr petlacalco chronicler of the 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.230
 merced and responsible for the project 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.920
 Mexican heritage 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.690
 jesus we are at the mercy but from where 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.329
 they were at mercy what would be the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.210
 exact location of this area within 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.750
 the city and we can not consider it to be 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.519
 a space that evolves so much that its 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.970
 cultural limits in what 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.100
 no manners do not like me 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.800
 much to say that the real limits of the 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.559
 mercy that when you know you've arrived 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.259
 to the Knesset is when I hear the noise 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.270
 we at the mercy is at the mercy of 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.789
 fashion is not in full 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.380
 revitalization by provided authorities 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.390
 curious and especially its inhabitants 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.979
 and this is the street that has given 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.530
 identity for centuries 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.780
 it seems that in Roldan you still hear 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.689
 the running of a ghost river where it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.210
 the ditch raised the ditch 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.070
 real was this prolongation more than 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.770
 programming was this section of the channel 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.630
 that went to the southern part of the account 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.229
 until xochimilco and tláhuac chalco by 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.000
 there everything went to this city we went to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.770
 look for vestiges of history that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.270
 narrates jesús rodríguez 'tato' the lime that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.270
 during his historical tours 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.000
 / Republic of Uruguay and Republic of 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.159
 Salvador is the street of Talavera a 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.680
 of the oldest in the neighborhood and in its 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.049
 pedestrian part where it is called alhóndiga 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.170
 a neighborhood rises within the neighborhood 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.050
 the street of the children god where near 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.440
 of 1500 people are engaged in dressing and 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.330
 make these religious images 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.640
 however this industry 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.810
 although flourishing is not as old in 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.810
 this area of ​​the historic center 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.910
 in this sale of chilies of all 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.690
 classes today a celebration takes place 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.400
 it's this pizza lady's birthday one 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.130
 of the longest living inhabitants of the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.900
 mercy and then the whole street of 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.900
 They look like a party 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.970
 in the end 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.590
 what would be the most 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.750
 emblematic those that still exist 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.650
 for a long time from this street and 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.840
 I believe that one of the sites 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.940
 emblematic of the street is what 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.660
 We are having been a warehouse of 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.850
 chiles for a long time today is a place 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.130
 specialized in chile in a restaurant 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.430
 of first level that rescues the values 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.670
 heritage of local gastronomy 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.930
 mercedaria but there is also coffee x 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.480
 that coffee we could consider it as the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.860
 oldest cafe in the city of Mitu in 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.210
 the time when the cid in giving him 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.730
 The name was very fashionable 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.680
 Beer Two Xs They Choose Monkeys and 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.220
 a beer with two x's in a cafe with 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.220
 an X 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.420
 but also Maria is the steelworks of 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.160
 María de la Soledad's 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.830
 owners who are also several 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.810
 generations said good and the candles 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.300
 of sebum if they are sold but not all 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.700
 the world consumes them that we are going to make and 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.790
 they were for what it truly has 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.870
 fashionable to candle all this candle 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.190
 with aroma the figure and have a truth 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.390
 which is a product that is truly 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.310
 wonderful that are the candles of the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.110
 divine providence but we said what 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.600
 is what people ask the dignified 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.170
 providence that asks me before 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.170
 anything else 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.180
 are lots of coins and it's 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.790
 truly a unique product and among 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.750
 other spaces are the Chilean 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.640
 one enters sun about all the chilies 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.850
 that you can not imagine sizes and 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.760
 colors colors and I always say that it is 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.920
 A mural of chile is disappointing 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.720
 another of the points that jesús rodríguez 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.660
 petacalco usually show in their 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.610
 tours is the plaza de la aguilita a 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.560
 place that wants to remember the myth 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.070
 foundational eagle devouring a 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.630
 snake in the middle of a nopalera is the 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.210
 mercè of the oldest area of ​​the 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.490
 city we can practically define 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.760
 the woman as the oldest neighborhood in 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.840
 the old city of mexico today would be the 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.570
 oldest neighborhood in the center that something 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.940
 we were full of pride is already 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.380
 the center is considered the mercy 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.380
 historic historic center 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.080
 the heritage project mexico invites you 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.840
 to the historical tours by the 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.320
 merced a small lesson about a 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.320
 big city
