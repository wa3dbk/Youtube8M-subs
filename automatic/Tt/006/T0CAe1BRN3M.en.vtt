00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.740
 hello today i wish you 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.850
 tell about the hot key 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.910
 maybe youâ€™ve heard vanik 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.690
 do not use and maybe not 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.470
 use so it will be useful 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.799
 find out what it is 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.060
 ia hotkeys are also called 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.839
 shortcut keys 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.769
 These are ordinary keys to our keys. 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:22.600
 keyboard 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.820
 but behind these attacker keys 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.500
 fixed certain 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.649
 actions 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.199
 that is, not only those actions that 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.240
 marked on each key 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.150
 volleyball operating system 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.350
 either about the various programs behind these 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.750
 keys can be fixed some 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.900
 items for example 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.260
 and the interface or some option 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.020
 program 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.090
 that is, when you press a certain key 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.210
 the program will be somatically started 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.400
 but you don't need this action 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 and it starts up soy operation on the panel 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.010
 pressing tools 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.510
 and the corresponding 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.910
 window almost on the toolbar for 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.910
 selects her detour drop down menu 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.990
 also you can use not 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.300
 only keys but also shortcut keys that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.510
 most commonly used 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.010
 and we'll talk just about that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.630
 which combination alas 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.280
 percentage shortcut keys you can 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.790
 use which is already with default 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.180
 there are in the operating system and which 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.500
 also except 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.080
 into the operating system itself yet 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.940
 used by some 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.980
 programs and so let's say even 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.470
 most programs 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.910
 but also you can download 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.370
 according to saw will be 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.760
 falik board set 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.810
 in which Molotov are listed more 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.700
 often used combination in enclave 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.660
 you can print it 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.170
 here 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.580
 hang up a list near the computer and 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.530
 use it until from that 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.710
 they won't fill me i will also remember 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.430
 its this list applied a set 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.700
 so that we can remove 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.400
 key combination which 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.940
 you remember the borax that you never 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.230
 will use 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.730
 and correspondingly 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.400
 can print a new list 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.060
 half-word computers and 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.990
 to use 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.329
 but now I propose to consider 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.329
 directly keys on the keyboard 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.449
 first let's look at those 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.329
 keys that are on the keyboard and mom 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.399
 designated by some turners 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.329
 first of all here here upstairs 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.070
 represented by a number of keys 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.400
 which start with fish copy off 1 m2 with 34 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.459
 and so on that is f1 lose tv 12 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.679
 these keys are called functional 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:31.869
 and they perform in different programs 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:33.889
 different tasks and behind them in different 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:34.530
 programs 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.049
 flooded on various operations 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.120
 as a rule, f1 keys 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.390
 she is in all programs in that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.040
 number and in the operating system 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.849
 windows 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.690
 she performs nato not fixed 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.720
 help call operation i.e. 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.710
 pressing the f1 key will launch 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.749
 program 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.539
 otherwise help is definitely 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.729
 program or operating system 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.419
 function keys very often 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.599
 used in various programs 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.100
 for example volvo file managers 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.110
 such as the total team at once many of these 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.540
 function keys secured 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.200
 certain operations for example 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.780
 the bonfire is open again entail kenya 4 for 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.969
 editing 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.499
 and again copy f6 move and all 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:16.119
 create documents in the apt folder on April 8 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.169
 that is, I alas in various programs 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.069
 you can pay attention to what is behind it 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.870
 keys 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.870
 secured and on various operation 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.819
 further 10 another key from books 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.059
 the one that applies to 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.809
 and closing the case was a different menu chokona 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.719
 because the base is not fixed as well 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:35.899
 cancellation of actions 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.049
 when you want a plank path of operations 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.649
 want this operation to cancel you how 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:40.599
 rule can take advantage 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.869
 poland sands 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.969
 further down here there are cup keys of servants 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.299
 key quality to out loud 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.249
 it is used to enable the mode 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.219
 capital letters that is if you type on 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:55.079
 keyboard in small capital letters 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.099
 want to switch to the title you 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.760
 press hear the capsule 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.709
 and then you will again be produced 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.889
 print in capital letters only 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.559
 then there are a number of keys that 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:08.919
 sometimes called keys 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.110
 modifiers 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.609
 this is the shift key 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.240
 key contra key windows 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.099
 and the key is melting 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.519
 they call them a modifier for that 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.439
 the reason that u when a combination of data 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.110
 keys with some other value 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.779
 another key but usually changes then 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:28.780
 there is just the same shortcut 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.560
 about which we are now going to talk 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.250
 this modifier key combination with attack 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.840
 would be different keys on the keyboard 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.650
 so for example the shift key and which 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.100
 either bukoviny keys 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.330
 changes the register of the laptop here that is 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.470
 for example if you have been disabled 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.410
 Products cup syllable that is derived from the usual 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.599
 in small capital letters 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.759
 and who is the shift key 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.599
 keeping york pressed for example 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.080
 any other letter 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.330
 it will cause your letters to be 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.740
 displayed in title on 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.659
 capitalized 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.110
 if you had keys to the ambassador 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.990
 n applied that is, you have the title 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.530
 letters 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.200
 you press shift its it any 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.350
 then you have a letter 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.639
 the register changes and output the place 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.479
 upper case letters 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.159
 the same combination of shift keys with which grid 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.469
 or keys from this lawyer that is here 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:21.879
 from this famous series 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.639
 leads to what will be displayed 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.090
 late which you 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.980
 here is marked about but whom tsiferki 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.400
 that is, here is the usual specified 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.130
 assessment 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.809
 and any badges 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:34.119
 for example due to the km asterisk brace and 

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:36.529
 so on then there is a keyboard shortcut when 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:38.440
 hold down the shift key 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.860
 and clicking on any of these digital 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.350
 keys 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.170
 will be displayed on the icon that you have 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.110
 signed near the corresponding 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.520
 number keys 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.509
 on most process keyboards 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:49.860
 the right side is so small 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.410
 numeric keypad 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.220
 and here it is usually top on digital on 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.490
 keyboard there is a key tax 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.000
 this key enables or disables data 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.849
 keyboard 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:01.869
 that is, if you press once 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:04.030
 This hairpin scarf could 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.040
 then you unplug the keyboard and when 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.770
 will drive the numbers you work they do not 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.550
 but you will be this keyboard 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.520
 work like 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.740
 these are the cursor keys 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.319
 because here if you choose and shadow 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.560
 The moment on the keys 8 2 4 5 is also shown 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.990
 like an arrow 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.490
 if you turn on this cancun key 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.289
 then accordingly you turn on the data 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.550
 Keyboard can New Yearâ€™s numbers with 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.439
 this keyboard also 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:31.039
 and here and the top of me 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.699
 there are two more keys you have 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.059
 maybe there are three keys 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:36.909
 wipe the keys which is called 

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:39.519
 scroll lock I have such an operation court 

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.809
 maybe you have it now 

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:43.369
 practically no longer used and 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:44.139
 so 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.659
 on the keyboard but its just 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.259
 stopped installing 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.669
 Katy same two keys printskrin and Linda 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.089
 pause or break 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:55.849
 they apply for the next poland print 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.599

 screen to make a picture of him 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.250
 about how to do this I have already created one of 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.889
 lessons that you can find on my 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:08.319
 blog post 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.179
 key pause he very often 

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:11.710
 are used 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.780
 when booting the computer 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.510
 at least i'm using for this 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.180
 when the computer boots up 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.430
