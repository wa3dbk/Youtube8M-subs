is a heel that I was doing earlier you
know<00:02:42.860> kind<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> made<00:02:43.280> little<00:02:43.900> multicolored

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
know kind of made little multicolored

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.540 
know kind of made little multicolored
layers<00:02:45.290> in<00:02:45.680> there<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.100> then<00:02:46.190> sort<00:02:46.460> of

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
layers in there and then sort of

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.580 
layers in there and then sort of
grounded<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:47.060> down<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.870> only<00:02:48.020> problem<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.410> run

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
grounded it down the only problem I run

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.070 
grounded it down the only problem I run
into<00:02:48.710> so<00:02:49.070> far<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.550> that<00:02:49.780> having<00:02:50.780> trouble

getting the cap back on there without

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.880 
getting the cap back on there without
scuffing<00:02:52.700> up<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.910> neck<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.480> I'll<00:02:54.350> mess<00:02:54.710> with

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
scuffing up the neck so I'll mess with

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.290 
scuffing up the neck so I'll mess with
that<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.100> little<00:02:55.250> bit<00:02:55.490> I<00:02:55.730> don't<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.120> like

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
that a little bit I don't think I like

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.320 
that a little bit I don't think I like
these<00:02:56.450> tuning<00:02:56.870> pegs<00:02:57.080> very<00:02:57.350> much<00:02:57.560> either<00:02:57.770> but

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
these tuning pegs very much either but

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.290 
these tuning pegs very much either but
now<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.390> know<00:02:59.630> little<00:02:59.960> by<00:03:00.140> little<00:03:04.120> you'll<00:03:05.120> see

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
now you know little by little you'll see
