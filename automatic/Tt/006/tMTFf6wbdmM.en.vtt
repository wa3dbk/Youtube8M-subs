00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
to lay flat you want it to go up like a

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
to lay flat you want it to go up like a
petal

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
petal

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.559 
petal
now<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.540> next<00:03:29.579> I've<00:03:30.579> got<00:03:30.879> my<00:03:31.060> first<00:03:31.269> layer

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
now to the next I've got my first layer

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.309 
now to the next I've got my first layer
on<00:03:31.599> now<00:03:32.319> on<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.860> my<00:03:33.040> next<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:34.019> little<00:03:35.019> bit<00:03:35.230> of

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
on now on to my next a little bit of

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.309 
on now on to my next a little bit of
glue<00:03:35.500> on<00:03:35.620> there<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.810> you're<00:03:37.810> going<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:37.989> place

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
glue on there and you're going to place

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.960 
glue on there and you're going to place
your<00:03:38.620> next<00:03:38.769> color<00:03:39.129> in<00:03:39.459> between<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:42.040> first<00:03:42.519> two

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
your next color in between the first two

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.750 
your next color in between the first two
so<00:03:43.480> as<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:44.230> can<00:03:44.379> see<00:03:44.439> it's<00:03:44.950> going<00:03:45.129> to<00:03:45.189> be<00:03:45.250> like

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
so as you can see it's going to be like

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.720 
so as you can see it's going to be like
again<00:03:46.180> like<00:03:46.359> a<00:03:46.390> petal<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.620> darker<00:03:48.040> color<00:03:48.280> goes

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
again like a petal the darker color goes

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.759 
again like a petal the darker color goes
in<00:03:48.939> between<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.359> two<00:03:49.480> lighter<00:03:52.439> now<00:03:53.439> you<00:03:53.500> may

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
in between the two lighter now you may

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.369 
in between the two lighter now you may
run<00:03:54.010> into<00:03:54.370> where<00:03:54.609> it<00:03:54.700> doesn't<00:03:54.909> exactly<00:03:55.659> fit<00:03:56.170> in

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
run into where it doesn't exactly fit in

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.170 
run into where it doesn't exactly fit in
between<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.859> two<00:03:57.010> petals<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.519> that's<00:03:57.760> okay

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
between the two petals and that's okay

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.619 
between the two petals and that's okay
it's<00:03:58.599> not<00:03:58.810> perfect<00:03:59.260> but<00:03:59.560> neither<00:03:59.739> is<00:03:59.920> a<00:03:59.950> flower

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
it's not perfect but neither is a flower

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.479 
it's not perfect but neither is a flower
two<00:04:01.629> layers<00:04:01.870> down<00:04:02.200> two<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.799> go<00:04:02.829> don't<00:04:03.340> forget

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
two layers down two to go don't forget

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.020 
two layers down two to go don't forget
in<00:04:03.940> between<00:04:04.709> one<00:04:05.709> more<00:04:05.920> layer<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.159> go<00:04:06.489> now

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
in between one more layer to go now

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.670 
in between one more layer to go now
remember<00:04:07.420> this<00:04:07.599> is<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.900> time<00:04:08.109> that<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.500> want
