a link for it in the description of this
video<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.720> let's<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:28.109> ahead<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.590> press<00:00:28.920> start

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
video so let's go ahead and press start

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.959 
video so let's go ahead and press start
now<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.330> see<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.279> unlock

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
now you can see you do get to unlock

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.790 
now you can see you do get to unlock
other<00:00:33.239> types<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.690> planes<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.320> since<00:00:34.530> I

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
other types of planes but since I

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
other types of planes but since I
haven't<00:00:35.370> unlocked<00:00:35.700> any<00:00:35.969> we'll<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.360> go<00:00:36.480> with

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
haven't unlocked any we'll just go with

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
haven't unlocked any we'll just go with
a<00:00:36.690> basic<00:00:36.870> set<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.670> see

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
a basic set up and as you can see

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
a basic set up and as you can see
already<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.540> flight<00:00:39.780> control<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.260> get

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
already just like flight control we get

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.530 
already just like flight control we get
this<00:00:40.530> little<00:00:40.850> exclamation<00:00:41.850> mark<00:00:42.090> letting<00:00:42.450> us

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
this little exclamation mark letting us

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.650 
this little exclamation mark letting us
know<00:00:42.629> where<00:00:43.530> these<00:00:43.789> enemy<00:00:44.789> planes<00:00:45.090> are<00:00:45.329> coming

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
know where these enemy planes are coming

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.810 
know where these enemy planes are coming
from<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.469> obviously<00:00:46.620> instead<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> landing

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
from now obviously instead of landing

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.189 
from now obviously instead of landing
planes<00:00:48.860> you're<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.300> controlling<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.660> one

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
planes you're just controlling this one

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.590 
planes you're just controlling this one
airplane<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.219> you're<00:00:53.460> using<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> attack

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
airplane and you're using it to attack

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.720 
airplane and you're using it to attack
other<00:00:54.899> planes<00:00:56.840> there<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.699> just

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
other planes there we go so as you just

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
other planes there we go so as you just
solved<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> control<00:01:00.690> plane<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.410> draw<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
solved a control plane you just draw a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.340 
solved a control plane you just draw a
line<00:01:01.890> from<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.510> point<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.809> whichever

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
line from it and point it in whichever

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.980 
line from it and point it in whichever
direction<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.890> want<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> go<00:01:05.930> now<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
direction you want it to go now the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.340 
direction you want it to go now the
smaller<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.010> line<00:01:08.220> line<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.810> slower<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
smaller the line line is the slower to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.030 
smaller the line line is the slower to
go<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.880> draw<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.659> long<00:01:12.869> line<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
go so if you draw a really long line you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.960 
go so if you draw a really long line you
can<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> plane<00:01:14.820> goes<00:01:15.060> much<00:01:15.240> faster

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
can see that the plane goes much faster

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.429 
can see that the plane goes much faster
so<00:01:17.970> let's<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.299> ahead<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.630> take<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.229> two

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
so let's go ahead and take out these two

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.330 
so let's go ahead and take out these two
planes<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.150> also<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:22.189> not<00:01:23.189> all

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
planes here as you can also see not all

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.649 
planes here as you can also see not all
planes<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.880> equal<00:01:24.560> some<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.740> smaller<00:01:26.100> or

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
planes are equal some are smaller or

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.840 
planes are equal some are smaller or
larger<00:01:27.659> than<00:01:27.689> others<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.890> some<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.579> them<00:01:29.700> are

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
larger than others and some of them are

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.740 
larger than others and some of them are
more<00:01:30.060> powerful<00:01:30.329> than<00:01:30.900> others<00:01:32.509> let's<00:01:33.509> go<00:01:33.659> ahead

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
more powerful than others let's go ahead

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.249 
more powerful than others let's go ahead
and<00:01:34.020> take<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.799> out<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:35.790> ahead<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:39.259> now

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and take this one out go ahead on now

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.200 
and take this one out go ahead on now
there<00:01:40.439> are<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.860> upgrades<00:01:41.640> throughout<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
there are also upgrades throughout the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.730 
there are also upgrades throughout the

game you can upgrade your weapon by

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.880 
game you can upgrade your weapon by
power-ups<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:48.090> these<00:01:48.240> missiles<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.710> can

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
power-ups you get these missiles you can

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.450 
power-ups you get these missiles you can
get<00:01:49.979> shields<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:52.770> repair

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
get shields you can get a little repair

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.380 
get shields you can get a little repair
boost<00:01:55.340> just<00:01:56.340> some<00:01:56.549> little<00:01:56.670> options<00:01:57.210> there

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
boost just some little options there

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
boost just some little options there
there's<00:01:57.899> one<00:01:57.960> right<00:01:58.079> now<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.380> believe<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
there's one right now I believe this is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.300 
there's one right now I believe this is
a<00:01:59.509> missile<00:02:00.509> option<00:02:00.960> there<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.890> let's<00:02:02.159> go

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
a missile option there we go let's go

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.160 
a missile option there we go let's go
ahead<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:03.409> test<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:05.009> these<00:02:05.310> enemies

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
ahead and test it out on these enemies

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
ahead and test it out on these enemies
there<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.320> go

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.190 

so<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.820> gives<00:02:13.060> me<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.240> tactical<00:02:14.050> advantage

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
so that gives me a tactical advantage

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.890 
so that gives me a tactical advantage
there<00:02:17.250> very<00:02:18.250> simple<00:02:18.670> game<00:02:18.880> but<00:02:19.210> it's<00:02:19.660> one<00:02:19.810> of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900
