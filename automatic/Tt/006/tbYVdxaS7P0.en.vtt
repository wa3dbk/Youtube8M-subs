pretty<00:00:46.920> interesting<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.870> like<00:00:48.870> little

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289

pretty interesting and like little
YouTube<00:00:49.800> rules<00:00:50.190> i<00:00:50.399> guess<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.879> my<00:00:51.390> rules<00:00:51.660> i

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

guess<00:00:51.989> i<00:00:52.110> don't<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:52.620> goes

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920

through<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.129> head<00:00:53.250> when<00:00:53.520> i<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.760> against

through my head when i go against

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.270 
through my head when i go against
another<00:00:54.300> youtuber<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.469> i<00:00:55.500> think<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.129> would<00:00:56.190> be

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
another youtuber so i think it would be

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
another youtuber so i think it would be
pretty<00:00:56.489> interesting<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> watch<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.079> i<00:00:58.500> hope

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649

plays<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.660> consistent<00:03:00.990> basis<00:03:01.560> I've<00:03:02.190> slowly

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
plays on a consistent basis I've slowly

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.460 
plays on a consistent basis I've slowly
lost<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.240> feeling<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.870> rush<00:03:04.200> of

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
lost that feeling of that rush of

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.330 
lost that feeling of that rush of
getting<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> really<00:03:05.340> good<00:03:05.490> score<00:03:05.850> line<00:03:06.030> so

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
getting like a really good score line so

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.420 
getting like a really good score line so
probably<00:03:08.340> why<00:03:08.990> black<00:03:09.990> ops<00:03:10.200> 2<00:03:10.440> has<00:03:10.650> not<00:03:10.950> been<00:03:11.220> as

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
probably why black ops 2 has not been as

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.340 
probably why black ops 2 has not been as
exciting<00:03:12.330> because<00:03:12.510> I've<00:03:12.780> been<00:03:12.810> pulling<00:03:13.200> out

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
exciting because I've been pulling out

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.960 
exciting because I've been pulling out

release or the first day release I got
100-plus<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.990> usually<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.080> should<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.620> my

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
100-plus and usually it should in my

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.380 
100-plus and usually it should in my
opinion<00:03:19.980> this<00:03:20.430> game<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.790> really<00:03:21.030> really<00:03:21.300> easy

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
opinion this game is really really easy

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.900 
opinion this game is really really easy
to<00:03:21.690> get<00:03:21.780> 100<00:03:22.080> plus<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:23.130> wish<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.700> was<00:03:23.880> a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
to get 100 plus and I wish it was a

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.040 
to get 100 plus and I wish it was a
little<00:03:24.000> bit<00:03:24.240> harder<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> little<00:03:24.690> bit<00:03:24.900> more

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
little bit harder a little bit more

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.170 
little bit harder a little bit more
difficult<00:03:25.200> like<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.770> mon<00:03:25.980> frere<00:03:26.220> 3<00:03:26.460> like<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
difficult like on mon frere 3 like the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.400 
difficult like on mon frere 3 like the
first<00:03:27.360> couple<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.720> months<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.110> modern<00:03:28.290> warfare

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
first couple of months of modern warfare

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.170 
first couple of months of modern warfare
3<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.830> extremely<00:03:29.580> hard<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.910> get<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> hundred

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
3 is extremely hard to get a hundred

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.450 
3 is extremely hard to get a hundred
plus<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.830> that<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.860> think<00:03:32.160> that's<00:03:32.310> why<00:03:32.430> I

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
plus and that I think that's why I

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.980 
plus and that I think that's why I
enjoyed<00:03:32.820> model<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.270> three<00:03:33.450> more<00:03:33.630> because<00:03:33.900> it

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
enjoyed model for three more because it

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.380 
enjoyed model for three more because it
is<00:03:34.080> more<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.440> challenge<00:03:34.820> really<00:03:35.820> fast<00:03:36.120> paced

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
is more of a challenge really fast paced

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.020 
is more of a challenge really fast paced
game<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.750> black<00:03:37.020> ops<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.430> mostly<00:03:38.430> kill<00:03:38.700> streaks

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
game in black ops is mostly kill streaks

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.140 
game in black ops is mostly kill streaks
and<00:03:39.770> then<00:03:40.770> a<00:03:40.800> lot<00:03:41.070> of<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.220> games<00:03:41.430> are<00:03:41.970> like

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and then a lot of the games are like

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.600 
and then a lot of the games are like
this<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.450> slaughterfest<00:03:43.050> 124<00:03:44.040> kills<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.550> we

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
this a slaughterfest 124 kills and we

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.220 
this a slaughterfest 124 kills and we
went<00:03:44.820> in<00:03:44.910> less<00:03:45.090> than<00:03:45.240> eight<00:03:45.420> minutes<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:45.990> I

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
went in less than eight minutes so I

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.280 
went in less than eight minutes so I
think<00:03:46.620> we're<00:03:46.740> in<00:03:46.800> like<00:03:47.010> 200<00:03:47.490> 26<00:03:47.820> or<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.360> 280

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
think we're in like 200 26 or like 280

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.220 
think we're in like 200 26 or like 280
or<00:03:49.440> something<00:03:49.860> like<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:51.230> ridiculously

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
or something like that so ridiculously

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.800 
or something like that so ridiculously
fast<00:03:52.500> games<00:03:52.920> in<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.670> timer<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.540> timer

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
fast games in the the timer the timer

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.470 
fast games in the the timer the timer
like<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.920> halftime<00:03:56.340> split<00:03:56.910> in<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:57.120> game<00:03:57.300> is

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
like the halftime split in this game is

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.810 
like the halftime split in this game is
really<00:03:57.690> really<00:03:58.020> annoying<00:03:58.230> because<00:03:58.820> there's

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
really really annoying because there's

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.090 
really really annoying because there's
about<00:04:00.060> like<00:04:00.240> a<00:04:00.270> like<00:04:00.750> honestly<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.920> last

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
about like a like honestly like the last

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.650 
about like a like honestly like the last
30<00:04:02.340> seconds<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:02.910> got<00:04:03.090> your<00:04:03.120> swarm<00:04:03.510> and

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
30 seconds so you got your swarm and

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.300 
30 seconds so you got your swarm and
your<00:04:03.780> your<00:04:04.170> canine<00:04:04.500> unit<00:04:04.770> you<00:04:04.860> don't<00:04:05.100> want<00:04:05.250> to

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
your your canine unit you don't want to

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.280 
your your canine unit you don't want to
call<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.460> in<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:06.330> you're<00:04:06.480> wasting<00:04:06.840> practically

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
call it in so you're wasting practically

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.320 
call it in so you're wasting practically
like<00:04:07.440> 45<00:04:07.920> seconds<00:04:08.370> at<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.850> beginning<00:04:08.970> of<00:04:09.210> the

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
like 45 seconds at the beginning of the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.000 
like 45 seconds at the beginning of the
round<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.840> lose<00:04:10.020> like<00:04:10.170> 15<00:04:10.530> seconds<00:04:10.920> so

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
round to you lose like 15 seconds so

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.680 
round to you lose like 15 seconds so
you're<00:04:11.190> losing<00:04:11.459> about<00:04:11.550> 45<00:04:12.150> seconds<00:04:12.510> of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
you're losing about 45 seconds of

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.780 
you're losing about 45 seconds of
airtime<00:04:12.900> for<00:04:13.320> your<00:04:13.440> killstreaks<00:04:13.950> which<00:04:14.610> is<00:04:14.760> a

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
airtime for your killstreaks which is a

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.020 
airtime for your killstreaks which is a
big<00:04:15.180> it's<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.630> big<00:04:15.660> number<00:04:16.080> like<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.940> could<00:04:17.940> have

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
big it's a big number like I could have

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.940 
big it's a big number like I could have
probably<00:04:18.120> had<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.750> lot<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:19.140> hundred<00:04:19.560> fifty<00:04:19.770> plus

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
probably had a lot of hundred fifty plus

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.590 
probably had a lot of hundred fifty plus
games<00:04:20.220> if<00:04:20.459> there<00:04:20.700> wasn't<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.060> timer<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.480> this

game which I really do not agree with on
the<00:04:24.270> timer<00:04:24.510> because<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:25.050> limits<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.470> time

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
the timer because it limits the time
