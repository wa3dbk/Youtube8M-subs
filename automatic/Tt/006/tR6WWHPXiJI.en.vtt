00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
everything so we're gonna go between the

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.639 
everything so we're gonna go between the
two<00:01:39.940> here<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.720> see<00:01:40.929> what<00:01:41.140> might<00:01:41.380> be<00:01:41.410> the

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
two here to see what might be the

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.370 
two here to see what might be the
differences<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:42.490> perps<00:01:42.789> was<00:01:43.240> better<00:01:43.569> was<00:01:44.050> not

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
differences the perps was better was not

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.730 
differences the perps was better was not
will<00:01:44.860> see<00:01:45.300> so<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.599> can<00:01:47.140> already<00:01:47.319> tell<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.679> that
