actually change the game square logo

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.190 
actually change the game square logo
because<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.270> didn't<00:00:42.480> actually<00:00:42.600> set<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.050> up

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
because we didn't actually set that up

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.869 
because we didn't actually set that up
to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.710> anything<00:00:43.920> right<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.610> go<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
to do anything right so if we go to the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.209 
to do anything right so if we go to the
header<00:00:45.059> dot<00:00:45.210> PHP<00:00:45.690> you'll<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> image<00:00:47.010> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
header dot PHP you'll see the image is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
header dot PHP you'll see the image is
being<00:00:47.460> brought<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.230> right<00:00:49.370> here<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.750> it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
being brought in right here and it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.630 
being brought in right here and it's
being<00:00:51.930> brought<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> static<00:00:53.460> image

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
being brought in with a static image

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.630 
being brought in with a static image
right<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.660> don't<00:00:54.780> want<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.199> be

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
right here but we don't want that to be

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.459 
right here but we don't want that to be
dynamic<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.239> should<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
dynamic so we should go here to the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.439 
dynamic so we should go here to the
image<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.219> our<00:00:59.340> logo<00:00:59.520> we'll<00:01:00.300> just

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
image that is our logo we'll just

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.990 
image that is our logo we'll just
replace<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.020> URL<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:02.820> just

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
replace the URL so we can actually just

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.830 
replace the URL so we can actually just
take<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.680> source<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.270> we'll<00:01:06.270> open<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
take the source here and we'll open a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.679 
take the source here and we'll open a
PHP<00:01:07.229> tag<00:01:07.439> close<00:01:07.770> PHP<00:01:08.159> tag<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.640> we're<00:01:09.420> going<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
PHP tag close PHP tag and we're going to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.960 
PHP tag close PHP tag and we're going to
make<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.229> bit<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.680> dynamic<00:01:11.220> by<00:01:11.460> adding

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
make this a bit more dynamic by adding

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
make this a bit more dynamic by adding
in<00:01:12.119> another<00:01:12.530> echo<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:14.070> theme<00:01:14.790> mod<00:01:15.799> this<00:01:16.799> time

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
in another echo get theme mod this time

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.789 
in another echo get theme mod this time
the<00:01:17.159> field<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.390> logo<00:01:19.380> image

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
the field is going to be the logo image

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.819 
the field is going to be the logo image
the<00:01:22.799> ctrl<00:01:23.189> s<00:01:23.450> going<00:01:24.450> refresh<00:01:27.259> go<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> images

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the ctrl s going refresh go to images

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.260 
the ctrl s going refresh go to images
now<00:01:29.700> let's<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:31.549> does<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.119> want

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
now let's see if this does what we want

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.520 
now let's see if this does what we want
it<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.420> do<00:01:33.770> upload<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.950> image<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:36.350> there<00:01:37.350> we

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
let's go back here and refresh I think

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.540 
let's go back here and refresh I think
that's<00:04:29.350> all<00:04:29.470> I<00:04:29.500> need<00:04:29.680> for<00:04:29.800> details

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
that's all I need for details

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.130 
that's all I need for details
oh<00:04:30.580> well<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.240> doesn't<00:04:31.450> need<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.600> be<00:04:31.690> an<00:04:31.750> image

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
oh well it doesn't need to be an image

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.340 
oh well it doesn't need to be an image
upload<00:04:33.150> we<00:04:34.150> just<00:04:34.300> leave<00:04:34.420> this<00:04:34.600> default<00:04:34.810> if<00:04:35.230> we

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
upload we just leave this default if we

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.000 
upload we just leave this default if we
just<00:04:35.500> don't<00:04:35.680> add<00:04:35.860> what<00:04:36.130> it<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:37.710> then<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.860> think

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
just don't add what it is then I think

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.580 
just don't add what it is then I think
it<00:04:39.130> reverts<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.790> a<00:04:39.970> text<00:04:40.420> box<00:04:40.630> which<00:04:41.410> would<00:04:41.500> be

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
it reverts to a text box which would be

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.810 
it reverts to a text box which would be
fine<00:04:41.740> with<00:04:41.860> us<00:04:41.950> but<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.280> doesn't<00:04:42.520> apparently

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
fine with us but it doesn't apparently

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.940 
fine with us but it doesn't apparently
now<00:04:43.270> I<00:04:43.300> have<00:04:43.540> an<00:04:43.660> extra<00:04:43.900> closing<00:04:44.110> break<00:04:44.440> the
