00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
over here it it's pretty much like

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.480 
over here it it's pretty much like
another<00:00:28.439> fountain<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.279> looks<00:00:29.429> like

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
another fountain but it looks like

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.060 
another fountain but it looks like
barrels<00:00:29.880> pretty<00:00:30.240> much<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> me<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.410> when<00:00:31.949> he

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
barrels pretty much to me but when he

blows<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.850> teleporter<00:00:33.480> will<00:00:33.690> open

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
blows that up a teleporter will open

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
blows that up a teleporter will open
over<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.800> actually<00:00:35.640> i<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.880> might

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
over by the actually i think you might

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.810 
over by the actually i think you might
have<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.270> do<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.600> more<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.800> barrel<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
have to do one more and then barrel the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.970 
have to do one more and then barrel the
portal<00:00:39.390> will<00:00:39.420> open<00:00:39.600> up<00:00:39.930> by<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.170> other<00:00:40.500> phone

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
portal will open up by the other phone

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.299 
portal will open up by the other phone
and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.989> happens<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.500> after<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and then what happens is after that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.400 
and then what happens is after that
teleporter<00:00:44.820> opens<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.420> jump<00:00:45.690> into<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
teleporter opens up you jump into it and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.069 
teleporter opens up you jump into it and
then<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.420> parts<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> build<00:00:48.600> an<00:00:48.809> app<00:00:48.899> on

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
then all the parts to build an app on

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.799 
then all the parts to build an app on
table<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.739> exactly<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.969> there<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
table are like exactly right there and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.160 
table are like exactly right there and
after<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> finish<00:00:52.949> building<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
after you finish building it like the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.959 
after you finish building it like the
nav<00:00:55.530> card<00:00:55.800> from<00:00:56.010> die<00:00:56.190> rise<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.760> see<00:00:56.940> right

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
nav card from die rise as you see right

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.349 
nav card from die rise as you see right
here<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.680> goes<00:00:58.949> right<00:00:59.699> into<00:01:00.000> it

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
here that we have it goes right into it

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.709 
here that we have it goes right into it
and<00:01:00.649> yeah<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.829> pretty<00:01:01.949> much<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.480> but<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and yeah that's pretty much it but the
