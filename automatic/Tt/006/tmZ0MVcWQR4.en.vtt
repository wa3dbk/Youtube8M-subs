00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
tree should be there mine is still

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.140 
tree should be there mine is still
growing<00:02:04.900> it<00:02:05.320> takes<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.650> while<00:02:05.830> for<00:02:05.890> um<00:02:06.490> fruit

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.560 
regular tree I'll patch by the way then
you're<00:02:30.910> just<00:02:30.940> going<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.239> keep<00:02:31.330> running

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
you're just going to keep running

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.160 
you're just going to keep running
running<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:34.269> good<00:02:34.480> thing<00:02:34.510> about<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:35.110> is

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
running and the good thing about this is

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.620 
running and the good thing about this is
once<00:02:35.620> your<00:02:35.830> tree<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.430> fully<00:02:36.910> grown<00:02:37.299> right

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
once your tree is fully grown right

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.289 
once your tree is fully grown right
there's<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.500> magic<00:02:38.860> tree<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.730> 75

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
there's a magic tree if you have 75

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.199 
there's a magic tree if you have 75
woodcutting<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:41.470> really<00:02:41.830> good<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.370> UM<00:02:42.820> it's

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
woodcutting it's really good to UM it's

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.860 
woodcutting it's really good to UM it's
like<00:02:43.360> doing<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.959> um<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.250> don't<00:02:46.150> know<00:02:46.299> where<00:02:46.810> I'm

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
like doing a um I don't know where I'm

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.840 
going with this but whatever you pretty
much<00:02:50.080> can<00:02:50.440> cut<00:02:50.590> down<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:51.040> tree<00:02:51.310> Magic<00:02:51.489> Tree

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
much can cut down you tree Magic Tree

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.880 
much can cut down you tree Magic Tree
and<00:02:51.880> then<00:02:52.150> if<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.540> have<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.200> high<00:02:53.470> enough<00:02:53.680> for

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
and then if you have a high enough for

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
me you can cut down a magic tree at both

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.259 
me you can cut down a magic tree at both
to<00:02:56.440> magic<00:02:56.799> trees<00:02:56.980> at<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.250> same<00:02:57.430> time<00:02:57.670> which<00:02:58.239> is

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
to magic trees at the same time which is

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.720 
to magic trees at the same time which is
really<00:02:58.630> good<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.970> now<00:03:01.780> i'm<00:03:02.230> going<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:02.980> where
