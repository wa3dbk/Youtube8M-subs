little bit of punch and do most of the
everyday<00:01:13.210> tasks<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.729> think<00:01:16.330> that<00:01:16.659> that's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
everyday tasks and I think that that's

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.130 
everyday tasks and I think that that's
what<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.409> model<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:17.950> for<00:01:18.479> though<00:01:19.479> don't<00:01:19.929> let

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
what this model is for though don't let

it is the entry-level Optiplex series

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.319 
it is the entry-level Optiplex series
for<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.729> believe<00:01:25.469> 2010<00:01:26.579> 2009<00:01:27.579> I<00:01:27.609> think<00:01:27.909> was<00:01:28.210> the

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
for I believe 2010 2009 I think was the

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.809 
for I believe 2010 2009 I think was the
model<00:01:28.600> year<00:01:28.780> maybe<00:01:29.439> 2010<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:33.460> this<00:01:33.640> thing

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
model year maybe 2010 but this thing

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.669 
model year maybe 2010 but this thing
goes<00:01:33.999> pack<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.270> punch<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.840> can<00:01:34.869> go<00:01:35.140> it's<00:01:35.560> a

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
goes pack a punch you can go it's a

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.270 
goes pack a punch you can go it's a
socket<00:01:36.069> 775<00:01:36.399> based<00:01:37.270> system<00:01:37.749> and<00:01:38.069> you<00:01:39.069> can

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
socket 775 based system and you can

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.809 
socket 775 based system and you can
actually<00:01:39.490> go<00:01:39.939> with<00:01:40.420> an<00:01:40.539> Intel<00:01:40.840> Core<00:01:41.200> 2<00:01:41.469> quad

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
actually go with an Intel Core 2 quad

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.999 
actually go with an Intel Core 2 quad
q96<00:01:42.819> 50<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:45.310> should<00:01:46.030> be<00:01:46.210> able<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:47.770> than

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
q96 50 which should be able to more than

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.249 
q96 50 which should be able to more than
hold<00:01:48.219> its<00:01:48.399> own<00:01:48.520> with<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.939> core<00:01:49.299> i3<00:01:49.479> S<00:01:49.960> and

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
hold its own with the core i3 S and

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.779 
hold its own with the core i3 S and
maybe<00:01:50.409> even<00:01:50.590> hang<00:01:50.979> with<00:01:51.219> some<00:01:51.429> of<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.579> core

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
maybe even hang with some of the core

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.679 
maybe even hang with some of the core
i5s<00:01:54.719> so<00:01:55.719> that<00:01:56.439> being<00:01:56.740> said<00:01:57.539> we're<00:01:58.539> going<00:01:58.630> to

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
i5s so that being said we're going to

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.300 
i5s so that being said we're going to
pop<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.079> side<00:01:59.319> off<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.619> this<00:01:59.859> and<00:02:00.100> show<00:02:00.249> you

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
pop the side off of this and show you

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.510 
pop the side off of this and show you
guys<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.549> inside<00:02:01.389> and<00:02:01.950> we'll<00:02:02.950> go<00:02:03.100> over<00:02:03.340> some

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
guys the inside and we'll go over some

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.090 
guys the inside and we'll go over some
of<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.670> differences<00:02:04.119> between<00:02:04.329> this<00:02:04.719> one<00:02:04.990> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
of the differences between this one and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.660 
of the differences between this one and
like<00:02:06.100> an<00:02:06.219> op<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.520> Plex<00:02:06.729> 580<00:02:07.209> or<00:02:07.389> 780<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:08.800> we'll

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
like an op the Plex 580 or 780 so we'll

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.130 
like an op the Plex 580 or 780 so we'll
come<00:02:09.819> back<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.240> next<00:02:10.509> part<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.899> clip

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
come back to the next part of the clip

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.990 
come back to the next part of the clip
and<00:02:11.170> we'll<00:02:11.560> have<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.010> side<00:02:12.250> off<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.760> be<00:02:12.850> right

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
and we'll have the side off and be right

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.110 
and we'll have the side off and be right
inside<00:02:13.620> yep

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
inside yep

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.449 
inside yep
this<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.230> pretty<00:02:17.409> much<00:02:17.590> typical<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:18.310> what

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
this is pretty much typical of what

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.800 
this is pretty much typical of what
you're<00:02:18.580> going<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.730> find<00:02:18.970> inside<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.510> one<00:02:19.780> of

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
you're going to find inside of one of

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.309 
you're going to find inside of one of
these<00:02:19.959> Dell<00:02:20.260> Optiplex<00:02:20.739> cases<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.989> even

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
these Dell Optiplex cases and it even

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.809 
these Dell Optiplex cases and it even
actually<00:02:23.620> looks<00:02:23.769> very<00:02:23.830> similar<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.580> that

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
actually looks very similar to that

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.039 
actually looks very similar to that
dimension<00:02:25.629> system<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.560> had<00:02:27.720> done<00:02:28.720> several

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
dimension system that I had done several

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.360 
dimension system that I had done several
videos<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:31.140> yeah<00:02:32.140> I'm<00:02:32.440> sure<00:02:32.799> this<00:02:33.129> one

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
videos on and yeah I'm sure this one

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.949 
videos on and yeah I'm sure this one
like<00:02:33.579> all<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.940> other<00:02:34.060> machines<00:02:34.269> have<00:02:34.720> worked

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
like all the other machines have worked

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.270 
like all the other machines have worked
on<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.349> will<00:02:35.560> clean<00:02:35.769> up<00:02:35.799> nicely<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.980> note<00:02:39.250> I

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
on this will clean up nicely one note I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.309 
on this will clean up nicely one note I
did<00:02:39.489> when<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.730> mentioned<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.780> one<00:02:41.019> actually

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
did when I mentioned this one actually

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.850 
did when I mentioned this one actually
has<00:02:41.829> I<00:02:41.860> believe<00:02:42.159> it<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> 200<00:02:43.450> yen<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:43.860> 255

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
has I believe it is a 200 yen to 255

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.339 
has I believe it is a 200 yen to 255
watt<00:02:45.480> power<00:02:46.480> supply<00:02:48.629> looks<00:02:49.629> like<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.109> one

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
watt power supply looks like this one

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.650 
watt power supply looks like this one
was<00:02:50.590> probably<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.400> standard<00:02:52.000> model<00:02:52.359> I<00:02:52.480> don't

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
was probably the standard model I don't

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.380 
was probably the standard model I don't
see<00:02:52.840> any<00:02:53.049> 80-plus<00:02:53.590> badging<00:02:54.190> on<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.549> or<00:02:54.790> any

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
see any 80-plus badging on it or any

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.860 
see any 80-plus badging on it or any
such<00:02:56.200> stuff<00:02:56.890> like<00:02:57.099> that<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.329> is<00:02:58.450> probably

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
such stuff like that so this is probably

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.800 
such stuff like that so this is probably
the<00:02:59.079> base<00:02:59.290> model<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:01.349> motherboard<00:03:02.349> itself

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
the base model the motherboard itself

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.059 
the base model the motherboard itself
Wow<00:03:04.810> they<00:03:05.260> just<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.099> two<00:03:06.400> memory<00:03:07.269> slots<00:03:07.599> I<00:03:08.069> am

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
Wow they just the two memory slots I am

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.259 
Wow they just the two memory slots I am
hearing<00:03:09.579> different<00:03:10.000> stories<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:11.849> did<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:12.879> little

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
hearing different stories I did a little

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.119 
hearing different stories I did a little
research<00:03:13.540> on<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.109> particular<00:03:14.440> model<00:03:14.799> online

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
research on this particular model online

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.180 
research on this particular model online
and<00:03:15.760> one<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.569> users<00:03:16.780> on<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.200> forum<00:03:17.680> website

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
and one of the users on a forum website

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.000 
and one of the users on a forum website
actually<00:03:18.400> talked<00:03:18.819> about<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.329> particular

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
actually talked about this particular

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.800 
actually talked about this particular
optiplex<00:03:21.060> supporting<00:03:22.060> up<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.410> 8<00:03:23.739> gigs<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.400> ram

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
optiplex supporting up to 8 gigs of ram

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:34.229 
optiplex supporting up to 8 gigs of ram
that<00:03:25.810> would<00:03:25.989> be<00:03:26.109> ddr3<00:03:28.739> ddr3<00:03:29.739> RAM<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:33.239> this

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
that would be ddr3 ddr3 RAM and this

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:42.030 
that would be ddr3 ddr3 RAM and this
person<00:03:34.840> said<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:37.049> BIOS<00:03:38.049> revision<00:03:38.799> a<00:03:39.329> 0<00:03:40.329> 6<00:03:41.040> was

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
person said that BIOS revision a 0 6 was

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.210 
person said that BIOS revision a 0 6 was
needed<00:03:42.430> for<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.660> system<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.349> support<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:45.010> I

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
needed for the system to support that I

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.689 
needed for the system to support that I
don't<00:03:45.910> have<00:03:46.120> confirmation<00:03:46.629> on<00:03:47.079> that<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:48.190> we

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
don't have confirmation on that but we

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.939 
don't have confirmation on that but we
are<00:03:48.879> going<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.150> test<00:03:49.389> it<00:03:49.629> before<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.109> spend<00:03:50.799> the

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
are going to test it before I spend the

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.699 
are going to test it before I spend the
money<00:03:51.160> on<00:03:51.459> 8<00:03:51.940> gigs<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.389> ram<00:03:52.660> if<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.349> machine

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
money on 8 gigs of ram if the machine

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.409 
money on 8 gigs of ram if the machine
will<00:03:53.949> only<00:03:54.690> support<00:03:55.690> up<00:03:55.959> to<00:03:56.199> 4<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:57.220> we'll<00:03:58.120> find

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
will only support up to 4 so we'll find

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.569 
will only support up to 4 so we'll find
out<00:03:58.569> about<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:58.840> in<00:03:59.319> future<00:03:59.680> videos<00:03:59.919> on<00:04:00.250> this

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
out about that in future videos on this

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.330 
out about that in future videos on this

I'm<00:04:11.049> probably<00:04:11.349> going<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.650> put<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.949> Core<00:04:12.160> 2<00:04:12.430> Duo

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
I'm probably going to put the Core 2 Duo

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.780 
I'm probably going to put the Core 2 Duo
in<00:04:13.090> this<00:04:13.299> just<00:04:13.690> for<00:04:13.780> now<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.650> 400<00:04:15.519> will<00:04:15.609> take

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
in this just for now the 400 will take

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.990 
in this just for now the 400 will take
that<00:04:15.940> Pentium<00:04:16.359> out<00:04:16.539> and<00:04:17.459> thread<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.519> Core<00:04:18.760> 2<00:04:18.789> Duo

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
in there probably do a same salt state

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.890 
in there probably do a same salt state

if I add dual optical drives I'm going

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.250 
if I add dual optical drives I'm going
to<00:04:31.050> have<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:31.760> probably<00:04:32.760> put<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> SATA<00:04:33.660> card<00:04:34.050> in

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
to have to probably put a SATA card in

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.020 
to have to probably put a SATA card in
this<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:35.510> then<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:37.440> do<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.710> card<00:04:38.280> reader<00:04:38.610> I'm

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
this and then to do the card reader I'm

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.440 
this and then to do the card reader I'm
going<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.570> have<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.960> use<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.920> other<00:04:41.190> PCI<00:04:41.820> slot

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
going to have to use the other PCI slot

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.620 
going to have to use the other PCI slot
down<00:04:42.750> on<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.170> board<00:04:43.500> I<00:04:43.770> have<00:04:44.670> a<00:04:44.700> video<00:04:45.030> card<00:04:45.450> I

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
down on the board I have a video card I

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.230 
down on the board I have a video card I
can<00:04:45.780> put<00:04:46.020> in<00:04:46.140> it<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.910> that's<00:04:47.910> pretty<00:04:48.090> much

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
can put in it and that's pretty much

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.120 
can put in it and that's pretty much
about<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.870> so<00:04:49.080> we<00:04:49.200> can<00:04:49.350> do<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.620> thing<00:04:49.890> on<00:04:50.070> a

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
about it so we can do this thing on a

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.980 
about it so we can do this thing on a
little<00:04:50.310> bit<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.670> budget<00:04:50.910> here<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:53.900> don't<00:04:54.900> know

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
little bit of a budget here I don't know

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.600 
little bit of a budget here I don't know
why<00:04:55.140> they<00:04:55.350> would<00:04:55.470> put<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:55.830> one<00:04:56.040> slot<00:04:56.370> down

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
why they would put that one slot down

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.340 
why they would put that one slot down
there<00:04:56.880> I<00:04:56.910> think<00:04:57.060> it's<00:04:57.390> actually<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:57.960> looks

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
there I think it's actually it looks

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.010 
there I think it's actually it looks
like<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.710> can<00:04:58.920> use<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.160> normal<00:04:59.610> PC<00:05:00.000> I<00:05:00.030> tape<00:05:00.570> card

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
like I can use a normal PC I tape card

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.909 
like I can use a normal PC I tape card
but<00:05:01.950> I<00:05:01.980> think<00:05:02.340> it's<00:05:02.490> also<00:05:03.050> meant<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.560> be<00:05:04.680> used

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
but I think it's also meant to be used

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.310 
but I think it's also meant to be used
for<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.280> riser<00:05:05.580> card<00:05:06.030> which<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.690> really<00:05:07.169> don't

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
for a riser card which I really don't

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.110 
for a riser card which I really don't
see<00:05:07.380> how<00:05:07.560> a<00:05:07.710> riser<00:05:08.070> card<00:05:08.430> would<00:05:08.669> fit<00:05:08.850> in<00:05:08.970> this

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
see how a riser card would fit in this

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.950 
see how a riser card would fit in this
machine<00:05:09.300> but<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:11.250> know<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:11.970> be<00:05:12.210> it

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
machine but you know so be it

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.580 
machine but you know so be it
we'll<00:05:13.740> try<00:05:14.010> it<00:05:14.040> out<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.430> see<00:05:14.490> what<00:05:14.820> happens

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
we'll try it out and see what happens

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.290 
we'll try it out and see what happens
worst-case<00:05:16.590> scenario<00:05:17.220> is<00:05:17.310> I'd<00:05:17.610> pop<00:05:17.820> a<00:05:17.850> card<00:05:18.180> in

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
worst-case scenario is I'd pop a card in

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.560 
worst-case scenario is I'd pop a card in
there<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:18.630> doesn't<00:05:18.960> work<00:05:19.190> but<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.760> know

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
there and it doesn't work but you know

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.050 
there and it doesn't work but you know
I'll<00:05:21.780> have<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.080> put<00:05:22.980> a<00:05:24.080> USB<00:05:25.080> card<00:05:25.350> in<00:05:25.620> this<00:05:26.060> so

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
I'll have to put a USB card in this so

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.930 
I'll have to put a USB card in this so
that<00:05:27.090> I<00:05:27.240> can<00:05:27.330> plug<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.810> card<00:05:28.020> reader<00:05:28.320> in<00:05:28.940> that

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
that I can plug the card reader in that

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.659 
that I can plug the card reader in that
I<00:05:29.970> add<00:05:30.270> in<00:05:30.480> every<00:05:30.690> machine<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.320> we'll<00:05:32.160> do<00:05:32.370> a

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.490 

excuse<00:05:35.669> me<00:05:35.850> a<00:05:35.880> CD<00:05:36.180> controller<00:05:37.169> card<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:39.500> just

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
excuse me a CD controller card and just

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
excuse me a CD controller card and just
just<00:05:41.430> because<00:05:41.880> it's<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.210> PCI<00:05:42.660> slot<00:05:43.200> will<00:05:43.530> will

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
just because it's a PCI slot will will

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.360 
just because it's a PCI slot will will
use<00:05:44.790> those<00:05:45.120> SATA<00:05:45.540> ports<00:05:46.020> for<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.830> optical

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
use those SATA ports for the optical

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.600 
use those SATA ports for the optical
drives<00:05:47.729> if<00:05:48.720> I<00:05:49.110> wind<00:05:49.530> up<00:05:49.650> deciding<00:05:50.160> to<00:05:50.250> do<00:05:50.400> that

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
drives if I wind up deciding to do that

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.270 
drives if I wind up deciding to do that
I<00:05:50.790> did<00:05:51.419> talk<00:05:51.720> about<00:05:51.770> possibly<00:05:52.770> putting<00:05:53.010> one<00:05:53.190> of

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
I did talk about possibly putting one of

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.340 
I did talk about possibly putting one of
those<00:05:53.400> hybrid<00:05:53.820> drives<00:05:54.090> in<00:05:54.330> there<00:05:54.510> so<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:54.900> got<00:05:55.260> to

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
those hybrid drives in there so I got to

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.659 
those hybrid drives in there so I got to
make<00:05:55.500> up<00:05:55.650> my<00:05:55.800> mind<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.220> see<00:05:56.340> what<00:05:56.460> we're<00:05:56.550> going

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
make up my mind and see what we're going

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.040 
make up my mind and see what we're going
to<00:05:56.700> do<00:05:56.850> with<00:05:57.030> that<00:05:57.560> so<00:05:59.330> otherwise<00:06:00.330> I<00:06:00.600> got<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.840> I

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.780 
to do with that so otherwise I got to I
got<00:06:01.169> to<00:06:01.350> clean<00:06:01.620> this<00:06:01.800> thing<00:06:01.860> up<00:06:02.250> a<00:06:02.400> little<00:06:02.550> bit

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
got to clean this thing up a little bit

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.000 
got to clean this thing up a little bit
and<00:06:02.970> there<00:06:03.479> will<00:06:03.660> be<00:06:03.690> future<00:06:04.380> videos<00:06:04.710> that
