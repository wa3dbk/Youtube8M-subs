00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
describe this film I mean it's not

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.240 
describe this film I mean it's not
necessarily<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.510> horror<00:00:34.780> film<00:00:34.989> you<00:00:35.800> can't<00:00:36.070> call

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
necessarily a horror film you can't call

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.650 
necessarily a horror film you can't call
it<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.370> horror<00:00:36.579> film<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:37.030> can't<00:00:37.239> really<00:00:37.420> call

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
it a horror film you can't really call

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
it a horror film you can't really call
it<00:00:37.719> a<00:00:37.899> vampire<00:00:38.290> film

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
it a vampire film

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.750 
it a vampire film
it's<00:00:39.820> definitely<00:00:40.360> got<00:00:40.690> vampires<00:00:41.440> but<00:00:41.829> I<00:00:42.070> think

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
it's definitely got vampires but I think

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.280 
it's definitely got vampires but I think
weirdly<00:00:43.090> a<00:00:43.210> lot<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.660> people<00:00:43.899> could<00:00:44.020> relate<00:00:44.260> to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
weirdly a lot of people could relate to

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.280 
weirdly a lot of people could relate to
it<00:00:44.559> it's<00:00:44.770> just<00:00:45.010> so<00:00:45.219> real<00:00:45.520> and<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.780> stuff<00:00:47.079> that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
it it's just so real and the stuff that

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.260 
it it's just so real and the stuff that
you'll<00:00:47.440> see<00:00:47.680> in<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:47.950> it's<00:00:48.460> really<00:00:48.700> awesome<00:00:48.910> and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
you'll see in it it's really awesome and

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.389 
you'll see in it it's really awesome and
I<00:00:49.420> think<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:50.530> main<00:00:50.770> thing<00:00:50.980> is<00:00:51.100> about<00:00:51.340> a

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
I think the main thing is about a

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.000 
I think the main thing is about a
12-yard<00:00:52.059> growing<00:00:52.539> up<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.320> they'll<00:00:53.770> be<00:00:53.920> able

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
12-yard growing up and they'll be able

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.860 
12-yard growing up and they'll be able
to<00:00:54.160> reach<00:00:54.309> relate<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:55.030> some<00:00:55.239> people<00:00:55.539> I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
to reach relate to that some people I

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.290 
to reach relate to that some people I
never<00:00:56.469> even<00:00:56.590> heard<00:00:56.800> you<00:00:56.980> describe<00:00:57.250> it<00:00:57.670> before

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
never even heard you describe it before

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.540 
never even heard you describe it before
as<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.449> love<00:00:58.660> story<00:00:58.899> it<00:00:59.739> is<00:00:59.920> kind<00:01:00.219> of<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.370> love

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
as a love story it is kind of a love

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.520 
as a love story it is kind of a love
story<00:01:00.760> as<00:01:00.940> well<00:01:01.149> because<00:01:01.539> Owen<00:01:01.960> lives<00:01:02.320> in<00:01:02.410> his

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
story as well because Owen lives in his

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.200 
story as well because Owen lives in his
own<00:01:02.649> world<00:01:02.710> he<00:01:03.370> thinks<00:01:03.670> that<00:01:03.789> she<00:01:03.820> does<00:01:04.089> as

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
own world he thinks that she does as

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.010 
own world he thinks that she does as
well<00:01:04.360> he<00:01:04.479> doesn't<00:01:04.720> know<00:01:04.780> she's<00:01:05.020> a<00:01:05.050> vampire<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
well he doesn't know she's a vampire and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.740 
well he doesn't know she's a vampire and
they<00:01:08.520> when<00:01:09.520> they<00:01:09.640> meet<00:01:09.880> each<00:01:09.909> other<00:01:10.240> they<00:01:10.570> have

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
they when they meet each other they have

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.310 
they when they meet each other they have
each<00:01:10.900> other

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
each other

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.480 
each other
so<00:01:11.470> when<00:01:11.799> they<00:01:11.890> come<00:01:12.070> home<00:01:12.220> they<00:01:12.280> have

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
so when they come home they have

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.219 
so when they come home they have
something<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.880> look<00:01:12.970> forward<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.659> think

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
something to look forward to I think

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.080 
something to look forward to I think
that's<00:01:14.409> very<00:01:14.530> nice<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:15.760> you've<00:01:15.909> had<00:01:16.060> a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
that's very nice that you've had a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.600 
that's very nice that you've had a
chance<00:01:16.360> to<00:01:16.540> kind<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.260> do<00:01:17.409> a<00:01:17.439> film<00:01:17.740> that<00:01:18.220> that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
chance to kind of do a film that that

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.179 
chance to kind of do a film that that
deals<00:01:19.420> with<00:01:19.509> vampires<00:01:19.960> are<00:01:20.770> do<00:01:21.159> you

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
deals with vampires are do you

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.800 
deals with vampires are do you
understand<00:01:21.610> why<00:01:21.759> people<00:01:22.090> are<00:01:22.180> so<00:01:22.299> attracted

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
understand why people are so attracted

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.870 
understand why people are so attracted
to<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.049> particular<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.830> guess<00:01:24.369> theme<00:01:24.640> or

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
to that particular I guess theme or

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
to that particular I guess theme or
genre<00:01:25.330> definitely<00:01:26.110> because<00:01:26.470> I<00:01:26.740> think<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.689> can

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
genre definitely because I think you can

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.789 
genre definitely because I think you can
take<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.140> vampire

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799

and it's already a story itself they

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.880 
and it's already a story itself they
have<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.659> kill<00:01:31.840> people<00:01:31.869> to<00:01:32.170> survive<00:01:32.500> that's
