00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.370
 Hello, I want to record this video 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.800
 training practices 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.530
 breath holding 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.250
 more precisely the preparatory saw that all 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.220
 the overall picture was clear as needed 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.539
 train what you need to train like 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.699
 train why why and naturally 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.960
 workout safety related 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.550
 holding the breath 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.399
 treasure with diving could not 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.120
 find complete information about william 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.370
 pictures 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.210
 training with what is connected after all that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 happens in the body when a person 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.079
 hold your breath pido un this 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.210
 do it when you train 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.940
 just trained and everything i was 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.359
 the result is, well, I did not have to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.430
 a lot of blues fucking in training I became 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.650
 study yourself check that is well on 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.370
 I am more affected that gives more 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.370
 result 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.810
 clean came from the side you see that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.780
 affects the breath hold that can 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.350
 train and how can you train 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.600
 Hello, I checked myself only 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.750
 didn't read anything too much 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.390
 still studied the exercise picked up 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.550
 under me so comfortable throw me 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:42.270
 fits what exactly I wanted to tell what 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.950
 if anyone thinks to train on 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.050
 holding your breath this means doing 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.540
 holding your breath just dress up a plan 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.440
 salvation and that's enough 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.290
 it means he can do enough 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.090
 train up this way time 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.760
 a lot of results can go away 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.980
 small dinner to train more 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.980
 globally and walk from different angles 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.170
 let's start with the simplest thing 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.820
 need for maximum breath hold 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.110
 that is, you need a supply of oxygen 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.800
 naturally the maximum 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.060
 opportunity 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.330
 and qualitatively its economical use 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.989
 organism from this point of view can 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.350
 suit 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.560
 why the question is because if a person 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.599
 just give information about something 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.420
 if the question is asked therefore with 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.250
 questions where does the general mechanism begin 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:50.390
 cheaper that is naturally the lungs themselves 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.860
 that is, you need to train the lungs need 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.850
 train their quality 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.590
 volume to train their gas exchange that is 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.140
 replacement speed 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.440
 the quality of gas exchange in general 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.760
 molecular quality that is purity then 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.600
 there is elasticity of the elastic diaphragm 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.000
 from the lungs 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.500
 respiratory center also trained in 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.500
 he has a certain range 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.790
 the percentage of gas in the tissue in 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.170
 blood to the brain that is if 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.610
 range is broken here but he 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.590
 naturally trying to force you 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.320
 breathe you have willpower ears 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.420
 hold back all this range you need 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.150
 expand pushing professionals he 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.490
 very but dangerous limits 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.700
 when already crying just 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.950
 easy comes while newbies 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.890
 rarely offensive that they have not 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.830
 enough willpower to relocate 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:56.190
 it is this range when the body 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.080
 respiratory center is not ready for sensors there 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.080
 can be said to be located here 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:09.180
 carotid artery or quality control 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:13.710
 supplying their quality with blood rest 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.290
 there is a brain that is control full this 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.160
 range need to be trained to develop 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.830
 in a certain way too 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.510
 I definitely did an exercise of my own 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.530
 for themselves as what is convenient for me 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.830
 diverse power this in a separate video 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.080
 also 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:34.320
 what next is the blood, that is, it transfers 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.600
 oxygen in the bone tissue in terms of 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.840
 cut that is hemoglobin everything is possible 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.400
 let's make it work well and clearly 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.200
 quickly 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.000
 this is your approach again 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:50.730
 there is a hormonal system that is, if 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.760
 organism conditions where gas exchange saturn 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.670
 that is, throw out certain hormones 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.460
 in the blood pancreas alert 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.150
 adrenal glands ie hormones that 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.730
 help that is to stock up oxygen 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.540
 keep him endorse expenses that is 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:13.020
 and other ways of saving i mean they 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.380
 help many know such a thing here 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:20.040
 exchange and the delay becomes more 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.930
 everything is simple here comments and factor already 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.540
 which is triggered or the delay pole 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.220
 breathing 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.920
 when the farm does not increase the amount 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.960
 carbon dioxide it's automatic 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.570
 relaxes all muscles even those that 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.900
 you can't deliberately relax it just 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.150
 having triggered relax all muscles 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.750
 that is, if the muscles are relaxed then 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.480
 they consume less oxygen no 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.340
 no voltage spasms this is a plus 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.180
 breath holding if the muscles are relaxed 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.760
 and the same effect goes and psyche brain 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.980
 if the head is relaxed and the body 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.750
 relaxes if the body relax in 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.200
 head relaxes this is the opposite effect 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.690
 on men experimentally prove that 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.440
 there works 2 part 3 part after 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:10.249
 15 minutes of such action hormones 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.679
 triggers that is 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.819
 families again which helps 

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:18.289
 the body can handle 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:20.329
 There are a lot of words on the transmitter 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.949
 factors that work help 

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:24.259
 if you train them know how they are 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.299
 work in advance is to foresee everything then 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.119
 can be very serious about their quality 

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:31.849
 workouts increase while saving 

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:35.179
 time to workout and get more 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:38.209
 I will tell you the result 

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:39.289
 step by step in more detail on something 

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:41.839
 specifically grip 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.699
 in the following videos because in one 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:49.099
 video I can not drive it all 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:52.129
 systems themselves have nikita have like 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:55.039
 delay techniques gymnastics that is how 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:57.229
 with easy work even with food there 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.389
 examples of products that help 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:03.619
 the quality of the lungs raise without enhance 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:07.249
 a lot of all sorts of ways I will try 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:09.289
 pass it on just when i started this 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:10.599
 it knew nothing and that everything in the 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:16.039
 worked in the process 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:18.679
 I want to share this future lay 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:22.819
 necessarily video in more detail and more 

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:27.379
 accented who will be interested in who 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:30.849
 It is interesting to know what to do to everyone bye. 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.849
 clean water and
