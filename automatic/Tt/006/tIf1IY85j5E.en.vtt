exactly<00:00:15.809> though<00:00:16.139> because<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.740> pretty

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
exactly though because this I pretty

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.010 
exactly though because this I pretty
sure<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.310> picture<00:00:17.580> from<00:00:17.699> New<00:00:17.910> Hope<00:00:18.150> could<00:00:18.930> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
sure the picture from New Hope could it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.929 
sure the picture from New Hope could it
be<00:00:19.140> because<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.920> packaging<00:00:20.609> style

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
be because that was the packaging style

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.090 
be because that was the packaging style

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
- well I didn't really want to try to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.980 
- well I didn't really want to try to
force<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.570> another<00:01:36.570> thing<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.869> really

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
force it so another thing I really

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.429 
force it so another thing I really
didn't<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.240> helmet<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.390> falls<00:01:40.259> off

really<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:40.920> easily<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.259> considering

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
really really easily and considering

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.990 
really really easily and considering
that<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> face<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.649> already<00:01:44.130> looks<00:01:44.880> like

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that the face is already looks like

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.429 
that the face is already looks like
there's<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.360> paints<00:01:45.840> already<00:01:46.079> kind<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
scratched on it I don't understand why

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.310 
scratched on it I don't understand why
this<00:01:49.290> needed<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.009> loose<00:01:51.200> also<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> don't

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
this needed to be so loose also I don't

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200 
this needed to be so loose also I don't
know<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.189> character<00:01:53.970> itself

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
know if this it's the character itself

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.170 
know if this it's the character itself
supposed<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.750> scars<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.170> his<00:01:55.470> face<00:01:56.180> but

price<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.470> little<00:02:40.590> too<00:02:40.709> high<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.340> my<00:02:41.400> opinion

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
price is a little too high in my opinion

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.839 
price is a little too high in my opinion
but<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:43.380> know<00:02:43.500> catching<00:02:44.340> what<00:02:44.489> he<00:02:44.550> comes<00:02:44.700> with

but you know catching what he comes with
I<00:02:44.940> think<00:02:45.150> price<00:02:45.390> should<00:02:45.569> be<00:02:45.720> two<00:02:46.350> dollars<00:02:46.620> less

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.259 
I think price should be two dollars less
but<00:02:47.100> that's<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.400> my<00:02:47.549> opinion<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:48.000> know<00:02:48.090> what
