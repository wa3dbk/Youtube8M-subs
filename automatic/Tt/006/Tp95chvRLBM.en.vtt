best sensitivity I find is just do it
just<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.320> little<00:02:16.620> bit<00:02:16.740> under<00:02:16.890> halfway

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
just just a little bit under halfway

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.070 
just just a little bit under halfway
that<00:02:17.610> will<00:02:17.700> give<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> best<00:02:18.330> sensitivity

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
that will give you the best sensitivity

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.270 
that will give you the best sensitivity
it's<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.410> too<00:02:19.530> fast<00:02:19.740> not<00:02:19.860> too<00:02:19.920> slow<00:02:20.040> just

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
it's not too fast not too slow just

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.700 
it's not too fast not too slow just
right<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.930> want<00:02:22.110> leave<00:02:22.260> all<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
right so you want leave all this the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.540 
right so you want leave all this the
same<00:02:22.920> but<00:02:23.160> then<00:02:23.250> when<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.460> get<00:02:23.550> steering<00:02:23.940> axis

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
same but then when you get steering axis

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.610 
same but then when you get steering axis
which<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:27.390> x-axis<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:28.110> should<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.380> right

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
which is the x-axis it should be right

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.530 
which is the x-axis it should be right
already<00:02:29.420> but<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:32.090> even<00:02:33.090> if<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.330> let

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
already but as you can see even if I let

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.970 
already but as you can see even if I let
go<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:34.080> out<00:02:34.230> note<00:02:34.590> because<00:02:34.800> I've

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
go a little out note because I've

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.650 
go a little out note because I've
already<00:02:35.190> changed<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.580> usually<00:02:36.060> like<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.240> so

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
already changed it usually like that so

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.330 
already changed it usually like that so
I'm<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:37.050> even<00:02:37.290> got<00:02:37.530> hold<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.920> controller

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
I'm not even got hold of the controller

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.910 
I'm not even got hold of the controller
and<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.330> sense<00:02:39.960> in<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.320> iron<00:02:40.590> turning

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and it's a sense in the iron turning

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.070 
and it's a sense in the iron turning
left<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.850> what<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.120> can<00:02:42.210> do<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.570> just<00:02:42.750> pull

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
left so what you can do is just pull

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.050 
left so what you can do is just pull
this<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.290> until<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.130> can't<00:02:44.340> see<00:02:44.520> anymore

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
this up until you can't see anymore

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.320 
this up until you can't see anymore
I<00:02:45.090> pull<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.900> up<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:47.010> comfortably<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.940> even

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
I pull it up so it's comfortably so even

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.300 
I pull it up so it's comfortably so even
when<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.480> turn<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.110> slightly<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.860> not<00:02:50.070> even

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
when I turn it slightly it's not even

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.720 
when I turn it slightly it's not even
there<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:50.940> yeah<00:02:51.780> that's<00:02:52.050> nice<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.350> like<00:02:52.620> that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
there so yeah that's nice I like that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.680 
there so yeah that's nice I like that
then<00:02:53.730> what<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:53.940> want<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.090> go<00:02:54.210> down<00:02:54.450> for

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
then what you want to go down for

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.360 
then what you want to go down for
acceleration<00:02:55.110> usually<00:02:55.770> have<00:02:55.920> one<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
acceleration usually have one of the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.820 
acceleration usually have one of the
back<00:02:56.730> buttons<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.930> Xbox<00:02:58.230> controller<00:02:58.590> it's

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
back buttons on the Xbox controller it's

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.970 
back buttons on the Xbox controller it's
called<00:02:59.070> RT<00:02:59.490> I<00:02:59.730> will<00:03:00.600> change<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> RT<00:03:01.740> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
called RT I will change this to RT and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.400 
called RT I will change this to RT and
as<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.910> see<00:03:03.090> I've<00:03:03.330> not<00:03:03.870> even<00:03:04.110> got<00:03:04.260> my

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
as you can see I've not even got my

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.530 
as you can see I've not even got my
finger<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.310> acceleration<00:03:05.730> button<00:03:06.210> and

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
finger on the acceleration button and

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.690 
finger on the acceleration button and
it's<00:03:06.810> registering<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.740> as<00:03:08.010> accelerating

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
it's registering it as accelerating

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.900 
it's registering it as accelerating
halfway<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.960> what<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.320> want<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.500> do<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.910> drag

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
halfway so what you want to do is drag

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.360 
halfway so what you want to do is drag
the<00:03:11.940> dead<00:03:12.360> zone<00:03:12.660> all<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.440> way<00:03:13.560> up<00:03:13.800> until<00:03:14.040> he

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
the dead zone all the way up until he

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.220 
the dead zone all the way up until he
disappears<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.360> now<00:03:15.480> when<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.720> move<00:03:16.050> it

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
disappears so now when I move it

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.440 
disappears so now when I move it
slightly<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.790> goes<00:03:18.000> up<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.360> then

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
slightly it so goes up and then

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.570 
slightly it so goes up and then
disappears<00:03:18.840> when<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.080> let<00:03:19.200> go<00:03:19.380> same<00:03:20.340> with<00:03:20.489> the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
disappears when I let go same with the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.000 
disappears when I let go same with the
brake<00:03:20.790> with<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.330> brake<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.900> will<00:03:22.290> click<00:03:22.770> and

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
brake with the brake I will click and

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.460 
brake with the brake I will click and
change<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.420> LT<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:26.780> as<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.050> can<00:03:28.170> see<00:03:28.320> this

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
change this to LT so as you can see this

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.080 
change this to LT so as you can see this
one's<00:03:28.680> actually<00:03:28.860> alright<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.730> doesn't<00:03:30.000> need

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
one's actually alright it doesn't need

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.180 
one's actually alright it doesn't need
to<00:03:30.180> be<00:03:30.209> moved<00:03:30.450> at<00:03:30.630> all<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.530> that's<00:03:31.860> what<00:03:32.070> you'll

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
to be moved at all so that's what you'll

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.810 
to be moved at all so that's what you'll
get<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.390> then<00:03:33.890> when<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:34.980> get<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.220> look<00:03:35.430> up<00:03:35.580> and

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
get so then when you get to look up and

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.729 
get so then when you get to look up and
down<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.720> want<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.989> get<00:03:37.110> your<00:03:37.260> right<00:03:37.500> analog

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
down you want to get your right analog

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.650 
down you want to get your right analog
stick<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.340> just<00:03:38.610> push<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.850> up<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.480> all

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
stick and just push it up and it all

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.920 
stick and just push it up and it all
register<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.980> as<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.190> can<00:03:41.280> see<00:03:41.660> now<00:03:42.660> it's

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
register that so as you can see now it's

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.740 
register that so as you can see now it's
gotten<00:03:43.200> as<00:03:43.709> actually<00:03:44.130> right<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.330> just<00:03:45.600> move

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
gotten as actually right so I just move

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.080 
gotten as actually right so I just move
that<00:03:45.900> up<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.560> sure<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.700> yeah<00:03:47.880> and

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
that up it just to be sure so yeah and

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.300 
that up it just to be sure so yeah and
then<00:03:48.239> look<00:03:48.570> left<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.870> right<00:03:48.959> get<00:03:49.440> your<00:03:49.590> right

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
then look left and right get your right

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.090 
then look left and right get your right
analog<00:03:50.550> stick<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.060> just<00:03:51.930> put<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.200> left<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.680> it

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
analog stick and just put it left and it

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.090 
analog stick and just put it left and it
or<00:03:53.190> register<00:03:53.580> so<00:03:54.180> now<00:03:54.300> as<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.690> can<00:03:54.959> see<00:03:55.100> that

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
or register so now as you can see that

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.490 
or register so now as you can see that
I'll<00:03:56.430> be<00:03:56.610> able<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.880> move<00:03:57.510> around<00:03:57.720> my<00:03:58.320> head

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
I'll be able to move around my head

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.870 
I'll be able to move around my head
