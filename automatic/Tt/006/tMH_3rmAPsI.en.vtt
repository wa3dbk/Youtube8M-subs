00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
phobia of turning around because you

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.700 
phobia of turning around because you

something<00:04:41.920> right<00:04:42.310> in<00:04:42.460> your<00:04:42.580> face

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.250 

seriously<00:04:46.570> like<00:04:46.720> I<00:04:46.810> have<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.080> right<00:04:47.200> now

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
seriously like I have that right now

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.960 
seriously like I have that right now
like<00:04:47.410> that's<00:04:47.770> why<00:04:47.950> you<00:04:48.010> don't<00:04:48.340> see<00:04:48.550> me<00:04:48.670> turning

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
like that's why you don't see me turning

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.030 
like that's why you don't see me turning
around<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.300> often<00:04:49.570> because<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.680> just<00:04:50.890> don't

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
around that often because I just don't

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.680 
around that often because I just don't
want<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.190> turn<00:04:51.370> around<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:52.150> see<00:04:52.270> some<00:04:52.420> big-ass

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
want to turn around and see some big-ass

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.060 
want to turn around and see some big-ass
pterodactyl<00:04:53.590> ride<00:04:53.740> my<00:04:53.860> face<00:04:54.160> like<00:04:54.430> before<00:04:56.070> it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
pterodactyl ride my face like before it

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.360 
pterodactyl ride my face like before it
also<00:04:57.220> makes<00:04:57.520> it<00:04:57.670> bad<00:04:57.820> because<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.960> game

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
also makes it bad because the game

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.520 
also makes it bad because the game
unintentionally<00:05:00.370> is<00:05:00.580> freaky<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:01.150> think<00:05:01.540> due<00:05:02.440> to

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
unintentionally is freaky I think due to

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.150 
unintentionally is freaky I think due to
the<00:05:02.620> fact<00:05:02.890> that<00:05:03.360> PlayStation<00:05:04.360> games<00:05:04.570> as<00:05:05.160> mini

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
the fact that PlayStation games as mini

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.230 
the fact that PlayStation games as mini
games<00:05:06.460> of<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:06.910> time<00:05:07.690> had<00:05:09.000> they<00:05:10.000> have<00:05:10.210> a

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
games of that time had they have a

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.290 
games of that time had they have a
problem<00:05:10.570> with<00:05:10.720> pop<00:05:11.020> up<00:05:11.290> with<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:11.920> polygons<00:05:12.430> so

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
problem with pop up with the polygons so

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.750 
problem with pop up with the polygons so
you'll<00:05:13.720> be<00:05:13.930> like<00:05:14.380> running<00:05:14.650> along<00:05:15.010> and<00:05:15.550> all<00:05:15.730> of

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
you'll be like running along and all of

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.520 
you'll be like running along and all of
a<00:05:15.880> sudden<00:05:15.910> boom<00:05:16.480> something<00:05:16.870> disappears<00:05:17.350> right

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
a sudden boom something disappears right

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.290 
a sudden boom something disappears right
in<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.710> middle<00:05:17.860> of<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:18.130> screen<00:05:18.430> because<00:05:19.150> of

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
in the middle of the screen because of

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.350 
in the middle of the screen because of
the<00:05:19.420> pop-up<00:05:20.730> so<00:05:21.730> I<00:05:22.000> don't<00:05:22.150> know<00:05:22.210> how

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360
