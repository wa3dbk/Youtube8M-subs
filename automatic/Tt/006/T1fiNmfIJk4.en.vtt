00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:35.590 
okay I'm guessing I can't go that way
for<00:00:26.289> now

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.500

already

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.550 

when<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.340> was<00:00:51.430> rage<00:00:51.640> attacks<00:00:52.000> like<00:00:52.210> on<00:00:52.390> here<00:00:52.660> so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
when it was rage attacks like on here so

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.750 
when it was rage attacks like on here so
I<00:00:53.590> guess<00:00:53.740> that's<00:00:53.920> one<00:00:54.100> thing<00:00:54.280> you<00:00:54.370> want<00:00:54.520> to<00:00:54.580> try

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
I guess that's one thing you want to try

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.550 
I guess that's one thing you want to try
and<00:00:54.910> do<00:00:55.000> is<00:00:55.120> get<00:00:55.300> your<00:00:55.420> rage<00:00:55.930> up<00:00:56.110> on<00:00:56.200> each<00:00:56.320> Lola

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
and do is get your rage up on each Lola

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.780 
and do is get your rage up on each Lola
so<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:56.710> can<00:00:56.830> see<00:00:56.980> what<00:00:57.100> each<00:00:57.220> unique<00:00:57.580> rage

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
so you can see what each unique rage

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.850 
so you can see what each unique rage
attack<00:00:57.940> looks<00:00:58.300> like<00:00:58.540> until<00:00:59.380> these<00:00:59.590> fuckers
