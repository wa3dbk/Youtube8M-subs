00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
take out and replace a headset so the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.390 
take out and replace a headset so the
first<00:00:10.290> thing<00:00:10.440> you're<00:00:10.590> gonna<00:00:10.710> want<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.070> do<00:00:11.219> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
first thing you're gonna want to do is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.180 
first thing you're gonna want to do is
loosen<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:12.030> stem<00:00:12.349> bolt<00:00:13.349> rate<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> side

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
loosen the stem bolt rate on the side

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.269 
loosen the stem bolt rate on the side
here<00:00:14.460> now<00:00:15.080> these<00:00:16.080> are<00:00:16.320> usually<00:00:16.500> connected

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
here now these are usually connected

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310 
here now these are usually connected
right<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> fork<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.570> make<00:00:18.779> sure<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.109> stem

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
right to the fork to make sure the stem

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.260 
right to the fork to make sure the stem
doesn't<00:00:19.710> move<00:00:19.859> when<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> bar<00:00:20.910> spin

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
doesn't move when you do like a bar spin

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.529 
doesn't move when you do like a bar spin
or<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> pro<00:00:21.810> op<00:00:22.460> or<00:00:23.460> tune<00:00:23.640> your<00:00:23.789> bars<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.180> any<00:00:24.359> way

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
or a pro op or tune your bars in any way

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.240 
or a pro op or tune your bars in any way
so<00:00:25.140> you're<00:00:25.410> first<00:00:25.619> gonna<00:00:25.740> want<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> loosen

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
so you're first gonna want to loosen

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:49.869 
so you're first gonna want to loosen
those<00:00:26.430> up

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.150 

okay<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.510> once<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:51.899> done<00:00:51.929> with<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
okay so once you're done with that the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.770 
okay so once you're done with that the
stem<00:00:53.370> should<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.760> able<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.359> move<00:00:54.539> around

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
stem should be able to just move around

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.410 
stem should be able to just move around
a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.109> bit<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.670> next<00:00:56.789> thing<00:00:57.059> you're<00:00:57.179> gonna

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
a little bit the next thing you're gonna

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.729 
a little bit the next thing you're gonna
want<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.989> remove<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.350> four

want to do is remove the four

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.329 
want to do is remove the four
compression<00:00:59.370> bolt<00:00:59.899> now<00:01:00.899> Anmol<00:01:01.620> sports<00:01:02.070> is

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
compression bolt now Anmol sports is

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.749 
compression bolt now Anmol sports is
pretty<00:01:02.909> much<00:01:03.059> ready<00:01:03.329> tighty<00:01:03.629> lefty<00:01:03.750> loosey<00:01:04.759> so

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
pretty much ready tighty lefty loosey so

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.340 
pretty much ready tighty lefty loosey so
we'll<00:01:05.940> just<00:01:06.119> go<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> left<00:01:06.600> loosen<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> up

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
we'll just go to the left loosen it up

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.430 
we'll just go to the left loosen it up
and<00:01:07.909> then<00:01:08.909> after<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.539> few<00:01:09.600> turns<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.289> whole

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
and then after a few turns the whole

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.350 
and then after a few turns the whole
step<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.310> whole<00:01:11.460> compression<00:01:12.000> capsule<00:01:12.330> just

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
step the whole compression capsule just

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.440 
step the whole compression capsule just
come<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:12.840> off

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
is this slowly just turn the bars until

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.590 
is this slowly just turn the bars until
the<00:01:34.049> stem<00:01:34.259> comes<00:01:34.560> off<00:01:38.330> next<00:01:39.330> you're<00:01:39.479> gonna

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the stem comes off next you're gonna

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
the stem comes off next you're gonna
want<00:01:39.929> to<00:01:40.049> remove<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.740> dust<00:01:40.920> cap<00:01:41.190> that<00:01:41.220> goes<00:01:41.429> on

want to remove the dust cap that goes on

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.840 
want to remove the dust cap that goes on
top<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> bearings<00:01:44.869> now<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.259> my<00:01:46.619> stem<00:01:47.580> I

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
top of the bearings now on my stem I

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.419 
top of the bearings now on my stem I
have<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> spacer<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.709> make<00:01:50.159> sure<00:01:50.340> you

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
have a spacer you make make sure you

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.270 
have a spacer you make make sure you
want<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> keep<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:54.259> next<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.679> is<00:01:55.739> what<00:01:56.099> your

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
want to keep that next this is what your

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.400 
want to keep that next this is what your
bearings<00:01:56.610> will<00:01:56.819> mostly<00:01:57.239> look<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.690> this<00:01:58.259> is

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
bearings will mostly look like this is

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.889 
bearings will mostly look like this is
good<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.709> know<00:01:58.739> throughout<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.250> process<00:01:59.899> so

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
good to know throughout the process so

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.510 
good to know throughout the process so
the<00:02:01.020> first<00:02:01.229> thing<00:02:01.410> you're<00:02:01.619> gonna<00:02:01.739> take<00:02:02.129> out<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the first thing you're gonna take out is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.350 
the first thing you're gonna take out is
the<00:02:02.819> bearing<00:02:03.500> ring<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:04.979> called<00:02:05.360> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the bearing ring I think it's called and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.790 
the bearing ring I think it's called and
then<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:06.690> will<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.989> little<00:02:07.289> internal

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
then there will be a little internal

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.670 
then there will be a little internal
ring<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.970> there's<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.050> bearings<00:02:13.470> look

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
ring and there's what the bearings look

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.210 
ring and there's what the bearings look
like<00:02:13.920> now<00:02:14.550> if<00:02:14.760> you're<00:02:14.940> going<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.450> remove<00:02:15.810> this

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
like now if you're going to remove this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.369 
like now if you're going to remove this
all<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.400> gotta<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.360> slight<00:02:18.900> off<00:02:19.050> with<00:02:19.230> a

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
all you gotta do is a slight off with a

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.150 
all you gotta do is a slight off with a
fork<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.540> then<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:22.349> whole<00:02:22.530> fork<00:02:22.830> will<00:02:22.980> just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
fork and then this whole fork will just

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.320 
fork and then this whole fork will just
come<00:02:23.310> right<00:02:23.519> off<00:02:25.129> now<00:02:26.129> their<00:02:26.370> bearings<00:02:26.879> on<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
come right off now their bearings on the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.240 
come right off now their bearings on the
top<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.780> bottom<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.379> head<00:02:28.530> -<00:02:28.709> there's

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
top and bottom of the head - there's

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.820 
top and bottom of the head - there's
bearings<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:29.940> here<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:31.410> then<00:02:31.500> there<00:02:31.800> are

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
bearings up here and then there are

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.860 
bearings up here and then there are
bearings<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.580> bottom<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:36.690> you're

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
bearings on the bottom now if you're

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.380 
bearings on the bottom now if you're
going<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.230> remove<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:38.819> really<00:02:39.030> stuck

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
going to remove it if it's really stuck

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.479 
going to remove it if it's really stuck
in<00:02:39.569> there<00:02:39.599> all<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.140> gotta<00:02:40.319> do<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.590> um<00:02:41.010> take<00:02:41.459> a

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
in there all you gotta do is um take a

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.210
