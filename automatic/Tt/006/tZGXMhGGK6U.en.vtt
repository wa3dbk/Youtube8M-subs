about the Gothic culture which is the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.990 
about the Gothic culture which is the
DIY<00:03:54.410> aspect<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.100> artist<00:03:56.489> community

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
DIY aspect and the artist community

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.710 
DIY aspect and the artist community
aspect<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:59.000> so<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.030> don't<00:04:00.150> want<00:04:00.330> that<00:04:00.510> to

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
aspect of it and so I don't want that to

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.740 
aspect of it and so I don't want that to
die<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:01.380> when<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.100> comes<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.510> drifting<00:04:03.510> or

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
die and so when it comes to drifting or

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.070 
die and so when it comes to drifting or
designer<00:04:04.709> only<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.370> think<00:04:05.730> an<00:04:05.940> even<00:04:06.239> balance<00:04:06.600> is

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080

what<00:04:07.769> works<00:04:08.010> best<00:04:08.510> sometimes<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:10.049> really<00:04:10.260> can

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
what works best sometimes you really can

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.199 
what works best sometimes you really can
