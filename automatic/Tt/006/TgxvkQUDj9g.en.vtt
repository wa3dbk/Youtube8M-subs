00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.550
 Eye make up for brown eyes and 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.760
 over on the canal from the beauty to 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.369
 go or kati there is a mecca for 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.110
 blue eyes so much fun and we 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.640
 Begin immediately before joining today 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.470
 Eye make-up I'll show you yet 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.570
 very quickly what I have on my face 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.250
 has applied and I only 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.860
 once the foundation of maybelline 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.750
 use your own 105 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.190
 entire face applied with the ebel 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.720
 in youtube countries make up the thalia 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.190
 then I for under the eyes to 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.559
 perfect match gasoline engine from l'oreal 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.969
 applied highly recommended covers 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.350
 very nice off such a medium opacity 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.120
 the part about 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.430
 and I have a bit of that too 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.020
 the foundation of the concealer and of 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.969
 the albert mineral powder that I have now 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.740
 use on the eyelids and also a 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.050
 a bit under the skin 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.649
 so for me that's still real 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.310
 the best base eyeshadow and stuff like that 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:17.229
 and that's why I'm rowing and madcon 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.509
 Many residents eyelids a bit 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.070
 From the next step was one 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.229
 bit down on that to wear 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.909
 The katies anglo brown saw him holding 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.890
 I just have a little bit of it 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.229
 on my bank a little bit 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.390
 underneath applied to the sleeps and 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.280
 then came a little bit of it 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.080
 pro reli sda that's a very nice one 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.580
 Pietsch have the rouge for those 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.159
 of you who did not notice that 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.950
 and lastly I wear before 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.369
 Eye make-up still such a favorite with 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.720
 plus pin anything from lyxor logo on 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.060
 in the color grid 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.590
 and then we come to those and that 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.420
 I have this beautiful first 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.110
 bright eyeshadow of manhattan used 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.579
 that's the color 31 degrees peaches and such 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.079
 he does not give much color just like that 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.939
 a light shine and I think 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.040
 just happens to be great as a face for 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.560
 the whole song is easy with 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.440
 to apply the fingers and over it 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.630
 then comes one of the highlights 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.850
 hopefully of the whole and sat on one 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.440
 of these in the cable eyeshadow of 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.820
 l'oreal that is actually rather pigments 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.920
 eyeshadow has a buttery soft 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.650
 beautiful consistency and that is 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.790
 now the color 0044 pink and I have 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.610
 That's why I decided for the color 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.530
 because pink supposedly such a contrast 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.630
 forms too brown and therefore because 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.210
 Brown should look especially nice 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.950
 the cables can not see bright pink 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.150
 So no one needs are afraid is the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.040
 somehow not suitable for everyday use empty 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.960
 or not at all so it really is 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.270
 just a light pink china and me 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.800
 then find it really very beautiful I am 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.930
 a bit of a second 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.110
 Eyeshadow from Manhattan That's one 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.480
 friendly raging in 92 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.650
 with the pink fable and that's how it comes from 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.040
 a little something at the bottom 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.600
 eyelash and then comes exactly this 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.160
 Just put the paint back in the eyelet fold 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.440
 I build all so long until 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.540
 happy with the results and you 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.420
 knows the game dazzle dazzle dazzle 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.980
 the more you hide the more the better 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.960
 It's beautiful in the end and above all 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.370
 you want to be darker the longer you are 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.560
 you should also use the brush off 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:21.500
 stay and I always fade in 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 and so far the whole thing off and 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.230
 Now it's the second one, and that's right 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.850
 alone that from one of l'oreal and 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.790
 honestly the quality is really great 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.910
 that's one of those zippers 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.830
 neighbors for hazel eyes so for brown 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.720
 eyes supposedly and the special thing about that 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.090
 Part is from far away looks like 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.890
 black but the alone has to the whole 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.540
 slight dealer stich and that should 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.040
 allegedly just brown eyes to radiate 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.860
 bring 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.730
 somehow make it look even better 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.260
 as hopefully steps anyway 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.540
 I honestly do not know if that 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.010
 true but I find the fallopian tube very 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.290
 nice i like i have and 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.420
 These shots, while short and 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.250
 simple but as always alone 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.379
 I'm really three times 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.769
 Will take a long time to be satisfied 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.810
 was 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.019
 but when I was it then I have again 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.660
 times the p2 in the press tent used in 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.579
 this black cable has mine again 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.760
 upper and lower waterline in 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.020
 painted in black and I'm from 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.690
 the quality is still total 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.580
 so excited again 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.500
 denied butter soft product so 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.970
 you do not need long and strong 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.050
 express and you have really nice 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.870
 whopping black I have the beginning of the 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.210
 to bring eyelashes to study and then as 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.610
 mascara the patrice bryant mascara in 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.940
 waterproof I think that's very nice 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.100
 reminds me a bit of those of 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.889
 lancome this hypnosis is as well 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.400
 a lot cheaper it costs me 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:58.090
 think 395 and I find it extended 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.830
 beautiful flowers great mascara for 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.510
 those who still feel like it 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.449
 I here the installation lister of patrice 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.490
 I use as a matte highlighter 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.830
 the eyebrow simply with the pen 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.930
 applied and then easily with the 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.060
 finger makes me beautiful and makes 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.030
 style and the rest of the make-up shines 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.440
 quite strong and as a last resort 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.940
 I'll use one of these new ones 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.520
 ipod cancels from manhattan 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.110
 next to the color 93 de I always find 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.150
 I'm really good, too 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.039
 fallen eyebrows do not stand 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.110
 So I have my own 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.160
 taken to it and the whole blinded 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.229
