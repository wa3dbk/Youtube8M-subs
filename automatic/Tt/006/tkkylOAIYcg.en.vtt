00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 welcome in the 20s on the occasion of 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.930
 this year's halloween decided to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.740
 try turning it into a factory 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.940
 girl precisely using also 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.379
 jewelry dresses and a similar hairstyle 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.240
 precisely to the one they brought in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.640
 twenties and we immediately see how I have 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.100
 done opens with the base definitely more 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.710
 clear of my complexion using 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.340
 2 bb king and then I go to hang out with a 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.340
 brush 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.590
 obviously the clearer you are, the better 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.640
 because we know that in the past 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.489
 light complexion from sanremo di 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.750
 gaza requests then go to cancel 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.750
 my imperfections with the concealer 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.660
 always everything with the same brush e 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.190
 later I set my base with 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.190
 a transparent powder 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.160
 now comes the fun part 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.840
 clear eyebrows 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.330
 I simply used the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.600
 corrector and then I walked the whole thing 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.930
 with a figure this time colored I have to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.090
 however, advise that it is necessary to repeat 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.690
 the passage many times because the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.240
 however, the corrector tends to disappear 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.869
 here here is this is the final result, however, 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.090
 of many of the many many layers I go for 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.200
 redraw my eyebrows 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.410
 decidedly higher is definitely 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.810
 thinner and definitely longer and 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.140
 precisely dramatic with a pencil 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.210
 brown and then I will go to 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.790
 fix my brown pencil with a 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.500
 even brown eyeshadow for 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.500
 eyebrows here it is 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.450
 Now let's start with the eye makeup removal 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.700
 these two goals xi and port in 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.360
 short-sightedness that causes a bit like colors 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.520
 transitional and I don't care about 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.410
 stay too low having high is 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 ours was very ours 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.390
 eyebrow arch 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.100
 I go high enough then apply 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.680
 a black pencil all over my eyelid 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.840
 mobile and take it with my finger to give one 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.140
 based on black brito own canvases but between 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.140
 little 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.670
 when just a matte black eye shadow 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.049
 I apply all over my mobile eyelid 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.790
 and on my turn I try not to 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.480
 extend me too long as 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.310
 in height then give this shape 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 round to my eye as far as to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.480
 how much is possible here 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.720
 now black pencil in my first exterior 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.940
 lower tried to dab with 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.890
 the black eyeshadow obviously to do yes 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.650
 that I am not mistaken I then apply a pencil 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.570
 white in the inner rim of the eye 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.570
 to make it even more rounded 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.670
 and even the same pencil 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.120
 at the inner corner to give a base 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.800
 today we all take off immediately afterwards 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.260
 I then apply the false eyelash glue 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.500
 dabbing it shared and collecting 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.420
 iter whites multicolor bar and I go them 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.670
 to place in the outer corner spend 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.370
 not even a little below as you see for 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.890
 give even more that dramatic touch 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.770
 now under my eyebrows a little 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.840
 to camouflage the real eyebrows not 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.070
 can also expect a light point 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.200
 this time a beautiful investigation 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.780
 dramatic I go to apply an eye shadow 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.960
 white completely opaque and after the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.620
 round 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.620
 mascara 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.450
 on the rosy apcom blush cheeks indeed 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.880
 only on new slots and and not 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.670
 we apply the earth to me is a big one 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.400
 sacrifice, however, I wanted to keep myself 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.730
 quite faithful and therefore no land 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.390
 the lips are very intense 40 of 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:32.180
 outline with a black pencil and then fades 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:37.340
 inward my ports to go 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:42.220
 to make a shadow effect even on 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:45.830
 my lips without even just on the lips 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:53.210
 and precisely at the center I am going to apply the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:56.540
 matteo russian red this is here 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.250
