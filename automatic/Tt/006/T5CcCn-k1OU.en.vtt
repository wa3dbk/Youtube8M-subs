to<00:02:46.840> 70<00:02:47.170> minutes<00:02:47.290> now<00:02:48.040> if<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.580> muck<00:02:49.030> up<00:02:49.180> your

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
to 70 minutes now if you muck up your

to 70 minutes now if you muck up your
potion<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.290> start<00:02:50.500> from<00:02:50.620> scratch<00:02:50.980> so

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
potion you have to start from scratch so

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.640 
potion you have to start from scratch so
not<00:02:52.180> only<00:02:52.330> have<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.690> wasted<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.170> brewing

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
not only have you wasted that brewing

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.710 
not only have you wasted that brewing
time<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.160> have<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.430> do<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.670> again<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.150> the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
time you have to do it again and the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.360 
time you have to do it again and the
possibility<00:02:56.320> of<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.740> mucking<00:02:57.040> up<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.190> potion

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
possibility of you mucking up a potion

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.090 
possibility of you mucking up a potion
is<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.210> you<00:02:58.960> know<00:02:59.080> high<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.860> you'll<00:02:59.950> probably

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
is so you know high that you'll probably

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.410 
is so you know high that you'll probably
have<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.400> do<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.580> again<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.910> again<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.210> again

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
have to do it again and again and again

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.860 
have to do it again and again and again
and<00:03:01.540> again

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
and again

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.140 
and again
so<00:03:02.020> this<00:03:02.140> wastes<00:03:02.530> time<00:03:02.800> this<00:03:03.370> wastes<00:03:03.910> money

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
so this wastes time this wastes money

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.690 
so this wastes time this wastes money
whether<00:03:04.630> fake<00:03:04.990> money<00:03:05.170> galleon<00:03:05.590> money<00:03:05.740> and<00:03:06.550> it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
whether fake money galleon money and it

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.390 
whether fake money galleon money and it
also<00:03:06.850> wastes<00:03:07.360> precious<00:03:07.470> ingredients<00:03:08.470> such<00:03:09.370> as

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
also wastes precious ingredients such as

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.210 
also wastes precious ingredients such as
flubber<00:03:09.820> where<00:03:10.000> mucus<00:03:10.480> mucus<00:03:11.260> gross<00:03:11.830> I

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
flubber where mucus mucus gross I

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.920 
flubber where mucus mucus gross I
personally<00:03:12.910> feel<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.360> PlayStation

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
personally feel that the PlayStation

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.900 
personally feel that the PlayStation
games<00:03:14.140> are<00:03:14.410> more<00:03:14.770> interactive<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.580> engaging

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
games are more interactive and engaging

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.150 
games are more interactive and engaging
due<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.170> narration<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.709> these<00:03:17.830> sorts<00:03:18.100> of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
due to the narration of these sorts of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.340 
due to the narration of these sorts of
games<00:03:18.400> they<00:03:18.850> focus<00:03:19.270> more<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.870> chapters

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
games they focus more on the chapters

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.290 
games they focus more on the chapters
I'm<00:03:20.650> getting<00:03:20.920> from<00:03:21.070> A<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.220> B<00:03:21.400> as<00:03:21.700> opposed<00:03:22.240> to

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
I'm getting from A to B as opposed to

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.490 
I'm getting from A to B as opposed to
focusing<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.780> little<00:03:23.050> things<00:03:23.230> individually

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
focusing on little things individually

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.120 
focusing on little things individually
such<00:03:24.010> as<00:03:24.160> potion<00:03:24.520> making<00:03:25.200> breathe<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:26.950> guess

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
such as potion making breathe so I guess

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.830 
such as potion making breathe so I guess
possible<00:03:27.610> has<00:03:27.820> sort<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.150> brought<00:03:28.330> out<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.780> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
possible has sort of brought out to the
