00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 Hey 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.790
 I am with us and you are 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.759
 coordinator of the design department in the 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.590
 He has no money in the house 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.939
 five senses is a jeroen telephone 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.660
 former 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.650
 creative director ton van de ven and 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.750
 1995 designed this 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.519
 he really wanted a beacon in it 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.920
 put away the landscape so that the efteling 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.000
 visible and recognizable from afar 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.129
 to be 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.280
 the idea behind it was organic 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.110
 and it also looks like one 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.339
 held open theater curtain where all 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.339
 guests be welcomed 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.289
 that whole thatched roof of no less than 45 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.149
 one hundred square meters 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.149
 the largest in the world that is of course 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.170
 search nature and there are more than 800 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.420
 large tree trunks 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.659
 that together as a whole bunch 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.609
 be knotted by 331 nodes 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.440
 then that tree trunk trade comes together 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.570
 and then they leave again 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.119
 which are very special entirely which 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.890
 was even during the engineering and 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.869
 design phase of the building 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.840
 complicated that we had to step in 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.259
 in the engineering process to model 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.810
 to make from all those 800 piles and to be 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.860
 all those nodes that are 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.420
 numbered 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.630
 to resist communication 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.979
 much better i am pim van de ven i am 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.970
 have been employed for about three and a half years now 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.259
 within the efteling 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.460
 the project manager and I am 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.350
 responsible for this large 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.250
 maintenance modification project 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.810
 twickelo 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.720
 have been busy recently 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.380
 been with ranja carousel it 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.880
 dream flight 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.649
 there is already a research project one day 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.270
 on this project now also under the project 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.799
 is in 1996 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.810
 this building is the building with 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.979
 mainly natural materials and 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.429
 has it over the course of time 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.429
 maintenance required 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.590
 Oh 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.109
 We are basically working on it 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.490
 replace reeds and partly restore 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.429
 wooden construction is checked 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.519
 bottlenecks are inspected 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.750
 cleaned and impregnated wooden 

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:11.940
 checkout blocks with the guest service 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.430
 refreshed maintenance takes place 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.470
 and ergonomic issues are being implemented 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.760
 for the welfare of our employees 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.709
 technical installation is checked 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.420
 and we know some modifications 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.890
 well the work makes them specialized 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.660
 because it is a unique building a whole 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.830
 separate construction at height 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.330
 well when you get there so do your work 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.920
 must perform in all 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.610
 weather conditions as it is now 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.610
 that is a challenge 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.330
 if we do a major maintenance on this 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.430
 we want to scale 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.519
 not something extra stuff a bit anyway 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.650
 to offer more value to what was already there 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.470
 and if you look closely at it 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.019
 design found to cycle from 95 then 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.400
 you can see the word efteling in the hood 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.209
 and that is never really 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.010
 executed 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.549
 and those golden letters that must 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.340
 natural daylight nicely reflect 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.140
 and now you can paint around 30 gold and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.860
 you can do much better with gold leaf 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.599
 investing 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.730
 the letters that are smeared with who 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.500
 also carries in line and on it 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.930
 exactly at the right time 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.209
 those little gold leaves that 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.459
 paste letters here with a 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.560
 down a small hill so that there is a mattisson 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.400
 and where that overlap 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.980
 takes place 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.090
 because gold has not led on and 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.150
 I am a very soft 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.590
 brushed leather eventually polished 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.180
 must then polish that entire letter 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.180
 become so that you can tap into yourself 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.799
 Yes 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.390
 yes, but large-scale maintenance is possible 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.650
 can of course last a very long time 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.110
 and as long as the house of the five senses 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.709
 There are more than 60 million 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.200
 Visitors have gone under we are now 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.620
 ready for the next 60
