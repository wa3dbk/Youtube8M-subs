00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 so many people know that she is with 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.610
 he signed a contract in 2004 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.740
 I was just bargaining I think she 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.480
 it would be good for us I think they are there 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.340
 got chatting giving then reach 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.619
 a level that we will fight 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.900
 delayed I was all right and nothing of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.640
 car your powder will make us reach 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.650
 knows how to make a better singer has many 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.629
 things that involve a great deal of 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.949
 fight then we have to always think 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.220
 which is good for us we can never 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.840
 to feel tied and accept that we have 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.280
 that stir the problem a little if 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.590
 concentrating on mines is helping people 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.989
 I do not think it's more difficult to have a 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.329
 contract and did not know he had day 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.100
 one more known adversary understood 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.960
 no role of a conversation i think 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.579
 elderly people by car 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.140
 in that bar rafaeli says something else 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.020
 speaks on the public network for 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.620
 that the fans do not understand anything, she was going 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.760
 speak different things then in the then 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.920
 was sensitized and reached a plateau 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.050
 that obviously will not happen 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.950
 So now we have notes that 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.950
 It leads them to 0 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.440
 the alliance already knew when he left to play 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.810
 in Brazil already very excited with this fight 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.460
 I think it 's a great fight I fight super 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.310
 I think both I and the easier 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.500
 try to give the best to the galera with 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.270
 fans so this is I think our 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.430
 fight to the fans I'm very happy for 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.290
 I'm going to give it my all in the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.290
 training get there and win this fight 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.010
 just talking about doing or just talking 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.110
 train I think this is my life 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.270
 fight the arrival of my best and won the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.700
 fight then look what I do and I can not 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 talking if it's hard is not easier not 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.080
 leave positions they like discussion 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.350
 are arguing and I'm going to continue 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.350
 my walk 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.550
 she gives a little 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.770
 worried about a queue for the lighthouse but 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.140
 There are other people who deserve this 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.090
 listen but since it gave me the opportunity 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.070
 I'm going to hug the president, change my 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.310
 better for sure I will be very very 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.170
 much more aggressive and much more 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.990
 wanting to win the fight for it with this 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.230
 condition they are showing in their 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.230
 cell phone 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.680
 here in Brazil has already touched the car of 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.709
 Everybody's got energy. 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.519
 positive and sure will give a show 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.519
 For you, you do.
