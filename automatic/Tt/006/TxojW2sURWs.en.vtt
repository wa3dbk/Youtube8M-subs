00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.500
 I'm going to take a run on the beach and then 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.430
 I'm back home, my street is the bedroom. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.680
 I work day to day so 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.949
 In the morning the study was then 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.949
 to work 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.950
 I have plants 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.640
 I open service today and also iron and even 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.770
 with so much neck in general also until 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.840
 arrive here until the first months I 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.239
 I did not know what I wanted but with time. 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.030
 I found myself 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.769
 I'm having a lot of preparation for what 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.839
 I will find in the job market 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:54.900
 and no doubt made it much safer 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:57.750
 because I have the rodrigo in the future 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.369
 he likes computers is proactive and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 has been a great help in getting ready 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.320
 our support team and taking this 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 range of knowledge he has that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 possibility he has everything to give himself 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.650
 well in the market 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.229
 Natalie was a lucky person, she's going 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.960
 a little beyond what everyone else 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.610
 has the obligation to do is a point 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.119
 very positive in her and stands out 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.119
 really 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.520
 education is the only way I see 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.050
 for me to become what I want 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.440
 the methodology of the legal apprenticeship program 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.869
 has helped me a lot the confidence that 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.409
 the person is taking theoretical and 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.110
 it must have at the same time when the 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.030
 young person enters almost the entire 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.070
 young itapagipe and when they have this 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.540
 opportunity that would often be up to 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.850
 to help their families 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.890
 We recognize this 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.289
 only personal as well as professional 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.610
 this is the moment and he choose it will be 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.270
 the protagonist of his own story 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.270
 of society 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.640
 I think that we live is difficult, right? 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.410
 We deal with teenagers because today 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.600
 in the day the adolescents do not want anything 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.260
 he is an example of a teenager who 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.430
 He changed to a very responsible teenager 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.880
 about all the study work 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.880
 his 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.099
 I could not do wrong things 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.319
 could you doing nonsense so I 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.040
 I'm here inside the apprentice program 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.410
 cool 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.640
 I'm trying to pass on what 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.790
 I learned 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.050
 the program helped him graduate 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.739
 citizen 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.360
 the guilherme when he arrived very 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.549
 specific, it has already 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.220
 other learners because they put 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.709
 the debates he gave the opinion of the people 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.560
 perceive in this speech this posture already 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.730
 professional labor market 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.190
 It continues so she has a very 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.840
 pilot if I could have one more 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.890
 queue although I wanted to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.890
 It just brings joy. 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.650
 The hope that I have inside me is 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.450
 What do you do to me whenever you continue? 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.670
 always closed and I want to arrive well 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.430
 farther than I already have in the future 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.560
 have company and everything I see in 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.380
 learning only leads me to have more 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.280
 motivation but no one ever 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.310
 forgets 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.959
 Phil Day and even fifo in life, right? 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.420
 I know that it all started here with 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.989
 learning program 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.330
 my first essay was as an apprentice to 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.540
 company that worked with your company 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.920
 public and I could not stay there I could not be 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.019
 effected until the opportunity arose 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.790
 I came here, I could not always 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.549
 had an interest in my eyes always 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.060
 joke in the program the apprentice 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.620
 the program is making a difference to them 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.750
 professional staff believe that they 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.209
 they will be able to reach very far 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.220
 The film highlights Natalia a moment that 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.660
 I was in place at some point it is 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.760
 because I ask a lot of attention in people 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.430
 that stand out for me and yes 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.310
 naples knife for me and I always look for 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.040
 show a little took place too 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.200
 and one from above by force 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.030
 credibility that does not trust at all 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.440
 What did you do to me? 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.440
 good luck arriving 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.560
 I met a sensational young program 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.560

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.970
