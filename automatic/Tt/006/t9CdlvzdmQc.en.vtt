to see a blue actually come out and

state this now in an upcoming patch 1.3
in<00:02:56.610> which<00:02:56.790> we<00:02:56.970> will<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.240> seeing<00:02:57.450> some<00:02:57.660> major

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
in which we will be seeing some major

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.930 
in which we will be seeing some major
changes<00:02:58.100> some<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.220> those<00:02:59.340> changes<00:02:59.760> are

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
changes some of those changes are

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.910 
changes some of those changes are
actually<00:03:00.330> geared<00:03:00.600> towards<00:03:01.230> changing<00:03:01.740> this

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
actually geared towards changing this

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.920 
actually geared towards changing this
disparity<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.730> hopefully<00:03:03.450> making<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.870> a

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
disparity and hopefully making it a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.660 
disparity and hopefully making it a
little<00:03:04.080> bit<00:03:04.260> easier<00:03:04.500> from<00:03:04.860> ally<00:03:05.070> characters

little bit easier from ally characters

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.790 
little bit easier from ally characters
now<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.510> important<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.110> note<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
now it is important to note that in the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.920 
now it is important to note that in the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
as much of a disparity simply because

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.060 
as much of a disparity simply because

going<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.280> take<00:04:41.460> place<00:04:41.490> here<00:04:41.729> is<00:04:42.120> that<00:04:42.240> if<00:04:42.360> any

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
going to take place here is that if any

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.900 
going to take place here is that if any
high-value<00:04:43.260> items<00:04:43.289> are<00:04:43.740> sold<00:04:43.979> or<00:04:44.490> if<00:04:44.669> things

seem<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.210> bit<00:04:45.240> off<00:04:45.510> for<00:04:46.020> example<00:04:46.470> if<00:04:46.590> someone

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
seem a bit off for example if someone

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.350 
seem a bit off for example if someone
tries<00:04:47.070> to<00:04:47.190> make<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.340> purchase<00:04:47.610> on<00:04:47.910> your<00:04:48.120> account
