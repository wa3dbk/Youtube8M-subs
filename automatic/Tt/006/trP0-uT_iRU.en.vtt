00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
of course you can lay on this building

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.540 
of course you can lay on this building
and<00:01:27.680> pick<00:01:28.680> people<00:01:28.890> off<00:01:30.890> then<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.009> course<00:01:32.280> you

what you need to do here's another
little<00:01:42.179> one<00:01:42.450> right<00:01:42.630> over<00:01:42.660> here<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.830> in<00:01:43.890> this

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
little one right over here it's in this

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.669 
little one right over here it's in this
corner<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.240> back<00:01:45.600> into<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.380> jump

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
corner you just back into it and jump

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.169 
corner you just back into it and jump
and<00:01:46.860> keep<00:01:47.039> holding<00:01:47.220> back<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.880> control

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
and keep holding back on the control

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.359 
and keep holding back on the control
stick<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.170> you're<00:01:49.289> actually<00:01:49.679> standing<00:01:49.950> off

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
stick and you're actually standing off

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.649 
stick and you're actually standing off
the<00:01:50.610> ground<00:01:53.119> because<00:01:54.119> you're<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.509> hit

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the ground because you're kind of hit

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.240 
the ground because you're kind of hit
you're<00:01:54.929> hidden<00:01:55.110> by<00:01:55.259> all<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> pipes<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.159> stuff

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you're hidden by all the pipes and stuff

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.880 
you're hidden by all the pipes and stuff
and<00:01:56.750> then<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.349> sit<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.739> wait

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and then you can just sit here and wait

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.749 
and then you can just sit here and wait
for<00:01:59.310> them<00:01:59.459> to<00:01:59.489> run<00:02:00.360> by<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:00.959> of<00:02:01.080> course

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
for them to run by and then of course

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:10.940 
for them to run by and then of course
pick<00:02:02.759> them<00:02:02.940> off<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:03.720> run<00:02:03.899> by<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:10.830> got

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
pick them off as they run by you got

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.750 
pick them off as they run by you got
there's<00:02:11.280> another<00:02:11.459> little<00:02:11.790> spot<00:02:12.090> over<00:02:12.120> here

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
there's another little spot over here

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.750 
there's another little spot over here
I'll<00:02:14.760> show<00:02:14.790> you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.819 

probably<00:02:21.540> an<00:02:21.599> easier<00:02:21.930> way<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:24.260> get<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.379> there

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
probably an easier way to get in there

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:35.260 
probably an easier way to get in there
and<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.069> missed<00:02:26.370> it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.190 

maybe<00:02:36.050> they'd<00:02:36.260> blocked<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.800> one<00:02:37.070> I<00:02:38.200> hadn't

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
maybe they'd blocked that one I hadn't

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.360 
maybe they'd blocked that one I hadn't
played<00:02:39.380> on<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.680> map<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.160> forever<00:02:42.370> usually

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
played on this map and forever usually

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.960 
played on this map and forever usually
you<00:02:43.520> play<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:43.910> one<00:02:44.150> like<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:45.970> free-for-all

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
you play this one like in free-for-all

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.820 
you play this one like in free-for-all
and<00:02:50.140> actually<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.230> know<00:02:51.290> what<00:02:51.380> there's<00:02:51.770> a

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
and actually you know what there's a

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.500 
and actually you know what there's a
there's<00:02:52.250> got<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.490> be<00:02:52.520> another<00:02:52.760> easier<00:02:53.180> way<00:02:53.210> but

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
there's got to be another easier way but

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.640 
there's got to be another easier way but
then<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.780> go<00:02:53.900> through<00:02:53.930> these<00:02:54.200> tunnels<00:02:54.620> here<00:02:55.600> a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
then you go through these tunnels here a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.880 
then you go through these tunnels here a
lot<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.800> people<00:02:58.100> camp<00:02:59.000> right<00:02:59.300> here<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.830> you

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
lot of people camp right here so you

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.560 
lot of people camp right here so you
just<00:03:04.130> be<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.430> lookout<00:03:04.610> for<00:03:04.970> those<00:03:07.570> you

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
just be on the lookout for those you

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.110 
just be on the lookout for those you
used<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.900> be<00:03:09.020> able<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.370> jump<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.550> get<00:03:10.700> up<00:03:10.850> here

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
used to be able to jump and get up here

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.620 
used to be able to jump and get up here
but<00:03:11.530> I'm<00:03:12.530> thinking<00:03:12.980> they<00:03:13.100> could<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.390> fix

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
but I'm thinking they could that fix

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.810 
but I'm thinking they could that fix
that<00:03:14.810> glitch<00:03:14.990> because<00:03:15.350> see<00:03:15.680> then<00:03:15.860> what<00:03:16.640> you

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
that glitch because see then what you

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.550 
that glitch because see then what you
would<00:03:16.970> do<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.690> would<00:03:17.720> get<00:03:18.110> you<00:03:18.380> know<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
would do is you would get you know the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.650 
would do is you would get you know the
people<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:18.860> were<00:03:19.040> standing<00:03:19.340> here<00:03:19.510> you'd<00:03:20.510> be

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
people that were standing here you'd be

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.480

was<00:05:30.669> keep<00:05:30.820> doing<00:05:31.060> that<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.450> then<00:05:31.960> eventually

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
was keep doing that and then eventually

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.370 
was keep doing that and then eventually
you'll<00:05:32.470> be<00:05:32.590> off<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.890> map<00:05:33.100> I<00:05:34.050> haven't<00:05:35.050> been<00:05:35.169> I

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
you'll be off the map I haven't been I

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.750 
you'll be off the map I haven't been I
haven't<00:05:35.560> done<00:05:35.800> it<00:05:35.890> yet

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
haven't done it yet

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.730 
haven't done it yet
I<00:05:36.850> don't<00:05:37.300> want<00:05:37.479> to<00:05:37.600> try<00:05:37.870> it<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:38.169> see<00:05:38.320> if<00:05:38.380> it<00:05:38.530> you

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
I don't want to try it to see if it you

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.520 
I don't want to try it to see if it you
know<00:05:38.950> see<00:05:39.580> if<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:39.760> could<00:05:39.970> do<00:05:40.060> it<00:05:40.240> so<00:05:41.080> maybe<00:05:41.200> one

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
know see if I could do it so maybe one

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.180 
know see if I could do it so maybe one
of<00:05:41.560> these<00:05:41.680> days<00:05:41.919> I'll<00:05:42.130> bring<00:05:42.310> a<00:05:42.430> video<00:05:42.580> of<00:05:44.190> it

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
of these days I'll bring a video of it

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.090 
of these days I'll bring a video of it
but<00:05:45.430> I<00:05:46.000> don't<00:05:46.960> plan<00:05:47.140> on<00:05:47.290> trying<00:05:47.560> that<00:05:47.830> anytime

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
but I don't plan on trying that anytime

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.790 
but I don't plan on trying that anytime
soon<00:05:50.790> and<00:05:51.810> then<00:05:52.810> of<00:05:52.930> course<00:05:52.960> you<00:05:53.410> know<00:05:53.560> you<00:05:53.620> can

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
soon and then of course you know you can

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.990 
soon and then of course you know you can
get<00:05:53.919> up<00:05:54.039> here<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.900> hide<00:05:56.140> out<00:05:56.350> but<00:05:57.000> then

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
get up here and and hide out but then

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.029 
get up here and and hide out but then
y'all<00:05:58.450> everybody<00:05:59.050> I'm<00:05:59.380> pretty<00:05:59.650> sure<00:05:59.800> knows

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
y'all everybody I'm pretty sure knows

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.480 
y'all everybody I'm pretty sure knows
that<00:06:00.460> once<00:06:01.419> you<00:06:01.600> get<00:06:01.720> down<00:06:01.870> here<00:06:02.320> if<00:06:03.280> you<00:06:03.310> were

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
that once you get down here if you were

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.830 
that once you get down here if you were
to<00:06:03.580> go<00:06:03.669> up<00:06:03.729> this<00:06:03.850> ladder<00:06:04.060> you<00:06:04.330> get<00:06:04.419> clear<00:06:04.660> the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
to go up this ladder you get clear the

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.779 
to go up this ladder you get clear the
very<00:06:05.050> top<00:06:05.640> but<00:06:07.830> basically<00:06:08.830> that's<00:06:09.160> pretty

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
very top but basically that's pretty

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:14.279 
very top but basically that's pretty
much<00:06:10.060> it<00:06:10.360> for<00:06:10.390> rust<00:06:12.750> there's<00:06:13.750> not<00:06:13.900> a<00:06:13.930> whole<00:06:14.260> lot

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
much it for rust there's not a whole lot

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.370 
much it for rust there's not a whole lot
because<00:06:14.950> the<00:06:15.130> map<00:06:15.340> is<00:06:15.370> so<00:06:15.700> small<00:06:16.120> but<00:06:16.600> there's

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
because the map is so small but there's

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.190 
because the map is so small but there's
a<00:06:17.500> few<00:06:17.880> that<00:06:18.880> you<00:06:19.090> can<00:06:20.820> you<00:06:21.820> know<00:06:21.940> try<00:06:22.300> and

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
a few that you can you know try and

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.780 
a few that you can you know try and
a<00:06:24.180> few<00:06:25.180> things<00:06:25.360> to<00:06:25.540> look<00:06:25.690> for<00:06:26.020> when<00:06:26.050> you're

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
a few things to look for when you're

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.450 
a few things to look for when you're
watching<00:06:27.790> for<00:06:28.000> people<00:06:31.950> yeah<00:06:32.950> I<00:06:32.980> just<00:06:33.220> thought
