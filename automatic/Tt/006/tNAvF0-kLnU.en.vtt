00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
so let's go - ooh there's there's some

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.880 
so let's go - ooh there's there's some
lag<00:01:49.280> there<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:50.149> I<00:01:50.179> wrote<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.569> but<00:01:51.229> let's<00:01:51.530> go

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
lag there so I wrote that but let's go

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.080 
lag there so I wrote that but let's go
to<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:52.220> good<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:53.000> good<00:01:53.360> height<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.869> we<00:01:54.410> can<00:01:55.090> we

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
to a good a good height and we can we

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.930 
to a good a good height and we can we
can<00:01:56.209> demonstrate<00:01:57.429> planning<00:01:58.429> on<00:01:58.520> making<00:01:58.700> this

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
can demonstrate planning on making this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.550 
can demonstrate planning on making this
look<00:01:59.119> kind<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.509> short<00:01:59.810> mod<00:02:00.020> review<00:02:00.319> but<00:02:00.679> yeah

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
look kind of short mod review but yeah

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.770 
look kind of short mod review but yeah
so<00:02:03.560> we<00:02:03.860> have<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.160> we<00:02:04.580> go<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.789> a<00:02:04.880> fairly<00:02:05.450> high

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
so we have to we go to a fairly high

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.699 
so we have to we go to a fairly high
height<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:07.300> just<00:02:08.300> for<00:02:08.750> proof<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.259> it's<00:02:09.470> not

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
height and just for proof that it's not

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.330 
height and just for proof that it's not
that<00:02:10.039> I'm<00:02:11.030> not<00:02:11.349> just<00:02:12.349> in<00:02:12.470> creative<00:02:12.890> mode<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.099> I

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
that I'm not just in creative mode so I

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.059 
that I'm not just in creative mode so I
can<00:02:13.520> just<00:02:13.730> use<00:02:13.849> flying<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.739> actually

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
can just use flying and that I actually

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.280 
can just use flying and that I actually
have<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> parachute<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.480> can

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
idea but from another model view

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.640 
idea but from another model view
apparently<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.819> was<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.060> left<00:02:59.569> shift<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.379> try

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
apparently it was a left shift and I try

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.740 
apparently it was a left shift and I try
that<00:03:00.680> but<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.579> just<00:03:01.849> dismount

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
that but you just dismount

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.009 
that but you just dismount
so<00:03:03.819> that<00:03:04.819> was<00:03:04.940> for<00:03:05.120> one<00:03:05.299> point<00:03:05.540> three<00:03:05.659> point

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
so that was for one point three point

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.460 
so that was for one point three point
two<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.700> was<00:03:07.819> I<00:03:08.359> it<00:03:08.629> was<00:03:08.780> outdated<00:03:09.139> and

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
two so it was I it was outdated and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.170
