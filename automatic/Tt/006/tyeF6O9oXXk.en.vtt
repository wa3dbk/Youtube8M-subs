00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.659 
clues in the sound and embouchure
function<00:04:25.230> can<00:04:25.470> suggest<00:04:25.710> which<00:04:26.040> embouchure

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
function can suggest which embouchure

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.290 
function can suggest which embouchure
motion<00:04:27.180> will<00:04:27.390> work<00:04:27.570> best<00:04:27.840> for<00:04:27.990> this<00:04:28.230> player

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300

with<00:04:30.300> this<00:04:30.480> particular<00:04:30.780> case<00:04:31.169> I<00:04:31.520> suspect<00:04:32.520> that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
with this particular case I suspect that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.190 
with this particular case I suspect that
his<00:04:32.760> embouchure<00:04:33.120> motion<00:04:33.570> should<00:04:33.840> be<00:04:33.900> down

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
his embouchure motion should be down

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.380 
his embouchure motion should be down
towards<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.770> chin<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.280> ascend<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:35.970> up

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
towards the chin to ascend and up

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.850 
towards the chin to ascend and up
towards<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.840> nose<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.320> descend

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
towards the nose to descend

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.820 
towards the nose to descend
his<00:04:39.400> embouchure<00:04:39.910> formation<00:04:40.660> is<00:04:40.870> also<00:04:41.080> looser

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
his embouchure formation is also looser

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.830 
his embouchure formation is also looser
than<00:04:42.010> most<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.940> suspect<00:04:43.390> that<00:04:43.480> he<00:04:43.600> should

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
than most and I suspect that he should

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.110 
than most and I suspect that he should
firm<00:04:44.110> his<00:04:44.290> lips<00:04:44.590> up<00:04:44.770> more<00:04:45.040> and<00:04:45.280> perhaps<00:04:45.700> use<00:04:46.090> a

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
firm his lips up more and perhaps use a

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.730 
firm his lips up more and perhaps use a
bit<00:04:46.360> more<00:04:46.390> mouthpiece<00:04:47.020> pressure<00:04:49.260> this<00:04:50.260> next
