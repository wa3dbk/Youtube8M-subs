00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
real quick you have looks to be like a

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.690 
real quick you have looks to be like a
scroll<00:02:31.290> pad<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.800> some<00:02:32.010> sort<00:02:34.370> what's<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.430> was

another<00:02:36.330> thing<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.690> really<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.050> about<00:02:37.080> this

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
another thing I really like about this

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.130 
another thing I really like about this
device<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.330> stereo<00:02:39.690> speakers

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
device is that you have stereo speakers

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.050 
device is that you have stereo speakers
and<00:02:40.410> they're<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.220> back<00:02:41.459> but<00:02:41.790> they're<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and they're on the back but they're on a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.910 
and they're on the back but they're on a
curved<00:02:42.450> part<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.110> back<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.739> tell

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
curved part of the back you can tell

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.620 
curved part of the back you can tell
that<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.700> kind<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> curves<00:02:45.180> down<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.599> a

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
that it kind of curves down like a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.759 
that it kind of curves down like a
thumbnail<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.260> you're<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:46.530> going<00:02:46.709> to

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
thumbnail so you're not going to

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.380 
thumbnail so you're not going to
entirely<00:02:47.160> get<00:02:47.400> muffled<00:02:47.760> sound<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.180> like

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.280 

I<00:05:31.680> guess<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.880> bottom<00:05:33.240> it<00:05:33.360> says<00:05:33.630> seven

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
I guess that the bottom it says seven

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.320 
I guess that the bottom it says seven
percent<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:35.010> guess<00:05:35.370> that's<00:05:35.669> maybe<00:05:35.940> seven

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
percent I guess that's maybe seven

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.189 
percent I guess that's maybe seven

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
percent through the opening tutorials is

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.840 
percent through the opening tutorials is
