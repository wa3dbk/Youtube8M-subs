00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:11.730
 order my name is michael i'm a portico 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.070
 today talk about the reasons for the reason 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.209
 loss of decoration is always 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.390
 set of reasons 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.369
 namely, this neglect of absence 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.300
 care for the most and nearby 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.490
 plants 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.980
 nutritional deficiency problems with 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.160
 root system diseases and pests 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.710
 also factors of improper landing 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.790
 Now let's talk about the causes of yellowing 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.790
 that and in the order of their importance the first thing 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.880
 most importantly this landing then I most often 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.730
 dries from lack of moisture in the crown 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.310
 and provide enough in the roots 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.070
 moistening of the crown is already ore shure go a 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.800
 watering is necessary to ensure sufficient 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.450
 and grind the landing circle also 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.270
 cause of yellowing may be 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.290
 regular sunburn deficiency 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.350
 Moisture and bright spring sun burn 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.949
 I melt almost to the very trunk 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 secure in winter 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.540
 shading a thuja camouflage net and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.390
 also yellowing drying up the heath and 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.190
 perhaps due to the fact that the root system 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.590
 not enough room to grow 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.430
 usually such a lesion is manifested through 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.330
 5-7 years of planting a grown plant 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.070
 in this case only transplantation will help. 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.140
 the next cause of disease and pests 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.600
 fungal diseases need 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.390
 do urgent sanitary pruning and 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.500
 after that they are sprayed continuously 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.500
 thuja fungicide 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.070
 possibly a source of sailors disease 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.140
 is the lawn around the tour this is fusarium 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.140
 which happens both in the grass and in that 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.040
 the next reason is the loss of that 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.950
 decorativeness this mineral deficiency 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.890
 substances with problems with the root system 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.530
 but also in case of poverty 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:10.160
 over time, then I may lose my 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.160
 brightness and colors and turn yellow 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.320
 lack of both macro and microelements 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.470
 quickly compensate for watering with liquid 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.470
 fertilizer 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.370
 also cause local yellowing then and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.450
 below the mole can be commonplace and all 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.450
 pets 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.360
 in this globular tu and intergold yellow 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.239
 color and and natural but pobroveniya 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.640
 needles in this case due to the fact that her 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.480
 hard cut rather dull 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.480
 tool 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.750
 I hope that our advice will help 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.750
 restore the health of your tour
