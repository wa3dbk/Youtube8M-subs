where they're running more often than

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.320 
where they're running more often than
not<00:04:34.540> i'd<00:04:34.780> say<00:04:35.020> you'd<00:04:35.290> stare<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.370> where<00:04:36.669> they

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
not i'd say you'd stare to where they

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.530 
not i'd say you'd stare to where they
going<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.080> be<00:04:38.200> going<00:04:39.240> under<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.360> presumption

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
going to be going under the presumption

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.450 
going to be going under the presumption
that<00:04:41.020> there's<00:04:41.230> no<00:04:41.350> one<00:04:41.440> else<00:04:41.560> until<00:04:41.890> or<00:04:42.250> unless

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
that there's no one else until or unless

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.010 
that there's no one else until or unless
obviously<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.480> had<00:04:44.070> information<00:04:45.070> otherwise

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:58.040 

i'd<00:04:50.020> presume<00:04:50.500> he<00:04:51.160> could<00:04:51.370> have<00:04:51.490> heard<00:04:51.700> in<00:04:56.820> that

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
i'd presume he could have heard in that

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.700 
i'd presume he could have heard in that
was<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.080> bit<00:04:59.260> weird<00:05:00.990> he<00:05:01.990> doesn't<00:05:02.350> know<00:05:02.410> there<00:05:02.590> is

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
was a bit weird he doesn't know there is
