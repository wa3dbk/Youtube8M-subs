00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.960
 but 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.940
 and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello girls how is this is found 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.930

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.700
 huge and good today we begin 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.010
 with the videos of reviews on 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.779
 girls extensions these videos go 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.090
 specifically for those who are 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.920
 looking for good extensions because 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.560
 because in each video we are going to analyze 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.840
 an extension or a brand of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 extension and good I've heard things 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.940
 horrible I spread them better than something 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.550
 putting super false that I personally 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.559
 Personally, I do not believe 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.449
 that is something false because because 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.600
 end of accounts is something also of 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.250
 personal care to see you more 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 elaborate elaborate etcetera is like 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.329
 use heels to see you more saved with 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.239
 more porte or more right or with more pomp 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.460
 here I do not know why he had used heels 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.499
 is how using makeup is like ironing 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.149
 your hair, in the end 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.789
 all that would be false because it's not you 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.290
 but you more ' to rules you do not decide to use them 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.200
 or not to use them in the end there is no 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.409
 demonize the concept of extension by 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.409
 what 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.310
 well today I am going to analyze them 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.770
 are these I loved that they asked us 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.720
 a color that is the brawn medium is a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.960
 color lighter than mine these are from 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.420
 24 inches are that long look 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.700
 already cut the texture is very 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.619
 soft because you hand over and never 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.380
 they never tangled up they got entangled 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.350
 for nothing and apart from that they are very 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.020
