 two france tickets since 1830 the 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:19.480
 mandolin swing chapter 1 presentation 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.200
 of the swing mandolin and its 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.200
 different components 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.090
 the double horizontal blades one side is 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:39.030
 a wavy side the double julienne julienne 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:43.530
 one side 4 mm side decreases m trolley 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.800
 and his pusher the back foot and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.190
 foldable for minimum space requirements 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.859
 and easy storage 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.480
 feet without silicone coating and 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.560
 are anti slip for a perfect 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.230
 stability during cutting 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.540
 the swing mandolin can be used 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.500
 directly on the worktop or 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.500
 on a container 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.790
 first of all here is how to adjust 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.510
 cutting thickness using the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.120
 support plate 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.180
 after unlocking butterfly lizard 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.830
 located on the sides of the mandolin 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.080
 you can adjust the height of the board 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.390
 so is the cutting thickness 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.050
 the gripping area of ​​the plate 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.180
 support or facilitate this manipulation 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.570
 then blocked the plate by tightening 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.270
 the two butterfly vices to define the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.530
 parallel cuts in order to achieve 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.630
 washers or slices 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.170
 you have the double blades 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.479
 horizontal smooth side and corrugated side 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.240
 we remind you that these blades are 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.490
 sharply sharpened and donk left out 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.510
 the reach of children to handle 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.450
 with caution 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.520
 following the couple desires and position 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.280
 the chosen side towards the back of the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.190
 mandolin like these and then inserted into 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.620
 safely this blade on the side 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.050
 left of the mandolin a double rail 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.420
 to guide the assertion push the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.790
 blade inside until the click of 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.920
 safety to pull out the blade press 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.680
 on the small evening side bridge of that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.400
 if you want to make a cut 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.530
 vertical 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.959
 you have a double julian sentence 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.079
 it is always used in 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.450
 combination with the blade lice attention 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.700
 they are also highly sharpened 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.790
 it is important to take the comb 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.340
 by the area provided as these and then 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.470
 choose the desired spacing 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.799
 positioning the selected pen up 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.900
 the mandolin and insert it in all 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.120
 security on the right side of the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.079
 mandolin one will double and allows for 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.659
 guide insertion a plaque confirms 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.450
 that he is in place to remove the 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.159
 pen does the opposite operation in the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.060
 pulling by the gripping zone 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.340
 here is the cart they slip on these 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.010
 two rails and thus guarantees a 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.829
 driving for a regular cut and 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.560
 secure it is in this receptacle that 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.840
 you will have the foods push themselves 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.359
 has three needles 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.370
 allowing the maintenance of food and 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.739
 a resort guaranteeing a cut 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.440
 complete fruit or vegetable 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.510
 after setting the swing mandolin 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.879
 according to the desired cup place the 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.010
 produced in the cart when you 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.230
 push the pusher on the foods to 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.569
 cut the needle enters them for 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.430
 to keep from rolling and the resort their 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.859
 apply constant pressure 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.049
 you can then make your cuts 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.260
 by a simple movement back and forth 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.060
 the central rod of the pusher indicates 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.819
 the level of products remaining in the 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.799
 trolley chapter 2 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.930
 the different cuts we will you 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.480
 present different techniques of 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.760
 cutting achievable using the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.430
 mandolin souid for a cut more 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.109
 easy it is advisable to moisten the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.689
 backing plate when using 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.109
 washer of different thicknesses 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.109
 militia 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.060
 julienne cut in sticks the combs 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.060
 ling 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.270
 the box cup here are some tips 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.070
 in order to easily achieve perfectes 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.500
 wafers of potatoes 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.229
 this technique requires the use 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.080
 of the blade into milk in a first 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.449
 time adjust the cutting height to 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.449
 minimum is locked the plate 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.330
 in a second time after placing 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.850
 the product in the cart carried a 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.580
 first move by pushing him towards the 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.610
 down after bringing it backwards 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.220
 rotate about 1 8th 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.680
 of turns and pushed it back to the 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.449
 blade repeat this operation taking 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.490
 carefully alternate these two positions 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.590
 until the vegetable is 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.590
 fully cut and here is the result
