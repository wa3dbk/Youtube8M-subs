00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 today you are not welcome 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.420
 video, I'm going to welcome you as 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.340
 trap here people look and arrow from 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.670
 Fire in your head the boy looks at you 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.670
 beautiful 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.020
 So, these days, omã bojan 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.330
 woman was again watching the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.449
 he has posted a video that 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.330
 showed how you are on a wall you 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.369
 can hide a system that can 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.960
 To launch flash and traps then he 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.309
 basically april is missing flash 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.489
 so I said is that it gives to us do 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.540
 Best I think I got to include 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.579
 here as cool as possible people 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.629
 You may want to have a trap. 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.860
 from this stage 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.360
 for example you wanted to hide behind 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 from a lamp you see that licking 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.700
 that does not turn off 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.230
 she is very fast super discreet and here 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 It has a flash storage you 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.489
 keep as much as you want 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 the system works this way is when the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.750
 people press him open that door 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.789
 there and here is an arrow dispenser 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.080
 arrow goes through the lava and goes catching 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.490
 Fire attacking whoever is on the other side. 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 these reptiles that you see here 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.200
 on the side of yes I put it on 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.119
 people can access the button through the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.590
 front side is but I'm going to show 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.900
 that other side of the map 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.820
 system is actually quite compact 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.150
 it is only these issues here that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.979
 down to our door is this part 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.170
 back here this storage here is 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.810
 optional only put to show that the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.329
 thá and these side blocks here too 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 serve to ensure the lava is 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.040
 you do not want to use lava that only 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.020
 flashes and if it would only be 2 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.960
 width here is then super compact and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.720
 quick to do and entrance is that side 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.119
 Look how fast he can not. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.409
 to see people for sure is a 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.060
 trap is very cool 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.979
 and here the highlight is the center block but 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.930
 if you put only one wall nobody 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.509
 You know it's there then maybe even 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.979
 use some map because it's cool people 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.320
 I just really liked the system 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.240
 and I decided to mess with him that we have things 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.100
 legal you have stone also for whom 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.420
 I want to learn so I think we 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.420
 can do a tutorial for it already 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.840
 well then come on guys we start 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.659
 placing two pistons so head 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.720
 down here and we'll put the 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.939
 Our button here, this is it. 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.260
 button where you will get some 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.239
 There's got to be a pulse here. 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.579
 You can put such a boost 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.859
 two chips here that it works is very 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.260
 well it's okay and peter lim here 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.359
 here we will go to the Estonian 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.040
 truth, I've already gone wrong, people look here 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.530
 where in between always a block 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.450
 solid and on his side that these two 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.319
 Pistons is that here is bad 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.480
 setted up 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.519
 now here we put pressure on 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.409
 and this here this way now for 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.560
 feed the pistons from above to people 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.810
 puts a block of washing so looks 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.560
 only what already does what it already opens and 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.540
 date 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.359
 And you realize that it was a little 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.819
 slow then I'll show you how 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.010
 Let's speed it up here. 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.000
 the next step is to put a torch here 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.220
 and then a dispense here is that 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.829
 your pantry which goes to the arrows that I 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.480
 everyone prepared here forgot to take the 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.949
 flashes let's get another one 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.349
 alternative to people if you simply 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.510
 You want to exchange your friends instead of 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.220
 arrows you can put snowballs 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.400
 they only filled bags 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.430
 pushes the person back and does not cause 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.620
 damage unless people fall off the cliff 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.739
 okay and now you will see what happens 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.389
 the system already works 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.250
 he can already play arrow that is what 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.979
 matter and hide right 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.690
 this one would be your wall in this 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.239
 here and now let's take the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.159
 explanations that the following happens 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.560
 when you press the button you take 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:52.459
 energy that torch is out of here 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.919
 This causes this block to retract when it 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.349
 retracts two types after two chips 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.470
 then these questions down here 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.739
 pull it all down then this is it 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.049
 corridor all is empty and has 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.449
 way to this dispensation shoot the arrow 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.109
 it okay 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.440
 When this fee is paid, here is send. 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.540
 immediately 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.130
 then it is an ascending active 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.310
 dispense dispenser a team and then 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.109
 play flash so here does not interfere with the 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.989
 transfer of real estate is delegated to the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.410
 your server 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.759
 To interfere a little here is 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.030
 usually does not happen so it goes 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.220
 link will launch arrow is because when 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.319
 He calls here now that my share is 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.639
 accelerates the circuit he also switches on 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.569
 this block here 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.400
 and that block of energy back pro goes 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.800
 speak here for the piston with a block of 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.380
 and he gives energy here 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.090
 new this energy makes the whole system 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.800
 rise when he rises older encounter with 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.690
 block stone and door close 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.729
 quickly is concerned is to want 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.780
 put a lamp on peter well 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.400
 here a solid block here and now you 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.050
 you can replace this front block with a 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.690
 lamp and it looks really cool right? 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.310
 stays ahead of the system stays with 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:12.150
 this lamp so here is pretty cool 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.490
 here is very cool, people are the simple ones 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.340
 to do now to put there we are 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.810
 only you put here I put only glass 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.289
 to represent does not have to be glass 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.300
 OK 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.130
 and here in this little bag you 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.639
 will put there is as I said before 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.020
 you can choose to put here a 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.680
 Zinc dispenser 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.180
 let me put here which can could 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.000
 to be upside-down does not have 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.800
 problem is with lava buckets here you 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.509
 You can select here 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:46.880
 if you want the arrow to come out 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:46.880
 fire or if you click this button here 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:54.270
 an arrow is normal and after a 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.669
 small cut here people but ours 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.740
 tutorial is finished and I hope 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.409
 You guys have been tanning there, it 's one thing. 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.300
 very simple to do and have fun going 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:07.830
 control all the people they meet 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:10.639
 Big hug to you and even more. 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.639
 one closed 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.750
 just add these questions here 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:24.360
 under a layer more diverse shades 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.360
 here and you can do 71 doc
