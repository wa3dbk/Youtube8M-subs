00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.359 

which<00:01:17.070> forms<00:01:17.460> circle<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.070> called<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
which forms circle this is called a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.710 
which forms circle this is called a
normal<00:01:20.549> loop<00:01:22.280> next<00:01:23.280> instead<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.210> twisting

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
normal loop next instead of twisting

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
normal loop next instead of twisting
like<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.229> did<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.100> need<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.399> twist<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
like you just did you need to twist the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.779 
like you just did you need to twist the
other<00:01:27.090> way<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.740> right<00:01:28.979> hand<00:01:29.310> twist

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
other way so with your right hand twist

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.600 
other way so with your right hand twist
the<00:01:30.030> cable<00:01:30.210> towards<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.289> with<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.649> thumb<00:01:31.860> so

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the cable towards you with your thumb so

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.100 
the cable towards you with your thumb so
that<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> cable<00:01:33.030> comes<00:01:33.390> over<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:33.899> hand

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that the cable comes over your hand

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.679 
that the cable comes over your hand
let's<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.039> that<00:01:35.159> again<00:01:35.429> with<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.119> right<00:01:36.420> hand

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
let's do that again with your right hand

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.169 
let's do that again with your right hand
twister<00:01:37.470> cable<00:01:37.799> towards<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.819> cable

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
twister cable towards you so the cable

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.679 
twister cable towards you so the cable
comes<00:01:39.360> over<00:01:39.869> your<00:01:40.020> hand<00:01:40.229> or<00:01:40.439> wrist<00:01:41.329> then<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.569> do

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
comes over your hand or wrist then we do

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.719 
comes over your hand or wrist then we do
a<00:01:42.720> normal<00:01:42.899> loop<00:01:43.140> again<00:01:43.470> twisting<00:01:44.280> under<00:01:44.579> your

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a normal loop again twisting under your

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.030 
a normal loop again twisting under your
hand

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.920 

then<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.030> alternate<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.690> twist<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.260> cable

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
then we alternate and twist the cable

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.280 
then we alternate and twist the cable
your<00:01:53.050> hand<00:01:53.230> again

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.480 

then<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.190> do<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> normal<00:01:59.580> loop<00:01:59.850> twist<00:02:00.330> underhand

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
then we do a normal loop twist underhand

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.639 
then we do a normal loop twist underhand
then<00:02:03.060> an<00:02:03.180> alternate<00:02:03.630> loop<00:02:03.780> twist<00:02:04.259> over<00:02:04.439> your

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
then an alternate loop twist over your

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.620 
then an alternate loop twist over your
hand<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:05.579> repeat<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.000> until<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.390> reach<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
hand will repeat that until we reach the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.870 
hand will repeat that until we reach the
end<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> cable<00:02:07.530> you'll<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.459> better<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
end of the cable you'll get better and

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.809 
end of the cable you'll get better and
faster<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.750> practice

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.820 

stander<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:15.109> over

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
stander is over

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.690 
stander is over
under<00:02:17.280> twist<00:02:18.150> over<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.660> we<00:02:18.930> keep<00:02:19.080> going

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.449 

that's<00:02:23.630> how<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.840> tie<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.080> cable<00:02:24.470> why<00:02:25.130> do<00:02:25.190> we<00:02:25.310> tie

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
that's how you tie a cable why do we tie

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.130 
that's how you tie a cable why do we tie
a<00:02:25.490> cable<00:02:25.819> like<00:02:25.910> this<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.510> helps<00:02:26.720> prevents
