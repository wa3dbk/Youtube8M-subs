screen um the reason I'm making this
video<00:00:20.700> is<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.420> looked<00:00:21.630> online<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:23.060> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
video is I have looked online and you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.580 
video is I have looked online and you
know<00:00:24.179> you<00:00:24.240> figure<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> top<00:00:24.990> half<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.439> your

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
know you figure the top half of your

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.099 
know you figure the top half of your
remote<00:00:25.890> does<00:00:26.130> not<00:00:26.340> work<00:00:26.779> and<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.869> course

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
remote does not work and of course

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.509 
remote does not work and of course
hopefully<00:00:28.259> your<00:00:28.560> remote<00:00:28.830> does<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.160> look<00:00:29.339> like

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
hopefully your remote does not look like

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.659 
hopefully your remote does not look like
this<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.320> I've<00:00:31.320> already<00:00:31.769> taken<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.250> apart<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
this one I've already taken it apart to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.240 
this one I've already taken it apart to
figure<00:00:32.970> it<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.240> and<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.810> show<00:00:34.050> you

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
figure it out and I'm going to show you

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.530 
figure it out and I'm going to show you
there's<00:00:35.250> no<00:00:35.430> sense<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.820> taking<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.180> apart<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
there's no sense in taking it apart to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.160 
there's no sense in taking it apart to
be<00:00:36.630> honest

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
be honest

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.270 
be honest
here's<00:00:37.680> your<00:00:37.800> PC<00:00:38.100> board<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.980> or<00:00:40.980> your

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
here's your PC board going to it or your

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
here's your PC board going to it or your
circuit<00:00:41.670> board<00:00:41.789> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
circuit board going to it it is just a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.450 
circuit board going to it it is just a
basic<00:00:44.239> board<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.629> has<00:00:45.960> no<00:00:46.170> ribbon<00:00:46.559> cables<00:00:47.039> -<00:00:47.250> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
basic board it has no ribbon cables - it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.369 
basic board it has no ribbon cables - it
has<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.090> little<00:00:48.329> capacitor<00:00:48.899> down<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
has a little capacitor down here at the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.889 
has a little capacitor down here at the
bottom<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> transistor<00:00:51.719> or<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
bottom and it's like a transistor or a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.310 
bottom and it's like a transistor or a
resistor<00:00:52.379> somehow<00:00:52.859> something<00:00:53.300> I<00:00:54.300> don't<00:00:55.260> see

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
resistor somehow something I don't see

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.060 
resistor somehow something I don't see
any<00:00:55.590> point<00:00:55.859> of<00:00:55.949> pulling<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.309> apart<00:00:57.949> because<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
any point of pulling it apart because I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
any point of pulling it apart because I
figured<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.550> might<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.120> cable<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.930> come

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
figured there might be a cable that come

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.139 
figured there might be a cable that come
loose<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> older<00:01:02.100> style<00:01:02.399> remotes<00:01:02.879> it's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
loose like the older style remotes it's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.299 
loose like the older style remotes it's
got<00:01:03.329> some<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.780> chip<00:01:04.050> in<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.410> so<00:01:04.980> what<00:01:05.190> it

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
got some kind of chip in it so what it

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.830 
got some kind of chip in it so what it
amounts<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.240> faulty<00:01:07.080> ass<00:01:07.340> remote<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
amounts to it's a faulty ass remote and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
amounts to it's a faulty ass remote and
from<00:01:09.840> everybody's<00:01:10.410> comments<00:01:11.310> online<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
from everybody's comments online and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.429 
from everybody's comments online and
reviews<00:01:12.930> online<00:01:15.049> everybody's<00:01:16.049> having<00:01:16.320> this

reviews online everybody's having this
problem<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> top<00:01:17.250> half<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:17.700> remote

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
problem with the top half of your remote

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.350 
problem with the top half of your remote
not<00:01:18.390> wanting<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> work<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.170> ship<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.360> I'll

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
not wanting to work with a ship so I'll

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.440 
not wanting to work with a ship so I'll
still<00:01:21.689> show<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.930> how<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> pull<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.409> apart<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
still show you how to pull it apart and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
still show you how to pull it apart and
if<00:01:24.450> you'd<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.770> said<00:01:26.009> guys<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
if you'd like to but like I said guys it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.399 
if you'd like to but like I said guys it
does<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.180> look<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.600> there's<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> be

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
does not look like there's going to be

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.190 
does not look like there's going to be
any<00:01:28.829> point<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.850> pulling<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.750> apart

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
any point in pulling it apart

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.910 
any point in pulling it apart
nothing<00:01:31.650> has<00:01:31.829> broken<00:01:32.159> loose<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:33.920> little

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
nothing has broken loose this little

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.560 
nothing has broken loose this little
chip<00:01:35.159> down<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.640> looks<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
chip down here looks like it's all the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870 
chip down here looks like it's all the
connections<00:01:37.320> look<00:01:37.590> soldered<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.490> pretty

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
connections look soldered pretty pretty

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.920 
connections look soldered pretty pretty
well<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:41.070> really<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
well I just really think it is just a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.300 
well I just really think it is just a
faulty<00:01:43.920> ass<00:01:44.369> remote<00:01:45.680> but<00:01:46.680> we'll<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:46.979> ahead<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
faulty ass remote but we'll go ahead and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.620 
faulty ass remote but we'll go ahead and
show<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> how<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> anyway<00:01:48.329> alright

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
show you how to do it anyway alright

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.800 
show you how to do it anyway alright

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
how most remotes you can slide forward

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.640 
how most remotes you can slide forward
you<00:02:48.890> can<00:02:49.010> pop<00:02:49.310> them<00:02:49.520> off<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:50.420> one<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:51.350> main

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
two screwdrivers I got down in there

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.940 
two screwdrivers I got down in there
pretty<00:03:09.140> good<00:03:11.200> once<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.290> get<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.739> one<00:03:12.920> in

just like that you can take this other
one

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.199

little<00:03:26.360> pop<00:03:27.370> once<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.610> little<00:03:28.879> pop<00:03:29.150> happens

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
little pop once that little pop happens

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.550 
little pop once that little pop happens
there<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.290> go<00:03:30.580> how<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.790> sits<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.720> there's<00:03:33.500> a

there you go how it sits is there's a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.390 
there you go how it sits is there's a
little<00:03:33.830> tip<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:34.549> top<00:03:35.440> pops<00:03:36.440> into<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:37.010> bottom

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
little tip the top pops into the bottom

little tip the top pops into the bottom
I<00:03:37.489> don't<00:03:37.640> know<00:03:37.700> if<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:37.879> can<00:03:38.030> really<00:03:38.180> see<00:03:38.540> it

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
I don't know if you can really see it

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.869 
I don't know if you can really see it
but<00:03:40.519> there's<00:03:40.760> little<00:03:41.030> tabs<00:03:41.799> here<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:42.950> here

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
but there's little tabs here and here

but there's little tabs here and here
and<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.810> just<00:03:44.959> need<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.290> walk<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.709> down<00:03:46.209> while

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
and you just need to walk it down while

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.289 
and you just need to walk it down while
keeping<00:03:47.569> pressure<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.170> keep<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:48.470> up<00:03:49.299> and

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
keeping pressure to keep it up and

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.990 
keeping pressure to keep it up and
you'll<00:03:50.840> continuously<00:03:51.500> hear<00:03:51.769> it<00:03:51.860> pop<00:03:52.129> there<00:03:52.940> it

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
you'll continuously hear it pop there it

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.319 
you'll continuously hear it pop there it
goes<00:03:54.430> there<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.489> goes

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.990 

keep<00:03:59.329> walking<00:03:59.750> on<00:03:59.870> down<00:04:00.170> there<00:04:01.129> it<00:04:01.250> goes

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
keep walking on down there it goes

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.140 
keep walking on down there it goes
once<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.870> get<00:04:03.049> here<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.470> top<00:04:04.150> you're

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
once you get here to the top you're

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.500 
once you get here to the top you're
pretty<00:04:05.420> much<00:04:05.629> set<00:04:06.079> and<00:04:06.470> there<00:04:06.769> it<00:04:06.859> is<00:04:07.329> you<00:04:08.329> get

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
pretty much set and there it is you get

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.390 
pretty much set and there it is you get
to<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.780> other<00:04:08.930> side<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.620> do<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.739> same<00:04:10.069> thing

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
to the other side and do the same thing

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.009 
to the other side and do the same thing
as<00:04:10.609> I've<00:04:10.760> done<00:04:10.909> before<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.540> this<00:04:11.659> side<00:04:11.900> will

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
as I've done before and this side will

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:20.640 
as I've done before and this side will
be<00:04:12.140> easier<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.859> get<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.220> now<00:04:18.400> there<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.519> is

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
be easier to get to now there it is

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.340 
be easier to get to now there it is
and<00:04:21.650> like<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:22.010> say<00:04:22.250> walk<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.729> on<00:04:22.850> down<00:04:23.169> walk<00:04:24.169> it

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
and like I say walk it on down walk it

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.040 
and like I say walk it on down walk it
on<00:04:24.470> down<00:04:25.389> walk<00:04:26.389> it<00:04:26.539> on<00:04:26.660> down<00:04:28.510> walk<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.690> on<00:04:29.780> down

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
on down walk it on down walk it on down

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.100 
on down walk it on down walk it on down
and<00:04:30.380> there<00:04:31.340> she<00:04:31.550> is

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
and there she is

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.350 
and there she is
and<00:04:33.110> that<00:04:33.380> that's<00:04:34.190> how<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:34.430> take<00:04:34.700> apart<00:04:34.849> a

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
and that that's how you take apart a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.979 
and that that's how you take apart a
