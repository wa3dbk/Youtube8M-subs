00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:06.590 
have asked me about doing my version of

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.980 
have asked me about doing my version of
the<00:00:06.830> minimize<00:00:07.400> rapid<00:00:07.820> strike<00:00:08.090> this<00:00:08.690> is<00:00:08.840> what

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
the minimize rapid strike this is what

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.270 
the minimize rapid strike this is what
I'm<00:00:09.080> working<00:00:09.230> on<00:00:09.440> at<00:00:09.559> the<00:00:09.650> moment<00:00:09.679> it's<00:00:10.099> not

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
I'm working on at the moment it's not

quite finished just yet what I do a

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:13.629 
quite finished just yet what I do a
little<00:00:12.499> bit<00:00:12.589> different<00:00:12.980> to<00:00:13.039> the<00:00:13.070> others<00:00:13.369> is<00:00:13.519> I

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
little bit different to the others is I

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.119 
little bit different to the others is I
take<00:00:14.030> out<00:00:14.269> a<00:00:14.990> bit<00:00:15.289> more<00:00:15.469> of<00:00:15.559> the<00:00:15.619> material<00:00:15.709> at

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
take out a bit more of the material at

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.600 
take out a bit more of the material at
the<00:00:16.219> front<00:00:16.460> here<00:00:16.699> I<00:00:17.260> remove<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.530> rail<00:00:19.190> from<00:00:19.460> on

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
the front here I remove the rail from on

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.940 
the front here I remove the rail from on
top<00:00:19.820> I<00:00:20.090> was<00:00:20.810> still<00:00:21.230> in<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:21.410> process<00:00:21.800> of<00:00:21.890> doing

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
top I was still in the process of doing

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.520 
top I was still in the process of doing
this<00:00:22.160> one<00:00:22.370> but<00:00:22.550> I've<00:00:23.090> played<00:00:23.360> up<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:23.630> the

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
this one but I've played up the the

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.660 
this one but I've played up the the
openings<00:00:24.860> here<00:00:24.980> I've<00:00:25.190> still<00:00:25.340> got<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.520> put<00:00:25.610> a

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
openings here I've still got to put a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.860 
openings here I've still got to put a
plate<00:00:25.880> over<00:00:26.030> the<00:00:26.150> top<00:00:26.330> of<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:26.510> front<00:00:26.720> one

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:26.870 
plate over the top of the front one

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.319 
plate over the top of the front one
there<00:00:27.020> but<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.310> idea<00:00:29.710> custom-made<00:00:30.710> plates

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
there but the idea custom-made plates

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:38.380 
there but the idea custom-made plates
all<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.509> other<00:00:33.400> cetera<00:00:37.060> one<00:00:38.060> thing<00:00:38.240> that<00:00:38.329> I

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
all the other cetera one thing that I

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.240 
all the other cetera one thing that I
did<00:00:38.630> different<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:39.020> the<00:00:39.110> other<00:00:39.230> guys<00:00:39.410> which<00:00:39.770> I

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
did different to the other guys which I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.860 
did different to the other guys which I
don't<00:00:40.489> know<00:00:40.579> it's<00:00:40.820> I<00:00:41.120> guess<00:00:41.300> it's<00:00:41.480> personal

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
don't know it's I guess it's personal

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.979 
don't know it's I guess it's personal
choice<00:00:42.020> but<00:00:42.350> I<00:00:43.239> hate<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.390> idea<00:00:44.450> of<00:00:44.840> having

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
choice but I hate the idea of having

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.630 
choice but I hate the idea of having
these<00:00:45.230> external<00:00:45.620> battery<00:00:46.070> packs<00:00:46.340> on<00:00:46.550> the

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
these external battery packs on the

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.000 
these external battery packs on the
outside<00:00:46.970> you<00:00:47.090> gun<00:00:47.300> I<00:00:47.840> don't<00:00:48.110> do<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:48.649> I<00:00:48.829> don't

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
outside you gun I don't do it I don't

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.550 
outside you gun I don't do it I don't
like<00:00:49.220> it<00:00:49.510> I'd<00:00:50.510> like<00:00:50.810> to<00:00:50.960> have<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.200> batteries

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
like it I'd like to have the batteries

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.590 
like it I'd like to have the batteries
all<00:00:51.680> contained<00:00:52.040> in<00:00:52.280> internally<00:00:53.180> inside<00:00:53.480> the

all contained in internally inside the
gun<00:00:53.770> this<00:00:54.770> is<00:00:54.950> running<00:00:55.190> on<00:00:55.280> four<00:00:55.790> trusts<00:00:56.630> five

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
gun this is running on four trusts five

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.060 
gun this is running on four trusts five

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
and there is a charge port on the gun so

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.149 
and there is a charge port on the gun so
that<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.110> can<00:01:03.230> recharge<00:01:03.620> them<00:01:03.890> without

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
that you can recharge them without

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.530 
that you can recharge them without
having<00:01:04.399> to<00:01:04.489> open<00:01:04.579> up<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.850> gun<00:01:05.000> etcetera<00:01:05.360> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
having to open up the gun etcetera and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.760 
having to open up the gun etcetera and
get<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.870> batteries<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:06.470> has<00:01:06.590> been

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
get to the batteries this has been

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.390 
get to the batteries this has been
rewired

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
rewired

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.310 
rewired
I'm<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:08.060> motifs<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:08.870> have<00:01:09.020> been<00:01:09.110> on<00:01:09.229> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
I'm the motifs that have been on the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.370 
I'm the motifs that have been on the
sauce<00:01:09.500> which<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:09.799> a<00:01:09.890> 36<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:10.729> has<00:01:10.880> an<00:01:11.060> RPM<00:01:11.540> now

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
sauce which is a 36 it has an RPM now

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.320 
sauce which is a 36 it has an RPM now
there<00:01:12.560> are<00:01:12.620> actually<00:01:12.860> 12<00:01:13.370> volt<00:01:13.640> rated<00:01:13.850> motors

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
there are actually 12 volt rated motors

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.750 
there are actually 12 volt rated motors
as<00:01:14.510> opposed<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.620> 6<00:01:15.979> volt<00:01:16.159> rated<00:01:16.310> ones<00:01:16.520> in<00:01:16.670> a

if you're going to run your for trust

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.130 
if you're going to run your for trust
fires<00:01:21.650> like<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:22.010> am<00:01:22.190> in<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:22.750> now<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:23.840> is<00:01:23.990> only

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
fires like I am in this now this is only

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.800 
fires like I am in this now this is only
running<00:01:24.320> on<00:01:24.530> well<00:01:25.159> technically<00:01:26.030> it's<00:01:26.210> for<00:01:26.390> 0.8

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810

running on well technically it's for 0.8
volts<00:01:27.110> on<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.229> load<00:01:27.440> I'm<00:01:27.710> obviously<00:01:27.890> the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
volts on the load I'm obviously the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.950 
volts on the load I'm obviously the
batteries<00:01:29.060> charged<00:01:29.299> up<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.510> more<00:01:29.780> higher<00:01:29.900> than

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
that when they're not under load this is

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.520 
that when they're not under load this is
actually<00:01:32.150> up<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.510> running<00:01:32.570> it's<00:01:32.990> operational

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
actually up and running it's operational

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.649 
actually up and running it's operational
at<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.710> moment<00:01:34.040> it's<00:01:34.790> not<00:01:34.850> finished<00:01:35.390> I'm

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
at the moment it's not finished I'm

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.550 
at the moment it's not finished I'm
still<00:01:36.500> working<00:01:36.860> on<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:36.979> it's<00:01:37.939> got<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.210> be<00:01:38.299> a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
still working on it it's got to be a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.200 
still working on it it's got to be a
spacer<00:01:39.560> put<00:01:40.189> around<00:01:40.369> these<00:01:40.580> motors<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.090> then

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
spacer put around these motors and then
