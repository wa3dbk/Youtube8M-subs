why<00:00:19.590> I'm<00:00:19.800> using<00:00:19.980> blind<00:00:20.460> eye<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.910> class<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
why I'm using blind eye in this class is

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.599 
why I'm using blind eye in this class is
because<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> really<00:00:22.140> open<00:00:22.350> map<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.100> i'm

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
because it's a really open map and i'm

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.370 
because it's a really open map and i'm
using<00:00:24.119> really<00:00:24.390> high<00:00:24.510> shrieks<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.170> game

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
using really high shrieks in this game

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.700 
using really high shrieks in this game
i'm<00:00:25.560> using<00:00:25.949> 7<00:00:26.430> 12<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.939> 17<00:00:27.449> those<00:00:28.349> are<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.500> kill

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
i'm using 7 12 and 17 those are the kill

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.439 
i'm using 7 12 and 17 those are the kill
cheeks<00:00:28.920> i'm<00:00:29.070> using<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.789> i<00:00:29.939> don't<00:00:30.119> want<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.330> die

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
cheeks i'm using and i don't want to die

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.900 
cheeks i'm using and i don't want to die
like<00:00:30.480> two<00:00:30.869> or<00:00:31.019> three<00:00:31.080> away<00:00:31.500> from<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.340> next<00:00:32.700> kill

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
like two or three away from my next kill

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.790 
like two or three away from my next kill
streak<00:00:33.270> by<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> enemies<00:00:34.079> air<00:00:34.260> support<00:00:34.680> so

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
streak by the enemies air support so

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.900 
streak by the enemies air support so
that's<00:00:34.950> why<00:00:35.070> i<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.250> using<00:00:35.370> blind<00:00:35.730> eye

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that's why i like using blind eye

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.459 
that's why i like using blind eye
especially<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> map<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.050> where

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
especially for a map like this where

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.440 
especially for a map like this where
it's<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:38.040> open<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:39.090> isn't<00:00:39.360> too

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's really open and there isn't too

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.840 
it's really open and there isn't too
many<00:00:39.629> buildings<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.170> go<00:00:40.320> inside<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.950> also<00:00:41.520> if

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

the proficiency that i'm using this game
attachment<00:01:06.750> i<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.380> only<00:01:07.530> using<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
attachment i was only using it to you

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.469 
attachment i was only using it to you
know<00:01:08.280> test<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.180> there's<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
know test it out to see if there's a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.359 
know test it out to see if there's a
major<00:01:09.689> difference<00:01:09.900> between<00:01:10.320> attachments<00:01:11.250> in

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
major difference between attachments in

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.969 
major difference between attachments in
cake<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.350> kicked<00:01:13.740> it

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
cake and you know really if kicked it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.609 
cake and you know really if kicked it
reduces<00:01:14.460> recoil<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:15.119> lot<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.049> tell<00:01:16.560> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
reduces recoil a lot or not and tell you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
reduces recoil a lot or not and tell you
that<00:01:16.740> true<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.159> actually<00:01:17.460> does<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:18.030> when

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
that true that actually does like when

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.210 
that true that actually does like when
i'm<00:01:18.600> aiming<00:01:18.930> down<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> further<00:01:19.890> distance

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
i'm aiming down at a further distance

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.190 
i'm aiming down at a further distance
when<00:01:20.520> i'm<00:01:20.610> trying<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.909> lock<00:01:21.150> onto<00:01:21.390> my<00:01:21.630> enemy<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
when i'm trying to lock onto my enemy it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
when i'm trying to lock onto my enemy it
makes<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.770> huge<00:01:23.040> difference<00:01:23.430> i<00:01:23.880> mean<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
makes a huge difference i mean like the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.230 
makes a huge difference i mean like the
recoil<00:01:25.170> gets<00:01:25.530> really<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.520> hectic<00:01:26.850> all

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
recoil gets really really hectic all

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.030 
recoil gets really really hectic all
right<00:01:27.360> sometimes<00:01:27.600> i<00:01:27.869> can't<00:01:28.140> aim<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
right sometimes i can't aim because the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.440 
right sometimes i can't aim because the
guns<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.640> everywhere<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> just

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
guns just going everywhere so I just

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.929 
guns just going everywhere so I just
recommend<00:01:30.930> making<00:01:31.439> two<00:01:31.740> classes<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.640> want

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
recommend making two classes if you want

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.870 
recommend making two classes if you want
like<00:01:33.810> don't<00:01:34.020> make<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.560> class<00:01:34.829> with<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.310> red

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
like don't make one class with the red

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
like don't make one class with the red
dot<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> silencer<00:01:37.320> I'd<00:01:37.470> recommend

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
dot and then the silencer I'd recommend

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.160 
dot and then the silencer I'd recommend
making<00:01:38.100> two<00:01:38.430> classes<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.540> with<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> red<00:01:39.990> dot

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
making two classes one with the red dot

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.719 
making two classes one with the red dot
one<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> silencer<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
one with the silencer and then with the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.219 
one with the silencer and then with the
cake<00:01:41.909> proficiency<00:01:42.570> that'll<00:01:42.780> help<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.079> out<00:01:43.200> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
go on top of and then on my right

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.270 
go on top of and then on my right
there's<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.319> kind<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.740> river<00:02:23.010> it's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
there's the kind of like a river it's

like a dried up river and that kind of
reminds<00:02:25.620> me<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.770> jungle<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.760> thought<00:02:27.030> that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
reminds me of jungle so I thought that

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.120 
reminds me of jungle so I thought that
sense<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.600> open<00:02:27.959> map<00:02:28.110> I'm<00:02:28.319> gonna<00:02:28.500> try<00:02:28.740> my<00:02:28.770> best

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
sense is open map I'm gonna try my best

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.190 
sense is open map I'm gonna try my best
to<00:02:29.310> get<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.700> Osprey<00:02:30.150> gunner<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.660> use<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.050> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
to get the Osprey gunner and use in and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.900 
to get the Osprey gunner and use in and
see<00:02:31.350> how<00:02:31.530> effective<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.220> on<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.490> map<00:02:32.730> like

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
see how effective it is on a map like

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.699 
see how effective it is on a map like
this<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.360> tell<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:33.990> truth<00:02:34.260> guys<00:02:34.440> it's

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
this and tell you the truth guys it's

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.860 
this and tell you the truth guys it's
really<00:02:35.130> really<00:02:35.400> powerful<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.660> isn't

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
really really powerful now this isn't

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.720 
really really powerful now this isn't
the<00:02:37.110> full<00:02:37.350> domination<00:02:38.070> game<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.459> played

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the full domination game that I played

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.920 
the full domination game that I played
as<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.150> see<00:02:39.300> by<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.480> time<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:39.840> only

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
as you can see by the time it's only

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.020 
as you can see by the time it's only
five<00:02:40.260> minutes<00:02:40.470> long<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.730> reason<00:02:42.000> for

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
five minutes long and the reason for

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.240 
five minutes long and the reason for
that<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.390> because<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:43.290> game<00:02:43.500> was<00:02:43.530> around<00:02:43.890> ten

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that is because the game was around ten

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.430 
that is because the game was around ten
minutes<00:02:44.550> long<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.060> after<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> did<00:02:46.110> really<00:02:46.320> well

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
minutes long and after I did really well

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.199 
minutes long and after I did really well
like<00:02:46.739> after<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.070> came<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.400> my<00:02:47.550> Osprey<00:02:48.030> gunner

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
like after I came out my Osprey gunner

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.199 
like after I came out my Osprey gunner
um<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.800> enemy<00:02:50.160> team<00:02:50.400> all<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.820> them<00:02:50.910> they<00:02:51.030> just

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
um the enemy team all of them they just

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.670

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
because this is back when I got the game

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.750 
because this is back when I got the game
earlier<00:03:00.390> her<00:03:00.989> pride<00:03:01.260> Ridge<00:03:01.530> release<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.160> you

know since all those better players

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.690 
know since all those better players
joined<00:03:04.350> then<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.709> started<00:03:05.100> doing<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.370> bit<00:03:05.519> worse

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
joined then I started doing a bit worse

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.290 
joined then I started doing a bit worse
I<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.150> finished<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.660> game<00:03:07.220> 62<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.790> 12

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
I think I finished the game 62 and 12

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.870 
I think I finished the game 62 and 12
after<00:03:09.690> i<00:03:10.080> was<00:03:10.320> going<00:03:10.590> 42<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.280> one<00:03:11.519> for<00:03:11.760> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
after i was going 42 and one for the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.370 
after i was going 42 and one for the
first<00:03:12.060> half<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.450> game<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:12.810> i'd<00:03:12.870> i'd<00:03:13.080> put<00:03:13.350> a

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
first half of the game so i'd i'd put a

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.170 
first half of the game so i'd i'd put a
lot<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.590> times<00:03:13.920> after<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.489> i<00:03:14.850> only<00:03:15.000> got

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
lot of times after that and i only got

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.030 
lot of times after that and i only got
about<00:03:15.239> 20<00:03:15.750> kills<00:03:15.989> after<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.440> anyway<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.830> I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
about 20 kills after that anyway so I

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.370 
about 20 kills after that anyway so I
just<00:03:17.220> thought<00:03:17.370> I'd<00:03:17.430> cut<00:03:17.730> out<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.780> second<00:03:19.200> part

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
just thought I'd cut out the second part

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.990 
just thought I'd cut out the second part
of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.560> game<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.769> only<00:03:20.100> upload<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.459> first<00:03:20.670> part

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
kill streaks are how effective they are

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.069 
kill streaks are how effective they are
and<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> perfect<00:03:30.480> game<00:03:30.630> that's<00:03:30.989> a

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
and this is a perfect game that's a

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.720 
and this is a perfect game that's a
really<00:03:31.110> good<00:03:31.590> example<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.310> game<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.519> how

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
really good example in this game of how

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.430 
really good example in this game of how
effective<00:03:33.209> they<00:03:33.329> can<00:03:33.510> be<00:03:33.660> if<00:03:33.840> nobody<00:03:34.200> shoots

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
effective they can be if nobody shoots

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.860 
effective they can be if nobody shoots
them<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:34.829> because<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.670> think<00:03:35.940> I'm<00:03:36.390> pretty<00:03:36.630> sure

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
them now because I think I'm pretty sure

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.380 
them now because I think I'm pretty sure
they<00:03:36.989> shot<00:03:37.230> down<00:03:37.260> my<00:03:37.620> AC<00:03:37.799> 130<00:03:38.280> right<00:03:39.060> at<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
they shot down my AC 130 right at the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.240 
they shot down my AC 130 right at the
end<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.170> it's<00:03:40.380> still<00:03:40.620> got<00:03:40.799> quite<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.100> lot

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
end of it so it's still got quite a lot

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.770 
end of it so it's still got quite a lot
of<00:03:41.370> kills<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.850> then<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.299> they<00:03:42.420> shot<00:03:42.600> down

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
of kills and then I think they shot down

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.050 
of kills and then I think they shot down
my<00:03:42.900> Osprey<00:03:43.380> gunner<00:03:43.590> um<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:44.579> know<00:03:44.730> like

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
my Osprey gunner um you know like

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.729 
my Osprey gunner um you know like
halfway<00:03:45.570> through<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.140> even<00:03:46.380> though<00:03:46.470> they<00:03:46.590> shot

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
halfway through it even though they shot

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.080 
halfway through it even though they shot
it<00:03:46.769> down<00:03:46.920> halfway<00:03:47.130> through<00:03:47.489> day<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.640> still<00:03:47.970> got

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
it down halfway through day I still got

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.300 
it down halfway through day I still got
a<00:03:48.120> lot<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.360> kills<00:03:48.720> with<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:49.860> it's<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:50.100> really

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
a lot of kills with it so it's a really

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.650 
a lot of kills with it so it's a really
really<00:03:50.549> powerful<00:03:50.670> kill<00:03:51.180> streak<00:03:51.420> in<00:03:51.540> my

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
really powerful kill streak in my

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.840 
really powerful kill streak in my
opinion<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.260> yeah<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.340> map<00:03:53.549> it's<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
opinion but yeah so this map it's a

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.670 
opinion but yeah so this map it's a
really<00:03:54.030> open<00:03:54.180> map<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.630> like<00:03:54.780> maps<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.230> this<00:03:55.410> um

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
really open map I like maps like this um

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.410 
really open map I like maps like this um
you<00:03:56.220> know<00:03:56.340> because<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.850> killer<00:03:57.030> shoots<00:03:57.209> that

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
you know because the killer shoots that

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.180 
you know because the killer shoots that
you<00:03:57.540> get<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.200> work<00:03:58.380> hard<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:58.709> they<00:03:59.040> can

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
you get that you work hard for they can

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.590 
you get that you work hard for they can
actually<00:03:59.340> do<00:03:59.579> some<00:03:59.820> work<00:03:59.850> as<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.269> can<00:04:00.420> see

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
actually do some work as you can see

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.449 
actually do some work as you can see
right<00:04:00.630> here<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.230> don't<00:04:01.650> like<00:04:01.680> maps<00:04:02.010> with<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> lot

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
right here I don't like maps with a lot

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.130 
right here I don't like maps with a lot
of<00:04:02.610> buildings<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.209> them<00:04:03.420> because<00:04:03.570> what<00:04:03.900> people

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
of buildings on them because what people

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.900 
of buildings on them because what people
tend<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.500> do<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.709> they<00:04:05.010> all<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:05.549> sit<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:05.820> the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
tend to do is they all just sit in the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.550 
tend to do is they all just sit in the
buildings<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.570> you<00:04:07.019> know<00:04:07.110> they<00:04:07.230> put<00:04:07.380> down
