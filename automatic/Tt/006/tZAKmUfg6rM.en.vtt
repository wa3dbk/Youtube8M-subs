00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.910
 good morning today we will sit down 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.860
 legs but first let's talk a little about him 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.940
 yes of course we will talk this winter garlic 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.260
 large 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.869
 I removed it in July 20 July, and now 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.189
 now it's time to plant it though 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:30.640
 don't understand it onions no it could not science 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:34.030
 not ask them and fitness but let's say it 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.520
 garlic onion or garlic onion onion and 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.090
 you know him so interesting you know how 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.899
 called cancer cancer pain merchants such but 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:49.620
 it is less acute less acute as well 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:53.199
 winter garlic gets into the soil in a loan until 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.780
 creates such huge duo lichke and 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.850
 hit no no no no here right here 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.719
 divided into slices and this one 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.120
 onion 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.429
 and and we plant here is separated from right to 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.250
 only deeper sadim which usually garlic 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.850
 because the bulb is big and this one 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.450
 payday 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.990
 still onion of garlic garlic it is not less 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.140
 winter hardy therefore you need it 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.300
 mulch either tops 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.790
 potato or lil cali scream yes thing 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.950
 time to plant winter garlic 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.500
 but this is so here I certainly never 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.540
 when it was engaged in the when the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.670
 this should also start learning here 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:43.140
 look here in my wheelbarrow is 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:46.630
 humus too big thing very important thing for 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.900
 growing garlic and still have 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.530
 mineral fertilizers are nitrophoscopic 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 but so it gives nitrogen phosphorus curry to 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.060
 good rooting we will do like this 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.890
 before you make a lady 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.680
 before them from there to the furrows 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.620
 directly locally but it does 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.800
 could and under digging me make 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.370
 but we will do it like this somewhere 30 grams 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:20.010
 per square meter now need 1 time 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:22.950
 yes now we make furrows well 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:29.329
 because we have some depth 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:32.760
 bo rose should be four depth 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:41.970
 the height of the teeth with a punch and now with 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:44.489
 let us put the humus first 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.890
 we put carom 10 centimeters should 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:53.420
 be guys down to pin down and 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:03:02.340
 digging in x now was going to do 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:04.890
 trample yes boy look now 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.980
 and scattered but must necessarily 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.069
 evenly about 10 centimeters between 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.780
 between plants 10 centimeters because 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:20.400
 that here and in this way and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.239
 dent and may come but the dent from 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.239
 and wake up 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.090
 that's all all definitely be back on 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.200
 this bed 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.360
 will come back next year for garlic and 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.390
 winter carom them for winter garlic in 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.730
 July other carom them in August to 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.300
