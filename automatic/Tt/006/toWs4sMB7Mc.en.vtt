and as I'm showing you right now on my
map<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:25.410> every<00:00:25.890> single<00:00:26.189> hotspot<00:00:26.939> unlocked

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
map I have every single hotspot unlocked

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.650 
map I have every single hotspot unlocked
or<00:00:27.779> at<00:00:27.869> least<00:00:28.019> that's<00:00:28.230> how<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.410> looks<00:00:28.949> I

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
or at least that's how it looks I

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.870 
or at least that's how it looks I
currently<00:00:30.660> only<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:31.170> 99<00:00:31.890> out<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.640> hundred

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
currently only have 99 out of a hundred

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.440 
currently only have 99 out of a hundred
and<00:00:33.469> well<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.739> thought<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.460> may<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.969> bit<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and well I thought this may be a bit of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
and well I thought this may be a bit of
an<00:00:36.570> issue<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.020> glitch<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.739> something<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
an issue a glitch or something in the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.220 
an issue a glitch or something in the
game<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> started<00:00:39.300> looking<00:00:39.690> around<00:00:39.719> online

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
game so I started looking around online

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.880 
game so I started looking around online
and<00:00:40.760> I<00:00:41.760> found<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.210> lot<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.540> people<00:00:43.320> having<00:00:43.739> this

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
and I found a lot of people having this

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.330 
and I found a lot of people having this
exact<00:00:44.460> same<00:00:44.820> issue<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.590> ended<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.950> coming

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
exact same issue and I ended up coming

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.330 
exact same issue and I ended up coming
across<00:00:47.430> two<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.899> fixes<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.309> I

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
across two kind of fixes for it so I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.549 
across two kind of fixes for it so I
figured<00:00:50.789> I'd<00:00:50.940> show<00:00:51.300> them<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.110> here

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
figured I'd show them off to you here

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.270 
figured I'd show them off to you here
today

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
today

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.689 
today
so<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.020> first<00:00:55.289> fix<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.770> guess<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.399> give<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so the first fix I guess I can give you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.020 
so the first fix I guess I can give you
guys<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.780> idea<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.160> are<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.640> zoom

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
guys is the idea that if you are to zoom

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.689 
guys is the idea that if you are to zoom
into<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.480> map<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.649> some<00:01:02.280> items

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
into the map you can see some items

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.969 
into the map you can see some items
actually<00:01:02.969> become<00:01:03.570> clearer<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> map<00:01:04.680> for

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
actually become clearer on the map for

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.770 
actually become clearer on the map for
instance<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.580> tunnel<00:01:06.030> opening<00:01:06.420> which<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
instance this tunnel opening which is

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.469 
instance this tunnel opening which is
normally<00:01:07.229> covered<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.710> by<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> criminal<00:01:08.479> convoy

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
normally covered up by a criminal convoy

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.800 
normally covered up by a criminal convoy
marker<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.200> i<00:01:10.710> zoom<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:12.150> actually<00:01:12.330> see

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
marker if i zoom in I can actually see

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
marker if i zoom in I can actually see
it<00:01:12.840> begin<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.409> poke<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.890> from<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> criminal

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
it begin to poke out from the criminal

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.539 
it begin to poke out from the criminal
convoy<00:01:15.509> marker<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.799> issue<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.400> this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
convoy marker and the issue that this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.820 
convoy marker and the issue that this
brings<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.330> fact<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.780> other<00:01:19.140> markers

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
brings up is the fact that other markers

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010 
brings up is the fact that other markers
can<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.220> hidden<00:01:20.520> behind<00:01:20.700> things<00:01:21.210> such<00:01:21.990> as

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
can get hidden behind things such as

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
can get hidden behind things such as
this<00:01:22.470> fixer<00:01:23.009> contract<00:01:23.810> blocking<00:01:25.159> my<00:01:26.159> final

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
this fixer contract blocking my final

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.830 
this fixer contract blocking my final
hotspot<00:01:28.040> now<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.430> course<00:01:29.700> there<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> second

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
hotspot now of course there is a second

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.859 
hotspot now of course there is a second
way<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> finding<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.220> hotspots<00:01:32.869> specifically

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
way of finding the hotspots specifically

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.319 
way of finding the hotspots specifically
so<00:01:34.049> we'll<00:01:34.200> show<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.560> now<00:01:35.329> accessing

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
so we'll show you that now accessing

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.330 
so we'll show you that now accessing
your<00:01:36.659> in-game<00:01:37.049> smartphone<00:01:37.799> gives<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
your in-game smartphone gives you a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.010 
your in-game smartphone gives you a
bunch<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.729> different<00:01:39.030> apps<00:01:39.240> including<00:01:39.840> one

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
bunch of different apps including one

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.830 
bunch of different apps including one
called<00:01:40.229> city<00:01:40.710> hotspots<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.420> does<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
called city hotspots and what it does is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.440 
called city hotspots and what it does is
it<00:01:43.020> separates<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> city<00:01:44.009> hotspots<00:01:44.700> from<00:01:45.119> not

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
it separates the city hotspots from not

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.170 
it separates the city hotspots from not
visited<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.259> visit<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:48.030> can

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
visited and visit it and you can

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.819 
visited and visit it and you can
actually<00:01:48.329> set<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> waypoint<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.590> those

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
actually set a waypoint to those

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.789 
actually set a waypoint to those
hotspots<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:51.720> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.049> do<00:01:52.259> here

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
hotspots so what I'm going to do here

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.319 
hotspots so what I'm going to do here
after<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.670> screw<00:01:53.880> around<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.240> little

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
after I kind of screw around a little

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.749 
after I kind of screw around a little
bit<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.930> application<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:55.799> I'm<00:01:56.399> going<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
bit with the application as I'm going to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.700 
bit with the application as I'm going to
go<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.390> st.<00:01:57.719> Valentine's<00:01:58.409> Day<00:01:58.560> Massacre

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
go to the st. Valentine's Day Massacre

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.340 
go to the st. Valentine's Day Massacre
which<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.969> last<00:02:00.240> hotspot<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.140> was

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
which is the last hotspot that I was

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.280 
which is the last hotspot that I was
unable<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.979> locate<00:02:02.280> before<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.140> now

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
unable to locate before and I can now
