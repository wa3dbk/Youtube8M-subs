00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
using the UM UMP or the umg in this game

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.179 
using the UM UMP or the umg in this game
apparently<00:00:06.870> they've<00:00:07.379> changed<00:00:07.620> things<00:00:07.890> up<00:00:08.069> a

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
apparently they've changed things up a

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.009 
apparently they've changed things up a
little<00:00:08.309> bit<00:00:08.429> so<00:00:08.760> they've<00:00:08.970> like<00:00:09.179> they<00:00:09.480> as<00:00:09.840> I

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
little bit so they've like they as I

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.720
