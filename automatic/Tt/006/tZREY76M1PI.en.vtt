already<00:00:58.230> sat<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.820> steering<00:00:59.820> wheel<00:00:59.940> seems

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
already sat on it steering wheel seems

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
already sat on it steering wheel seems
pretty<00:01:00.449> good<00:01:00.719> already<00:01:01.170> adjusted<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
pretty good already adjusted the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.000 
pretty good already adjusted the
steering<00:01:02.430> shaft<00:01:02.460> assembly<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.770> can't

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
steering shaft assembly and you can't

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.100 
steering shaft assembly and you can't
really<00:01:08.159> see<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.460> anymore<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
really see it anymore but there was a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.929 
really see it anymore but there was a
hole<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:11.189> had<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.400> cut<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
hole there that we had to cut out to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
hole there that we had to cut out to
adjust<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.780> new<00:01:12.930> firewall<00:01:13.320> height<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
adjust for the new firewall height and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.630 
adjust for the new firewall height and
that's<00:01:14.760> been<00:01:14.939> patched<00:01:16.460> relocated<00:01:17.460> pretty

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that's been patched relocated pretty

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.670 
that's been patched relocated pretty
much<00:01:17.790> everything<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.049> wiring<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
much everything all the wiring to the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
much everything all the wiring to the
inside<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> vehicle<00:01:21.020> traced<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.170> my

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
inside of the vehicle traced on my

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380 
inside of the vehicle traced on my
ground<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:23.430> sure<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.759> hand<00:01:24.000> loops<00:01:24.150> as

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
ground make sure the one hand loops as

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.590 
ground make sure the one hand loops as
you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.500> we're<00:01:25.680> relocating<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.600> cluster

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
you can see we're relocating the cluster

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.010 
you can see we're relocating the cluster
to<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> center<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> -<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:29.189> gonna<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.520> all

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
to the center of the - it's gonna be all

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.719 
to the center of the - it's gonna be all
tricked<00:01:31.020> out<00:01:31.170> once<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.650> done<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.070> dumped<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
tricked out once it's done I dumped the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.280 
tricked out once it's done I dumped the
screen<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> last<00:01:33.600> video<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
screen in the last video because I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.719 
screen in the last video because I
figured<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.979> too<00:01:35.100> bit<00:01:35.579> my

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
gonna see any wiring because

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.760 
gonna see any wiring because
