00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
flash ring so it has a ring around here

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.670 
flash ring so it has a ring around here

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
so you don't worry about that

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.529

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
really nice tactile feedback on that

really nice tactile feedback on that
clicker<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:45.210> can<00:04:46.210> kind<00:04:46.419> of<00:04:46.449> hear<00:04:46.539> that

there's<00:04:47.830> my<00:04:47.979> hipster<00:04:48.220> cat<00:04:48.509> so<00:04:49.509> basically

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
there's my hipster cat so basically

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.700 
there's my hipster cat so basically
overall<00:04:52.030> if<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.510> was<00:04:52.630> give<00:04:52.750> us<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.930> rating<00:04:53.080> out<00:04:53.500> of

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
overall if I was give us a rating out of

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.670 
overall if I was give us a rating out of
about<00:04:53.919> 10<00:04:54.280> I'd<00:04:54.789> say<00:04:54.850> it's<00:04:55.120> about<00:04:55.180> 8.5<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:56.050> think

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
about 10 I'd say it's about 8.5 I think

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.840 
about 10 I'd say it's about 8.5 I think
it's<00:04:56.800> really<00:04:57.039> really<00:04:57.220> nice<00:04:57.490> it's<00:04:57.789> really

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
it's really really nice it's really

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.150 
it's really really nice it's really
solid<00:04:58.300> I've<00:04:59.050> noticed<00:04:59.410> that<00:04:59.500> sometimes<00:04:59.740> the

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
solid I've noticed that sometimes the

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.710 
solid I've noticed that sometimes the
color<00:05:00.340> can<00:05:00.580> kind<00:05:00.760> of<00:05:00.789> deteriorate<00:05:01.330> from<00:05:01.479> this

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
color can kind of deteriorate from this

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.969 
color can kind of deteriorate from this
edge<00:05:01.870> here<00:05:01.900> based<00:05:02.440> on<00:05:02.530> how<00:05:02.680> much<00:05:02.770> you're<00:05:02.949> using

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
edge here based on how much you're using

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.330 
edge here based on how much you're using
it<00:05:03.340> so<00:05:04.060> that's<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.330> negative<00:05:04.590> also<00:05:05.590> think<00:05:06.070> I

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
it so that's a negative also think I

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.279 
it so that's a negative also think I
could<00:05:06.520> have<00:05:06.610> put<00:05:06.789> a<00:05:06.820> little<00:05:07.120> less<00:05:07.539> of<00:05:07.900> the

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
could have put a little less of the

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:09.570 
could have put a little less of the
silicone<00:05:08.710> on<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.889> back<00:05:09.100> it<00:05:09.250> doesn't<00:05:09.370> have<00:05:09.520> to

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
silicone on the back it doesn't have to

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.689 
silicone on the back it doesn't have to
be<00:05:09.669> quite<00:05:09.910> so<00:05:10.120> extensive<00:05:10.710> maybe<00:05:11.710> half<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.610> this

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
be quite so extensive maybe half of this

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.700 
be quite so extensive maybe half of this
amount<00:05:12.760> on<00:05:13.210> each<00:05:13.330> side<00:05:13.570> that<00:05:14.320> PI<00:05:14.470> would<00:05:14.590> have

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
amount on each side that PI would have

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.830 
amount on each side that PI would have
been<00:05:14.830> enough<00:05:15.070> I<00:05:15.310> think<00:05:15.729> that<00:05:15.940> with<00:05:16.120> so<00:05:16.419> much<00:05:16.599> on

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
been enough I think that with so much on

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.210 
been enough I think that with so much on
there<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.229> can<00:05:17.349> sometimes<00:05:17.560> feel<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:18.009> little

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
there it can sometimes feel a little

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.249 
there it can sometimes feel a little
distracting<00:05:18.820> but<00:05:19.090> overall<00:05:19.479> the<00:05:20.020> what<00:05:20.139> they're

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
distracting but overall the what they're

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:21.930 
distracting but overall the what they're
going<00:05:20.380> for<00:05:20.500> here<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:20.949> this<00:05:21.099> is<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.250> gaming<00:05:21.729> case

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
going for here is this is a gaming case

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.370 
going for here is this is a gaming case
so<00:05:22.180> if<00:05:22.630> you're<00:05:22.780> holding<00:05:23.020> your<00:05:23.080> phone<00:05:23.260> like

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
so if you're holding your phone like

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.110 
so if you're holding your phone like
this<00:05:23.530> or<00:05:23.740> you're<00:05:23.830> texting<00:05:24.160> a<00:05:24.250> lot<00:05:24.280> or<00:05:24.669> you<00:05:25.030> know

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
this or you're texting a lot or you know

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.550 
this or you're texting a lot or you know
playing<00:05:25.389> a<00:05:25.539> game<00:05:25.720> or<00:05:25.750> whatever<00:05:26.199> you're<00:05:26.320> doing

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
playing a game or whatever you're doing

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.839 
playing a game or whatever you're doing
it's<00:05:26.949> suppose<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.130> be<00:05:27.190> able<00:05:27.280> to<00:05:27.370> give<00:05:27.610> you<00:05:27.699> that

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
it's suppose to be able to give you that

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.219 
it's suppose to be able to give you that
grip<00:05:28.120> when<00:05:28.479> you're<00:05:28.630> holding<00:05:28.840> on<00:05:28.960> to<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.139> so

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
grip when you're holding on to it so

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.469 
grip when you're holding on to it so
that<00:05:29.320> way<00:05:29.530> it<00:05:29.620> makes<00:05:29.740> it<00:05:29.860> feel<00:05:30.010> really<00:05:30.160> nice

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
that way it makes it feel really nice

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.969 
that way it makes it feel really nice
overall<00:05:31.479> I<00:05:31.510> would<00:05:31.720> definitely<00:05:32.380> say<00:05:32.560> go<00:05:32.800> with

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
overall I would definitely say go with

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.520 
overall I would definitely say go with
the<00:05:33.039> CandyShell<00:05:33.849> grip<00:05:33.880> over<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:35.199> candy<00:05:35.409> shop

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
the CandyShell grip over the candy shop

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.870 
the CandyShell grip over the candy shop
I've<00:05:35.650> tried<00:05:35.830> them<00:05:35.949> both<00:05:36.070> out<00:05:36.280> for<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.520> few<00:05:36.760> weeks

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
I've tried them both out for a few weeks

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.750 
I've tried them both out for a few weeks
and<00:05:37.180> I<00:05:37.659> really<00:05:37.870> think<00:05:38.050> that<00:05:38.370> they<00:05:39.370> nailed<00:05:39.610> it

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
and I really think that they nailed it

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.890 
and I really think that they nailed it
with<00:05:39.909> a<00:05:40.120> candy<00:05:40.419> ship<00:05:40.570> growth<00:05:40.780> which

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
with a candy ship growth which

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.409 
with a candy ship growth which
CandyShell<00:05:41.470> grip<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:42.070> time<00:05:42.310> I<00:05:42.580> think<00:05:43.150> it's<00:05:43.360> a

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
CandyShell grip this time I think it's a

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.850 
CandyShell grip this time I think it's a
much<00:05:43.570> better<00:05:43.690> buy<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:43.960> think<00:05:44.169> it's<00:05:44.470> a<00:05:44.590> better

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
much better buy I think it's a better

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.210 
much better buy I think it's a better
fit<00:05:45.330> for<00:05:46.330> me<00:05:46.479> also<00:05:46.750> when<00:05:47.110> I<00:05:47.139> hold<00:05:47.500> this<00:05:47.650> case<00:05:47.979> it

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
fit for me also when I hold this case it

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.820 
fit for me also when I hold this case it
feels<00:05:48.400> slippery<00:05:49.030> in<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:49.750> back<00:05:49.900> and<00:05:50.320> that's

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
feels slippery in the back and that's

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.399 
feels slippery in the back and that's
the<00:05:50.949> entire<00:05:51.490> reason<00:05:51.550> why<00:05:52.199> you<00:05:53.199> would<00:05:53.320> go
