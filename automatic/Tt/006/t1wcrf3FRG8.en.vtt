are<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> knobs<00:00:25.769> pretty<00:00:26.640> easy<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.510> I

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
are the knobs pretty easy and I

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.570 
are the knobs pretty easy and I
mentioned<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.890> Mayflower<00:00:29.310> too

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
mentioned this with the Mayflower too

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.479 
mentioned this with the Mayflower too
when<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.119> demoing<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.710> really

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
when I was demoing that one but I really

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.389 
when I was demoing that one but I really
like<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.510> rubber<00:00:34.380> thing<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.190> goes

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
like this little rubber thing that goes

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.869 
like this little rubber thing that goes
around<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.500> power<00:00:37.500> Jack<00:00:37.890> makes<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.520> sit<00:00:38.760> in

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
around the power Jack makes it sit in

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.119 
around the power Jack makes it sit in
there<00:00:39.059> further<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.140> more<00:00:40.379> securely<00:00:40.860> than

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
there further and more securely than

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.590 
there further and more securely than
most<00:00:41.309> pedals<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.000> wish<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.360> they<00:00:42.480> would

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
most pedals and I wish that they would

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.900 
most pedals and I wish that they would
all<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.320> don't<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:43.950> why<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
all do that I don't know why it's just a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.069 
all do that I don't know why it's just a
small<00:00:45.149> thing<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.539> doesn't<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:45.899> affect

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
small thing and it doesn't really affect

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.400 
small thing and it doesn't really affect
the<00:00:46.350> way<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.530> sounds<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.719> there

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the way it sounds but I like it so there

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.770 
the way it sounds but I like it so there
you<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.670> then<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> little<00:00:51.180> switch<00:00:51.420> here

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
you go then you got a little switch here

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
you go then you got a little switch here
little<00:00:52.350> three<00:00:52.590> position<00:00:53.070> switch<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.730> go

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
little three position switch that can go

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
little three position switch that can go
left<00:00:54.059> center<00:00:54.480> right<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.379> center<00:00:55.680> seems<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.100> be

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
left center right the center seems to be

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
left center right the center seems to be
the<00:00:56.370> most<00:00:56.640> kind<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> present<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.870> loud<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the most kind of present and loud and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.520 
the most kind of present and loud and
lively<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> three<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> left<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
lively of the three and then the left is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.319 
lively of the three and then the left is
a<00:01:01.559> little<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.070> lower<00:01:02.609> than<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
a little bit lower than that and the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.060 
a little bit lower than that and the
right<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.690> kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> lowest<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.710> guess<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
right is kind of the lowest I guess it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
right is kind of the lowest I guess it
makes<00:01:05.280> them<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.540> me<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.780> makes<00:01:06.960> them<00:01:07.110> just

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
makes them more to me it makes them just

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.830 
makes them more to me it makes them just
sound<00:01:07.500> more<00:01:07.710> saturated<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:09.360> whatever<00:01:09.659> you'll

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
sound more saturated or whatever you'll

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.450 
sound more saturated or whatever you'll
see<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> mean<00:01:10.170> once<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.680> go<00:01:11.040> through<00:01:11.280> there

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
see what I mean once we go through there

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.690 
see what I mean once we go through there
but<00:01:11.700> anyways<00:01:12.360> I'm<00:01:13.080> playing<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> nasty<00:01:13.979> 57

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.950 

and<00:01:24.760> we<00:01:25.760> are<00:01:25.910> going<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.210> start<00:01:26.510> with<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.660> switch

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
and we are going to start with a switch

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.690 
and we are going to start with a switch
in<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.170> middle<00:01:27.230> here<00:01:27.770> you'll<00:01:28.190> see<00:01:28.370> how<00:01:28.490> far

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
in the middle here you'll see how far

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.310 
in the middle here you'll see how far
I've<00:01:28.850> got<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:29.150> dialed<00:01:29.420> back<00:01:29.660> this<00:01:29.870> gives<00:01:30.140> it

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
I've got this dialed back this gives it

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.410 
I've got this dialed back this gives it
if<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.100> come<00:01:31.310> all<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.610> way<00:01:31.640> back<00:01:31.730> this<00:01:32.120> far

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
if you come all the way back this far

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.420 
if you come all the way back this far
you<00:01:32.900> can<00:01:33.080> kind<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.410> get<00:01:33.530> more<00:01:33.710> overdrive

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
you can kind of get more overdrive

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.120 
you can kind of get more overdrive

instead<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.760> full-out<00:01:38.690> distortion<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:39.680> I<00:01:39.710> want

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
instead of full-out distortion so I want

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.920 
instead of full-out distortion so I want
to<00:01:39.920> start<00:01:40.190> there<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:41.720> what<00:01:41.900> that

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
to start there so this is what that

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:50.800 
to start there so this is what that
sounds<00:01:42.080> like<00:01:42.410> I<00:01:49.180> feel<00:01:50.180> like<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.510> really<00:01:50.690> has<00:01:50.780> a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
sounds like I feel like it really has a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.260 
sounds like I feel like it really has a
nice<00:01:50.990> tone<00:01:51.320> at<00:01:51.530> low<00:01:51.650> volumes<00:01:52.100> like<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.580> but

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
nice tone at low volumes like that but

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.030 
nice tone at low volumes like that but
let<00:01:53.420> me<00:01:53.510> show<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:54.050> same<00:01:54.380> position<00:01:54.920> with

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
let me show you this same position with

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.190 
let me show you this same position with
the<00:01:55.100> other<00:01:55.400> two<00:01:55.730> positions<00:01:56.540> on<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.960> same

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
the other two positions on the same

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.140 
the other two positions on the same
dials<00:01:57.890> with<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.130> other<00:01:58.280> two<00:01:58.490> positions<00:01:59.000> on

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
dials with the other two positions on

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.130
