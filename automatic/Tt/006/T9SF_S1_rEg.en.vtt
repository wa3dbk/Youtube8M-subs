dealing with injuries is something that

a<00:00:17.040> lot<00:00:17.099> of<00:00:17.250> guys<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.669> to<00:00:17.820> deal<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.650 
a lot of guys have to deal with and
everybody<00:00:20.369> does<00:00:20.579> to<00:00:20.790> some<00:00:20.970> extent<00:00:21.360> but<00:00:21.540> it

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
everybody does to some extent but it

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.389 
everybody does to some extent but it
seems<00:00:21.869> more<00:00:22.169> than<00:00:22.380> others<00:00:22.649> and<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.980> some<00:00:23.160> cases

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:23.399 
seems more than others and in some cases

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.639 
seems more than others and in some cases
it<00:00:23.700> seems<00:00:23.730> unfair<00:00:24.360> and<00:00:24.599> with<00:00:24.960> Bart<00:00:25.200> I<00:00:25.320> think<00:00:25.529> it

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:25.649 
it seems unfair and with Bart I think it

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.639 
it seems unfair and with Bart I think it
has<00:00:25.770> been<00:00:25.800> unfair<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:26.910> he's<00:00:27.270> a<00:00:27.300> guy<00:00:27.509> that

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649 
has been unfair because he's a guy that

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.490 
has been unfair because he's a guy that
that<00:00:28.649> has<00:00:28.770> worked<00:00:29.009> hard<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.320> hasn't<00:00:31.320> been

that has worked hard and and hasn't been

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.980 
that has worked hard and and hasn't been
able<00:00:31.739> to<00:00:32.160> show<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.180> he<00:00:33.300> could<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.660> do

that<00:02:27.450> there's<00:02:27.599> there's<00:02:27.900> rewards<00:02:28.319> at<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> end

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that there's there's rewards at the end

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.660 
that there's there's rewards at the end
of<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.010> handle<00:02:29.250> things<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> right<00:02:29.610> way

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
of it if you handle things the right way

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.990 
of it if you handle things the right way
I<00:02:30.060> think<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.720> guy<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.200> his<00:02:31.920> position<00:02:32.340> being<00:02:32.819> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
I think a guy in his position being a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.770 
I think a guy in his position being a
senior<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:34.340> isn't<00:02:35.340> starting<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.269> doesn't

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
senior that isn't starting and doesn't

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.960 
senior that isn't starting and doesn't
get<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> lot<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.170> playing<00:02:37.470> time<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:38.430> easy<00:02:38.700> for

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
get a lot of playing time it's easy for

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.740 
get a lot of playing time it's easy for
those<00:02:39.120> guys<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:40.910> drift<00:02:41.910> away<00:02:42.120> from<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
those guys to just drift away from the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.509 
those guys to just drift away from the
heart<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.140> team<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.769> really<00:02:44.069> become<00:02:44.340> a

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
heart of the team and really become a

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.990 
heart of the team and really become a

have<00:03:29.310> such<00:03:29.730> high<00:03:29.940> character<00:03:30.269> if<00:03:30.599> he<00:03:30.720> didn't

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
have such high character if he didn't

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.660 
have such high character if he didn't
have<00:03:31.139> the<00:03:31.410> connection<00:03:31.889> to<00:03:31.920> Auburn<00:03:32.400> with<00:03:32.519> his

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
have the connection to Auburn with his

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.190 
have the connection to Auburn with his
family<00:03:32.910> if<00:03:33.239> he<00:03:33.359> didn't<00:03:33.599> have<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.900> kind<00:03:34.049> of

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
family if he didn't have the kind of

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.860 
family if he didn't have the kind of
character<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.889> if<00:03:35.549> his<00:03:35.910> parents<00:03:36.239> have

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
character that if his parents have

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.890 
character that if his parents have
instilled<00:03:37.049> in<00:03:37.950> him<00:03:38.299> he<00:03:39.299> wouldn't<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.660> willing

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
instilled in him he wouldn't be willing

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.140 
instilled in him he wouldn't be willing
to<00:03:39.989> do<00:03:40.139> those<00:03:40.319> things<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.849> his

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
to do those things and so I think his

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.610 
to do those things and so I think his
family<00:03:42.540> certainly<00:03:42.750> has<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.079> lot<00:03:43.169> to<00:03:43.470> do<00:03:43.590> with

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
family certainly has a lot to do with

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.140 
family certainly has a lot to do with
his<00:03:43.889> love<00:03:44.099> for<00:03:44.310> all<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.459> them<00:03:44.579> but<00:03:44.730> also<00:03:44.880> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
his love for all of them but also the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150 
his love for all of them but also the
kind<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.389> kid<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:45.599> he<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:45.989> I'm<00:03:46.290> just<00:03:46.709> excited
