200<00:01:00.640> years<00:01:00.670> that's<00:01:01.000> 5<00:01:01.239> feet<00:01:01.269> per<00:01:01.510> century<00:01:01.960> and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
200 years that's 5 feet per century and

200 years that's 5 feet per century and
that<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.320> a<00:01:02.350> lot<00:01:02.589> and<00:01:02.830> that<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.040> something<00:01:03.400> we

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
that is a lot and that is something we

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.640 
that is a lot and that is something we
would<00:01:03.940> have<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.150> contend<00:01:04.570> with<00:01:04.659> scientists

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650

say<00:01:05.740> West<00:01:06.040> Antarctic<00:01:06.640> glaciers<00:01:06.969> have<00:01:07.180> now

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
say West Antarctic glaciers have now

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.520 
say West Antarctic glaciers have now
retreated<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.049> point<00:01:08.259> of<00:01:08.350> creating

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
retreated to the point of creating

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.649

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
inherent instability in the ice sheet

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.719 
inherent instability in the ice sheet
Jacquin<00:01:11.560> says<00:01:11.770> his<00:01:11.950> computer<00:01:12.430> model

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
Jacquin says his computer model

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.520 
Jacquin says his computer model
simulating<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.570> behavior<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.140> ice<00:01:14.259> sheet

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
simulating the behavior of the ice sheet

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.709 
simulating the behavior of the ice sheet
indicates<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.820> likely<00:01:16.060> too<00:01:16.359> late<00:01:16.570> to

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
indicates that it is likely too late to

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.590 
indicates that it is likely too late to
halt<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.170> glacial<00:01:17.409> retreat<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.299> what<00:01:19.479> we've

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
halt this glacial retreat so what we've

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.270 
halt this glacial retreat so what we've
been<00:01:19.719> seeing<00:01:20.020> recently<00:01:20.320> along<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.039> Amundsen

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
been seeing recently along the Amundsen

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.099 
been seeing recently along the Amundsen
Coast<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.270> many<00:01:22.450> other<00:01:22.600> groups<00:01:22.750> have<00:01:22.960> seen

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
Coast and many other groups have seen

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.840 
Coast and many other groups have seen
this<00:01:23.229> too<00:01:23.469> is<00:01:23.740> that<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.189> ice<00:01:24.369> is<00:01:24.579> thinning

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
this too is that the ice is thinning

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.340 
this too is that the ice is thinning
rapidly<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.509> glaciers<00:01:25.840> have<00:01:26.020> sped<00:01:26.320> up

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
rapidly and the glaciers have sped up

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.740 
rapidly and the glaciers have sped up
for<00:01:27.250> example<00:01:27.399> Pine<00:01:28.000> Island<00:01:28.149> glacier<00:01:28.329> was

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
for example Pine Island glacier was

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.779 
for example Pine Island glacier was
going<00:01:29.109> 23<00:01:29.920> 2500<00:01:30.579> meters<00:01:30.789> a<00:01:30.820> year<00:01:31.420> or<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.789> the

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
going 23 2500 meters a year or so the

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.440 
going 23 2500 meters a year or so the
speed<00:01:34.030> near<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.359> grounding<00:01:34.689> line<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.829> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
speed near the grounding line in the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.639 
speed near the grounding line in the
70's<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.509> 80's<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:37.929> 90's<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.350> now<00:01:38.469> it's

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
70's and 80's and 90's and now it's

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.529 
70's and 80's and 90's and now it's
going<00:01:38.979> more<00:01:39.159> like<00:01:39.310> 4,000<00:01:39.880> meters<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.210> year<00:01:40.240> so

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
going more like 4,000 meters a year so

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.109 
going more like 4,000 meters a year so
these<00:01:40.630> are<00:01:40.780> really<00:01:40.899> big<00:01:41.140> speed<00:01:41.439> ups<00:01:41.969> the<00:01:42.969> nice

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
these are really big speed ups the nice

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.459 
these are really big speed ups the nice
thing<00:01:43.329> that<00:01:43.359> the<00:01:43.539> model<00:01:43.810> was<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.109> actually

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
thing that the model was it actually

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.050 
thing that the model was it actually
fairly<00:01:44.740> well<00:01:44.829> reproduced<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.520> losses<00:01:45.880> in

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
fairly well reproduced the losses in

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.630 
fairly well reproduced the losses in
this<00:01:46.270> glacier<00:01:46.630> over<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.960> last<00:01:47.219> 18<00:01:48.219> years<00:01:48.249> or

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
this glacier over the last 18 years or

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.819 
this glacier over the last 18 years or
so<00:01:48.819> very<00:01:49.539> matches<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.049> quite<00:01:50.229> well<00:01:50.350> with<00:01:50.499> the

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
so very matches it quite well with the

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.349 
so very matches it quite well with the
higher<00:01:51.039> melt<00:01:51.340> scenarios<00:01:51.819> that<00:01:51.999> we're<00:01:52.119> using

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
higher melt scenarios that we're using

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.330 
higher melt scenarios that we're using
which<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.289> consistent<00:01:53.799> with<00:01:53.859> the<00:01:54.069> idea<00:01:54.159> that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
which is consistent with the idea that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.739 
which is consistent with the idea that

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
there has been a much more warm water

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.739 
there has been a much more warm water
coming<00:01:56.319> in<00:01:56.439> lately<00:01:56.999> and<00:01:57.999> therefore<00:01:58.539> much<00:01:58.719> more

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749

then<00:02:00.310> when<00:02:00.490> we<00:02:00.609> just<00:02:00.819> looked<00:02:01.119> what<00:02:01.299> our<00:02:01.840> model

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
then when we just looked what our model

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.660 
then when we just looked what our model
was<00:02:02.350> producing<00:02:02.740> for<00:02:02.920> melt<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.249> compared<00:02:03.579> it

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
was producing for melt and compared it

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.190 
was producing for melt and compared it
with<00:02:03.700> what<00:02:03.969> others<00:02:04.240> had<00:02:04.450> estimated<00:02:04.569> the<00:02:05.049> melt

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
with what others had estimated the melt

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450

and at this point we'll say it's just a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
shows and some of what we expected is

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.070 
shows and some of what we expected is
that<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:40.010> rate<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:40.900> collapse<00:02:41.900> of

the this glacier really depends on the

the this glacier really depends on the
