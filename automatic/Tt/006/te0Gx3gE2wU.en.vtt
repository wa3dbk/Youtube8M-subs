00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
like I mentioned okay so I took my

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.260 
like I mentioned okay so I took my
extensions<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.129> had<00:01:02.430> those<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:03.030> about

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
extensions out and I had those for about

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.420 
extensions out and I had those for about
like<00:01:03.570> maybe<00:01:03.719> seven<00:01:04.290> weeks<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.129> really

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
this is probably something that I would

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.960 
this is probably something that I would
do<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.979> long<00:01:35.159> time<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.850> because

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
post relaxer so I almost think I relaxed

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.420 
post relaxer so I almost think I relaxed
just<00:01:46.799> kind<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.250> like

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
just kind of just like

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.910 
just kind of just like
spur-of-the-moment<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.869> took<00:01:49.409> my<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.710> thought

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
spur-of-the-moment I took my we thought

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.700 
spur-of-the-moment I took my we thought
maybe<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.340> last<00:01:50.939> week<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.079> five

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
maybe like last week and then like five

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.560 
maybe like last week and then like five
days<00:01:52.979> later<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.430> was<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.729> oh<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.030> gosh<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.450> have

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
days later I was like oh my gosh I have

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.690 
days later I was like oh my gosh I have
a<00:01:54.600> lot<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.899> new<00:01:55.140> growth<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.460> don't

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
a lot of new growth and I just don't

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.149 
a lot of new growth and I just don't
really<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:57.000> how<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.299> attainment<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.950> just

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
really know how to attainment so I just

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.190 
really know how to attainment so I just
I<00:01:59.430> figured<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.969> should<00:02:00.000> get<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.390> perm<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
I figured that I should get a perm and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840 
I figured that I should get a perm and
my<00:02:01.619> mom<00:02:01.770> gave<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> me<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.490> she<00:02:02.610> always

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
my mom gave it to me like she always

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.670 
my mom gave it to me like she always
does<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> did<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.020> film<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.500> process

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
does so I did not film the process

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
does so I did not film the process
because<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.759> feel<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> lot<00:02:06.719> of

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
because I feel like I have a lot of

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.460

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440

just<00:02:30.710> figured<00:02:30.950> then<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.280> would<00:02:31.460> do<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.610> hair

update and also back at school I decided
to<00:02:35.360> give<00:02:35.930> biotin<00:02:36.800> another<00:02:37.280> go<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.030> if<00:02:38.720> you

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
to give biotin another go and if you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.590 
to give biotin another go and if you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.780 
would know that biotin vitamins
really<00:02:44.180> made<00:02:44.390> my<00:02:44.600> face<00:02:44.930> break<00:02:45.350> out<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.730> just

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
really made my face break out and I just

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.540 
really made my face break out and I just
didn't<00:02:47.660> want<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.990> keep<00:02:48.290> using<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.770> I<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:49.070> I

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
didn't want to keep using it I just I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.850 
didn't want to keep using it I just I
use<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:49.970> for<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.240> maybe<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.630> week<00:02:50.900> wait<00:02:51.590> maybe

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
use it for like maybe a week wait maybe

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.350 
use it for like maybe a week wait maybe
like<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.070> year<00:02:52.370> or<00:02:52.490> two<00:02:52.580> ago<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.850> use<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.120> prolonged

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
like a year or two ago I use a prolonged

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.720 
like a year or two ago I use a prolonged
a<00:02:53.540> week<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:54.680> just<00:02:55.010> couldn't<00:02:55.310> do<00:02:55.550> it

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
a week and I just couldn't do it

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.210 
a week and I just couldn't do it
but<00:02:56.060> back<00:02:56.570> in<00:02:56.780> school<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.440> figured<00:02:58.070> that<00:02:58.190> I

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
but back in school I figured that I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.160 
but back in school I figured that I
wanted<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.700> give<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:58.880> another<00:02:59.270> go<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.900> the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
wanted to give it another go and the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.230 
wanted to give it another go and the
only<00:03:00.380> reason<00:03:00.590> why<00:03:00.800> I<00:03:00.980> took<00:03:01.070> this<00:03:01.550> chance<00:03:01.880> was

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
only reason why I took this chance was

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.210 
only reason why I took this chance was
because<00:03:02.540> my<00:03:02.750> sister<00:03:03.140> had<00:03:03.650> did<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:03.980> video

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
because my sister had did a video

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.030 
because my sister had did a video
talking<00:03:04.640> about<00:03:04.760> how<00:03:04.940> pantothenic<00:03:05.720> acid

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
talking about how pantothenic acid

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.640 
talking about how pantothenic acid
paired<00:03:07.040> with<00:03:07.220> biotin<00:03:07.910> will<00:03:08.450> combat<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.410> break

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
paired with biotin will combat to break

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.710 
paired with biotin will combat to break
out<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.490> will<00:03:10.670> prevent<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.300> from<00:03:11.330> getting

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
out and it will prevent you from getting

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.290 
out and it will prevent you from getting
any<00:03:11.840> breakouts<00:03:12.320> so<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:13.220> decided<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.910> take<00:03:14.090> these

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
any breakouts so I decided to take these

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.300 
any breakouts so I decided to take these
two<00:03:14.570> in<00:03:14.780> school<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.410> as<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.890> can<00:03:15.980> see<00:03:16.040> this

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
two in school and as you can see this

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.400 
two in school and as you can see this
bottle<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.760> empty<00:03:16.970> because<00:03:17.660> my<00:03:18.080> sister<00:03:18.320> just

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
bottle is empty because my sister just

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.440 
bottle is empty because my sister just
let<00:03:18.620> me<00:03:18.739> get<00:03:18.890> like<00:03:19.070> her<00:03:19.550> last<00:03:19.790> few<00:03:20.090> ones<00:03:20.300> I

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
let me get like her last few ones I

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.400 
let me get like her last few ones I
think<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.750> was<00:03:20.840> like<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:20.989> couple<00:03:21.380> pills<00:03:23.140> but<00:03:24.140> I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
think it was like a couple pills but I

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.800 
think it was like a couple pills but I
thought<00:03:25.310> about<00:03:25.519> it<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:26.060> day<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.750> took

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
thought about it a day and then I took

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.949 
thought about it a day and then I took
one<00:03:27.110> of<00:03:27.140> these<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:28.070> I<00:03:28.700> was<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.360> happy<00:03:29.630> because

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
one of these and I was so happy because

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.530 
one of these and I was so happy because
I<00:03:30.290> had<00:03:30.620> no<00:03:30.950> breakouts<00:03:31.459> or<00:03:31.730> anything<00:03:32.209> like<00:03:32.480> that

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
I had no breakouts or anything like that

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.650 
I had no breakouts or anything like that
and<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.530> honestly<00:03:34.040> just<00:03:34.100> took<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.760> see<00:03:35.030> if<00:03:35.300> I

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
and I honestly just took it to see if I

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.479 
and I honestly just took it to see if I
could<00:03:35.720> take<00:03:36.050> it<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.470> my<00:03:36.680> skin<00:03:36.980> will<00:03:37.130> still<00:03:37.340> be

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
could take it and my skin will still be

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.460 
could take it and my skin will still be
clear<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.299> just<00:03:38.630> wanted<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.959> see<00:03:39.140> if<00:03:39.290> it

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
clear and I just wanted to see if it

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.590 
clear and I just wanted to see if it
would<00:03:39.560> make<00:03:39.799> my<00:03:39.950> hair<00:03:40.160> stronger<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.150> like

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
would make my hair stronger and like

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.660 
would make my hair stronger and like
maybe<00:03:41.870> make<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.140> grow<00:03:42.560> or<00:03:42.890> something<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.640> that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
maybe make it grow or something of that

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.880 
maybe make it grow or something of that
sort<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.660> honestly<00:03:44.959> don't<00:03:45.410> think<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.739> it

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
sort so I honestly don't think that it

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.800 
sort so I honestly don't think that it
made<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.130> grow<00:03:46.459> but<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:46.880> do<00:03:46.940> think<00:03:47.510> that<00:03:47.570> is

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
made it grow but I do think that is

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.900 
made it grow but I do think that is
straightening<00:03:48.320> my<00:03:48.440> hair<00:03:48.470> or<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.100> just<00:03:49.610> think<00:03:49.790> in

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
straightening my hair or I just think in

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.330 
straightening my hair or I just think in
general<00:03:50.120> my<00:03:50.510> hair<00:03:50.780> got<00:03:50.989> really<00:03:51.380> strong<00:03:51.769> with

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
general my hair got really strong with

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.520 
general my hair got really strong with
this<00:03:52.489> last<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.120> when<00:03:53.299> that<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.510> had<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.350> could

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
this last so when that I had so it could

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.920 
this last so when that I had so it could
also<00:03:54.739> be<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:54.980> so<00:03:55.310> in<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:55.940> like<00:03:56.180> not<00:03:56.600> using

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
also be the so in and like not using

like I want to say I took it for maybe
two<00:04:43.850> weeks<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.479> I<00:04:44.870> don't<00:04:45.050> think<00:04:45.199> that<00:04:45.289> that's

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
two weeks and I don't think that that's

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.990 
two weeks and I don't think that that's
long<00:04:45.710> enough<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:46.100> actually<00:04:46.250> get<00:04:46.550> your<00:04:46.639> hair<00:04:46.880> to

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
long enough to actually get your hair to

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.790 
long enough to actually get your hair to
grow<00:04:47.120> but<00:04:47.780> do<00:04:47.960> you<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:48.349> long<00:04:48.530> enough

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
grow but do you think it's long enough

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.279 
grow but do you think it's long enough
to<00:04:48.949> get<00:04:49.099> your<00:04:49.310> system<00:04:49.789> to<00:04:50.090> make<00:04:50.300> your<00:04:50.509> skin<00:04:50.870> and

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.800 
to get your system to make your skin and
your<00:04:51.680> nose<00:04:52.039> and<00:04:52.370> your<00:04:52.490> hair<00:04:52.789> stronger<00:04:53.210> yeah

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
my hair I just I've never been like so

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.610 
my hair I just I've never been like so
satisfied<00:07:25.090> with<00:07:25.300> my<00:07:25.450> hair<00:07:25.690> and<00:07:25.720> I<00:07:26.139> know<00:07:26.200> a<00:07:26.349> lot

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
satisfied with my hair and I know a lot

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.860 
satisfied with my hair and I know a lot
of<00:07:26.650> girls<00:07:26.889> really<00:07:27.580> focus<00:07:28.090> on<00:07:28.300> like<00:07:28.479> their<00:07:28.720> hair

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
of girls really focus on like their hair

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.440 
of girls really focus on like their hair
getting<00:07:29.080> longer<00:07:29.410> and<00:07:29.650> longer<00:07:29.889> and<00:07:30.580> I<00:07:30.940> also

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:31.450 
getting longer and longer and I also

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.210 
getting longer and longer and I also
think<00:07:31.780> that<00:07:31.870> when<00:07:32.380> you<00:07:32.560> know<00:07:32.590> how<00:07:32.919> to<00:07:33.039> take

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.220 
think that when you know how to take

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.740 
think that when you know how to take
care<00:07:33.430> of<00:07:33.520> your<00:07:33.639> hair<00:07:33.849> and<00:07:34.150> when<00:07:34.450> your<00:07:34.570> hair<00:07:34.720> is

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:34.750 
care of your hair and when your hair is

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.320 
care of your hair and when your hair is
really<00:07:34.960> strong<00:07:35.440> then<00:07:36.099> like<00:07:36.430> length<00:07:37.060> will

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.330 
really strong then like length will

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.210 
really strong then like length will
eventually<00:07:37.750> come<00:07:37.990> with<00:07:38.169> that<00:07:38.349> but<00:07:38.860> I<00:07:38.889> think

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.220 
eventually come with that but I think

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.830 
eventually come with that but I think
the<00:07:39.400> most<00:07:39.610> important<00:07:40.120> priority<00:07:40.570> for<00:07:40.780> your

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 
the most important priority for your

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.020 
the most important priority for your
hair<00:07:41.110> is<00:07:41.380> for<00:07:41.620> it<00:07:41.710> to<00:07:41.770> be<00:07:41.830> healthy<00:07:42.160> and<00:07:42.580> strong

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.030 
hair is for it to be healthy and strong

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.779 
hair is for it to be healthy and strong
and<00:07:43.450> things<00:07:43.900> like<00:07:44.050> that<00:07:44.110> so<00:07:44.580> that<00:07:45.580> you<00:07:45.639> guys
