my parents could give him a better shot

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.850

than Lotus he was good at Lotus he won

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.040 
than Lotus he was good at Lotus he won
some<00:01:15.040> races<00:01:15.100> back<00:01:16.000> then<00:01:16.240> for<00:01:16.479> sure<00:01:16.509> things

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
some races back then for sure things

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.540 
some races back then for sure things
were<00:01:17.200> very<00:01:17.440> different<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:17.979> I<00:01:18.190> think<00:01:18.250> they

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
were very different and I think they

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.520 
were very different and I think they
were<00:01:18.670> probably<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:19.479> bit<00:01:19.509> more<00:01:19.840> crazy<00:01:20.050> than<00:01:20.229> we

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
were probably a bit more crazy than we

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.969 
were probably a bit more crazy than we
are<00:01:20.710> now<00:01:20.890> this<00:01:21.119> Ayrton<00:01:22.119> was<00:01:22.149> lovely<00:01:22.979> there
