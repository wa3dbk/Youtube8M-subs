00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
so many different things going on in my

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.249

head<00:05:51.289> I<00:05:51.560> just<00:05:52.550> I<00:05:53.000> think<00:05:53.900> that's<00:05:54.020> pretty<00:05:54.199> much

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
head I just I think that's pretty much

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.019 
head I just I think that's pretty much
it<00:05:54.439> for<00:05:54.469> now<00:05:54.650> today<00:05:54.979> we<00:05:55.400> just<00:05:55.580> wanted<00:05:55.819> to<00:05:55.879> kind

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:56.029 
it for now today we just wanted to kind

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:57.279 
it for now today we just wanted to kind
of<00:05:56.150> touch<00:05:56.300> base<00:05:56.509> because<00:05:56.750> we<00:05:56.839> don't<00:05:56.990> really<00:05:57.080> do

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
of touch base because we don't really do

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.809 
of touch base because we don't really do
too<00:05:57.319> often<00:05:57.740> and<00:05:57.979> we<00:05:58.039> probably<00:05:58.219> should<00:05:58.460> do<00:05:58.580> it

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
too often and we probably should do it

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.659 
too often and we probably should do it
more<00:05:59.000> yeah<00:05:59.599> we<00:05:59.750> may<00:05:59.899> not<00:05:59.960> say<00:06:00.169> hello<00:06:00.469> yeah<00:06:01.370> so
