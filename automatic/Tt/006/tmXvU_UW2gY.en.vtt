00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 hello to all today i would like to introduce you 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.929
 yes this time the butter is here 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.740
 and then it's not happened yet is better later on here it's a 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:21.800
 prototype 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 the agreement back together 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.409
 wafer at dice green 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.800
 steel death 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 newsletters 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.340
 with a treatment 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.980
 the surface 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.200
 the body 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.200
 freddy nock québec the famous system 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.820
 proto block 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.190
 a belt clip with a treatment the same surface treatment as the blade 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.690
 the body 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 a windowbreaker 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.090
 here 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.930
 construction was opened 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.850
 an extreme that locks 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 pretty good 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.560
 you're waiting for it we're coming soon 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.560
 he would be very very good in hand 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.930
 like that you always have the function 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.360
 bottle opener 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.250
 thus 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.759
 ping jeans that can serve as net ideas so bing that hangs pretty well 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.720
 here 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 aaa with his own rock based you liked 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.040
 the briscard their 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 which is much shallower on the fixed version 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.960
 so this is a prototype so 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.830
 so there are a lot of things that have evolved since 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.420
 finishing 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.480
 the finish is exemplary 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.010
 on the on the final versions that I had in hand 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.270
 where paul barthélémy defect centering 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.199
 reportage 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.199
 the film is produced only slightly more raw 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.609
 generally 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.219
 it is a knife that is very very interesting 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.739
 which makes for the ground which is very very robust an explosive version 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.929
 péladeau of the very thick hand 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.559
 once again 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:32.559
 who from an overview 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.879
 a system allows it 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.569
 end here 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.569
 and use it as a lever 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:52.219
 it will come with a tool that will serve you to lock the pivot 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.219
 who will have the mission of the friends 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.439
 it will mount 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.249
 the icebreaker 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.729
 we announce once again a grip very very interesting 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.729
 in terms of size 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.329
 you can see something we know about all 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.609
 the complete skier farting 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.329
 it's pretty much the same thing 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.329
 is taken in hand without necessarily different 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.979
 but it's a knife that will be very interesting so for all those who 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.639
 are going on the pec city to the world with 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.389
 with me the knife is coming very very very soon be patient I thank you 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.899
 besides for and patience 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.859
 there's more than a few days before that happens can you give a 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.749
 little sneak preview this is not the knife is the knife of the 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.779
 designer who send it to me so that the 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:44.929
 I show it to you 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:46.919
 while here 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.849
 the tpx caste f 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.849
 from version 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.899
 fix that is for die until today by pesci 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.759
 and who in the future will be produced by a society 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.710
 So here you go to play or show it super knife 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.519
 in the twentieth 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.540
 this function I remind it was off capsules gold 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.389
 having said that it has an interesting function 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.759
 we'll say 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.759
 chance would have it 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.270
 the life they are there is that in the water we can also feed like that 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.509
 I think it was not done on purpose initially it was something that 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.430
 was on the initial design of the fixed 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.540
 which were delivered to the client version 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.060
 it turns out that's when the functions or is but it's not 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.029
 a function m some people find that 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:39.560
 it's far too little inspired by the people's version 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.520
 I can understand their point of view this being said I think it was the 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.430
 initial design on the fixed 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.070
 this poster is the delights son we think to make a customer so this 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.379
 point of view here I think it's forgivable fact that 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.690
 accidentally it works like that 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.770
 quick opening system 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.050
 so here you go 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.670
 the versions of the videos on the final version of they will follow 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.979
 I'm just going to give you a glimpse of nothing 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.210
 once again 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.439
 way almost 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.669
 Well, you can not see what to expect 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.999
 for a few more days 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:17.169
 thank you for your comments and for 100 euros under pressure rental and then to 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.739
