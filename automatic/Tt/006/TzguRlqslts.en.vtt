00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.869
 very good small and small or 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.210
 we keep showing interesting hardware 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.779
 for all who, like us, are 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.630
 very game two months we brought you the n 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.759
 land of a r 9 270 x and today is the turn 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.020
 of your big sister let's take a 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.330
 look at the sapphire 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.739
 r9 280 x three x of 3 gb at a glance 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.170
 it is striking how big the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.420
 box but normal since the card is 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.160
 quite long, very careful if you think 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.769
 put it in a small box since 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.479
 You may find that the 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.729
 card comes with three fans for 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.589
 optimize cooling by minimizing 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.199
 the noise and the truth is that you remember 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.659
 enough to the steam system x although not 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.010
 has its characteristics in this 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.229
 have hit the nail on the head since the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.180
 pretty quiet card even low 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.150
 a lot of cargo keeping cool throughout 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.450
 moment this card would be almost 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.270
 almost up to the geforce gtx 770 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.840
 of gigas surpassing the latter to 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.040
 the 280 x in less than 5% in speed 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.380
 in general use 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.730
 this would be with resolutions of up 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.190
 1080p 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.960
 notwithstanding the clear front shot m 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.820
 as soon as we move to handle resolutions 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.890
 higher since that's where it 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.080
 you need more ram ups to handle 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.840
 larger textures and come into play 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.390
 the 3 gb of the 280 x 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.659
 on the other hand the m of consumes more 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.780
 energy than the gtx 770 but the latter 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:48.109
 is between 10 and 15 euros more expensive than the m 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.990
 of 280 x if you play a 1080p screen 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.780
 and does not seem to happen to the new 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.009
 3k screens in the near future 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.259
 you'll get something lower than performance 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.020
 with envy for something less money 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.539
 It should also be noted that this is not 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.509
 in all the games some other games 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.890
 the md performs better than envy and is 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.729
 that we must not forget that in the new 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.470
 generation 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.599
 aemme devastated nor present in the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.489
 development of many games since everything 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.500
 the hardware of the consoles in the gene is 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.290
 of md and the collaborations with the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.660
 studies will end up paying off 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.849
 and we must not forget that the mda already 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.970
 It is compatible with mantel declaring 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.579
 improvements of 45% in fps in frames per 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.940
 second attack on the 4th and up to one 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:34.489
 200% on the star get one demo so 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.470
 You already know how to choose carefully and based on 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.540
 your economy but once analyzed 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.569
 the two options seem more complete 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.310
 at 280 x m despite being something else 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.319
 slow 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.000
 we leave you with the results of 3 of 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.739
 marc obtained with our team of 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.040
 tests until the next vice video 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.040
 armchair 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.920
 or the juicy and juicy today we bring you 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.920
 a little tutorial for you to go but
