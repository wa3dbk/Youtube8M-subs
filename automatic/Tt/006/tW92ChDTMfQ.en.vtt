00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.280
 goo 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.340
 Now to 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.980
 It's not like you've been to the ground for the first time in a long time, one ok rock 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.980
 It is taka-kun and I Regards Masu Regards 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.110
 Finally, next week 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.500
 New Album Yes Certify Yes Reese Yes 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.190
 What about album Well 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.840
 Pretty confidence in the Well in that I 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.650
 Hm yes 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:34.810
 I think there will be works in that so-called world 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:42.940
 A place where you can see what symbolizes one of your activities 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:46.310
 Two it means internal or work but of activity up to now is one I'm character main of it Well 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.730
 Well there's a culmination of things 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:54.640
 More than previous work 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:58.329
 'S also there was a little change in base but whether sense of life's Toka language Kanda Toka those things 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.340
 Hey, do you this is I think Kedomo is roughly Well 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:08.720
 Since the first production itself of this album did not perform the chair anymore in Japan 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:12.530
 Reflected in the Well that Oh manufacturers and therefore while sucking air rain of the Well 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 Because I did all the boarding that I also write lyrics 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.000
 In that sense, it's pretty good if you're up to now 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.070
 There are a lot of absolutely different part 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.610
 I think that it is the most curbing English probably even if it is Japanese 2 minutes with detailed inspiration 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.720
 but 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:34.840
 For example , it's Billford , or you 're out with a barn in the city 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:38.050
 It may be a little different even if it is English of a short sentence a little, so-called we 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.020
 I'm in Japan and want to use Japanese and English 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.570
 Japanese English 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.650
 Kankan Fighting 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:50.900
 It will nuance of the words that say that next Hashora been with or go Do this 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.830
 Jump that say so I America Deyufu also one by one tiny symbol to of the eye 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.700
 Or whether 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.909
 Little was there in what that there is no commercial phrase was or Toka cut 15 seconds 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.869
 There was a word, but it seems to be slightly different 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:09.330
 10,000 Japanese is very explained 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.259
 Naka Naka you often do not I'm either yes Uran Well of this compelling word words 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.410
 difficult 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.410
 If it before and after is really to Magyaku 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.090
 All people make it again just by changing one 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.459
 It is also very simple before 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.590
 What both described the Japanese people something this because Well it is not a course, our direction is also why 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:31.140
 Though it is difficult for Shino 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.040
 But I think it's really fashionable, but this deep, fashionable and different voice of ion 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.540
 To a 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:43.760
 Something like that happened when I felt that I was living on the other side 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:47.490
 Dehai of feel really evolved from compatible like a part in say so 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:54.150
 There is also a feeling that I have absorbed it and how about the sound side 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:57.090
 Is I over our life of another previous It's another really so can be in Japan in the so-called ones 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.960
 I think that everything has already been done 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.490
 so 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.840
 Even year Date be doing over time and very compressed drink match stick sound with respect to Well of the album 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.980
 Is it 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.470
 Oh, after all I made that album and now it's too 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.760
 In Well 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:20.240
 Ensakiko I environment Tteyuu to live in many this time other than Japan country we were waiting I, et al. 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.400
 It's still very cool this album 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:29.670
 I have a major impact when making a 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.420
 Was a lock of rain in the octagonal Te I Raney really favorite music to something after all this really now 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.350
 Toka 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:40.470
 What is uk lock or real lock? 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:44.840
 Even though I was in a place where rice is basically basic and Western music, I still somehow myself 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.710
 Say Do Kitetanda to express it in a very narrow view of the world I reach 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:53.810
 In particular it was still aware there is also the world 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:55.060
 At the same time, after all the fruit is already over in the US and something is a little 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.050
 In Japan 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.770
 It's a song that is only made in Japan 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:07.230
 Will I do not think probably only be of ribbon without stop calibration refolding 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:12.600
 When I played the songs of the album in the United States, I had a very slight sense of discomfort 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.810
 I I still this formation and we can say what kind of thing or by say going out to the world 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.040
 Say what was made of their accident Datte best 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.630
 Of course I always have that feeling 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:27.920
 I do not want to go to tell such things fairly and still the world 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:33.040
 Absorbing various things on the scale and traveling on the foot 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.639
 The fact that we will transmit on a world-wide basis is the part of us 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.569
 I'll tell you, there really is 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.630
 There is also one that I was noticed there 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.120
 Oh dear 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:48.849
 Hey I'd we also now has built the first time Purusu 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:55.959
 Reverse Record The producer of the music we have listened to 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:05:02.409
 It Is Nantes again and say the feeling of course sound ask them about this time and medical mesh 

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:04.839
 You don't have to say anything while you're in the protective raster and you're going to be guitar- based and drummed 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:08.430
 I beat it and vocal 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:14.430
 The sound we wanted was in the store there 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:17.640
 Very relaxed and also this also to the fact that their own to grow by one person in the state Kioketoge 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:21.360
 Intends leverage chip was I, for example, to this more than anything now 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.830
 This from the file N'was here for me like the we 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.449
 If it was in the center, its radius is within 34 kilometers 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.780
 Well this is a parable though 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.800
 Ah ah ah 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.840
 I feel like I created a work every time it wasn't the last minute 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.080
 Hmm 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:42.660
 But after all that 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:46.710
 I would like to quit, I think this is a new one 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:52.860
 Furthermore, I also from along As we open up the world 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.870
 I will make tears, and I will make a big one again centering on the place where it came out 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.260
 I want to Do with 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.380
 That feeling was so strong 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:04.449
 So who in the recording at this time of the United States 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:08.249
 Of course if you ask, it's obviously different from the previous one, though 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:12.480
 It was a very fulfilling day in my own child 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:19.680
 I guess is between that there Do it big 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:24.180
 And degrade the I say that album or rather now solve slowly and carefully even a little care 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:29.460
 Or say it has been commented a little one by one 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.569
 I think if you want to ask I'm going out 8 overseas from now 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.009
 Get along 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:35.529
 I also made 2 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.700
 Will you count anymore how many times live spear I was overseas 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.740
 Hey That's right 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.460
 Sitting 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.050
 Well punishment crawling What strangeness 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.080
 First we went America Chorotto 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:51.090
 And Russia 6 we went to Russia 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.840
 Europe already solemn enough this time singer minutes 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.520
 I got a storm 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.480
 Package Dotte 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.840
 Hey I was quite go 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.140
 South America is also good South America is also down there 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.139
 South America is also all Argentina 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:11.870
 Brazil I 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:13.310
 Receiving construction at and there is not one place but already there is a line very American pie 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.139
 South American continent 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:21.030
 I steadily on and on soooo 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:26.480
 In this way , it is probably really the end that you have come out of what came to Kochi 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:31.790
 Than in the think resonate Unlike this says good impression softening rough-hewn 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:35.480
 I think I'll definitely know if I'm going to understand something somehow 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:40.490
 I think yes and I want to future talks Yes 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:45.160
 So thank you for the part of the talk so far, but from now on 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.160
 And I think that I want to tease That's 2 hours child Idoido
