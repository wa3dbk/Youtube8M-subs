hello everybody today we'll be making an

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.140 
hello everybody today we'll be making an
edible<00:00:08.559> water<00:00:08.800> bottle<00:00:09.309> lots<00:00:09.580> of<00:00:09.820> exciting

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
edible water bottle lots of exciting

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.230 
edible water bottle lots of exciting
things<00:00:10.300> okay<00:00:11.140> so<00:00:11.230> for<00:00:12.160> this<00:00:12.370> experiment<00:00:12.849> first

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
things okay so for this experiment first

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.120 
things okay so for this experiment first
we<00:00:13.480> should<00:00:13.540> go<00:00:13.990> over<00:00:14.019> the<00:00:14.290> materials<00:00:14.860> that<00:00:15.040> we

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.130 
we should go over the materials that we

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.750 
we should go over the materials that we
need<00:00:15.309> to<00:00:15.730> make<00:00:15.880> this<00:00:16.059> happen<00:00:17.609> firstly<00:00:18.609> we<00:00:18.670> will

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
need to make this happen firstly we will

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.859 
need to make this happen firstly we will
need<00:00:19.000> one<00:00:19.300> gram<00:00:19.599> of<00:00:19.630> sodium<00:00:20.169> alginate<00:00:20.589> and<00:00:21.869> in

this water is not to be drinking and
this<00:00:46.060> one<00:00:46.570> cup<00:00:46.810> of<00:00:46.930> water<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:47.350> actually<00:00:47.590> the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
this one cup of water is actually the

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.100 
this one cup of water is actually the
water<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:48.430> will<00:00:48.520> be<00:00:48.640> drinking<00:00:49.000> so<00:00:49.300> be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
water you will be drinking so be

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.620 
water you will be drinking so be
prepared<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.940> make<00:00:51.940> special<00:00:52.480> arrangements

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
prepared to make special arrangements

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.220 
prepared to make special arrangements
for<00:00:53.320> this<00:00:53.440> water<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.810> over<00:00:55.810> here<00:00:56.020> we<00:00:56.200> have

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
for this water and over here we have

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.180 
for this water and over here we have
five<00:00:56.770> grams<00:00:57.130> of<00:00:57.370> calcium<00:00:57.640> chloride<00:00:59.040> and<00:01:00.040> yeah

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
five grams of calcium chloride and yeah

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.800 
five grams of calcium chloride and yeah
that's<00:01:00.490> the<00:01:00.610> materials<00:01:01.120> that<00:01:01.270> will<00:01:01.420> need<00:01:01.600> for

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
that's the materials that will need for

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.819 
that's the materials that will need for
the<00:01:01.900> sixth<00:01:02.170> time<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.730> here<00:01:04.320> take<00:01:05.320> your<00:01:05.500> sodium

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
the sixth time so here take your sodium

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.050 
the sixth time so here take your sodium
alginate

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
alginate

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:15.050 
alginate
and<00:01:07.420> put<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:07.750> into<00:01:08.280> Europe<00:01:09.280> your<00:01:10.149> 1<00:01:10.360> cup<00:01:10.570> water

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.310 

now<00:01:16.060> make<00:01:16.899> sure<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.170> stir<00:01:17.740> gently<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:19.320> keep

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
now make sure to stir gently and keep

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.730 
now make sure to stir gently and keep
stirring<00:01:20.740> until<00:01:21.009> you<00:01:21.610> feel<00:01:21.880> like<00:01:22.500> all<00:01:23.500> the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
stirring until you feel like all the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:35.760 
stirring until you feel like all the
sodium<00:01:24.100> content<00:01:24.250> has<00:01:24.700> his<00:01:24.880> own<00:01:34.619> once<00:01:35.619> you

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
sodium content has his own once you

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.550 
sodium content has his own once you
filled<00:01:36.039> out<00:01:36.220> all<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.520> sodium<00:01:37.000> outfit<00:01:37.560> that's

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
filled out all the sodium outfit that's

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.029 
filled out all the sodium outfit that's
dissolve<00:01:39.009> into<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.399> water<00:01:40.920> send<00:01:41.920> your
