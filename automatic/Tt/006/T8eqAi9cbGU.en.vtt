up pretty much anywhere you want put in

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.940 
up pretty much anywhere you want put in
your<00:00:17.470> living<00:00:17.710> room

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
your living room

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.380 
your living room
and<00:00:18.039> then<00:00:18.189> gives<00:00:18.340> you<00:00:18.430> that<00:00:18.550> feeling<00:00:19.000> like

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
and then gives you that feeling like

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.580 
and then gives you that feeling like
you're<00:00:19.570> skating<00:00:20.169> cuz<00:00:20.320> you're<00:00:20.410> gonna<00:00:20.470> be

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
sliding back and forth on it

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.669 
sliding back and forth on it
and<00:00:22.240> it's<00:00:22.630> really<00:00:22.869> similar<00:00:23.080> to<00:00:23.199> the<00:00:23.320> skating

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
and it's really similar to the skating

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.439

shoes so you can slide back and forth so
this<00:00:46.869> is<00:00:47.110> a<00:00:47.140> really<00:00:47.530> slick<00:00:47.979> piece<00:00:48.159> of<00:00:48.369> plastic

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
the stoppers are both the same I think

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.740

and<00:01:00.339> solid<00:01:00.489> it's<00:01:01.210> got<00:01:01.330> a<00:01:01.360> handle<00:01:01.629> here<00:01:01.960> I<00:01:01.989> think

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
and solid it's got a handle here I think

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.780 
and solid it's got a handle here I think
for<00:01:02.290> doing<00:01:02.559> workouts<00:01:02.949> like<00:01:03.189> lunges<00:01:03.580> and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
for doing workouts like lunges and

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.700 
for doing workouts like lunges and
mountain<00:01:04.059> climbers<00:01:04.269> and<00:01:04.510> stuff<00:01:04.720> how<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.439> set

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
mountain climbers and stuff how you set

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.500 
mountain climbers and stuff how you set
it<00:01:05.799> up<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.369> lay<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.640> sheet<00:01:06.790> out<00:01:06.939> you<00:01:07.240> wedge

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
it up is you lay the sheet out you wedge

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.139 
it up is you lay the sheet out you wedge
it<00:01:07.689> in<00:01:07.840> between<00:01:08.289> the<00:01:08.829> stopper<00:01:09.609> and<00:01:10.000> then<00:01:10.090> you

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
it in between the stopper and then you

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.029 
it in between the stopper and then you
just<00:01:10.270> twist<00:01:10.450> these<00:01:10.750> knobs<00:01:11.049> and<00:01:11.439> that's<00:01:11.859> going

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
just twist these knobs and that's going

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.830 
just twist these knobs and that's going
to<00:01:12.100> make<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.399> nice<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.549> tight<00:01:12.909> so<00:01:13.179> on<00:01:13.750> the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
to make it nice and tight so on the

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.690 
to make it nice and tight so on the
other<00:01:13.960> side<00:01:14.229> underneath<00:01:14.679> it's<00:01:15.369> got<00:01:15.520> this

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
other side underneath it's got this

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.440 
other side underneath it's got this
heavy<00:01:16.109> rubber<00:01:17.820> stopper<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.000> that's<00:01:19.179> going<00:01:19.390> to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
heavy rubber stopper and that's going to

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.510 
heavy rubber stopper and that's going to
keep<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:20.350> slide<00:01:20.619> board<00:01:20.890> from<00:01:21.070> moving<00:01:21.369> back

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
keep the slide board from moving back

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.399 
keep the slide board from moving back
and<00:01:21.670> forth<00:01:21.939> so<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:22.479> can<00:01:22.719> slide<00:01:22.929> back<00:01:23.200> and

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
and forth so you can slide back and

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.109 
and forth so you can slide back and
forth<00:01:23.499> but<00:01:24.159> this<00:01:24.310> thing<00:01:24.490> won't<00:01:24.640> be<00:01:24.759> shifting

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
forth but this thing won't be shifting

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.669 
forth but this thing won't be shifting
underneath<00:01:25.329> your<00:01:25.570> feet<00:01:25.719> so<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.350> looks<00:01:26.499> like<00:01:26.649> a

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
underneath your feet so it looks like a

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.529 
underneath your feet so it looks like a
really<00:01:26.890> good<00:01:27.070> setup<00:01:27.280> pretty<00:01:27.609> simple<00:01:27.999> let's

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
really good setup pretty simple let's

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.389 
really good setup pretty simple let's
test<00:01:28.719> it<00:01:28.840> out<00:01:28.960> so<00:01:29.829> we<00:01:29.890> can<00:01:29.950> start<00:01:30.219> with<00:01:30.340> the

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
test it out so we can start with the

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.830 
test it out so we can start with the
basic<00:01:30.609> stride<00:01:31.030> here<00:01:31.270> just<00:01:31.450> going<00:01:31.570> back<00:01:31.780> and

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
basic stride here just going back and

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.419 
basic stride here just going back and
forth<00:01:32.259> but<00:01:32.499> what's<00:01:32.619> important<00:01:33.039> is<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.159> good

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
forth but what's important is that good

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.999 
forth but what's important is that good
form<00:01:33.819> so<00:01:34.270> really<00:01:35.020> deep<00:01:35.350> knee<00:01:35.590> bent

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
form so really deep knee bent

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.950 
form so really deep knee bent
standing<00:01:36.280> nice<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.490> low<00:01:37.060> having<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.719> head

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
standing nice and low having that head

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.349 
standing nice and low having that head
up<00:01:38.140> head<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.590> chest<00:01:38.859> up<00:01:39.100> pointing<00:01:39.999> the<00:01:40.149> toes

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
up head the chest up pointing the toes

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.330 
up head the chest up pointing the toes
each<00:01:40.630> time<00:01:40.869> when<00:01:41.049> you<00:01:41.109> push<00:01:41.350> off<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.920> then

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
each time when you push off and then

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.919 
each time when you push off and then
also<00:01:42.490> moving<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.179> arms<00:01:43.479> we're<00:01:43.630> not<00:01:43.719> really

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
also moving the arms we're not really

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.319 
also moving the arms we're not really
rolling<00:01:44.469> them<00:01:44.710> wildly<00:01:45.189> back<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:45.579> forth<00:01:45.819> so

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
rolling them wildly back and forth so

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.819 
rolling them wildly back and forth so
doing<00:01:46.539> that<00:01:46.659> you're<00:01:46.840> working<00:01:46.990> on<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:47.469> good

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
doing that you're working on that good

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.739 
doing that you're working on that good
form<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.729> can<00:01:48.850> see<00:01:48.969> the<00:01:49.060> basic<00:01:49.240> functions

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
form so you can see the basic functions

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:50.849 
form so you can see the basic functions
of<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.869> slide<00:01:50.109> board<00:01:50.350> there<00:01:50.499> you<00:01:50.649> can<00:01:50.770> see

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
of the slide board there you can see

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.379 
of the slide board there you can see
that<00:01:50.889> was<00:01:51.069> nice<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.340> slick<00:01:51.639> I<00:01:51.789> was<00:01:51.909> sliding

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389 
that was nice and slick I was sliding

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.179 
that was nice and slick I was sliding
back<00:01:52.569> and<00:01:52.600> forth<00:01:52.810> really<00:01:53.109> easily<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:54.069> can

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
back and forth really easily and you can

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.129 
back and forth really easily and you can
really<00:01:54.399> see<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.909> resemblance<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.810> skating

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:56.139 
really see that resemblance the skating

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:57.389 
really see that resemblance the skating
stride<00:01:56.439> that<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.619> can<00:01:56.710> be<00:01:56.799> taking<00:01:57.100> on<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.280> ice

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
stride that you can be taking on the ice

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.760 
stride that you can be taking on the ice
so<00:01:57.939> for<00:01:58.329> that<00:01:58.450> purpose<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:59.259> know<00:01:59.499> it's<00:01:59.649> pretty

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
so for that purpose you know it's pretty

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.529 
so for that purpose you know it's pretty
good<00:01:59.889> way<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.189> simulate<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.909> stride<00:02:01.240> at<00:02:01.359> home

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
good way to simulate that stride at home

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.899 
good way to simulate that stride at home
however<00:02:02.079> if<00:02:02.590> you're<00:02:02.770> only<00:02:02.920> sliding<00:02:03.579> back<00:02:03.700> and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
however if you're only sliding back and

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:04.199 
however if you're only sliding back and
forth

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
forth

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.459 
forth
you'll<00:02:04.389> probably<00:02:04.569> get<00:02:04.869> tired<00:02:05.229> of<00:02:05.380> it

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
you'll probably get tired of it

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.199 
you'll probably get tired of it
eventually<00:02:05.740> but<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.490> good<00:02:06.639> news<00:02:06.789> is<00:02:06.999> there's

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
eventually but the good news is there's

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.699 
eventually but the good news is there's
all<00:02:07.420> kinds<00:02:07.899> of<00:02:07.959> drills<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.350> can<00:02:08.410> do<00:02:08.560> on<00:02:08.649> a

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
all kinds of drills that you can do on a

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.960 
all kinds of drills that you can do on a
slide<00:02:08.950> board<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.459> I'm<00:02:09.520> going<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.700> show<00:02:09.819> you<00:02:09.880> a

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
slide board so I'm going to show you a

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.340 
slide board so I'm going to show you a
few<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.300> my<00:02:10.390> favorites<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:10.899> if<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.110> do<00:02:11.200> pick

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
few of my favorites and if you do pick

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.900 
few of my favorites and if you do pick

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
one of these up you can come up with a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.780 
one of these up you can come up with a
whole<00:02:13.270> bunch<00:02:13.480> on<00:02:13.720> your<00:02:13.990> own<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.260> just

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
whole bunch on your own and just

already<00:02:16.080> doing<00:02:16.200> at<00:02:16.379> home<00:02:16.500> now<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.220> pump<00:02:17.459> it

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
already doing at home now we can pump it

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.729 
already doing at home now we can pump it
up<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.819> notch<00:02:17.849> because<00:02:18.360> now<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.780> got<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> 20<00:02:19.439> pound

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
up a notch because now I got a 20 pound

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.069 
up a notch because now I got a 20 pound
medicine<00:02:20.400> ball<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.000> that's<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.629> add<00:02:21.780> a

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
medicine ball and that's going to add a

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.830 
medicine ball and that's going to add a
lot<00:02:22.409> of<00:02:22.439> weight<00:02:22.709> here<00:02:23.129> slide<00:02:23.700> every<00:02:24.450> push<00:02:24.659> is

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
lot of weight here slide every push is

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.179 
lot of weight here slide every push is
like<00:02:24.959> you're<00:02:25.110> pushing<00:02:25.260> next<00:02:25.560> you're<00:02:25.650> 20

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
like you're pushing next you're 20

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.009 
like you're pushing next you're 20
pounds<00:02:26.519> across<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.000> mat<00:02:27.180> that's<00:02:27.450> also<00:02:27.900> going

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
pounds across the mat that's also going

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.479 
pounds across the mat that's also going
to<00:02:28.079> work<00:02:28.230> your<00:02:28.409> core<00:02:28.620> all<00:02:29.129> right<00:02:29.280> got<00:02:29.430> your

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
to work your core all right got your

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.190 
to work your core all right got your
mountain<00:02:29.819> climbers<00:02:30.239> this<00:02:30.629> is<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.840> great<00:02:31.049> one

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
mountain climbers this is a great one

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.750 
mountain climbers this is a great one
because<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.620> get<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.769> full<00:02:32.010> extension<00:02:32.400> from

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
because you get a full extension from

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.880 
because you get a full extension from
each<00:02:32.909> leg<00:02:33.209> work<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:33.840> your<00:02:33.959> flexibility<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
each leg work on your flexibility and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.460 
each leg work on your flexibility and
also<00:02:35.370> good<00:02:35.730> cardio<00:02:36.180> workout<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.349> good

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
also good cardio workout this is a good

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.080 
also good cardio workout this is a good
workout<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.980> got<00:02:38.099> from<00:02:38.220> Gary<00:02:38.489> Roberts<00:02:38.940> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
workout that I got from Gary Roberts and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.369 
workout that I got from Gary Roberts and
I<00:02:39.120> was<00:02:39.209> working<00:02:39.450> out<00:02:39.510> with<00:02:39.569> Steven<00:02:39.930> Stamkos

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
I was working out with Steven Stamkos

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.559 
I was working out with Steven Stamkos
lucky<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.099> me<00:02:41.250> I'm<00:02:41.700> actually<00:02:41.940> cheating<00:02:42.299> right

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
lucky you me I'm actually cheating right

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.089 
lucky you me I'm actually cheating right
now<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.019> reason<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.379> like<00:02:43.409> this<00:02:43.739> one<00:02:43.920> is
