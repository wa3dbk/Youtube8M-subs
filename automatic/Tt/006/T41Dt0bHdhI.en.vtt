out<00:02:40.940> some<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.330> low<00:02:41.510> end<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:42.380> little<00:02:42.650> bit

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
out some of the low end and a little bit

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.650 
out some of the low end and a little bit
of<00:02:42.890> some<00:02:43.190> ratalie<00:02:43.670> stuff<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.180> don't<00:02:44.360> want

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
of some ratalie stuff that I don't want

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.780 
of some ratalie stuff that I don't want
and<00:02:44.959> then<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.680> final<00:02:46.040> thing<00:02:46.069> is<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.519> kind<00:02:46.730> of

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
and then the final thing is to kind of

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.020 
and then the final thing is to kind of
find<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.810> fundamental<00:02:48.200> fat<00:02:49.010> frequency<00:02:49.880> of

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
find the fundamental fat frequency of

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.490 
find the fundamental fat frequency of
the<00:02:50.150> snare<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:50.989> usually<00:02:51.110> going<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.440> be

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
the snare and it's usually going to be

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.100 
the snare and it's usually going to be
in<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.650> low<00:02:51.830> mates<00:02:52.069> maybe<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.489> 200s<00:02:53.180> 300s<00:02:53.569> and

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
in the low mates maybe the 200s 300s and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.740 
in the low mates maybe the 200s 300s and
so<00:02:54.620> what<00:02:54.769> I'm<00:02:54.860> going<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.010> do<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:55.400> grab

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
so what I'm going to do is just grab

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.630 
so what I'm going to do is just grab
this<00:02:56.750> little<00:02:56.989> guy<00:02:57.110> around<00:02:57.290> here<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:57.920> go<00:02:58.459> on

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
this little guy around here and go on

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.759 
this little guy around here and go on
the<00:02:58.760> hunt<00:02:58.970> for<00:02:59.060> what<00:02:59.840> makes<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.260> snare<00:03:00.500> sound

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
the hunt for what makes the snare sound

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.970 
the hunt for what makes the snare sound
super<00:03:01.010> fat<00:03:01.489> make<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.600> tighter<00:03:02.870> queue<00:03:03.319> and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
super fat make it a tighter queue and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:16.449 
super fat make it a tighter queue and
let's<00:03:04.190> go<00:03:04.370> boosting<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.980> now<00:03:16.130> we're<00:03:16.280> getting

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
let's go boosting so now we're getting

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.740 
let's go boosting so now we're getting
away<00:03:16.549> from<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.970> fatness<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:23.239> sounds<00:03:23.570> pretty

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
away from the fatness that sounds pretty

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:32.170 
away from the fatness that sounds pretty
good<00:03:25.420> getting<00:03:26.420> away<00:03:26.660> from<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:27.049> there<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:31.280> 2:22

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
good getting away from it there so 2:22

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.720 
good getting away from it there so 2:22
let's<00:03:32.840> make<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:33.200> our<00:03:33.260> phat<00:03:33.590> frequency<00:03:34.160> I'm

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
let's make that our phat frequency I'm

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.090 
let's make that our phat frequency I'm
going<00:03:34.850> to<00:03:34.910> dial<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.329> back<00:03:35.390> down<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.440> under<00:03:36.829> 6

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
going to dial this back down to under 6

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.650 
going to dial this back down to under 6
dB<00:03:37.600> smooth<00:03:38.600> out<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.900> more<00:03:39.489> natural<00:03:40.489> EQ<00:03:41.329> curve

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
dB smooth out a more natural EQ curve

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:50.740 
dB smooth out a more natural EQ curve
here<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:42.880> take<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.910> listen<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.209> that<00:03:49.750> alright

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
here and take a listen to that alright

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.080 
here and take a listen to that alright
and<00:03:50.959> then<00:03:51.109> since<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.680> have<00:03:51.980> increased<00:03:52.910> the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
and then since I have increased the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.670 
and then since I have increased the
volume<00:03:53.299> substantially<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.260> can<00:03:54.410> see<00:03:54.560> the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
volume substantially you can see the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.740 
volume substantially you can see the
output<00:03:54.829> up<00:03:55.280> top<00:03:55.489> was<00:03:55.700> not<00:03:55.850> matching<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.269> input

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
output up top was not matching the input

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.599 
output up top was not matching the input
and<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.829> we<00:03:58.070> talked<00:03:58.250> about<00:03:58.340> yesterday

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
and so like we talked about yesterday

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.250 
and so like we talked about yesterday
with<00:03:59.000> game<00:03:59.209> matching<00:03:59.570> I'm<00:03:59.690> going<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.870> dial<00:04:00.079> the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
with game matching I'm going to dial the

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:19.420 
with game matching I'm going to dial the
output<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.680> this<00:04:00.890> EQ<00:04:01.280> down<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.730> match

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.830 

all<00:04:20.430> right<00:04:20.580> little<00:04:20.820> closer<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.360> the<00:04:21.720> last

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
all right little closer so the last

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:44.180 
all right little closer so the last
bypass<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.500> see<00:04:22.650> what<00:04:22.770> we've<00:04:22.860> done<00:04:42.950> it's<00:04:43.950> real

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
bypass to see what we've done it's real

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.950 
bypass to see what we've done it's real
simple<00:04:44.460> it's<00:04:44.910> about<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.300> same<00:04:45.480> volume<00:04:45.780> but

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
simple it's about the same volume but

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.440 
simple it's about the same volume but
now<00:04:46.140> we<00:04:46.200> have<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.410> rounder<00:04:47.010> fatter<00:04:47.670> tone<00:04:48.150> on<00:04:48.360> the

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
now we have a rounder fatter tone on the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.390 
now we have a rounder fatter tone on the
snare<00:04:48.720> drum<00:04:48.780> which<00:04:49.410> is<00:04:49.440> now<00:04:49.740> primed<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.340> ready

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
snare drum which is now primed and ready

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.610 
snare drum which is now primed and ready
for<00:04:50.670> some<00:04:50.970> compression<00:04:51.360> if<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.110> choose<00:04:52.410> to

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
for some compression if you so choose to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.830 
for some compression if you so choose to
do<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.190> there<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.490> fattening<00:04:54.150> up<00:04:54.390> a<00:04:54.540> snare

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
do so there it is fattening up a snare

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.960 
do so there it is fattening up a snare
drum<00:04:54.870> with<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.350> little<00:04:55.590> bit<00:04:55.710> of<00:04:55.770> EQ<00:04:56.160> carve<00:04:56.820> out

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
drum with a little bit of EQ carve out

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.420 
drum with a little bit of EQ carve out
what<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.210> don't<00:04:57.420> need<00:04:57.660> find<00:04:58.620> what<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:59.190> fat

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
what you don't need find what that fat

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.820 
what you don't need find what that fat
frequency<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.150> emphasize<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.110> bit<00:05:01.320> gain

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
frequency is emphasize it a bit gain

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.040 
frequency is emphasize it a bit gain
match<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.910> have<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.060> rounder<00:05:03.600> tone<00:05:03.870> it

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
match it and you have a rounder tone it

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.210 
match it and you have a rounder tone it
seems<00:05:04.290> like<00:05:04.470> you're<00:05:04.620> not<00:05:04.680> doing<00:05:04.980> a<00:05:05.040> lot<00:05:05.190> of

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
seems like you're not doing a lot of

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.280 
seems like you're not doing a lot of
drastic<00:05:05.520> EQ<00:05:06.150> but<00:05:06.360> then<00:05:06.510> when<00:05:06.630> you<00:05:06.690> bypass<00:05:07.080> it

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
drastic EQ but then when you bypass it

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.690 
drastic EQ but then when you bypass it
you<00:05:07.350> realize<00:05:07.680> you've<00:05:07.830> taken<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> long<00:05:08.460> way

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
you realize you've taken it a long way

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.550 
you realize you've taken it a long way
