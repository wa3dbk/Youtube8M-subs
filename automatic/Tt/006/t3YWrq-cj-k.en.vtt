sugar goes and I say no no I want a

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.710 
sugar goes and I say no no I want a
break<00:03:44.130> on<00:03:44.370> your<00:03:44.549> blood<00:03:44.730> sugar<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.209> throw<00:03:45.569> an

avocado in I throw some protein in
that's<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.090> break<00:03:48.389> it<00:03:48.569> brings<00:03:48.870> down<00:03:49.139> your

your<00:03:53.340> system<00:03:53.579> slowly<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.560> key<00:03:55.680> to

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
your system slowly that is the key to

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:56.690 
your system slowly that is the key to
weight<00:03:55.889> loss<00:03:55.950> right<00:03:56.340> there

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
weight loss right there

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.069 
weight loss right there
it's<00:03:56.819> not<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> mathematical<00:03:57.450> thing<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:57.989> not

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
it's not a mathematical thing it's not

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.440 
it's not a mathematical thing it's not
calories<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.620> calories<00:03:58.769> out<00:03:59.069> right<00:03:59.519> so<00:04:00.150> you're

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
calories in calories out right so you're

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.420 
calories in calories out right so you're
adding<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.079> fat<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.980> whole<00:04:02.160> grain<00:04:02.400> or

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
adding the fat to the whole grain or

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.520 
adding the fat to the whole grain or
you're<00:04:02.700> just<00:04:02.730> doing<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.180> fat<00:04:03.389> either<00:04:03.959> or<00:04:04.380> if

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
you're just doing the fat either or if

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.470 
you're just doing the fat either or if
you<00:04:04.620> have<00:04:04.889> our<00:04:05.069> grains<00:04:05.549> have<00:04:06.090> whole<00:04:06.269> grains

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
you have our grains have whole grains

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.160 
you have our grains have whole grains
you'll<00:04:06.660> still<00:04:06.810> lose<00:04:06.989> weight

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
you'll still lose weight

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.349 
you'll still lose weight
make<00:04:07.650> sure<00:04:07.829> you<00:04:07.950> slap<00:04:08.459> some<00:04:08.700> fat<00:04:08.940> or<00:04:09.180> some

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
make sure you slap some fat or some

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.849 
make sure you slap some fat or some
protein<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:09.870> there<00:04:10.049> because<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.410> slows<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
protein on there because it slows the

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.920 
protein on there because it slows the
entry<00:04:11.130> into<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.400> bloodstream<00:04:11.579> good<00:04:12.209> point

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
entry into the bloodstream good point

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.870 
entry into the bloodstream good point
okay<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.680> last<00:04:13.980> thing<00:04:14.160> for<00:04:14.430> weight<00:04:14.549> loss<00:04:14.730> is

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
okay the last thing for weight loss is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.029 
okay the last thing for weight loss is
get<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> buddy<00:04:15.359> and<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:16.380> know<00:04:16.500> when<00:04:16.680> when<00:04:16.919> I'm

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
get a buddy and you know when when I'm

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.770 
get a buddy and you know when when I'm
working<00:04:17.400> one-on-one<00:04:17.549> with<00:04:17.820> people<00:04:18.120> or<00:04:18.630> we're

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
working one-on-one with people or we're

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.870 
working one-on-one with people or we're
doing<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.049> on<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.380> city<00:04:19.620> line<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:20.459> research

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
doing it on that city line the research

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.070 
doing it on that city line the research
shows<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.239> if<00:04:21.539> you're<00:04:21.630> working<00:04:21.840> with<00:04:21.959> a

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
shows that if you're working with a

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.900 
shows that if you're working with a
buddy<00:04:22.349> or<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.740> group<00:04:22.950> you're<00:04:23.520> is
