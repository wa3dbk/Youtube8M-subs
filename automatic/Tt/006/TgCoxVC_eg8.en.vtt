 But I'm afraid you're worried about the beads. 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:52.020

 There's a rumor that it's armed . 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:49.060
 They know they're Kim. They share the armed forces that have stood up to the Blue House. 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:53.520

 There are several meaningful crime groups. 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.920

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:46.790
 But 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.330
 If the kit does this reckless thing, 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.830

 Please choose your worry. 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.280
