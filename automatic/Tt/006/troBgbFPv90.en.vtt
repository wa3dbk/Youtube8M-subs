00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.130
 and we are again going to do 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.230
 pickled peppers 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.690
 it can also be the carrot collection 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.420
 a lot and this I have if more 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.790
 clarito are the ideal ones to finish 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.960
 here we have a pretty glass jar 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.029
 big 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.130
 we will take the foundations that we have 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.489
 washed and dried and we will cut them 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.489
 tip 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.920
 dance would place us 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.920
 that's the tip 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.570
 to deliver the trip 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.370
 this trick this 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.809
 taught to someone this will only be my 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.659
 father with him was little my father who in 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.000
 peace rest I saw it do then 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.000
 I had always stayed with this but 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.270
 because it cuts the tip 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.660
 and then clear the vinegar that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.040
 our most and then they look great and 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.040
 he did many many 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.890
 we have the last pot minus 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.750
 we will need 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.880
 so let's think 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.159
 we are going to put there and this we are going to 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.700
 put into action 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.700
 yes 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.850
 A) Yes 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.330
 and this we are going to put here lying down 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.710
 OK 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.710
 and today we are going to take salt 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.469
 and a lot with the vinegar 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.469
 White wine vinegar 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:09.000
 This one that is conserved discards water 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.420
 but the thing about him has to be wide 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.950
 now 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.209
 we fill the boat 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.360
 if it took a liter because this boat 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.360
 big 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.270
 He gets along very well because he's from 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.630
 asparagus 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:34.820
 large ones that I sold in I bought them for 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.820
 Christmas remembering the truth 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.880
 and it is already 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.450
 and we close well 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.450
 A) Yes 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.360
 It's okay, it's already 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.260
 this 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.270
 one month 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.020
 from here one month you are eating 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:20.570
 similar foundations 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.570
 for the delicious appetizer 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.440
 I will go checking if you are a bomb 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.170
 is that you had not closed it well 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.670
 but if you do not have to give them and the month is 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.160
 can eat with friends here I leave you another 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.790
 little thing 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.790
 until another
