today I'm going to demonstrate how to

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.420 
today I'm going to demonstrate how to
dive<00:00:03.030> stream<00:00:03.330> from<00:00:03.570> your<00:00:03.810> iOS<00:00:04.230> device<00:00:05.220> to

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
dive stream from your iOS device to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.270 
dive stream from your iOS device to
chromecast<00:00:06.060> so<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.319> couch<00:00:08.130> I'm

chromecast so this is the couch I'm
holding<00:00:16.070> here<00:00:17.330> and<00:00:18.330> then<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> connected<00:00:52.760> so

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
holding here and then it is connected so

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
holding here and then it is connected so
choose<00:00:55.980> any<00:00:56.160> server<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.059> content<00:00:57.629> from

going to stream live stream from camera
to<00:01:10.920> web<00:01:11.670> server<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.290> web<00:01:13.470> server

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
to web server and then that web server

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.109 
to web server and then that web server
will<00:01:14.010> send<00:01:14.250> his<00:01:14.340> team<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.670> chromecast

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
will send his team to the chromecast

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.560

some dinner as the content from my else
device<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:20.150> being<00:02:20.450> transferred<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> media

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
device is being transferred to media

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.140 
device is being transferred to media
server<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.010> then<00:02:22.310> from<00:02:22.520> media<00:02:22.760> server<00:02:23.030> to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
server and then from media server to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.090 
server and then from media server to
chromecast<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.320> there<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.590> some<00:02:24.770> Network

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
chromecast so there is some Network

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.070 
chromecast so there is some Network
latency<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.880> conversion<00:02:26.540> from<00:02:27.020> frames

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
latency and the conversion from frames

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.910 
latency and the conversion from frames
so<00:02:30.080> as<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:31.700> can<00:02:31.850> see<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.270> can<00:02:32.570> they<00:02:33.110> pause<00:02:33.560> the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
divided mixin have hidden now so the cat

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.860 
divided mixin have hidden now so the cat
is<00:03:09.050> much<00:03:09.590> clearer<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:12.380> that's<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.600> can<00:03:14.600> pause

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
is much clearer so that's it I can pause

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.010 
is much clearer so that's it I can pause
from<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.380> choice<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.570> stream<00:03:17.570> is<00:03:17.690> going<00:03:17.870> to

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
from a choice and stream is going to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.760 
from a choice and stream is going to
post<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:21.020> content<00:03:21.350> which<00:03:21.470> has<00:03:21.500> been
