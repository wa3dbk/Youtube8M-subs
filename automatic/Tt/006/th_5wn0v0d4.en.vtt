00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello my friends how are they good today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.700
 when you watch videos on the internet from 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.400
 young titans is one of my cartoons 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.950
 favorite of childhood after a 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.870
 I thought about this if rabbani star fire 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.730
 fight who would win and good to that 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.920
 came the idea for this video in which 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.750
 I will analyze both characters and in the end 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.300
 I will say who in my staff would earn good 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.010
 I will start by analyzing star fire star 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 fire is a girl of extraterrestrial race 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.810
 of real blood in a few words is a 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.939
 princess so to speak comes from a 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.590
 planet called tamarÃ¡n is a planet 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.120
 that is millions of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.950
 kilometers of the earth when its 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.140
 planet was attacked by another race 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.059
 alien was imprisoned but for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.100
 luck this one managed to escape and took as 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.230
 new home to the land after having 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.210
 known to young titans this is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.460
 he decides to join and is part of the team 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 his powers are to shoot spheres of 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.840
 stellar fire by the hands shoot 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.640
 eye lasers fly based on the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.649
 solar and ultraviolet energy what 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.719
 it also allows you not only to fly in the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.340
 earth but in space it also has 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.020
 superhuman strength that next to the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.239
 hand-to-hand fighting training 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.790
 that he had on the planet or face makes 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.659
 a very strong rival now let's continue with 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.509
 raven my weight 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.310
 favorite of the young titans raven is 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.319
 by far one of the most 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.329
 mysterious and dark in the comics of 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:17.700
 efe unlike the other characters 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.560
 this girl is not normal was born in a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.079
 dimension called chance to one dimension 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.909
 dark and destroyed she is the daughter of 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.069
 a mestiza of chance to you of a super 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.929
 interdimensional demon called trigon 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.340
 one of the most powerful villains in the 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.709
 series unlike the others 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.479
 characters the powers of raven are something 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.429
 complex this is because their powers 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.170
 they are based on their emotions and can 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.599
 get to be triggered between your 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.000
 powers she possesses telekinesis can 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:44.219
 throw rays move and manipulate objects and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.989
 people fly that yes unlike 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.509
 star file this one can not fly in the 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:50.759
 space can go through walls can 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.069
 heal wounds can create shields open 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.530
 portals and you can use various tricks of 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.329
 dark magic and white good now I will give 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.829
 my opinion about who would win in a 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.390
 fight remember as I said 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.670
 previously this is my opinion 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.700
 staff in my personal raven would win 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.319
 very, very easy for various reasons 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.479
 number one raven have many techniques 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.370
 and superpowers both defensive and of 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.870
 star attack unlike fire that 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.879
 only has attack 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.680
 number 2 raven is very but very list by 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.810
 please anyone knows this she always 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.030
 he spends reading books and meditating 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.799
 you also have to remember that unlike 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.720
 of the others when terra returned to the 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.909
 young titans this was the only one 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.950
 I suspect and in the end all your suspicions 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.989
 they were true and also that there is that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.879
 time when she managed to cheat that 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.099
 clown are bosc or even though she 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.260
 I was turned into a rabbit without power 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.360
 use their powers and also being 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.129
 very close to death yes raven will fight 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.079
 with star fire in case this one 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.660
 I was in a dangerous location 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.579
 I would think of a plan to give you an advantage and 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.349
 number 3 and final is that be file a 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.480
 Raven difference is very good and 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.129
 tender has already happened that in more than one 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.049
 occasion when he meets a 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.329
 villain asks you to please surrender 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.250
 to avoid fighting but this only causes 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.170
 that the villain flee or attack something that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.760
 happened with one of the droids is that of 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.739
 When she fought with Earth she went 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.750
 tricked by his tricks thinking that 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.700
 she did not want to hurt him and when in 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.769
 truth just took advantage of this and by 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.019
 little dies star file unlike 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.090
 raven she is very cold and calculating that 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.639
 in a fight she of the first blows 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.319
 it's not something that surprises too much besides 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.239
 Raven releases her dark side 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.189
 evil can come not only to defeat 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.650
 to star fire very easily too 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.659
 I could kill her if she is neglected but 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.549
 good that can be expected from a girl 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.349
 demon also here will clarify that the 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.239
 powers of star files are based on 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.549
 emotions of happiness so if 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.980
 during the fight it becomes sad or 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.930
 depressed can get to weaken good 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.879
 as I said earlier this is my 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.799
 personal opinion if someone thinks 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.569
 different or have another theory just 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.400
 write it in the comments but 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.499
 do it without writing of 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.689
 negative way if you want res but you 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:53.189
 you must first have it good that's all 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:57.530
 I say goodbye I hope you liked it 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.530
 the video says goodbye by blocking 20
