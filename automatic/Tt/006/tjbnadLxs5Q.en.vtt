 i take water from under the filter always 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.760
 just from under the filter 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:32.189
 triple try well like the maximum 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:37.730
 value so that the heater is covered 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:41.760
 the water heater itself is already full marks and 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 once said to clean it well, I am no more 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:57.000

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.520
 water level 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.530
 once the water level is critical she 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.790
 either disconnects by itself 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.509
 stops burning 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.350
 or you can add water using 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.350
 filling device 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.110
 double boiler plugged in I did 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.730
 one level so i have a double boiler with 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:46.140
 two levels and turn on time 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:50.940
 cooking about 50 5 minutes 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.920
 Approximately the mass here is indicated for 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:59.490
 how much is cooked 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:01.350
 hens until 1525 the moment we stayed standing 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.110
 a little bit more time is indicated in 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:10.310
 instructions all timer will shut down be 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.020
 indicator lights up 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.959
 as soon as and if water decreases that 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.860
 the indicator goes out 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.500
 automatically suitably double boiler 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.580
 turns off until you give water like 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.180
 just in the water removal then the barbarian again 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.750
 starts working until time runs out 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.570
 when time runs out such 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.290
 Easy elephant about broadcasting about that 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.600
 double boiler 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.830
 finished work you can see that the double boiler 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.530
 I began to work here went 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.070
 quietly go steam has already gone dark 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.070
 glass 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.800
 Now food steam will be prepared 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.750
