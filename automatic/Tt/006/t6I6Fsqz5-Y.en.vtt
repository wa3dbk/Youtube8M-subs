 yes Wild Wings will be whoever believes does not matter 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.410
 but I do not know that must be clear to them 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.400
 while the Israelis did not just move with quotes with my company 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.530
 why did they then shut me up and used to persecute me? 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.210
 That was not only a lot of pursuers that remained, she meant 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.080

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.350
 that it was right 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.619
 why could the Germans outweigh the dust by more than 90 percent 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.360
 in Saxony minus five degrees 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.230

 I never heard anything from her 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
 why only the Germans are not interested in education 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.640
 the interest in the rbs daughter RBS Sempra has just been in the assumption 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.620

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.340
 tell them two facts 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.610

 about respect as today that is fact 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.049
 But not only that 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.179

 94 and Vettel 90 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.789

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.049
 5 percent die it would be nice or not 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.029
 he sang it to me, why did the 98 percent have to 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.179
 20 seabed 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:47.819

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.469
 I still have questions 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:54.609
 this is not a team 6 of course the statistics have given 48% 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.549

 Kolat hopes that now I wanted him out of it was neatly her 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.290
 should on behalf of the dpa "Why are the German I am the same 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.409
 superior to the Israelis 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.229
 that they were gone again 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.229
 well the same question he will get in Germany 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.800
 It's a big role we will be producing or around 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.829
 first time 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.419
 that's easy now 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:39.669

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.229

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.709
 Stephan Hornberger 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.709
 because I guess those are in Germany maybe 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.299
 hundred thousand 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.810

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.039
 next to pretty cheap 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.850
 AMA Billen after all, as dignified right always faster 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.370
 but I mean neighbors 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.370
 Answer me this one 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.849
 the Steelers are not wanted to answer them

 These goals are not to be met by our main accused September 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.749
 Problem is that this also succeeds not work we do not have to do it 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.339
 the first 38 percent is in Germany 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.339

 that's why I finally made it today was based on how 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.009
 Here another way to have received met 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.710
