00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
because it's a robo Gator it might not

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.620 
because it's a robo Gator it might not
work<00:02:04.170> properly<00:02:04.709> but<00:02:05.220> if<00:02:05.459> you<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.420> for

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
work properly but if you use it for

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.669 
work properly but if you use it for
something<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.250> call<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.679> definitely

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
something like a call it definitely

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.010 
something like a call it definitely
works<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.390> shooter<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.800> shootable<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:14.430> worked

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
works on shooter a shootable it worked
