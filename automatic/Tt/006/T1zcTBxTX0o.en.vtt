at three of the map sponges created
using<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> port<00:00:45.690> first<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.829> an<00:00:46.950> old<00:00:47.070> friend

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340

actually a hybrid of Blood Gulch and its
successor<00:00:51.629> coagulation<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> intent<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
successor coagulation but the intent is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.220 
successor coagulation but the intent is
the<00:00:53.489> same<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.360> map<00:00:54.600> made<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.050> Team

one<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> slightly<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.219> complex<00:01:02.670> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
one is a slightly more complex and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.369 
one is a slightly more complex and
intriguing<00:01:03.149> version<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> classic<00:01:03.960> map

essentially most of the layout is the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
essentially most of the layout is the
