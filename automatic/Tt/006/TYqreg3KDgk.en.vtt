00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello everyone, today I would like to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.560
 make a comparison between the two very 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.670
 cool very popular shooters 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.299
 such as cs go and warfess I tried 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.940
 be 100% objective 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.880
 no personal factors to this 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.260
 the structure will not affect well of course in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.380
 comments there are people who 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.140
 steal your opinion but it is normal and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.929
 everyone should have an opinion but 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.000
 my video I express my opinion and if 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.079
 you agree with him you can just 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 write in the comments that went well 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.340
 graphics both games became available for 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.090
 players in 2012 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.879
 but vx even for those years raf was not 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.379
 dries but in our thousand fifteenth year 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.760
 she is not a cafe kingdom now warface 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.300
 2012 the game received an award for 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.640
 the best graphics and now it is on the level 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.520
 drawing weapons cards equipment all 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.010
 made by 100 points of claims be not 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.920
 maybe warface is a clear leader 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.290
 therefore, 1 point goes away 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.530
 it has gameplay 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.210
 what's warfare rate cutting with control and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.080
 physics has always been simple and clear 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.750
 and there is an enemy you need to kill but the atmosphere 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.810
 both north attract every day 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.380

 cases of steam and does not affect 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.330
 weapon characteristics 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.810
 You can both buy and sell them. 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.130
 marketplace varfeys it free 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.220
 multiplayer game 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.140
 which can play absolutely anyone 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.040

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.519
 real currency and luck boxes 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.610
 weapons for a while are like weapons for 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.760
 warbaks game currency and here are the boxed 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.160
 ways that can both choose and no 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.230
 most often surpass conventional weapons in 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.840
 characteristics that is is 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.989
 imbalance is also on solution for 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.160
 loans and skins on the characters who are neither 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.010
 not looking at anything 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.289
 home conclusion is obvious no cross 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.200
 need to invest money in the game 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:25.460
 apart from the cost of the game therefore 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.710
 for donat I give this game a residence in 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.320
 both games meet and arm shields and 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.250
 otherworldly wire for online games 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.960
 It's okay everyday but struggle 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.390
 with them is conducted around the clock 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.580
 first the realization of these two games of accounts 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.290
 it became much less and time to 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.520
 get sick of any player 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:50.800
 the one on the right is much smaller 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:53.510
 so in this round no one's sounds 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.120
 Sounds of great importance in shooters 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.940
 after all during to hear in close gang 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.510
 any rustling and any sound is a pledge 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.910
 survival that warfare darn with all sounds 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.630
 performed perfectly if you can listen 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.510
 you definitely will not be killed back for voice acting 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.980
 food on each team by gender that is 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.110
 draw communication players 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.510
 varfeysa to play with the GRU million 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.880
 and how nice I think I can 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.830
 talk to you favorite game invine and 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.240
 cover your back 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.750
 Facebook can get acquainted with the person 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.960
 right in the game using voice chat 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.640
 which in battle is of the utmost importance 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.860
 price tags and will always be able to give advice on 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.000
 the game and either said those gates 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.310
 but after the fight you can have a hearty talk 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.340
 Warface of the glottis bad work nothing 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.050
 I can't hear any hiss in general 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.180
 there is a written chat but sometimes say 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.100
 two or three words are much faster than theirs 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.169
 write but 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.210
 administration of the game contributes 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.940
 dating players through meetings 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.990
 fans of the game with admins in different cities 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.050
 and countries 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.050
 You can also collect a picture of your office and 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.389
 using a group in your mouth from VKontakte admin 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.210
 ff really promote dating 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.490
 players so the base communication goes to 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.130
 booth 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:21.160
 bugs and lags as if they were trying to find 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:24.940
 any card card bugs 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.070
 murals I never found them on the texture 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.729
 here they can only get it from 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.790
 mines in this game I play already furious and for 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.919
 all this time I haven't had one 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:39.820
 Ping sags even if I recorded 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:42.669
 no lags and no bugs 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.460
 famous for its gods and some eyes 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.840
 YouTube even make their selection after 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.139
 each one in the game appear 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.350
 various bugs phrase i have three 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:55.510
 Compass a little more often than I did headshot 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.610
 every month on different maps 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.580
 found a variety of plague 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.770
 which interfere with the normal game type 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.610
 card exits or passage through 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.610
 textures 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:15.310
 so base 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.930
 and bugs and lags and give well well here and 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.080
 it's time to take stock 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.430
 both clays took 6 points each 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.220
 it can say that everyone is here 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:28.180
 rigged what kind of plays is 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:30.400
 better than the other and principle in each 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.690
 gray your pros and your cons what you 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.849
 more like natural to decide 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.729
 only you do not listen to the opinion 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:39.190
 other YouTube can be other people 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:41.650
 play in these two games can not not do 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.569
 worthy and which one you like best 

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.120
