this<00:03:39.840> game<00:03:39.990> was<00:03:40.140> really<00:03:40.260> short<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:41.310> was<00:03:41.430> a

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
this game was really short it was a

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.280 
this game was really short it was a
under<00:03:42.300> five<00:03:42.480> minutes<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.930> think<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.140> was<00:03:43.230> like

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
under five minutes I think it was like

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.350 
under five minutes I think it was like
440<00:03:43.860> or<00:03:43.980> something<00:03:44.250> like<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.580> just<00:03:44.790> because

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
440 or something like that just because

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.110 
440 or something like that just because
of<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:46.170> know<00:03:46.200> 57<00:03:46.920> kills<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.430> pretty<00:03:47.970> much

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
of you know 57 kills that pretty much

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.910 
of you know 57 kills that pretty much
ends<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.510> game<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.989> know<00:03:49.080> 18<00:03:49.440> other<00:03:49.590> kills

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
ends the game you know 18 other kills

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.860 
ends the game you know 18 other kills
happened<00:03:50.580> in<00:03:50.670> this<00:03:50.790> whole<00:03:51.030> game<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.600> was

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
happened in this whole game so I was

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.229 
happened in this whole game so I was
just<00:03:51.900> running<00:03:52.230> up<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.590> down<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.950> place<00:03:53.940> and

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
just running up and down the place and

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.530 
just running up and down the place and
it<00:03:54.989> was<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:55.320> quick<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.920> had<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.520> Huey<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.450> know

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
dog combination and I think that's the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.190 
dog combination and I think that's the
most<00:03:59.400> epic<00:03:59.580> combination<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.330> this<00:04:00.420> game<00:04:00.660> when

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
most epic combination in this game when

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.600 
most epic combination in this game when
