00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
going to have to be returned to google

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.900 
going to have to be returned to google
it<00:00:36.420> has<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> bad<00:00:36.930> screen<00:00:37.500> there's<00:00:38.340> been<00:00:38.489> lots<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it has a bad screen there's been lots of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.220 
it has a bad screen there's been lots of
news<00:00:39.059> about<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.450> floating<00:00:39.809> around<00:00:39.930> but

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
news about that floating around but

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
news about that floating around but
apparently<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.920> happened<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> lot<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> folks

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
apparently it happened to a lot of folks

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.490 
apparently it happened to a lot of folks
so<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.180> figured<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> might<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:42.809> well<00:00:42.930> unbox<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.959 
so I figured I might as well unbox this
one<00:00:43.710> before<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.010> give<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> away<00:00:44.340> make<00:00:44.610> sure<00:00:44.760> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
one before I give it away make sure that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.810 
one before I give it away make sure that
the<00:00:45.090> screen<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.420> okay<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.860> also

Google ships it to me let's see 1
gigabyte<00:03:38.579> of<00:03:38.730> ram<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.269> has<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.750> quad-core

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
gigabyte of ram it has the quad-core

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.530 
gigabyte of ram it has the quad-core
Tegra<00:03:40.590> 3<00:03:40.620> processor<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.359> going<00:03:42.480> to

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
Tegra 3 processor so this is going to

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.440 
Tegra 3 processor so this is going to
fly<00:03:42.930> especially<00:03:43.200> with<00:03:43.709> jelly<00:03:43.980> bean<00:03:44.450> it's

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
fly especially with jelly bean it's

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.520 
fly especially with jelly bean it's
already<00:03:45.600> telling<00:03:45.900> me<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.109> I<00:03:46.170> have<00:03:46.319> low

already telling me that I have low
batteries<00:03:46.980> we<00:03:47.400> will<00:03:47.609> kind<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.569> go<00:03:48.690> through

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
batteries we will kind of go through

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.650 
batteries we will kind of go through
here<00:03:49.670> but<00:03:50.670> anyways<00:03:50.970> what<00:03:51.180> kind<00:03:51.329> of<00:03:51.389> look<00:03:51.540> at

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
here but anyways what kind of look at

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.920 
here but anyways what kind of look at
this<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.940> biggest<00:03:54.120> thing<00:03:54.299> here<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.750> the

this so the biggest thing here is the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.979 
this so the biggest thing here is the
tremendously<00:03:55.590> large<00:03:55.889> battery<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.459> it's<00:03:56.989> 4325

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
tremendously large battery so it's 4325

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.140 
tremendously large battery so it's 4325
milliamps<00:03:58.799> that's<00:03:59.370> going<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.609> be<00:03:59.730> good<00:03:59.880> for

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
milliamps that's going to be good for

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.750 
milliamps that's going to be good for
nine<00:04:00.329> hours<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.780> HD<00:04:01.380> video<00:04:01.620> playback<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.370> I

just<00:05:49.900> don't<00:05:50.020> think<00:05:50.170> you<00:05:50.260> can<00:05:50.290> beat<00:05:50.590> it<00:05:51.000> curious

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
just don't think you can beat it curious

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.640 
just don't think you can beat it curious
to<00:05:52.120> see<00:05:52.240> what<00:05:52.420> Apple's<00:05:52.780> coming<00:05:53.080> out<00:05:53.200> with<00:05:53.410> what

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
to see what Apple's coming out with what

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.930 
to see what Apple's coming out with what
they're<00:05:53.770> miniature<00:05:54.130> tablet<00:05:54.580> but<00:05:54.670> I<00:05:54.730> still

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
they're miniature tablet but I still

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.130 
they're miniature tablet but I still
think<00:05:55.090> it's<00:05:55.210> going<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.360> be<00:05:55.420> way<00:05:55.690> above<00:05:55.870> the

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
think it's going to be way above the

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.260 
think it's going to be way above the
price<00:05:56.350> point<00:05:56.680> I<00:05:56.830> don't<00:05:57.640> think<00:05:57.790> it<00:05:58.000> will<00:05:58.120> be

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
price point I don't think it will be

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.030 
price point I don't think it will be
able<00:05:58.390> to<00:05:58.600> beat<00:05:58.750> this<00:05:58.960> in<00:05:59.170> my<00:05:59.470> opinion<00:05:59.740> and<00:05:59.950> this
