00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
bins as you can see that just hold a

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.490 
bins as you can see that just hold a
bunch<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.400> things<00:04:49.580> so<00:04:50.540> we'll<00:04:50.900> come<00:04:51.080> up<00:04:51.110> back<00:04:51.320> up

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
bunch of things so we'll come up back up

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.630 
bunch of things so we'll come up back up
here<00:04:52.000> we<00:04:53.000> will<00:04:53.270> go<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:54.320> backyard<00:04:54.580> now<00:04:55.580> the

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
here we will go to the backyard now the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.950 
here we will go to the backyard now the
backyard<00:04:56.030> just<00:04:56.090> probably<00:04:56.330> changed<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.750> most

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
backyard just probably changed the most

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.950 
backyard just probably changed the most
data<00:04:57.520> there<00:04:58.520> this<00:04:58.940> was<00:04:59.210> just<00:04:59.510> like<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.660> little

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
data there this was just like a little

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.870 
data there this was just like a little
pool<00:05:00.200> and<00:05:00.560> then<00:05:00.740> it<00:05:00.860> stopped<00:05:01.160> but<00:05:01.460> now<00:05:01.640> it's

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
pool and then it stopped but now it's

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.560 
pool and then it stopped but now it's
like<00:05:02.000> a<00:05:02.120> patio<00:05:03.490> thus<00:05:04.490> close<00:05:04.760> stones<00:05:05.030> there<00:05:05.270> for

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
like a patio thus close stones there for

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.409 
like a patio thus close stones there for
like<00:05:05.750> night<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.710> can't<00:05:06.979> see<00:05:07.130> crap<00:05:07.490> so<00:05:07.850> I<00:05:08.060> just

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
like night you can't see crap so I just

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.030 
like night you can't see crap so I just
put<00:05:08.479> it<00:05:08.720> there<00:05:08.870> so<00:05:09.140> that's<00:05:09.380> not<00:05:09.590> going<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.830> stay

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
put it there so that's not going to stay

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.250 
put it there so that's not going to stay
there<00:05:10.250> maybe<00:05:11.210> I'll<00:05:11.360> implement<00:05:11.720> it<00:05:11.990> eventually

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
there maybe I'll implement it eventually

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.460 
there maybe I'll implement it eventually
so<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.830> looks<00:05:13.070> better<00:05:13.340> at<00:05:13.580> least<00:05:14.020> ice<00:05:15.020> because

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
so it looks better at least ice because

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.740 
so it looks better at least ice because
i<00:05:15.560> live<00:05:15.740> in<00:05:15.770> half<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.250> snow<00:05:16.370> biome<00:05:16.820> so<00:05:17.360> it<00:05:17.510> just

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
i live in half of snow biome so it just

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.930 
i live in half of snow biome so it just
keeps<00:05:18.200> coming<00:05:18.440> back<00:05:18.470> i<00:05:18.740> can't<00:05:18.950> get<00:05:19.070> rid<00:05:19.220> of<00:05:19.250> it

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
keeps coming back i can't get rid of it
