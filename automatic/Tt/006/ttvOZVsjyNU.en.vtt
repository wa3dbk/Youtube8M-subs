00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello everyone, today I want with you 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.509
 share a new product in the field 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.730
 phone protection can no longer be 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.620
 use ordinary standard covers 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.840
 since there appeared a so -called 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.400
 vinyl stickers 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.190
 they are very thin but very 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.160
 durable and there are many colors 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.180
 I like on the site spent about 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.710
 usual time to choose 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.960
 the tour of the grid which is me the most 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.219
 liked this case, chose the answer 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.770
 snake skin if you show how 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.050
 This sticker is applied to the phone 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.469
 the first step we will process the phone with 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.850
 using a cloth to remove prints 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.950
 fingers any clogging there rag 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.600
 usually this is how we cars 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:59.059
 wipe any optical devices 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.160
 next we take the sticker itself 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.939
 separate it from the surface on which 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.939
 she sat remove various stubs 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:14.820
 which there may be for the camera given 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:19.049
 case for the badge by the way wanted to say 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.759
 that the stickers on the site are selected under 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.880
 phone model that is you need 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.220
 click on select phone model and with 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.579
 her on the color of the sticker and everything and you 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.200
 sent by mail here is such a sticker 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.600
 so now we put the sticker itself on 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.299
 phone surface is necessary 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.520
 Substitute so that the camera is not 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.000
 closed to the apple was there in 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.000
 size 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.190
 a sticker to have such a property that 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.530
 it does not immediately stick here you 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.110
 first and adjusts as you need to and 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:15.660
 then she 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:15.660
 proglazhivaetsya fingers and everything 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.140
 if you have bubbles stay something 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.629
 it doesn't matter either because there 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.760
 there are such 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.680
 so-called small holes for 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.439
 air outlet you just spend 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.680
 fingers through the air so which is there 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:43.129
 stayed and it comes out very quickly 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:51.840
 smooth your fingers and 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:54.150
 a cloth if in the future you want 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.870
 remove the sticker it is also very easy 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.790
 removed without leaving any traces 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:06.480
 we already tried it with another phone 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:11.450
 it's true well that's the principle of such 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.810
 we got the color of the phone now 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.730
 pretty enough the same we 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.680
 do with the front surface and 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.190
 side surfaces for this we have 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.449
 there are still stickers that were in 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.190
 Here we are finished with the front 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:34.739
 the panel 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:38.400
 now you run it now look 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:47.629
 how did we get the result front 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:47.629
 panel side panel back panel 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:58.769
 quite original pretty and 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.889
 the phone is as secure as 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.569
 protected by cover 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:07.400
