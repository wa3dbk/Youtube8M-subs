00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.319
 I will tell you today how times 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.380
 a decent citizen makes you beautiful 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.349
 with artwork as the first one 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.719
 important we need meat meat is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.580
 in our case chopped mixed nicely 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.949
 so that is nice and juicy 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.550
 and that's where we buy two directly 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.980
 kilo is enough for about six people 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.840
 if they eat normally or for three 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.689
 Eaten as we dare 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.840
 that's just 1.4 kilos per person 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.510
 which one could then displace for it is 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.430
 the citizen also so small so again 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.320
 to come back 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.230
 you do not have to do that in principle 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.520
 Edit much say the content is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.289
 Just come a few chopped up 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.199
 little onion 2 a bit panel and 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.059
 pepper salt from me from paprika powder 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.719
 chemistry depending on what he is on 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.910
 then it looks like this finished in shape 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.320
 your hand and only one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.180
 clarification me it would have to be separated 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.049
 why prepare them now, too 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.290
 baking sheet looks like that a kilo and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.640
 the second keynote at loan so quite 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.369
 It is important that we have two pallets 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.500
 But we want a real one here 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.770
 Citizens build really good burger 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.689
 that push now for the first time very comfortable 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 20 minutes in the oven and let it 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:29.970
 nice to cook and if that happens 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.250
 is it looks like they are now before I 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.400
 the tasty looking two giant 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.579
 We do not sprinkle bulets well 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.810
 with the finest gouda cheese or dana ever 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.299
 what you stand for 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.790
 important is proper cheese we have 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.070
 taken 200 grams per bulette speak 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.380
 such a small packet with the stuff there 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.259
 in there then the whole covered nicely 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.860
 alufoil and dedicate yourself to the others 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.920
 stuff 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.110
 the second point is the pizza 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.320
 she must now call in to be with her 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.360
 looks so nice after that and a good one 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.770
 book 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.190
 while the pizza bread are converse 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.179
 already to third puzzles of bacon 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.489
 must be in the tub 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.500
 also there goes the more the better 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.720
 at all 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.540
 problem pops just like us 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.860
 Two fat packets of bacon in the pan 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.260
 she sizzles nicely 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.900
 to make them look so delicious and then 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.180
 He takes out the pizza and packs it 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.010
 meat on top 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.200
 now you can already enjoy the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.800
 still garnish over the kindle 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 schÃ¶necker hamburger sauce on it and then 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.640
 the second situation meat because she sooooo 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.890
 looks delicious 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.120
 the third point for the vegetarians 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.700
 among you we thought about how 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.920
 small but a bit salad on it but 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.580
 not so much just that one from one 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.580
 side looks 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.140
 to the conclusion even more sauce more 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.730
 bacon and the lid on top and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.459
 you can also bun in between 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.340
 do and a few more onions and 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.560
 then the finished work looks finished 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.810
 but the curious mel gibson looks 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.900
 and sad because he is not such a citizen 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.510
 It also looks easy on the table 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.820
 just delicious but sometimes a 6 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.040
 5 for each rich that's just under 750 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.110
 gram 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.930
 yes, such a citizen is heavy and a lot 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.690
 in there and so on I hope she has 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.070
 right appetite I can get me 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.070
 namely now the last piece
