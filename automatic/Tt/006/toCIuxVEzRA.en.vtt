00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
synthetic gotta hear my lips um we're

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.300 
synthetic gotta hear my lips um we're
good<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:29.830> find<00:05:30.550> that<00:05:30.789> my<00:05:31.030> head<00:05:31.510> is<00:05:31.889> oddly<00:05:32.889> shaped

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
good I find that my head is oddly shaped
I<00:05:33.940> guess<00:05:34.180> on<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:34.690> sides<00:05:35.220> because<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.490> flaps

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
I guess on the sides because the flaps

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.740 
I guess on the sides because the flaps
will<00:05:37.780> never<00:05:38.169> lay<00:05:38.470> flat<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:39.099> flaps<00:05:39.880> no<00:05:40.539> matter

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
will never lay flat the flaps no matter

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.350 
will never lay flat the flaps no matter
how<00:05:41.050> tight<00:05:41.440> in<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.800> back<00:05:42.070> I<00:05:42.310> get<00:05:42.700> it<00:05:42.849> they

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
how tight in the back I get it they

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.800 
how tight in the back I get it they
always<00:05:43.870> will<00:05:44.440> just<00:05:44.710> stay<00:05:44.889> flapping<00:05:45.630> even<00:05:46.630> if<00:05:46.720> i

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
always will just stay flapping even if i

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.920 
always will just stay flapping even if i
put<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.110> combs<00:05:47.380> in<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:48.550> top<00:05:48.820> will<00:05:49.060> fit<00:05:49.330> okay

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
put the combs in the top will fit okay

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.500 
put the combs in the top will fit okay
and<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.860> back<00:05:51.070> will<00:05:51.280> fit<00:05:51.490> fine<00:05:51.729> but<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.240> sides

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
and the back will fit fine but the sides

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.330 
and the back will fit fine but the sides
will<00:05:52.690> freaking<00:05:53.050> flap<00:05:53.320> so<00:05:54.300> what<00:05:55.300> I<00:05:55.330> did<00:05:55.539> was<00:05:56.380> I

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
will freaking flap so what I did was I

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.420 
will freaking flap so what I did was I
just<00:05:57.550> put<00:05:58.120> a<00:05:58.389> piece<00:05:58.780> of<00:05:58.810> Walker<00:05:59.349> no<00:05:59.740> shine<00:06:00.070> tape

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
just put a piece of Walker no shine tape

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.920 
just put a piece of Walker no shine tape
here<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.380> on<00:06:02.380> both<00:06:02.650> sides<00:06:03.539> so<00:06:04.539> that<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:04.780> would

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
here and on both sides so that it would

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.950 
here and on both sides so that it would
hold<00:06:05.110> it<00:06:05.289> down<00:06:05.620> so<00:06:06.580> I'm<00:06:06.610> not<00:06:07.120> using<00:06:07.360> any<00:06:07.660> glue

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
hold it down so I'm not using any glue

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.980 
hold it down so I'm not using any glue
just<00:06:08.620> one<00:06:08.860> piece<00:06:09.160> of<00:06:09.220> tape<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.300> like<00:06:10.810> I<00:06:10.930> said

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
just one piece of tape and like I said

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.040 
just one piece of tape and like I said
I've<00:06:11.229> ever<00:06:11.440> did<00:06:11.800> just<00:06:12.789> to<00:06:12.910> tape<00:06:13.180> application

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
I've ever did just to tape application

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.900 
I've ever did just to tape application
so<00:06:14.770> we'll<00:06:15.400> have<00:06:15.520> to

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
so we'll have to

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.180 
so we'll have to
see<00:06:15.970> how<00:06:16.150> it<00:06:16.300> holds<00:06:16.510> up<00:06:16.870> especially<00:06:17.800> because<00:06:17.950> I

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
see how it holds up especially because I

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.390 
see how it holds up especially because I
work<00:06:18.460> out<00:06:18.900> six<00:06:19.900> days<00:06:20.020> a<00:06:20.170> week<00:06:20.290> right<00:06:20.440> now<00:06:20.770> so<00:06:21.370> I

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
work out six days a week right now so I

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.290 
work out six days a week right now so I
sweat<00:06:21.910> a<00:06:21.940> lot<00:06:22.920> so<00:06:23.920> we'll<00:06:24.490> have<00:06:24.580> to<00:06:24.760> see<00:06:24.790> how<00:06:25.000> the

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
sweat a lot so we'll have to see how the

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.860 
sweat a lot so we'll have to see how the
tape<00:06:25.720> holds<00:06:26.110> up<00:06:26.230> but<00:06:26.650> as<00:06:26.950> far<00:06:27.640> as<00:06:27.700> the<00:06:28.330> hair<00:06:28.630> and

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
tape holds up but as far as the hair and

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.720 
tape holds up but as far as the hair and
the<00:06:28.930> weight<00:06:29.350> goes<00:06:29.740> I<00:06:30.540> love<00:06:31.540> it<00:06:31.950> I<00:06:32.950> didn't

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
the weight goes I love it I didn't

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.610 
the weight goes I love it I didn't
really<00:06:33.880> do<00:06:34.000> anything<00:06:34.210> to<00:06:34.570> it<00:06:34.750> I'm<00:06:34.990> all<00:06:35.500> would

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.360 
did was tie it down load the scarf and i
just<00:06:40.870> rolled<00:06:41.140> it<00:06:41.320> up<00:06:41.380> in<00:06:41.560> a<00:06:41.590> bun<00:06:41.890> in<00:06:41.920> the<00:06:42.160> back

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
just rolled it up in a bun in the back

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.800 
just rolled it up in a bun in the back
and<00:06:42.640> just<00:06:42.790> took<00:06:42.910> it<00:06:42.970> out<00:06:43.090> so<00:06:43.270> it<00:06:43.360> just<00:06:43.540> had<00:06:43.660> like

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
and just took it out so it just had like

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.490 
and just took it out so it just had like
a<00:06:43.840> little<00:06:44.050> bit<00:06:44.290> of<00:06:44.380> a<00:06:44.470> wave<00:06:44.710> to<00:06:45.070> it<00:06:45.220> not<00:06:45.400> nothing

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
a little bit of a wave to it not nothing

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.190 
a little bit of a wave to it not nothing
much<00:06:47.820> so<00:06:48.820> that's<00:06:49.090> all<00:06:49.300> I<00:06:49.360> did<00:06:49.630> to<00:06:49.660> it<00:06:49.900> end<00:06:50.050> then

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
much so that's all I did to it end then

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.430 
much so that's all I did to it end then
I<00:06:50.260> just<00:06:50.440> kind<00:06:50.590> of<00:06:50.740> put<00:06:51.430> it<00:06:51.520> up<00:06:51.610> on<00:06:51.760> the<00:06:51.910> side<00:06:52.440> so

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
I just kind of put it up on the side so

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.480 
I just kind of put it up on the side so
I<00:06:53.470> didn't<00:06:53.890> curl<00:06:54.130> it<00:06:54.310> I<00:06:54.400> didn't<00:06:54.610> flat<00:06:54.820> iron<00:06:55.060> it

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
I didn't curl it I didn't flat iron it

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.180 
I didn't curl it I didn't flat iron it
anything<00:06:57.490> like<00:06:57.640> that<00:06:58.170> so<00:06:59.170> that's<00:06:59.530> it<00:06:59.710> has<00:07:00.040> the

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
anything like that so that's it has the

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.950 
anything like that so that's it has the
baby<00:07:00.340> ears<00:07:02.100> and<00:07:03.100> I<00:07:03.610> didn't<00:07:03.910> take<00:07:04.630> down<00:07:04.840> the

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
baby ears and I didn't take down the

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.200 
baby ears and I didn't take down the
back<00:07:05.140> I<00:07:05.410> just<00:07:05.710> taped<00:07:05.950> the<00:07:06.130> front<00:07:06.400> down<00:07:06.580> so<00:07:07.090> the

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
back I just taped the front down so the

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.080 
back I just taped the front down so the
back<00:07:07.390> fits<00:07:07.720> fine<00:07:08.020> with<00:07:08.380> just<00:07:08.410> the<00:07:08.770> band<00:07:09.430> and<00:07:09.790> I

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
back fits fine with just the band and I

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.670 
back fits fine with just the band and I
like<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:10.300> fact<00:07:10.450> that<00:07:10.660> it<00:07:10.840> has<00:07:11.050> that<00:07:11.350> because

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
like the fact that it has that because

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.770 
like the fact that it has that because
if<00:07:12.220> I<00:07:12.430> head<00:07:12.610> gets<00:07:12.820> hot<00:07:13.000> and<00:07:13.240> just<00:07:13.390> kind<00:07:13.540> of<00:07:13.570> left

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
if I head gets hot and just kind of left

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.280 
if I head gets hot and just kind of left
it<00:07:14.080> up<00:07:14.640> on<00:07:15.640> a<00:07:15.700> stocking<00:07:16.210> cap<00:07:16.240> starts<00:07:16.690> to<00:07:16.900> move<00:07:17.050> I
