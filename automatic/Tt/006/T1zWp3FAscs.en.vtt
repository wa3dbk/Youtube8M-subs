00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.000
 monseigneur philippe hello hello 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.890
 then you are responsible for the 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.169
 this parish the parish holy rita 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.840
 who is today threatened with 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.610
 destruction to make way for two 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.320
 car parks and social housing 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.570
 could you tell us one 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.260
 more about what led the parish 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.250
 without getting there 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.440
 this church was built in 1830 and 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.050
 then it was closed for 12 years 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.000
 and we took it back, that's 28 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.239
 years this month that we are in the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.130
 places we got on sale because 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.760
 this parish belongs to 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.530
 individuals who live in Switzerland and who 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.500
 have decided they have several churches 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.479
 of this kind and they want to sell them and 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.460
 so they did a real estate trick 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.700
 which they sold his a company 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.580
 estate agency and go to the case 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.500
 is there but we are offered nothing at all 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.720
 instead we are left like that 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.780
 do not know we'll go we do not propose 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.330
 church nor local so here is today 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.280
 we are very worried attendance 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.200
 this church in the day I have to little 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.080
 almost 100 to 150 people passing 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.789
 every day the ceremonies are very 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.649
 frequented a lot of weddings a lot 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.979
 of baten the burials unfortunately 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.300
 but that's the life of the church and so we 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.099
 is very worried because we already have 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.520
 a lot of weddings planned for this 

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:45.580
 summer 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.860
 baptisms and then it took 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.170
 question where we are going to land 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.990
 the company believes demand 3.3 million 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.869
 euros to buy the church what is 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.130
 the sentiment here 8.3 million 3 million 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.619
 is a lot 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.679
 in how did not and then we did not 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.030
 no faithful they have big ways 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.450
 whose bar is not obliged to give up 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.250
 purchase 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.800
 now what should be considered 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.420
 if we have to leave it's 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.090
 to buy a local or rent a local 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.980
 for transformed into a church 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.709
 the town hall of the 15th did not move us 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.230
 met the mayor on a market 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.720
 saxe avenue which has 18 all because with 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.550
 you but did not tell us where to go to play 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.730
 find that I have the impression that they 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.890
 do not want to get wet so today 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.890
 and then we have seen the future 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.540
 maybe the future elected in the future 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.710
 elected it's a bit normal with us 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.030
 but it does not help for now 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.520
 that is, no one has 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.400
 committed to solving this situation again 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.440
 no no one agrees the mayor said ben 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.280
 we could possibly have saved her 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.380
 to do a worship center so that 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.600
 means we're leaving so 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.410
 today we are the status quo if we do not 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.209
 do not know then we've seen that permits to 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.420
 build have been put to the grid my 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.370
 there they were torn off by a faithful 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.670
 obviously a little bit annoyed by this 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.860
 situation that is when do you 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.709
 are going to be expelled what you have you 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.900
 know is not we who have been 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.000
 installed have made that exciting and faithful 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.100
 even people who do not come to 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.690
 we were very upset so this 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.160
 week we were telephoned saying 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.320
 that cases is tearing all 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.780
 the panels and then and ben no one 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.150
 is waiting for a court case that 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:40.090
 had to be returned on Tuesday 11 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.700
 then there on Tuesday we will be how we go 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.489
 to be eaten right now I believe it 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.320
 180 churches are going to be demolished 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.930
 that is to say we know very easy 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.760
 leave the church closed and deteriorate 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.670
 then at some point we go to the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.170
 prefecture the danger is destroyed 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.340
 I believe that everyone is 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.440
 sheet 1 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.640
 we combine not long time 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.560
 television destroyed two beautiful 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.879
 churches to build small 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.610
 chapels one has the impression of being in 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.700
 a garage so royal gift project 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.069
 real estate and then when we talk about that to 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.670
 elected all that we do not have anyone in 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.349
 the churches 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.690
 which is not the case here for many 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.269
 of people you have never had 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.540
 problems with your landlord can not name 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.639
 never see him he asked when 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.870
 they praised us that they are there a 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.910
 times a year we've never seen them they're 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.350
 owners of other churches what 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.419
 the other churches will undergo the same 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.700
 fate than yours to your and they have 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.260
 other churches set but I believe that 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.030
 the in Belgium has already sold then 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.370
 in other countries I believe there is this 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.270
 church so currently they are in 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:51.120
 sell everything and I'm good to you
