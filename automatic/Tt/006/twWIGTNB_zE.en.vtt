pre-heat your oven to 375 and about time
suppose<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.789> supposed<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> take<00:00:27.269> about<00:00:27.420> half

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.929 
suppose they supposed to take about half
an<00:00:27.660> hour<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.680> don't<00:00:29.220> think<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.699> gonna

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
an hour but I don't think it's gonna

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.470 
an hour but I don't think it's gonna
take<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.390> though<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:32.070> bake<00:00:32.340> time<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
take that though and then bake time is

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.459 
take that though and then bake time is
about<00:00:33.840> 11<00:00:34.320> minutes<00:00:34.500> um<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.480> always<00:00:36.480> set<00:00:37.440> my

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
about 11 minutes um I always set my

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
about 11 minutes um I always set my
timers<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> little<00:00:38.610> less<00:00:38.730> time<00:00:39.000> than

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
timers to be a little less time than

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.819 
timers to be a little less time than
what<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.480> called<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.649> just

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
what it's called for because you just

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.400 
what it's called for because you just
don't<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.239> when<00:00:42.239> it'll<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.570> done<00:00:42.719> different

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
don't know when it'll be done different

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.630 
don't know when it'll be done different
different<00:00:43.980> elevations<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:45.059> change<00:00:45.300> that

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
different elevations can change that

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.069 
different elevations can change that
your<00:00:47.640> oven<00:00:47.969> could<00:00:48.180> run<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> little<00:00:48.629> hotter<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
your oven could run a little hotter a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.410 
your oven could run a little hotter a
little<00:00:49.379> cool<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.070> will<00:00:50.250> change<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.120> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
little cool and that will change it so I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
little cool and that will change it so I
always<00:00:51.570> recommend<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.379> setting<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
always recommend just setting it like it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.160 
always recommend just setting it like it
it<00:00:53.430> calls<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:53.820> 11<00:00:54.270> minutes<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.719> set<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.020> for

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
it calls for 11 minutes so set it for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
it calls for 11 minutes so set it for
nine<00:00:55.350> minutes<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.800> check<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.399> find<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
nine minutes and check it I find that a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
nine minutes and check it I find that a
lot<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.420> cookies<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:57.930> done<00:00:58.050> around<00:00:58.320> 9<00:00:58.890> minutes

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
lot my cookies are done around 9 minutes

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.029 
lot my cookies are done around 9 minutes
and<00:00:59.930> I<00:01:00.930> pull<00:01:01.170> them<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.800> let<00:01:01.980> them

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and I pull them out and I let them

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.470 
and I pull them out and I let them
finish<00:01:02.250> kind<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.670> cooking<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> cookie

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480

tray<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.019> moment<00:01:04.379> before<00:01:04.979> removing<00:01:05.820> them

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
tray for a moment before removing them

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.120 
tray for a moment before removing them
because<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.479> find<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.229> over<00:01:07.950> bake

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.649 
because I find that if you over bake
them<00:01:08.280> gonna<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.580> dry<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.119> never<00:01:09.270> meet<00:01:09.450> chewy
