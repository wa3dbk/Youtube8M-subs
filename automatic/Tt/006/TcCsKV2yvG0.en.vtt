 so here today the dome notes that it enters the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.989
 office is on the top so 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.090
 flying is required then make sure 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.330
 that the difficulty of dungeons is 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.100
 in heroic mode although there early on 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.830
 in the morning if you die you must attack the pm 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.509
 j no house at the event every time in 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.400
 that he is in his way 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.650
 this is necessary in order to proceed 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.780
 Instance then hits everything in the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.729
 way to the first chef this 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.840
 first optional chef if you do not 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.420
 want to kill 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.310
 just go through the cave you 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.040
 will reach the second boss who is the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.840
 stony leather there is no achievement in this 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.390
 boss but note that he has 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.049
 approximately 1% chance of switching to 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.200
 mount draco of stone video then good 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.329
 luck with the second possible boss 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.670
 you finally have three more modes in the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.409
 way and always attentive to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.259
 sentinels who are patrolling the area 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.000
 and you get kill quickly or 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.060
 they did not call all the enemies to the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.250
 around to attack you kill the third 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.920
 head of the court and also does not offer 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.990
 no achievement and when you get here in 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.780
 before the last head of the proceedings 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.229
 we have finally achieved the only 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.540
 dungeon that is rotten inside the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.580
 conquest requires you to kill 60 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.500
 cycles in 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.860
 the seconds during the fight with the high 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.380
 asian priestess and much attention here 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.680
 this achievement is very simple and it is only 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.840
 question you put all the exact 60 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.350
 enemies in front of the boss and kill 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.620
 together but it is crucial that you get into 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.360
 fight with the chef first, otherwise you 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.640
 will not receive the achievement 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.280
 so uses some voice 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.400
 attack on her and then martins 60 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.800
 disciples and achievement will be your complete 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.420
 to kill the boss and that's it I hope 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.420
 have enjoyed and until the next
