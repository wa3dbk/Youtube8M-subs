00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:10.889
 guys the day is once a Felipe 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.380
 problem asked for calm 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.820
 conditioning system consumes more than one 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.350
 car without air conditioning then when 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.410
 I say air conditioning 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.029
 my car becomes more economical as 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.410
 A few minutes and asked that I go 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.779
 enjoy that i'm here 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.810
 from two machines I will be able to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 show you why we're going 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.279
 out there already had the common look 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.590
 as you do not have a promotion car you 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.030
 not liking you machine but thinking 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 It's the same score 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.040
 I'm here on the side and an engine with a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.450
 machine with no air conditioning right, I'll go 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 show that I'm going to you, you can see 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.300
 that you are going to have the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.300
 engine transmission 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:06.440
 this would be the great one to receive 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:09.380
 another bag so be it can see the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.370
 difference there or semi of the cup 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.560
 conditioning coupling and are going to have straps 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.410
 the crown of the engine belts 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.400
 power to turn on the air compressor 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.360
 conditioning or part of the force 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.500
 generated by the motor will be responsible 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.660
 part of the employee with the engine will be 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.600
 responsible for turning on the compressor or 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.160
 Whether you 're stealing energy from the engine 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.090
 so when you split the air 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.479
 conditioning 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.280
 You stop losing this force of 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.410
 engine in the case taking all the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.910
 chapecoenses him to wheel becoming 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.240
 more economical 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.060
 the basic difference is only one cause 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.229
 will steal some of this 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.600
 motor force in a related case 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.880
 with the continue delegate will not steal 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.979
 then all the power of the whole force 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.640
 energy generated by the motor goes up 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:07.210
 of economic animals is extended to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.210
 guys okay beauty spoke
