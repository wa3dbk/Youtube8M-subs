is<00:00:40.469> my<00:00:40.620> least<00:00:40.890> favorite<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.210> countdown<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
is my least favorite but in countdown to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.299 
is my least favorite but in countdown to
extinction<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.410> feel<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.739> he's<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
extinction I feel like he's one of the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.430 
extinction I feel like he's one of the
more<00:00:44.550> valuable<00:00:45.149> people<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.050> he's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
more valuable people just because he's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.250 
more valuable people just because he's
so<00:00:46.710> fast<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.340> he<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.030> turn<00:00:48.300> close<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so fast and he can turn close with the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.080 
so fast and he can turn close with the
bomb<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.219> really<00:00:50.460> throws<00:00:50.760> off<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
bomb and it just really throws off the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
bomb and it just really throws off the
other<00:00:51.210> team<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.320> recommend<00:00:52.469> having

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
other team so I do recommend having

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.680 
other team so I do recommend having
always<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.820> skeleton<00:00:54.120> countdown<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
always one skeleton countdown to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.389 
always one skeleton countdown to
extinction<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.680> way<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.039> get<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.340> out

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
extinction that way you can get it out

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.799 
extinction that way you can get it out
of<00:00:56.460> your<00:00:56.610> base<00:00:56.760> quick<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.239> possible<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.780> even

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of your base quick as possible or even

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.560 
of your base quick as possible or even

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
my opinion is a very team based game

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.910 
my opinion is a very team based game
definitely<00:01:15.360> want<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.200> each<00:01:16.380> class<00:01:16.680> out

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
definitely want some of each class out

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
definitely want some of each class out
their<00:01:17.159> leaders<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.210> soldiers<00:01:18.750> are<00:01:19.080> very<00:01:19.380> good

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
their leaders and soldiers are very good

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.010 
their leaders and soldiers are very good
at<00:01:19.920> stopping<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.580> diffuse<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> bomb<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
at stopping a diffuse on the bomb and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
at stopping a diffuse on the bomb and
scouts<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.189> scientists<00:01:23.610> are<00:01:23.670> very<00:01:23.909> good<00:01:24.060> at

recommend<00:01:26.790> only<00:01:26.909> having<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.479> doubt<00:01:27.900> though

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
recommend only having one doubt though

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.929 
recommend only having one doubt though
on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.680> battlefield<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.700> just

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
on the battlefield if you can just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.700 
on the battlefield if you can just
because<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.720> kind<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.900> designate<00:01:31.409> him<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
because you can kind of designate him to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.109 
because you can kind of designate him to
run<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> bomb<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.000> of

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
run the bomb and then you can kind of

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.569 
run the bomb and then you can kind of
surround<00:01:33.840> yourself<00:01:34.200> around<00:01:34.290> him<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.829> defend

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
surround yourself around him and defend

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.999 
surround yourself around him and defend
him<00:01:35.820> when<00:01:36.150> he<00:01:36.270> has<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> bomb<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.079> help<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.740> when

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
him when he has a bomb and help out when

getting knocked away up in the air and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
getting knocked away up in the air and
I'm<00:01:42.509> hunting<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.049> cube<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:43.710> because

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I'm hunting for a cube right now because

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.190 
I'm hunting for a cube right now because
I<00:01:44.040> know<00:01:44.100> I'm<00:01:44.340> missing<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.700> piece<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.899> health

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
I know I'm missing one piece of health

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.380 
I know I'm missing one piece of health
and<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> pick<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.520> cube<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and so I pick up that cube I see a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.760 
and so I pick up that cube I see a
scientist<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.990> think<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.350> gonna<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.590> easy

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
scientist and I think it's gonna be easy

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.740 
scientist and I think it's gonna be easy
kill<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.820> lunch<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.270> far<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
kill but I don't lunch as far as I

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.810 
kill but I don't lunch as far as I
thought<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> EMP<00:01:53.130> shotgun<00:01:53.610> on

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
thought so if you get to EMP shotgun on

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.630 
thought so if you get to EMP shotgun on
me<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> maylean<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.470> goes<00:01:55.680> down<00:01:55.950> so

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
me and then the maylean I goes down so

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.280 
me and then the maylean I goes down so
I'm<00:01:56.790> coming<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.119> off<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.329> spawn<00:01:57.630> running<00:01:58.049> into

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
this so he doesn't see me so I can sneak

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.279 
this so he doesn't see me so I can sneak
attack<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.330> don't<00:02:09.509> even<00:02:09.690> need<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.050> because

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
pick up the bomb and take

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.590 
pick up the bomb and take
faster<00:02:14.220> than<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.430> cheetah<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.940> rocket<00:02:15.330> shoes

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
faster than a cheetah and rocket shoes

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.930 
faster than a cheetah and rocket shoes
just<00:02:16.440> cruising<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.130> should<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> for<00:02:17.670> sure

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
just cruising this should be a for sure

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.640 
just cruising this should be a for sure
plan<00:02:18.300> unless<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.080> got<00:02:19.230> killed<00:02:19.440> by<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
plan unless I got killed by the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.560 
plan unless I got killed by the
scientists<00:02:20.160> off<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.460> respawn<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.180> there<00:02:21.450> he

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
scientists off the respawn and there he

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.110 
scientists off the respawn and there he
is<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.230> go<00:02:22.410> for<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.620> melee<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.010> him<00:02:23.280> miss<00:02:23.910> it

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
is so I go for the melee on him miss it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.210 
is so I go for the melee on him miss it
but<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.600> get<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> plant<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.770> now<00:02:25.920> I'm<00:02:26.010> thinking

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
but I get the plant so now I'm thinking

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.220 
but I get the plant so now I'm thinking
that<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.910> need<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.150> sit<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.960> throw

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
that I just need to sit here and throw

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.290 
that I just need to sit here and throw
stun<00:02:28.680> grenades<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.550> bomb<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.000> make<00:02:30.150> sure

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
stun grenades on this bomb to make sure

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.880 
stun grenades on this bomb to make sure
that<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:30.630> do<00:02:30.690> not<00:02:30.930> get<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.410> then<00:02:31.500> kill

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that they do not get it and then kill

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.550 
that they do not get it and then kill
anyone<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.790> stun<00:02:33.390> or<00:02:33.660> anyone<00:02:34.050> around<00:02:34.290> it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
anyone that I stun or anyone around it

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.400 
anyone that I stun or anyone around it
and<00:02:35.210> at<00:02:36.210> around<00:02:36.390> three<00:02:36.720> seconds<00:02:37.080> I'm<00:02:37.140> always

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
and at around three seconds I'm always

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.380 
and at around three seconds I'm always
out<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.830> there<00:02:37.980> because<00:02:38.460> at<00:02:38.850> three<00:02:39.060> seconds

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
out of there because at three seconds

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.060 
out of there because at three seconds
it's<00:02:39.480> very<00:02:39.750> hard<00:02:39.990> for<00:02:40.050> them<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.290> diffuse<00:02:40.800> and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
it's very hard for them to diffuse and

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.160 
it's very hard for them to diffuse and
you're<00:02:41.460> pretty<00:02:41.670> much<00:02:41.730> guaranteed<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.690> make<00:02:43.020> it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
you're pretty much guaranteed to make it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.380 
you're pretty much guaranteed to make it
blow<00:02:43.410> up<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.130> got<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> cute<00:02:44.640> three<00:02:44.910> killstreak
