00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Welcome to Diesel is today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.410
 I will show you in this as well 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.670
 the - chilis lay prepared and cooked 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.030
 most of you if likely 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.790
 that at common sambal olek know 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.670
 from indonesia and we will be today 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.380
 Malaysian sambal consultants do yes 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.859
 ballack is nothing but 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.390
 shrimp fitted and you are here too 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.970
 Do not be put off by the profession again 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.849
 should that be exactly what it is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.910
 this special my friend says so 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.530
 makes a nutty taste 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.809
 So besides the use as loose 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.450
 Can you do that on the ball too? 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.040
 saute and vegetables seafood 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.690
 use meat 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.050
 For example, I also roast 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 of eggplant water spinach and grass 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.239
 or simply as an addition to dig 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.890
 or other dishes and how it 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.590
 I'll show you that now 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.670
 We have here 30 grams of shrimp fit 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.239
 nine big chilis five little chilies 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.170
 dried chillies 10 shallots 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.400
 garlic 10 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.280
 about 200 milliliters of water and 200 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.020
 milliliters of oil at first I small ones 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.830
 whole chilis something before I go into the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.290
 give mixer 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.270
 the big goals for sure are karen 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.080
 chilis she gets her normal in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.759
 supermarket for the little chilies 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.729
 I'm here chili paris or well known 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.259
 under the name chilis or botticellis 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.340
 taken a little bit more sharp 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.689
 reinzubringen 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.090
 because these little chilies are clear 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.439
 are sharper than the big ones if you like it 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.140
 do not want to have made it completely or 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.549
 the parties do not get mine 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.650
 as so often just from the asialaden 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.780
 Can you just make those five little ones 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.340
 by putting a big door in general 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.140
 you can do according to your sharpness 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.470
 choose a productive one by approx 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.600
 exchange four to five small cheese 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.780
 now come dried chilies 1 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.310
 I also have them from the asialaden 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.020
 they are also hotter than the fresh ones 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.460
 big but mainly different 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.920
 in comparison to taste 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.450
 the fresh also the shallots come 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.800
 with those mixa and beforehand something 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.420
 snipped small but there is now 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.130
 do not immediately fit everything into a mixer 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.140
 That's why I give some water 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.040
 on it and for her something in front of place 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.040
 to create for the rest 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.040
 so now we have enough space again 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.510
 the remaining shallots 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.340
 our turn of garlic and the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.400
 shrimps passe the budget for purely with 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.400
 go 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.540
 it comes again something on it and water 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.540
 then we puree the whole thing 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.680
 Then we heat the oil in a pan 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.450
 and put our chili pasta in it 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.900
 something careful again something is 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.900
 support 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.420
 I use the remaining water then 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.770
 it always leaves me there for a few more 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.290
 to wash out and now with in the 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.850
 pan 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.110
 All this has to ask something like that 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.110
 pretty aromatic right 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.020
 we regulate the heat down slightly 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.880
 and leave us for sauce at medium 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.470
 heat with occasional stirring about 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.720
 Something for 15 minutes 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:00.060
 simmer and cover and it is already 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.620
 homemade ball finished now 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.820
 it just has to cool down and then 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.430
 we can fill in our containers 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.020
 as for example, in sweet little ones, the themselves 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.840
 I think that's very good as well 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.640
 gifts are suitable 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.230
 Do not be afraid of the many oil that should 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.860
 be like that and that helps afterwards too 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.860
 preserve 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.340
 the oil settles up while storing 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.090
 and forms one, so to speak 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.950
 protective layer maybe what else 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.540
 to mention difference to the collection object 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.340
 is that our collection is in 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.500
 contrast, not so sour 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.500
 tastes good and he goes in the direction of moderate 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.370
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.639
 and if so then I would join the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.740
 high and new subscriptions we always ask 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.740
