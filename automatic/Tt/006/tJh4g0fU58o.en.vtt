00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.460
 Hey 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.660
 hello ladies to your 14 8 new gta 5 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.430
 online led you i am olaf and in this 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.410
 clip I show you the cart rejoinder 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.650
 etienne glitch and you probably work 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.180
 also with the engine and these sluts on the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.240
 evident 11 patch 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.650
 you should always check this as after 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.090
 the patches then I don't know if that 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.469
 you should ask me if it worked 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.480
 who still does 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.640
 and most of the time your patch is strong as 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.380
 find there which patches the menu 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.000
 This flash buck after the one paid per 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.450
 finally so last 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.790
 and this craft is solo so that's handy 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.690
 then not necessarily add a friend 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.290
 to be 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.360
 as chinese i don't want to do anything and like this one 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.100
 clubs have already done these LEDs in 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.180
 you can eat your cars and rejoinder 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.030
 don't sell the car 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.430
 so your rejoinder in the auto potx I say 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.440
 but your parent or you turismo theory 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.829
 you can't sell it then you can 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.960
 by the way, hotel cold but you can 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.509
 so then she wouldn't sell if you put it 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.340
 pushed likete and read aloud 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.350
 let's your entire garage be full and 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.959
 It doesn't matter which grass you are in 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.799
 garage here you sit if you fall in one 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.289
 car with 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.090
 or in the garage with four or two then 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.779
 these clips also seem one as long as you 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.939
 garage is full but besters if you have one 

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:29.829

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.119

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.740

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.569
 but in my so make sure your entire garage 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.579

 this lexus not very difficult 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.930

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:19.280

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.420
 value of 50,000 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.879
 so i now have my 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.780
 and to entertain the kafir on the 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.900
 street 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.840
 then you step into a car from a package 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.840
 the value of 50,000 for what this 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.370
 highlight 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.079
 oh yeah as you just stand and 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.469
 it doesn't matter if he doesn't have time 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.469
 as 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:58.069
 if only you weren't out and the police 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.319
 quality if you have one if you are broken or 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.030
 as you make and rows 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.129
 well it doesn't matter if you have a split 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.069
 but you must now address below 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.799
 of which 50,000 and rows of a glass 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.959
 I can now have police now and can not 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.009
 he is so into gauze you and stimulation 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:22.780
 just standing there waiting for me in my 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:22.780
 degree you can bob had with my garage 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.080
 ok that is now in grass and pull now 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.760
 just aa-church stuff you just click 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.470
 that 's good 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.840
 so when you see it it's good if you 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.120
 just driving is not good because you have 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.099
 not all your garage full 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.319
 they must ensure the state of yes you 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.760
 must lip read if you have done that then 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.379
 because that just this lits with the entity 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.640
 Now did I have to rebase with him 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.230
 the entity 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.989
 first I saw the police lost 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.660
 and no worries if you are so intense with it 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.660
 the ntr as long as you like this flash well 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.519
 and if it is unsure ask 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.630
 then in the comments and will try to 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.250
 respond and ensure that you are in good 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.870
 pitch shit because if you might after that 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.430
 the patch might make me your car 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.980
 so lost 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.230
 intention after the next patch can now 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.479
 maybe the clips can be votre pads 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.700
 and the works these clips no longer works 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.320
 because this clip minus elvis but 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.000
 when clips are lost so I click on one 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.070
 group to my entity 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.690
 I just did a massage and that 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.620
 jack so one more time I drive right 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:34.280
 my free 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:37.039
 ha my garage look at that with every gas 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.099
 jacket can be like i said so that is 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.990
 if you are beautiful then you are just in you 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.510
 garage walking around and you see yourself 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.919
 entity the stand 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.440
 it does n't matter where it stands if you 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.520
 but back vent and then you step inside 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.280
 were you then have lunch in it 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.340
 garage and then you click another error 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.680
 if you drive your garage 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.139
 if you want to see this screen games click 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.660
 then so to know just right 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.880
 will your dolls will drive a car 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.900
 which is a fresh ballistas if it is good 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.520
 so this is right as you see now you have 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.130
 I now have an invisble car 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.370
 so you drive about a block 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.370
 until your car arrives again 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.910
 that would be aparts again 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.460
 very much everyone and like this part 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.050
 go wrong you go garage and garage 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.970
 then you would hardly be in shirts anymore 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.490
 and then you just look old in sierre 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.540
 start them again with the glitch 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:39.000
 but if you want the router 6 is a row 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.990
 my garage one does not drive 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.520
 you put it in a you get out what they 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.020
 then do so you walk 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.020
 you walk around in your garage 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.740
 so you don't walk throne with you 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.870
 car but you walk if you have questions 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.100
 about places or something or your other videos 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.039
 hour had it all behind and 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.130
 reactions and my show do nothing here and 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.919
 you see that this screen comes opel that is 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.889
 something has been her taste since I 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.050
 just because you put cavalcade caterin 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.199
 then you have to replay them afterwards 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.510
 again run out so a curaçao 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:18.630

 that there is a car on the road or what 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:29.370

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.200
 he that a tractor offset you state he 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.460
 still if you don't state it now 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.690
 Stiglitz failed and then you will 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.479
 probably bullied you probably 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:39.479

 I can do it again but 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.280
