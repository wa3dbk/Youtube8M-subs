00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.510
 hi girls like here with a new one 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.059
 search for a home remedy for hair 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.190
 really very effective is very simple 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.400
 therefore he had a high speed then 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.529
 for the lazy girls who are looking at me 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 you can do it all because you need it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 I think you have rice 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.640
 all in case so you really don't have 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.380
 excuses and it is a very nice recipe 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 because you can use it both on 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.809
 hair but also divided so on 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.550
 leather and 21 and is therefore very simple 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.579
 let's go immediately to see a discovery that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.710
 really, really recently, I am immediately 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.079
 exalted for the result your no 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.680
 they must make a video with rice then 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.809
 you put the rice soaked in water and yes 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.180
 forms a kind of rice milk that has 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.410
 of properties very effective for i 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.510
 hair and skin 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.820
 I also wanted to add 2 3 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.129
 spoons of coconut flour of his for 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.140
 perfume make something nicer though 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.170
 absolutely you can do it even alone 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.780
 with rice and water then put it 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.820
 all in a pot and put on 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.720
 fire and expect training 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.720
 of the art of rice 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.840
 since we put it on the fire 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.760
 we were running about twenty minutes 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.100
 because you have to cook well and tris me 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.500
 that the rice guide is released and 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.869
 form this species of rice milk 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.700
 but this very beautiful hand because 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.159
 you can also do it by using the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.320
 what has advanced or maybe there 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.030
 you have to do the mink side and some units 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.530
 more so then later was this done 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.740
 recipe therefore also a kind of 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.680
 so I succeeded therefore also 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.780
 very much and you 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.610
 meanwhile rice is cooked 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.410
 obviously do what you want me 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 I am put on enamel also because then 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.460
 after waited a little bit that yes 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.440
 cool you see becomes just one 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.360
 very very thick creamy sauce 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.460
 at this point we love it to blend 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.380
 with a mini pive not chop that one 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.229
 what you want and it really becomes a cream 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.209
 very very dense very soft it can 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.700
 also to say eat because yes 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.950
 talk about lyso for those who are 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.019
 but lactose intolerant 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.420
 zuccher harlow and is also very good vi 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.489
 I say the truth is a now we take 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.560
 this cream and let's put it on 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.480
 a container this rice milk 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.090
 done this way you can too 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.640
 keep in the fridge then use it 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.230
 for several days because it keeps well 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.820
 I also tried to put the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.950
 preservative really lasted me 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.650
 very much and you can make some 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.600
 pack on the hair or spread it 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.180
 on the face use it as a mask 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.410
 because it is very soothing softener 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.290
 continue the rice starch that 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.000
 it softens a lot the face makes it 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.209
 smooth and really makes me a nice one 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.989
 result and therefore you 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.200
 at the same time put it on 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.760
 hair and face immediately do 21 misses 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.440
 it also clarifies the signs and the lines a little 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.440
 Spots on the face of rice starch 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.930
 it's really great though if you want to 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.760
 do something even more enriched ie 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.650
 you that the rice milk so 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.420
 prepared you can use it already as 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.320
 I pack on my hair and I told you how 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.209
 face mask 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.609
 if you want to enrich it even more 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.840
 you can do what I'm doing now that is 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.540
 add other ingredients 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.530
 housewives and make a pack really 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.430
 super super great and really special 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.810
 fantastic I added to it 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.810
 the honey then I added cocoa is 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.969
 I don't really tell you the world of cocoa 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.250
 really girls I feel like 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:39.140
 one chocolate because you do this 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.209
 very very creamy consistency e 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.909
 probably been perfumed then 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.310
 which I tell you to do, however, by doing so 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.900
 in 100 all these ingredients become 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.810
 an even more nutritious impact 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.439
 restructuring is obviously even more 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.810
 effective then we go to add some 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.879
 of glycerine, a bit of trust that is Latin 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.609
 which also excellent restructuring 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.540
 hair reinforcement and some 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.859
 coconut oil 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.109
 if you want you can also add the 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.819
 wheat proteins of the essential of 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.819
 lemon to perfume what you want 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.710
 obviously if you do not have all the same 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.940
 there is absolutely no ingredients 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.070
 problem as you know I like to do 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.320
 very rich things but I repeat to you that 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.310
 I made this rice milk with 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.530
 water and rice is really a remedy 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.720
 great for hair also used by 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.240
 just really great that it contains 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.570
 the starch which is very softening for i 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.100
 hair and nourishing softener 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.889
 really then it takes away the frizz 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.789
 silky pleases a lot and also for 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.650
 the face 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.680
 so if you try, let me know in 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.680
 comments 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.650
 then prepared the pack I am going to 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.830
 apply to the hair leaves it in place 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.169
 30 minutes but also an hour or so its time 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.960
 then later here by you hair normally 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.849

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.849
 voluminous soft that they do 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.730
 I really was too happy about this 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.920

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.980
 dried natural and absolutely without 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.720
 pity with no product after so 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.820
