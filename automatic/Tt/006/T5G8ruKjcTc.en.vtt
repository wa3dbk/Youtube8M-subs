up the alloy wheel which is very dirty
you<00:00:43.300> can<00:00:43.510> see<00:00:43.719> that<00:00:43.989> this<00:00:44.199> is<00:00:44.379> how<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.680> coating

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
you can see that this is how the coating

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.439 
you can see that this is how the coating
of<00:00:45.340> rather<00:00:46.329> thick<00:00:46.780> black<00:00:47.320> dust<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.940> I<00:00:48.969> think

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
of rather thick black dust that I think

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.090 
of rather thick black dust that I think
has<00:00:49.570> been<00:00:49.780> attracted<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.590> because<00:00:50.949> the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
has been attracted to it because the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.490 
has been attracted to it because the
owner<00:00:51.250> is<00:00:51.460> clean<00:00:51.730> despite<00:00:52.180> previously<00:00:53.079> with

rather<00:00:57.160> sticky<00:00:57.640> film<00:00:57.879> goose<00:00:58.870> will<00:00:59.440> not<00:00:59.769> leave

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
rather sticky film goose will not leave

a<00:01:00.430> sticky<00:01:00.730> residue<00:01:00.879> once<00:01:01.539> it's<00:01:01.750> being<00:01:02.019> applied

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
a sticky residue once it's being applied

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
and that's one of the major benefits

is how it will stay it won't fade after

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.450 
is how it will stay it won't fade after
a<00:02:03.910> few<00:02:04.179> minutes<00:02:04.360> like<00:02:04.690> some<00:02:04.959> other<00:02:05.110> products
