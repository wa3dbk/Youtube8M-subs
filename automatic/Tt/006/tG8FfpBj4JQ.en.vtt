clinic<00:00:21.789> part<00:00:22.029> two<00:00:22.269> as<00:00:23.140> you<00:00:23.199> remember<00:00:23.410> in<00:00:24.160> the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
clinic part two as you remember in the

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.040 
clinic part two as you remember in the
first<00:00:24.489> bar<00:00:24.730> we<00:00:24.880> talked<00:00:25.119> about<00:00:25.300> the

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
first bar we talked about the

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.540 
first bar we talked about the
appropriate<00:00:26.590> rudder<00:00:26.769> input<00:00:27.220> when<00:00:27.400> you're

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
appropriate rudder input when you're

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.479 
appropriate rudder input when you're
entering<00:00:27.880> knife-edge<00:00:28.410> from<00:00:29.410> an<00:00:29.710> upright

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
entering knife-edge from an upright

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.150 
entering knife-edge from an upright
position<00:00:30.840> think<00:00:31.840> opposite<00:00:32.500> rudder<00:00:32.680> so<00:00:33.070> if

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
position think opposite rudder so if

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.400 
position think opposite rudder so if
you're<00:00:33.309> rolling<00:00:33.670> to<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:33.940> left<00:00:34.239> try<00:00:35.110> it<00:00:35.170> right

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
you're rolling to the left try it right

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.960 
you're rolling to the left try it right
or<00:00:35.559> it's<00:00:35.650> going<00:00:35.829> to<00:00:35.920> roll<00:00:36.129> to<00:00:36.339> the<00:00:36.370> right<00:00:36.610> left

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
or it's going to roll to the right left

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.020 
or it's going to roll to the right left
rudder<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:37.839> now<00:00:38.170> get<00:00:38.470> you<00:00:38.680> where<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:39.790> need<00:00:39.820> to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
rudder and now get you where you need to

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.540 
rudder and now get you where you need to
be<00:00:40.180> without<00:00:40.449> getting<00:00:40.960> in<00:00:41.140> trouble<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:42.309> that

be without getting in trouble now that
we've<00:00:42.670> learned<00:00:42.879> that<00:00:43.120> left<00:00:43.720> a<00:00:45.870> little<00:00:46.870> bit

with Stevens arrow groove and that

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.440 
with Stevens arrow groove and that
really<00:01:23.110> inspired<00:01:23.649> me<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.999> start<00:01:24.999> learning<00:01:25.270> the

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
really inspired me to start learning the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.859 
really inspired me to start learning the
knife<00:01:25.719> had<00:01:25.929> just<00:01:26.140> definitely<00:01:26.759> by<00:01:27.759> far<00:01:27.869> my

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
knife had just definitely by far my

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.260 
knife had just definitely by far my
favorite<00:01:29.140> maneuver<00:01:29.409> when<00:01:29.859> the<00:01:30.700> airplane<00:01:31.090> is

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
favorite maneuver when the airplane is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.160 
favorite maneuver when the airplane is
not<00:01:31.450> ending<00:01:31.869> in<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.200> 3d<00:01:33.009> post<00:01:33.310> all<00:01:33.579> attitude

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
not ending in the 3d post all attitude

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.099 
not ending in the 3d post all attitude
okay<00:01:35.170> just<00:01:35.439> go<00:01:35.889> back<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.310> forth<00:01:36.460> like<00:01:36.729> that

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
okay just go back and forth like that

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.610 
okay just go back and forth like that
the<00:01:38.109> gentle<00:01:38.499> push

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.290 

go<00:01:44.440> get<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.470> little<00:01:45.770> bit<00:01:45.890> of<00:01:45.920> altitude<00:01:46.490> here

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:57.720 

start<00:01:50.300> my<00:01:50.450> time

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.640 

a<00:01:57.790> couple<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.510> things<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:58.810> I've<00:01:59.080> added<00:01:59.320> to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
a couple of things that I've added to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.680 
a couple of things that I've added to
spice<00:01:59.950> it<00:01:59.980> up<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.340> little<00:02:00.490> bit<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:01.240> just<00:02:01.420> put

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
spice it up a little bit you just put

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.450 
spice it up a little bit you just put
one<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.740> half<00:02:02.920> snap<00:02:03.640> in<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.330> middle<00:02:05.460> just

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
one and a half snap in the middle just

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.960 
one and a half snap in the middle just
like<00:02:06.580> that

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.630 

better<00:02:15.570> though

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
better though

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.960 
better though
and<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.510> need<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.810> practice<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.350> get<00:02:19.470> it

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
and you just need to practice to get it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.500 
and you just need to practice to get it
executed<00:02:20.970> cleanly

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.110 

once<00:02:26.930> you've<00:02:27.110> done<00:02:27.319> some<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.890> they<00:02:28.879> want

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
once you've done some of that they want

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.910 
once you've done some of that they want
a<00:02:29.180> little<00:02:29.420> bit<00:02:29.540> more<00:02:29.689> challenge<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.500> can<00:02:30.680> try

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
a little bit more challenge you can try

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:56.150 
a little bit more challenge you can try
and<00:02:31.069> doing<00:02:34.030> knife<00:02:35.030> edge<00:02:35.360> snap

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.310 

as<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.030> see<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.420> snap<00:02:57.720> itself<00:02:58.140> is

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
as you can see that snap itself is

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.680 
as you can see that snap itself is
pretty<00:02:58.590> simple<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.220> execute<00:02:59.390> but<00:03:00.390> it's<00:03:00.540> all<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
pretty simple to execute but it's all a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.860 
pretty simple to execute but it's all a
timing<00:03:00.990> maneuver<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.190> if<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.330> rather<00:03:03.540> sleep

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
timing maneuver so if you rather sleep

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.250 
timing maneuver so if you rather sleep
deprived<00:03:04.410> often<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.130> myself<00:03:05.370> many<00:03:06.060> times

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
deprived often like myself many times

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.740 
deprived often like myself many times
their<00:03:07.260> timing<00:03:07.710> might<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.460> slightly<00:03:08.760> offset<00:03:09.060> as

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
their timing might be slightly offset as

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.650 
their timing might be slightly offset as
always<00:03:10.290> when<00:03:10.560> you're<00:03:10.800> practicing<00:03:11.660> always

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
always when you're practicing always

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.940 
always when you're practicing always
good<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.900> have<00:03:13.640> altitude<00:03:14.640> as<00:03:14.910> your<00:03:15.270> friend<00:03:15.660> and

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
good to have altitude as your friend and

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.800 
good to have altitude as your friend and
not<00:03:16.950> your<00:03:17.220> enemy<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.700> then<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:23.970> course<00:03:24.240> the

not your enemy and then of course the

mother of all knife edge maneuver would

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.540 
mother of all knife edge maneuver would
be<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.120> knife<00:03:27.330> edge<00:03:27.600> loop<00:03:28.070> when<00:03:29.070> we<00:03:29.190> complete

be the knife edge loop when we complete

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.340 
be the knife edge loop when we complete
without<00:03:29.760> talking<00:03:30.270> about<00:03:30.330> it<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.780> way<00:03:30.960> you've

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
without talking about it that way you've

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.960 
without talking about it that way you've
got<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.650> have<00:03:31.770> enough<00:03:32.040> power<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.670> enough

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
got to have enough power and enough

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.740 
got to have enough power and enough
speed<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:34.160> initial<00:03:35.160> then<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.150> do<00:03:36.300> is<00:03:36.420> power

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
speed and initial then you do is power

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.610 
speed and initial then you do is power
through<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.950> manure<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:40.200> then<00:03:40.320> when<00:03:40.500> you're

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
through the manure and then when you're

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.200 
through the manure and then when you're
on<00:03:40.740> top<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.070> actually<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.400> opposite<00:03:41.970> rudder

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
on top you actually the opposite rudder

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.840 
on top you actually the opposite rudder
and<00:03:43.050> then<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.710> of<00:03:43.950> course<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.310> scariest

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
and then this is of course the scariest

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.790 
and then this is of course the scariest
part<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.690> when<00:03:49.170> you're<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.350> little<00:03:49.620> scared

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
part and when you're a little scared

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.190 
part and when you're a little scared
like<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.250> am<00:03:50.370> right<00:03:50.400> there<00:03:50.840> just<00:03:51.840> come<00:03:51.990> out<00:03:52.170> of

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
like I am right there just come out of

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.610 
like I am right there just come out of
it<00:03:52.440> there's<00:03:53.010> no<00:03:53.370> harm<00:03:53.670> in<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:54.470> when<00:03:55.470> you're

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
it there's no harm in that when you're

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.020 
it there's no harm in that when you're
initially<00:03:56.040> practicing<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:56.820> want<00:03:56.970> to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
initially practicing and you want to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.660 
initially practicing and you want to
make<00:03:57.120> sure<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.450> don't<00:03:57.630> dork<00:03:57.900> your<00:03:58.080> model<00:03:58.670> what

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
make sure you don't dork your model what

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.810 
make sure you don't dork your model what
you<00:03:59.790> do<00:03:59.940> just<00:03:59.970> come<00:04:00.390> back<00:04:00.570> out<00:04:01.760> do<00:04:02.760> a

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
you do just come back out do a

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.460 
you do just come back out do a
hammerhead<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:04.760> then<00:04:05.760> try<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.180> go<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.050> level

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
hammerhead and then try to go a level

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.650 
hammerhead and then try to go a level
from<00:04:07.890> that<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.370> attitude<00:04:08.940> just<00:04:09.209> like<00:04:09.450> that

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
from that and attitude just like that

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.380 
from that and attitude just like that
see<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.590> again<00:04:10.680> let's<00:04:11.130> try<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.490> again<00:04:11.550> now

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
see that again let's try that again now

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.970 
see that again let's try that again now
hammerhead<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.200> right

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.300 

there<00:04:17.610> you<00:04:17.910> go<00:04:18.260> it's<00:04:19.260> less<00:04:19.560> scary<00:04:19.830> that<00:04:20.130> way

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
there you go it's less scary that way

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.270 
there you go it's less scary that way
once<00:04:20.820> you've<00:04:21.000> gotten<00:04:21.300> used<00:04:21.480> to<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.770> and<00:04:22.770> by

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
once you've gotten used to that and by

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.460 
once you've gotten used to that and by
all<00:04:23.460> means<00:04:23.700> give<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.390> knife<00:04:24.570> edge<00:04:24.780> loop<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.230> try

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
all means give the knife edge loop a try

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.130 
all means give the knife edge loop a try
and<00:04:25.940> it<00:04:26.940> did<00:04:27.120> take<00:04:27.300> me<00:04:27.330> you're<00:04:27.600> quite<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.840> while

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
and it did take me you're quite a while

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.590 
and it did take me you're quite a while
to<00:04:28.170> figure<00:04:28.680> out<00:04:29.040> what<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.460> really<00:04:29.970> needed<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.480> do

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
to figure out what I really needed to do

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.350 
to figure out what I really needed to do
input<00:04:31.110> wise<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.890> just<00:04:32.100> have<00:04:33.000> enough

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
input wise and to just have enough

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.030 
input wise and to just have enough
cojones<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.960> pull<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.910> maneuver<00:04:35.910> cleanly

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
cojones to pull this maneuver cleanly

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:45.010 
cojones to pull this maneuver cleanly
without<00:04:38.390> bailing<00:04:39.390> out

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.800 

and<00:04:45.500> even<00:04:45.860> now<00:04:46.009> I'm<00:04:46.759> still<00:04:46.819> a<00:04:47.240> little<00:04:47.330> bit<00:04:47.629> more

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
and even now I'm still a little bit more

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:55.990 
and even now I'm still a little bit more
timid<00:04:50.500> okay

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.270 

you're<00:04:57.000> thinking<00:04:57.710> when<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.800> comes<00:04:59.010> to<00:04:59.130> high

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
you're thinking when it comes to high

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.470 
you're thinking when it comes to high
alpha<00:04:59.580> knife-edge<00:05:01.970> just<00:05:02.970> like<00:05:03.180> any<00:05:03.420> other

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
alpha knife-edge just like any other

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.620 
alpha knife-edge just like any other
high<00:05:03.750> alpha<00:05:03.960> maneuver<00:05:05.210> it's<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.300> combination

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
high alpha maneuver it's a combination

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.180 
high alpha maneuver it's a combination
of<00:05:06.960> throttle<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:09.380> elevator<00:05:10.380> in<00:05:10.800> this<00:05:10.980> case

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
of throttle and elevator in this case

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.129 
of throttle and elevator in this case
the<00:05:11.400> elevator<00:05:11.760> would<00:05:11.880> be<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.180> letter

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.679 

if<00:05:16.499> the<00:05:16.710> model<00:05:17.039> starting<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.550> do<00:05:18.300> funny<00:05:18.599> things

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:18.689 
if the model starting to do funny things

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.939 
if the model starting to do funny things
just<00:05:19.229> relax<00:05:19.590> your<00:05:19.830> control<00:05:20.219> and<00:05:20.400> fly<00:05:21.120> out

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
just relax your control and fly out

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.499 
just relax your control and fly out
because<00:05:22.949> when<00:05:23.280> you<00:05:23.520> try<00:05:23.789> to<00:05:23.849> over<00:05:24.150> control

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
because when you try to over control

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.140 
because when you try to over control
that's<00:05:24.749> when<00:05:24.990> you'll<00:05:25.169> snap<00:05:25.529> out<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.009> get<00:05:26.849> into

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
that's when you'll snap out and get into

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.959 
that's when you'll snap out and get into
all<00:05:27.360> sorts<00:05:27.389> of<00:05:27.900> trouble<00:05:31.460> that's<00:05:32.460> preview

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
all sorts of trouble that's preview

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.189 
all sorts of trouble that's preview
another<00:05:33.240> clinic<00:05:34.199> here<00:05:35.539> eventually<00:05:36.539> I'd<00:05:36.960> love

another clinic here eventually I'd love
to<00:05:37.379> talk<00:05:37.590> about<00:05:37.789> the<00:05:38.789> inverted<00:05:39.300> Harrier<00:05:40.639> which

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
to talk about the inverted Harrier which

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.489 
to talk about the inverted Harrier which
is<00:05:41.789> definitely<00:05:42.060> one<00:05:42.449> of<00:05:42.479> my<00:05:42.599> favorite<00:05:43.259> post

is definitely one of my favorite post

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:46.640 
is definitely one of my favorite post
