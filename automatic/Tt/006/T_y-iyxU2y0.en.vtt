it's okay to go ahead and release the
tension<00:01:58.729> on<00:01:59.030> your<00:01:59.149> hydraulic<00:01:59.869> floor<00:02:00.170> jack

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
tension on your hydraulic floor jack

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.960 
tension on your hydraulic floor jack
they're<00:02:01.070> gonna<00:02:01.190> want<00:02:01.399> to<00:02:01.490> let<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.670> tension

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
they're gonna want to let the tension

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.270 
they're gonna want to let the tension
off<00:02:02.090> slowly<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.259> vehicle<00:02:03.590> settles<00:02:04.070> down

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
off slowly so the vehicle settles down

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.460 
off slowly so the vehicle settles down
under<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.149> receiving<00:02:05.600> cups<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:06.080> your<00:02:06.229> jack

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
under the receiving cups of your jack

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:15.250 
under the receiving cups of your jack
stands<00:02:12.970> release<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.180> pressure<00:02:14.390> by<00:02:14.750> rotating

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
stands release the pressure by rotating

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.300 
stands release the pressure by rotating
the<00:02:15.500> handle<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.280> counterclockwise<00:02:16.870> motion

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the handle in a counterclockwise motion

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.500 
the handle in a counterclockwise motion
just<00:02:19.310> like<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.790> what<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.060> will<00:02:20.180> do<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.330> open

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
just like so what that will do is open

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.479 
just like so what that will do is open
the<00:02:20.750> release<00:02:20.870> valve<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.160> take<00:02:22.310> and

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
the release valve and you can take and

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.820 
the release valve and you can take and
speed<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.790> up<00:02:22.940> by<00:02:23.120> pushing<00:02:23.450> down<00:02:23.600> on<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
speed it up by pushing down on the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.880 
speed it up by pushing down on the
jacking<00:02:25.250> boom<00:02:25.459> itself
