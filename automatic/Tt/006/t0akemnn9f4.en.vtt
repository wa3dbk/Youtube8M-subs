things that make it possible for him to
use<00:04:06.540> these<00:04:06.780> weapons<00:04:07.049> but<00:04:07.470> as<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.950> also

what<00:04:48.870> could<00:04:49.110> we<00:04:49.290> do<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.620> mean<00:04:49.800> if<00:04:49.890> we<00:04:49.980> really

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
what could we do I mean if we really

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.740 
what could we do I mean if we really
think<00:04:50.370> he's<00:04:50.550> about<00:04:50.670> to<00:04:50.910> use<00:04:51.150> chemical<00:04:51.720> weapons

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
think he's about to use chemical weapons

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.690 
think he's about to use chemical weapons
maybe<00:04:52.350> not<00:04:52.500> today<00:04:52.650> maybe<00:04:52.770> not<00:04:53.100> tomorrow<00:04:53.220> but

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.430 
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but
if<00:04:54.120> we're<00:04:54.240> getting<00:04:54.450> this<00:04:54.600> concerned<00:04:55.020> about<00:04:55.260> it

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
if we're getting this concerned about it

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.200 
if we're getting this concerned about it
and<00:04:55.560> we're<00:04:55.710> saying<00:04:56.010> that's<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.430> red<00:04:56.640> line<00:04:56.880> that

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
and we're saying that's a red line that

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.910 
and we're saying that's a red line that
was<00:04:57.330> hillary<00:04:57.600> clinton's<00:04:57.900> term<00:04:57.930> what<00:04:58.830> does

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
was hillary clinton's term what does

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.290 
was hillary clinton's term what does
that<00:04:59.040> mean<00:04:59.840> well<00:05:00.840> for<00:05:01.380> American<00:05:02.130> options<00:05:02.880> I

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
that mean well for American options I

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.090 
that mean well for American options I
think<00:05:03.810> they're<00:05:03.990> actually<00:05:04.170> fairly<00:05:04.800> limited

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
think they're actually fairly limited

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.340 
think they're actually fairly limited
and<00:05:05.460> they're<00:05:05.580> all<00:05:05.730> dangerous<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.540> one<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:07.020> to

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
and they're all dangerous that one is to

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.680 
and they're all dangerous that one is to
destroy<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.100> chemical<00:05:08.280> weapons<00:05:08.970> in<00:05:09.210> place

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
destroy the chemical weapons in place

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.460 
destroy the chemical weapons in place
whether<00:05:10.530> through<00:05:10.950> aerial<00:05:11.490> attack<00:05:11.880> or<00:05:12.470> special

whether through aerial attack or special

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.140 
whether through aerial attack or special
operations<00:05:14.070> forces<00:05:14.430> on<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:14.700> ground<00:05:14.820> that

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
operations forces on the ground that

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.480 
operations forces on the ground that
obviously<00:05:15.660> puts<00:05:16.050> people<00:05:16.710> at<00:05:16.800> risk<00:05:16.860> it's<00:05:17.310> not

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
obviously puts people at risk it's not

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.700 
obviously puts people at risk it's not
easy<00:05:17.850> to<00:05:18.180> destroy<00:05:18.630> this<00:05:18.900> agent<00:05:19.440> of<00:05:19.530> these

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
easy to destroy this agent of these

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.130 
easy to destroy this agent of these
weapons<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:21.090> other<00:05:21.300> would<00:05:21.570> be<00:05:21.600> to<00:05:21.870> try<00:05:22.110> and

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
weapons the other would be to try and

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.620 
weapons the other would be to try and
capture<00:05:22.590> supplies<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.820> weapons<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.360> get

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
capture supplies of the weapons and get

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.360 
capture supplies of the weapons and get
them<00:05:24.840> out<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.170> country<00:05:25.380> that's<00:05:25.860> also<00:05:26.340> very

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
them out of the country that's also very

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.170 
them out of the country that's also very
dangerous<00:05:26.910> in<00:05:27.420> the<00:05:27.510> middle<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:28.530> civil<00:05:28.770> war

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
dangerous in the middle of a civil war

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.510 
dangerous in the middle of a civil war
so<00:05:30.180> it's<00:05:30.510> a<00:05:30.750> it's<00:05:31.230> a<00:05:31.380> very<00:05:31.770> dicey<00:05:32.130> proposition

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
so it's a it's a very dicey proposition

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.490 
so it's a it's a very dicey proposition
for<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.390> United<00:05:33.720> States<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.170> believe

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
for the United States and I believe

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.860 
for the United States and I believe

may be involved as well very late to be

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.850 
may be involved as well very late to be
worrying<00:05:41.880> about<00:05:42.360> this<00:05:42.840> at<00:05:43.050> this<00:05:43.200> point<00:05:43.440> what

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
worrying about this at this point what

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.040 
worrying about this at this point what
of<00:05:44.040> NATO<00:05:44.340> I<00:05:44.460> mean<00:05:44.730> this<00:05:44.820> this<00:05:45.150> has<00:05:45.750> to<00:05:45.930> be

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
of NATO I mean this this has to be

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.090 
of NATO I mean this this has to be
something<00:05:46.290> that<00:05:46.440> would<00:05:46.620> get<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.890> attention

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
something that would get the attention

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.010 
something that would get the attention
of<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.490> international<00:05:47.720> community<00:05:48.720> and<00:05:48.870> not

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
of the international community and not

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.800 
of the international community and not
just<00:05:49.290> America<00:05:49.940> well<00:05:50.940> I<00:05:50.970> think<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.330> Turks<00:05:51.600> are

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
just America well I think the Turks are

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.810 
just America well I think the Turks are
already<00:05:52.200> very<00:05:52.410> worried<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:53.040> Jordanians<00:05:53.670> and

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
Israelis as well i think in cooperation

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.400 
Israelis as well i think in cooperation
with<00:05:56.520> france<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.330> britain<00:05:57.810> and<00:05:58.170> perhaps

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
until Assad start using them we have to

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.190 
until Assad start using them we have to
consider<00:06:20.430> doing<00:06:21.150> something<00:06:21.480> to<00:06:21.840> prevent

their<00:06:22.500> use<00:06:22.710> because<00:06:23.190> if<00:06:23.940> he<00:06:24.180> unleashes

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
their use because if he unleashes

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.620 
their use because if he unleashes
chemical<00:06:25.290> weapons<00:06:25.620> against<00:06:26.040> the<00:06:26.130> opposition

his<00:07:13.050> own<00:07:13.140> people<00:07:13.350> oh<00:07:13.620> absolutely<00:07:14.340> I<00:07:14.790> don't

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.030 
his own people oh absolutely I don't

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.550 
his own people oh absolutely I don't
think<00:07:15.210> he<00:07:15.300> would<00:07:15.390> hesitate<00:07:15.600> if<00:07:16.050> he<00:07:16.170> thought<00:07:16.350> it

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
think he would hesitate if he thought it

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.500 
think he would hesitate if he thought it
was<00:07:16.590> that<00:07:16.980> or<00:07:17.220> the<00:07:17.370> end<00:07:17.520> of<00:07:17.670> his<00:07:17.850> regime<00:07:18.300> and

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:18.510 
was that or the end of his regime and

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.970 
was that or the end of his regime and
his<00:07:18.720> end<00:07:18.960> as<00:07:19.140> well<00:07:19.260> I<00:07:19.320> think<00:07:19.740> it<00:07:19.860> would<00:07:19.950> be

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
his end as well I think it would be

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.150
