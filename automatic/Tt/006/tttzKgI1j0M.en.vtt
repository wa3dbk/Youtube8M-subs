00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.090
 in this tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.059
 look for the programs that we have 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.410
 installed on our computer 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:13.820
 look for them within the operating system 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.440
 windows 8 or windows 8.1 so far with 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.990
 windows xp and windows 7 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.240
 we were used to looking for it in the 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.920
 bottom left of our 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.800
 windows operating system that is in 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.550
 start we click the start it 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.960
 displayed a menu or a window where 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.390
 we would have to select all the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.740
 programs and from there select the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.380
 folder that contains the program and 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.290
 then the program to my way of seeing with 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.990
 windows 8 has improved this search and is 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.840
 much more agile I 'll show you two 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.120
 ways to find these programs the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.670
 first way that is very similar to how 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.310
 was in windows xp windows 7 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.920
 would move the mouse to or in 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.800
 this case that I have windows 8.1 the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.890
 symbol of new windows is to say down 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.260
 to the left or if you are with 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.500
 windows 8 also the same 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.290
 down and to the left you click and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.880
 here at first on this screen os 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.530
 all the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.840
 programs that you have installed and well 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.440
 what I have is deleted all the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.330
 programs 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.240
 said this where then we find 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.340
 all the programs here you see an arrow 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.250
 looking towards the ground 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.659
 you click on it you know all the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.670
 programs that we have in our system 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.560
 operational simply we have not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.750
 moving with the left mouse to 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.250
 right and we're going to select the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.710
 program that we want 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.680
 how we left this page 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.320
 simply with escape button we left 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.260
 of the page the other way that is a lot 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.510
 more agile much simpler would be to 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.280
 through the search button where is 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.470
 that search button well all the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.950
 menus in windows 8 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.840
 it would go to the right of our 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.349
 screen well up 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.530
 to the corner or down to the corner and 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.280
 As you can see , a menu opens a 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.709
 new window here is simply doing 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.390
 click on search and we can search 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.959
 any program that we have in the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.379
 computer for example we can search in 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.989
 word because we are simply looking for 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.810
 the letters and we appear directly on 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.100
 word that we do not want to look for word but 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.710
 what we want to look for 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.110
 to be cache for example we go with the 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.430
 initials and we have it there simply 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.379
 we select 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.599
 and we would open the program in function 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.040
 how late or not late depending on 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.400
 processor speed is the drink 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.030
 in what we want to look for the program 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.489
 libreoffice greeter is the one that we 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.579
 allows the text editor by also 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.219
 the same free office and here we have 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.010
 all programs including files of 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:10.819
 songs that start with the word 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.410
 free we look for the libreoffice wheater and 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.660
 will open the document 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.880
 You see it is much easier much 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.940
 more agile with windows 8 than with windows 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.940
 xp
