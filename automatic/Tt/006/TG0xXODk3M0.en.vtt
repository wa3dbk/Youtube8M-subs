00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
going to finish off now with my left

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.969 
going to finish off now with my left
hand<00:01:11.060> show<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.119> how<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.479> goes<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.740> quite

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
hand show you how it goes it's quite

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.840 
hand show you how it goes it's quite
thick<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:17.090> I'm<00:01:18.090> gonna<00:01:18.240> start<00:01:19.280> putting<00:01:20.280> some<00:01:20.700> on

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
thick so I'm gonna start putting some on

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.899 
thick so I'm gonna start putting some on
now<00:01:21.560> doesn't<00:01:22.560> matter<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.159> overlap<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
now doesn't matter if you overlap it

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.200 
now doesn't matter if you overlap it
because<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.750> gives<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.080> better<00:01:25.229> effect

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
because I think it gives a better effect

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.950 
because I think it gives a better effect
but<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.909> sort<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.619> one<00:01:31.619> layer<00:01:32.960> if

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
but you can just do sort of one layer if

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.460 
but you can just do sort of one layer if
you<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.770> cracks<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.520> thin<00:01:36.170> or<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you want the cracks to be thin or you

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
you want the cracks to be thin or you
can<00:01:37.740> overlap<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:39.000> thicker<00:01:39.930> look
