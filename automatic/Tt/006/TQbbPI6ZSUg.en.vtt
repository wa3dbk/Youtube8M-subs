00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to feel a little fucked up the key is

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
to feel a little fucked up the key is
what<00:00:57.149> people<00:00:57.360> want<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> theory<00:00:58.859> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
what people want it what the theory is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.049 
what people want it what the theory is
with<00:00:59.309> these<00:00:59.489> trainers<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.180> these<00:01:00.329> gurus<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
with these trainers with these gurus is

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.939 
with these trainers with these gurus is
essentially<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.930> sit<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.140> eat<00:01:04.470> carbs

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
essentially to just sit there eat carbs

and<00:01:05.900> fucking<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.590> know<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.580> goes<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and fucking you know it all goes to the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 
and fucking you know it all goes to the
muscle<00:01:09.360> right<00:01:09.540> here's<00:01:10.020> my<00:01:10.229> theory<00:01:10.650> on

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
muscle right here's my theory on

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.010 
muscle right here's my theory on
training<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.580> lot<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.090> trainers<00:01:12.299> stop<00:01:12.720> about

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
training a lot of trainers stop about

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899 
training a lot of trainers stop about
Wednesday<00:01:13.350> before<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> show<00:01:14.130> now<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.490> pull

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
Wednesday before the show now I do pull

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.240 
Wednesday before the show now I do pull
cardio<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:15.540> no<00:01:16.290> later<00:01:16.560> than<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.890> Thursday

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
before the show and the cardio of the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
before the show and the cardio of the
week<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.869> show<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.470> gonna<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.159> low

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
week of the show is gonna be low

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
week of the show is gonna be low
intensity<00:01:20.790> cardio<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.840> some<00:01:21.990> blood

my<00:01:23.220> theory<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:24.240> elevates<00:01:24.479> after

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
my theory is what elevates after

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560 
my theory is what elevates after
training<00:01:25.710> protein<00:01:26.250> synthesis<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:27.390> also

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
training protein synthesis what also

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.350 
training protein synthesis what also
increases<00:01:28.350> insulin<00:01:28.890> sensitivity<00:01:29.549> what

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
increases insulin sensitivity what

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.380 
increases insulin sensitivity what
happens<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.530> carb<00:01:31.860> loading<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
happens if your carb loading and you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
happens if your carb loading and you
just<00:01:33.630> don't<00:01:33.900> train<00:01:34.290> you're<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.740> gonna<00:01:34.950> have

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
just don't train you're not gonna have

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.890 
just don't train you're not gonna have
those<00:01:35.369> receptors<00:01:36.000> up<00:01:36.180> taking<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
those receptors up taking the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.780 
those receptors up taking the
carbohydrate<00:01:37.439> into<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> muscle<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.670> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
carbohydrate into the muscle now if you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.030 
carbohydrate into the muscle now if you
train<00:01:39.210> now<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.780> saying<00:01:40.049> fucking<00:01:40.590> go<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
train now I'm not saying fucking go I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
train now I'm not saying fucking go I
did<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.700> four<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:41.970> five<00:01:42.090> two<00:01:42.390> days<00:01:42.570> out<00:01:42.750> for
