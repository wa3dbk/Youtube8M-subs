unplug it from the wall turn it all the
way<00:00:37.350> off<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.070> remove<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> battery

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879

that's<00:00:39.149> important<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.620> saying

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
that's important and like I was saying

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
that's important and like I was saying
there<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.190> no<00:00:41.370> easier<00:00:41.820> upgrade<00:00:42.090> than<00:00:42.239> adding

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there is no easier upgrade than adding

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.709 
there is no easier upgrade than adding
memory<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> notebook<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:45.360> joy<00:00:45.690> of

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
memory to a notebook and the joy of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.180 
memory to a notebook and the joy of
notebooks<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> easiest<00:00:47.039> things

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
notebooks and one of the easiest things

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.500 
notebooks and one of the easiest things
about<00:00:47.489> them<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.820> fact<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.030> usually<00:00:48.329> put

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
about them is the fact that usually put

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.040 
about them is the fact that usually put
these<00:00:48.890> ports<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.070> easy<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> find<00:00:50.730> places

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
these ports in easy to find places

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
these ports in easy to find places
dedicated<00:00:52.050> access<00:00:52.230> ports<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.800> getting<00:00:52.980> at

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
dedicated access ports for getting at

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.920 
dedicated access ports for getting at
things<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.460> memory<00:00:53.730> hard<00:00:54.300> drives<00:00:54.360> other

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
things like memory hard drives other

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
things like memory hard drives other
parts<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.640> generally<00:00:56.640> speaking<00:00:56.820> easy

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
parts like that generally speaking easy

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
parts like that generally speaking easy
to<00:00:57.449> install<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> remove<00:00:57.930> these<00:00:58.260> parts<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.800> if

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to install and remove these parts and if

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.209 
to install and remove these parts and if
you're<00:00:59.670> buying<00:00:59.879> memory<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:01.710> even<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> use

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
you're buying memory you even get to use

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.979 
you're buying memory you even get to use
smaller<00:01:02.850> size<00:01:03.149> parts<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.780> might<00:01:03.960> be

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
smaller size parts then you might be

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
smaller size parts then you might be
used<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> PC<00:01:04.949> side<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.280> things<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.090> as

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
used to on the PC side of things and as

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.760 
used to on the PC side of things and as
so<00:01:06.479> when<00:01:06.780> we're<00:01:06.869> talking<00:01:06.990> memory<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.560> well

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so when we're talking memory as well

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.700 
so when we're talking memory as well
similar<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> similar<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.689> computer<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
similar to similar to your computer you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770 
similar to similar to your computer you
want<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.130> matched<00:01:11.520> pair<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> notebook<00:01:12.570> if

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
want a matched pair for a notebook if

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
want a matched pair for a notebook if
you're<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.260> two<00:01:13.439> sticks<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.220> if

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
you're going to go with two sticks so if

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.359 
you're going to go with two sticks so if
you<00:01:15.090> pop<00:01:15.720> open<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.229> notebook<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.799> find<00:01:17.130> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you pop open your notebook and find that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.020 
you pop open your notebook and find that
in<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> access<00:01:18.240> port<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.990> bottom<00:01:19.140> side

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
in the access port on the bottom side

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
in the access port on the bottom side
where<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.180> memory<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.509> located<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.320> we've

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
where your memory is located and we've

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.080 
where your memory is located and we've
got<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.820> find<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
got that in there now if you find you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.760 
got that in there now if you find you
only<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.570> stick<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.350> would<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.619> one

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
only have one stick that would be one

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.080 
only have one stick that would be one
way<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> upgrade<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.460> could<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.939> what

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
way to upgrade you could just see what

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.539 
way to upgrade you could just see what
type<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.659> order<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.259> same<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.040> grab

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
type it is order that same one and grab

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.679 
type it is order that same one and grab
another<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.850> they're<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> two<00:01:30.329> memory

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
another one they're the two memory

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
another one they're the two memory
modules<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.070> lot<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.430> memory

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
modules right there a lot of memory

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
modules right there a lot of memory
manufacturers<00:01:33.329> actually<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.320> guide

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
manufacturers actually have a guide

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.590 
manufacturers actually have a guide
that'll<00:01:35.189> help<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.909> look<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> name

at<00:01:42.570> totally<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.619> super<00:01:43.890> helpful<00:01:44.070> now

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
at totally I can be super helpful now

at totally I can be super helpful now
for<00:01:44.610> older<00:01:45.000> notebooks<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.509> find<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.930> they're

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
for older notebooks I find that they're

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.359 
for older notebooks I find that they're
pretty<00:01:46.200> conservative<00:01:46.560> about<00:01:46.920> how<00:01:47.040> much

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
pretty conservative about how much

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.340 
pretty conservative about how much
memory<00:01:47.579> will<00:01:47.939> fit<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> notebook<00:01:48.899> they'll

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
memory will fit in the notebook they'll

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.289 
memory will fit in the notebook they'll
usually<00:01:49.619> limit<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.130> about<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> gigabyte<00:01:50.759> now

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
usually limit it to about a gigabyte now

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
usually limit it to about a gigabyte now
I<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.500> never<00:01:52.680> seen<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> notebook<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
I have I have never seen a notebook that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920 
I have I have never seen a notebook that
won't<00:01:53.520> take<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.820> least<00:01:53.939> two<00:01:54.210> right<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.750> just

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
won't take at least two right so just

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780 
won't take at least two right so just
let<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.950> most<00:01:56.219> notebooks<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> be

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
let you know on most notebooks you be

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.039 
let you know on most notebooks you be
able<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> at<00:01:57.240> least<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> one

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
able to at least go with the one

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.530 
able to at least go with the one
gigabyte<00:01:58.350> stick<00:01:58.649> times<00:01:58.950> two<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.939> now

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
gigabyte stick times two on that so now

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
gigabyte stick times two on that so now
getting<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.680> memory<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.159> out<00:02:02.280> really

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
getting that memory in and out really

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.999 
getting that memory in and out really
easy<00:02:03.329> there's<00:02:03.869> actually<00:02:04.200> 4<00:02:04.409> notebook<00:02:04.710> memory

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
easy there's actually 4 notebook memory

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.580 
easy there's actually 4 notebook memory
there's<00:02:06.000> two<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.360> tabs<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.869> each<00:02:07.020> side<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
there's two little tabs on each side to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.499 
there's two little tabs on each side to
pop<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.759> joy<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
pop that out and the joy with it is you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.119 
pop that out and the joy with it is you
just<00:02:09.539> barely<00:02:10.020> slide<00:02:10.379> these<00:02:10.590> little<00:02:10.770> tabs<00:02:10.950> on

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
just barely slide these little tabs on

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.400 
just barely slide these little tabs on
each<00:02:11.280> side<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:12.420> should<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> little

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
each side you should have a little

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
each side you should have a little
response<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:13.980> pop-up<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:14.760> once<00:02:15.360> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
response to it pop-up and then once it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.920 
response to it pop-up and then once it
does<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.320> remove<00:02:16.620> these<00:02:16.770> as<00:02:16.980> such<00:02:17.930> straight

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
does you remove these as such straight

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.980 
does you remove these as such straight
out<00:02:19.140> replace<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.370> with<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.180> module<00:02:21.630> same

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
out replace it with the module same

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.840 
out replace it with the module same
orientation<00:02:22.230> watch<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> notch<00:02:23.460> that

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850

memory inside the computer trick being

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.710 
memory inside the computer trick being
you<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.910> kind<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.090> leave<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.360> there<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.630> then

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
you just kind of leave it there and then

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.150 
you just kind of leave it there and then
you<00:02:30.840> give<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.080> gentle<00:02:31.230> press<00:02:31.590> down<00:02:31.890> once

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
you give it a gentle press down once

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.500 
you give it a gentle press down once
it's<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.520> slot<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.120> press<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.390> down

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
it's in the slot you just press it down

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.450 
it's in the slot you just press it down
and<00:02:33.810> locks<00:02:34.080> itself<00:02:34.350> into<00:02:34.590> place<00:02:34.710> now<00:02:35.340> of

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
and locks itself into place now of

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.400 
and locks itself into place now of
course<00:02:35.610> there's<00:02:35.880> two<00:02:36.360> there<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:36.720> two<00:02:36.840> modules

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
course there's two there are two modules

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.570 
course there's two there are two modules
and<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.770> do<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> bottom<00:02:38.250> one<00:02:38.340> first

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
and you have to do the bottom one first

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.120 
and you have to do the bottom one first
but<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.600> stays<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:39.990> there<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:40.770> what's<00:02:40.980> in

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
but it stays in there like what's in

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.950 
but it stays in there like what's in
there<00:02:41.250> dude<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.600> gonna<00:02:42.690> say<00:02:42.840> there

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
to get the one out from underneath of it

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.410 
to get the one out from underneath of it
though<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.790> remove<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.120> bottom

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
though you have to remove that bottom

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.890 
though you have to remove that bottom
one<00:02:45.450> first<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.110> there<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.310> now<00:02:47.880> for<00:02:48.780> the

requires<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.340> actually<00:03:11.730> remove<00:03:11.880> about

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
requires you to actually remove about

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.390 
requires you to actually remove about
1520<00:03:12.840> screws<00:03:13.110> yeah<00:03:13.680> that's<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.040> far<00:03:14.250> more

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
1520 screws yeah that's a far more

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.070 
1520 screws yeah that's a far more
difficult<00:03:14.610> upgrade<00:03:15.180> when<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.450> say<00:03:15.630> port<00:03:15.960> you

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
difficult upgrade when you say port you

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.560 
difficult upgrade when you say port you
mean<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.470> lid<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:16.980> can<00:03:17.010> unscrew<00:03:17.490> or<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.540> a

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
mean like a lid you can unscrew or on a

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.000 
mean like a lid you can unscrew or on a
lot<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.020> older<00:03:19.230> Mac<00:03:19.410> books<00:03:19.650> it's<00:03:19.770> funny<00:03:19.920> I

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
lot of the older Mac books it's funny I

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.430 
lot of the older Mac books it's funny I
just<00:03:20.070> upgraded<00:03:20.730> actually<00:03:21.230> Lisbon<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.290> folks

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
this MacBook Pro to get inside of it you

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.960 
this MacBook Pro to get inside of it you
had<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.780> pull<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.290> entire<00:03:31.410> bottom<00:03:32.400> off<00:03:32.580> and

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
had to pull the entire bottom off and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.580 
had to pull the entire bottom off and
the<00:03:33.030> top<00:03:33.270> off<00:03:33.570> have<00:03:33.900> some<00:03:34.080> good<00:03:34.260> tools<00:03:34.440> if

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
the top off have some good tools if

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.050 
the top off have some good tools if
you're<00:03:34.680> gonna<00:03:34.770> go<00:03:34.890> down<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.070> route<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.730> I

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
you're gonna go down that route and I

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.699 
you're gonna go down that route and I
cannot<00:03:36.450> stress<00:03:36.690> enough<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.230> where<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.530> want<00:03:37.680> a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
cannot stress enough to where you want a

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.680 
cannot stress enough to where you want a
nice<00:03:37.860> clean<00:03:38.130> workspace<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.209> if<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.510> screw

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
nice clean workspace so if the screw

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.150 
nice clean workspace so if the screw
goes<00:03:39.840> flying<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.290> can<00:03:40.440> hopefully<00:03:40.620> find<00:03:40.770> it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
goes flying you can hopefully find it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.030 
goes flying you can hopefully find it
and<00:03:41.550> tape<00:03:42.270> things<00:03:43.110> like<00:03:43.260> painters<00:03:43.620> tape<00:03:43.800> put

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
and tape things like painters tape put

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.170 
and tape things like painters tape put
it<00:03:44.070> strip<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.520> down<00:03:44.730> on<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:44.940> table<00:03:45.120> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
it strip of that down on the table and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.410 
it strip of that down on the table and
stick<00:03:45.450> all<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> parts<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:48.150> have<00:03:48.270> less

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
stick all the parts to it you have less

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.790 
stick all the parts to it you have less
of<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.600> chance<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.870> losing<00:03:49.020> stuff<00:03:49.410> basically

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
of a chance of losing stuff basically

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.340 
of a chance of losing stuff basically
also<00:03:50.390> we're<00:03:51.390> talking<00:03:51.660> about<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.900> ports<00:03:52.230> on

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
also we're talking about the ports on

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.650 
also we're talking about the ports on
the<00:03:52.440> bottom<00:03:52.770> of<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.950> notebook<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:54.270> can<00:03:54.450> check

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
the bottom of the notebook you can check

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.479 
the bottom of the notebook you can check
in<00:03:54.750> they're<00:03:54.870> all<00:03:54.930> labeled<00:03:55.170> as<00:03:55.440> such<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.010> I

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
in they're all labeled as such and I

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.250 
in they're all labeled as such and I
generally<00:03:57.090> would<00:03:57.270> recommend<00:03:57.600> just<00:03:57.870> explore<00:03:58.230> a

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
generally would recommend just explore a

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.420 
generally would recommend just explore a
little<00:03:58.410> bit<00:03:58.590> take<00:03:58.770> them<00:03:58.920> off<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.220> see<00:03:59.310> what's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
little bit take them off and see what's

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.190 
little bit take them off and see what's
under<00:03:59.640> each<00:03:59.760> one<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.540> might<00:04:00.660> have<00:04:00.720> ports<00:04:01.110> you

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
under each one you might have ports you

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.150 
under each one you might have ports you
don't<00:04:01.350> need<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:01.770> this<00:04:01.890> particular

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
don't need like on this particular

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.800 
don't need like on this particular
notebook<00:04:02.580> there's<00:04:02.910> actually<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.239> space<00:04:03.510> for<00:04:03.720> an

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
notebook there's actually a space for an

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.479 
notebook there's actually a space for an
extra<00:04:04.110> hard<00:04:04.320> drive<00:04:04.590> what<00:04:05.100> we're<00:04:05.220> not<00:04:05.280> going<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
extra hard drive what we're not going to

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.760 
extra hard drive what we're not going to
bother<00:04:05.610> with<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.970> one<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.440> there's<00:04:07.440> no<00:04:07.590> harm

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
bother with that one but there's no harm

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.900 
bother with that one but there's no harm
in<00:04:07.860> damage<00:04:08.190> really<00:04:08.340> just<00:04:08.640> make<00:04:08.760> sure<00:04:08.850> you

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
in damage really just make sure you

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.430 
in damage really just make sure you
don't<00:04:08.970> lose<00:04:09.180> your<00:04:09.209> screws<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.840> get

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
don't lose your screws and get

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.510 
don't lose your screws and get
everything<00:04:10.590> put<00:04:10.830> back<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.100> way<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.250> was<00:04:11.280> now

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
everything put back the way it was now

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.760 
just the holder for the new drive and in
this<00:04:38.890> case<00:04:39.130> our<00:04:39.340> SSD<00:04:39.870> will<00:04:40.870> slip<00:04:41.320> right<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.650> the

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
this case our SSD will slip right in the

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.830 
this case our SSD will slip right in the
way<00:04:41.890> it<00:04:42.010> was<00:04:42.160> there's<00:04:43.030> some<00:04:43.210> screw<00:04:43.420> holes<00:04:43.600> on

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
way it was there's some screw holes on

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.050 
way it was there's some screw holes on
the<00:04:43.930> side<00:04:44.260> we<00:04:45.040> just<00:04:45.070> add<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:47.970> put<00:04:48.970> our

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
the side we just add that to put our

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.410 
the side we just add that to put our
fasteners<00:04:49.480> back<00:04:49.750> in<00:04:50.850> Drive<00:04:51.850> is<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.180> same

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
fasteners back in Drive is in the same

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.910 
fasteners back in Drive is in the same
orientation<00:04:53.130> in<00:04:54.130> this<00:04:54.730> case<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:56.530> is<00:04:56.740> the

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
orientation in this case this is the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.430 
orientation in this case this is the
outside<00:04:57.460> of<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.850> drive<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.540> connectors<00:04:59.260> are

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
outside of the drive the connectors are

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.590 
outside of the drive the connectors are
on<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.740> inside<00:04:59.950> of<00:05:00.700> where<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:00.970> connector<00:05:01.420> are

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
on the inside of where the connector are

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.320 
on the inside of where the connector are
where<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.930> where<00:05:02.890> the<00:05:03.040> how<00:05:03.490> it<00:05:03.640> slides<00:05:03.820> in<00:05:04.090> and

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
where the where the how it slides in and

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.680 
where the where the how it slides in and
as<00:05:04.660> such<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:06.340> reinsert<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.000> these<00:05:07.420> literally

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
as such to reinsert it these literally

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.050 
as such to reinsert it these literally
just<00:05:07.960> slide<00:05:08.080> right<00:05:08.410> back<00:05:08.440> in<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:08.980> nice<00:05:09.910> thing

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
just slide right back in so nice thing

just slide right back in so nice thing
about<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.300> SATA<00:05:10.540> connectors<00:05:11.080> is<00:05:11.290> they're

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
about the SATA connectors is they're

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.460 
about the SATA connectors is they're
super<00:05:11.770> easy<00:05:12.040> to<00:05:12.460> engage<00:05:13.420> in<00:05:13.690> they're<00:05:13.870> totally

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
super easy to engage in they're totally

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.320 
super easy to engage in they're totally
and<00:05:14.650> for<00:05:15.010> that<00:05:15.100> one<00:05:15.310> has<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.820> little<00:05:15.910> tab<00:05:16.300> that

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
and for that one has a little tab that

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.780 
and for that one has a little tab that
tucks<00:05:16.750> under<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.260> the<00:05:18.070> coverage<00:05:18.340> goes<00:05:18.580> right

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
tucks under and the coverage goes right

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.020 
tucks under and the coverage goes right
back<00:05:18.940> on<00:05:19.230> that's<00:05:20.230> that<00:05:21.100> is<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.490> hard<00:05:21.820> drive

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
back on that's that is the hard drive

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.370 
back on that's that is the hard drive
removed<00:05:22.390> that's<00:05:22.600> all<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.870> data<00:05:23.110> being

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
removed that's all the data being

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.740 
removed that's all the data being
removed<00:05:23.800> so<00:05:24.160> before<00:05:24.820> you<00:05:25.030> do<00:05:25.210> that<00:05:25.360> stuff<00:05:25.630> you

basically have those files ready to go

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.830 
basically have those files ready to go
and<00:05:44.410> create<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.370> USB<00:05:45.910> installer<00:05:46.330> for<00:05:46.690> your

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
and create a USB installer for your

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.780 
and create a USB installer for your
favorite<00:05:47.169> operating<00:05:47.620> system<00:05:48.010> I<00:05:48.160> don't<00:05:48.640> care

favorite operating system I don't care

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.950 
favorite operating system I don't care
if<00:05:48.910> you're<00:05:49.030> using<00:05:49.150> Linux<00:05:49.510> or<00:05:49.570> what<00:05:49.690> this<00:05:49.810> one

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
if you're using Linux or what this one

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.260 
if you're using Linux or what this one
happens<00:05:50.230> to<00:05:50.260> be<00:05:50.350> Linux<00:05:51.010> Mint<00:05:51.160> I<00:05:51.520> also<00:05:51.970> have<00:05:52.150> one

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
happens to be Linux Mint I also have one

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.050 
happens to be Linux Mint I also have one
for<00:05:52.419> win7<00:05:52.870> at<00:05:53.200> one<00:05:53.320> for<00:05:53.470> win8<00:05:53.790> that<00:05:54.790> USB

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
for win7 at one for win8 that USB

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.730 
for win7 at one for win8 that USB
installer<00:05:55.419> is<00:05:55.690> so<00:05:55.870> much<00:05:56.080> faster<00:05:56.470> than<00:05:56.590> using

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
installer is so much faster than using

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.370 
installer is so much faster than using
the<00:05:57.010> old<00:05:57.510> basically<00:05:58.510> optical<00:05:58.870> media<00:05:59.110> it's

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
the old basically optical media it's

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.140 
the old basically optical media it's
just<00:05:59.740> much<00:05:59.980> quicker<00:06:00.220> and<00:06:00.400> also<00:06:00.460> test<00:06:00.910> that

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
just much quicker and also test that

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.530 
just much quicker and also test that
boot<00:06:01.870> media<00:06:02.200> your<00:06:02.650> new<00:06:02.830> installer<00:06:03.280> on<00:06:03.580> the

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
boot media your new installer on the

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.050 
boot media your new installer on the
notebook<00:06:04.750> prior<00:06:05.470> to<00:06:05.890> basically<00:06:06.430> swapping<00:06:07.000> out

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
notebook prior to basically swapping out

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.950 
notebook prior to basically swapping out
the<00:06:07.120> hard<00:06:07.330> drive<00:06:07.480> so<00:06:07.600> you<00:06:07.630> can<00:06:07.690> make<00:06:07.840> sure

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
the hard drive so you can make sure

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.180 
the hard drive so you can make sure
everything's<00:06:08.410> working<00:06:08.470> right<00:06:08.740> that<00:06:08.980> you<00:06:09.070> can

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
everything's working right that you can

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.070 
everything's working right that you can
get<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.490> that<00:06:09.610> boot<00:06:09.850> menu<00:06:10.000> that<00:06:10.630> if<00:06:10.750> you<00:06:10.870> need

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
get to that boot menu that if you need

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.420 
get to that boot menu that if you need
to<00:06:11.260> you<00:06:11.500> might<00:06:11.620> need<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:11.860> go<00:06:11.980> into<00:06:12.310> the

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
to you might need to go into the

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.580 
to you might need to go into the
notebooks<00:06:12.760> BIOS<00:06:13.090> and<00:06:13.300> set<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.690> USB<00:06:14.020> device

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
notebooks BIOS and set that USB device

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.620 
notebooks BIOS and set that USB device
as<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:15.550> primary<00:06:15.760> hard<00:06:16.120> drive<00:06:16.330> so<00:06:16.450> you<00:06:16.510> can

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
as the primary hard drive so you can

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.750 
as the primary hard drive so you can
boot<00:06:16.840> from<00:06:17.020> it<00:06:17.110> things<00:06:17.710> like<00:06:17.800> that<00:06:18.130> now<00:06:18.430> I'll

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
boot from it things like that now I'll

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.390 
boot from it things like that now I'll
get<00:06:18.970> into<00:06:19.120> that<00:06:19.180> a<00:06:19.300> little<00:06:19.690> bit<00:06:19.810> more<00:06:19.990> now<00:06:20.530> with

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
get into that a little bit more now with

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.400 
get into that a little bit more now with
