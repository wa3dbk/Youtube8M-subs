everything right right well what about
now<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.250> thought<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.700> now<00:02:56.910> like<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.300> they're

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
now I thought that now like this they're

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.880 
now I thought that now like this they're
really<00:02:57.810> getting<00:02:58.050> into<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.260> cuz<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.680> many

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
really getting into that cuz so many

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.770 
really getting into that cuz so many
even<00:02:59.190> why<00:02:59.310> I'm<00:02:59.490> gonna<00:02:59.580> doing<00:02:59.940> extensions<00:03:00.540> and

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
even why I'm gonna doing extensions and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.670 
even why I'm gonna doing extensions and
tracks<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.740> we<00:03:02.570> might<00:03:03.570> do<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.230> fusion

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
tracks and we might do the of the fusion

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.830 
tracks and we might do the of the fusion
right<00:03:05.180> what<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:06.270> think<00:03:06.450> about<00:03:06.510> fusion

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
right what do you think about fusion

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.060 
right what do you think about fusion
would<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:06.990> have<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> diffusion<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:12.950> they<00:03:13.950> say

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
would you have a diffusion you they say

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.890 
would you have a diffusion you they say
it<00:03:14.130> takes<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.370> here<00:03:14.490> about<00:03:14.580> two<00:03:14.820> right<00:03:17.900> what's

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
it takes you here about two right what's

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.060 
it takes you here about two right what's
the<00:03:18.990> other<00:03:19.080> one<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.380> another<00:03:19.590> one<00:03:19.770> besides

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
the other one is another one besides

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.060 
the other one is another one besides
fusion<00:03:20.520> that<00:03:20.640> um<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:22.440> like<00:03:22.560> little<00:03:22.800> wire

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
fusion that um it's like little wire

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.950 
fusion that um it's like little wire
it's<00:03:23.400> not<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.730> Google<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.120> not<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.420> glue<00:03:24.720> or
