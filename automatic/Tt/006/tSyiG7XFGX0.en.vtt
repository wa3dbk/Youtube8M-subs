translated into a real-life game that we
can<00:00:14.580> upload<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.690> three<00:00:16.470> chasers<00:00:17.010> two

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
can upload so you have three chasers two

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.730 
can upload so you have three chasers two
beaters<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:18.240> keeper<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.750> seeker<00:00:18.779> there's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
beaters a keeper and a seeker there's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.620 
beaters a keeper and a seeker there's
three<00:00:19.980> hoops<00:00:20.189> either<00:00:20.430> side<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.240> point<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
three hoops either side the point of the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.720 
three hoops either side the point of the
chaser<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.619> get<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> Quaffle<00:00:23.039> which<00:00:23.580> is

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
chaser is to get the Quaffle which is

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.220 
chaser is to get the Quaffle which is
the<00:00:23.850> main<00:00:24.000> ball<00:00:24.269> now<00:00:24.660> put<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.960> through<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the main ball now put it through the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.230 
the main ball now put it through the
hoops<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.680> score<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.189> ten<00:00:26.340> points<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.119> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
hoops to score for ten points it's a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.750 
hoops to score for ten points it's a
full-contact<00:00:27.769> session<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.279> basically

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
full-contact session so it's basically

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.089 
full-contact session so it's basically
rugby<00:00:30.150> tackling<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> bourbon<00:00:31.230> yo<00:00:31.439> whip

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
rugby tackling it with a bourbon yo whip

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.280 
rugby tackling it with a bourbon yo whip
beating<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.149> nice<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.840> red<00:00:34.020> ball

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
beating you get a nice little red ball

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.470 
beating you get a nice little red ball
and<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.980> idea<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and the idea of it is that you have to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.540 
and the idea of it is that you have to
hit<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.320> opposing<00:00:37.770> players<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.460> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
hit the opposing players with it if you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.709 
hit the opposing players with it if you
hit<00:00:38.640> them<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.510> drop

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
hit them with that they have to drop

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.940 
hit them with that they have to drop
whatever<00:00:39.930> they're<00:00:40.140> carrying<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.649> return

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
whatever they're carrying and return

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.119 
whatever they're carrying and return
back<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> their<00:00:41.370> hoops

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
back to their hoops

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.549 
back to their hoops
the<00:00:43.519> point<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.300> seeking<00:00:44.749> and<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:44.960> snitch<00:00:45.289> a

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
the point the seeking and the snitch a

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:46.930 
the point the seeking and the snitch a
lot<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:45.949> people<00:00:46.190> asked<00:00:46.429> what<00:00:46.519> the<00:00:46.670> snitch<00:00:46.909> is

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
lot of people asked what the snitch is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.130 
lot of people asked what the snitch is
the<00:00:47.929> snitch<00:00:48.140> itself<00:00:48.589> is<00:00:48.859> this

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.610 

and<00:00:51.800> attached<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:52.700> is<00:00:52.910> me<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:53.750> my<00:00:54.230> job<00:00:54.470> as

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
them around stop them push them away to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.889 
them around stop them push them away to
prevent<00:01:01.850> them<00:01:02.150> from<00:01:02.180> getting<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.660> snitch

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
because once they get the snitch that

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.130 
because once they get the snitch that
finishes<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.180> game<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.690> a<00:01:05.750> winner<00:01:05.960> is

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
finishes the game and a winner is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.040 
finishes the game and a winner is
decided<00:01:06.520> well<00:01:07.520> unfortunately<00:01:07.790> due<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.810> health

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
decided well unfortunately due to health

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.540 
decided well unfortunately due to health
and<00:01:09.229> safety<00:01:09.320> now<00:01:09.680> we're<00:01:09.860> not<00:01:09.950> allowed<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.340> fly

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
and safety now we're not allowed to fly

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.140 
and safety now we're not allowed to fly
anymore<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.479> it<00:01:11.840> does<00:01:12.140> generally<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:13.150> ears

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
anymore so it does generally the ears

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.570 
anymore so it does generally the ears
heartbreak<00:01:14.630> but<00:01:15.050> generally<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.190> biggest

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
heartbreak but generally the biggest

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.249 
heartbreak but generally the biggest
similarity<00:01:17.300> is<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.479> we<00:01:17.810> have<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.080> use<00:01:18.229> a

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
similarity is that we have to use a

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.890 
similarity is that we have to use a
broom<00:01:18.680> we're<00:01:19.610> not<00:01:19.700> allowed<00:01:19.909> to<00:01:19.940> take<00:01:20.720> the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
broom we're not allowed to take the

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.480 
broom we're not allowed to take the
broom<00:01:21.080> from<00:01:21.259> between<00:01:21.470> our<00:01:21.680> legs<00:01:21.800> otherwise<00:01:22.190> we

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
broom from between our legs otherwise we

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.010 
broom from between our legs otherwise we
have<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.640> return<00:01:23.180> back<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.509> hoops<00:01:23.720> again

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
have to return back to the hoops again

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.070 
have to return back to the hoops again
but<00:01:24.590> other<00:01:24.830> than<00:01:24.979> that<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.210> scoring<00:01:26.539> it's

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
but other than that and the scoring it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.440 
but other than that and the scoring it's
turned<00:01:27.830> into<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.160> game<00:01:28.430> where<00:01:28.789> it's<00:01:28.970> taken

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
turned into a game where it's taken
