00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
view each other at the front and you can

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.170 
view each other at the front and you can
see<00:02:16.620> exactly<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:17.130> you're<00:02:17.280> doing<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.030> this

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
see exactly what you're doing so this

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
one's better to record with them may

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.860 
one's better to record with them may
have<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.950> camera<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.970> cameras<00:02:21.390> pretty<00:02:21.450> good
