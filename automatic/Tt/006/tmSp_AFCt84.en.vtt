a few usage scenarios however this

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
a few usage scenarios however this

overall we like the the user interface
of<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.570> application<00:01:39.659> because<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:41.100> see

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
of the application because you can see

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.050 
of the application because you can see
that<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.799> intuitive<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.040> very<00:01:44.520> easy<00:01:44.759> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that it's a intuitive and very easy to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.539 
that it's a intuitive and very easy to
operate<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.600> however<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.619> slightly<00:01:47.100> more

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
operate with however a slightly more

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.359 
operate with however a slightly more
difficult<00:01:47.759> part<00:01:48.450> comes<00:01:48.750> when<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
difficult part comes when you have to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.969 
difficult part comes when you have to
draw<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:51.030> paint<00:01:51.450> over<00:01:52.020> your<00:01:52.049> image<00:01:52.500> because

draw or paint over your image because

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
draw or paint over your image because

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
obviously you'll be doing this with your

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.830 
obviously you'll be doing this with your
fingers<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.729> example<00:01:57.149> let's<00:01:57.329> say<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.570> we

one of them for example is that when you
add<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.700> new<00:04:31.790> text<00:04:32.570> layer<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:34.280> let's<00:04:34.700> say<00:04:34.910> that

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
add a new text layer and let's say that

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.700 
add a new text layer and let's say that
we've<00:04:36.680> chosen<00:04:36.950> what<00:04:37.490> our<00:04:38.450> what<00:04:39.140> we<00:04:39.290> want<00:04:39.530> our

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
we've chosen what our what we want our

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
we've chosen what our what we want our
text<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.580> say<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.150> when<00:04:42.140> we're<00:04:42.380> done

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
text to say and when we're done

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.780 
text to say and when we're done
manipulating<00:04:43.730> it

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
manipulating it

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.670 
manipulating it
this<00:04:46.790> actually<00:04:47.000> is<00:04:47.780> automatically

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
this actually is automatically

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.990 
this actually is automatically
rasterized<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.700> created<00:04:50.270> as<00:04:50.420> a<00:04:50.890> rasterized

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
rasterized and created as a rasterized

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.780 
rasterized and created as a rasterized
layer<00:04:53.000> here<00:04:53.360> so<00:04:53.420> we<00:04:53.840> can't<00:04:54.170> further<00:04:54.560> tweak<00:04:55.370> the

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
layer here so we can't further tweak the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.440 
layer here so we can't further tweak the
text<00:04:56.210> here<00:04:56.720> we<00:04:56.960> just<00:04:57.320> we<00:04:58.040> either<00:04:58.490> have<00:04:58.970> to<00:04:59.180> get

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
text here we just we either have to get

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.640 
text here we just we either have to get
rid<00:04:59.690> of<00:04:59.840> it<00:04:59.960> or<00:05:00.110> add<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.770> new<00:05:01.150> text<00:05:02.150> layer<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:03.500> it

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
rid of it or add a new text layer so it

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.400 
rid of it or add a new text layer so it
doesn't<00:05:04.040> stay<00:05:04.280> as<00:05:04.580> an<00:05:04.850> editable<00:05:05.360> text<00:05:05.990> layer

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
doesn't stay as an editable text layer

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.920 
doesn't stay as an editable text layer
another<00:05:07.030> limitation<00:05:08.030> of<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.270> program<00:05:08.720> is

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
another limitation of the program is

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.500 
another limitation of the program is
that<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.530> can't<00:05:09.830> install<00:05:10.160> additional<00:05:10.850> let's

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
that you can't install additional let's

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.830 
that you can't install additional let's
say<00:05:11.720> fonts<00:05:12.440> or<00:05:12.560> effects<00:05:13.460> or<00:05:13.610> some<00:05:13.910> third<00:05:14.420> party

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
say fonts or effects or some third party

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.530 
say fonts or effects or some third party
content<00:05:15.320> but<00:05:15.890> we<00:05:16.430> hope<00:05:16.640> that<00:05:16.670> at<00:05:17.060> least<00:05:17.090> a

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
content but we hope that at least a

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.720 
content but we hope that at least a
double<00:05:17.930> you<00:05:17.990> will<00:05:18.170> regularly<00:05:18.980> update<00:05:19.580> the

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
double you will regularly update the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.530 
double you will regularly update the
application<00:05:19.960> in<00:05:20.960> order<00:05:21.290> to<00:05:21.560> add<00:05:21.800> additional

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
application in order to add additional

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.270 
application in order to add additional
functionality<00:05:23.540> we<00:05:24.260> really<00:05:24.680> like<00:05:24.890> adobe

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
functionality we really like adobe

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.940 
functionality we really like adobe
photoshop<00:05:25.520> touch<00:05:26.210> it<00:05:26.690> has<00:05:26.960> relatively

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
photoshop touch it has relatively

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.390 
photoshop touch it has relatively
straightforward<00:05:29.140> interface<00:05:30.140> with<00:05:30.830> which<00:05:31.160> you

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
straightforward interface with which you

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.150 
straightforward interface with which you
can<00:05:31.640> get<00:05:32.270> used<00:05:32.600> to<00:05:32.780> in<00:05:33.230> a<00:05:33.410> matter<00:05:33.590> of<00:05:33.710> minutes

and it also has a very rich feature set
which<00:05:38.900> we<00:05:39.050> call<00:05:39.260> that<00:05:39.440> a<00:05:39.680> dab<00:05:39.920> you<00:05:40.070> will<00:05:40.280> update

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
which we call that a dab you will update
