00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.260
 All hot ones are actually coming and me 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.480
 I'm back with this because this time 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.630
 video is only very briefly about one 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.060
 Explanation to rowing at the romp it is 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.570
 my first exercise in my time 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.240
 pool day here is there seem to her 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.060
 will see that I here with it right 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.689
 the lower back quite a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.250
 This movement is movement 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.380
 but very controlled that is one 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.610
 controlled swing as expressed 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.410
 a controlled swing 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.090
 controlled swing just when 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.600
 move or only those who move has 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.149
 therein 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.750
 I could with the movement in the bottom 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.180
 but my arms would stop 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.710
 do not move, but me 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.960
 make the swing and then I pull 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.809
 first of all, that's a flowing one, of course 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.789
 movement in the video what can i do 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.649
 By doing so , I create the lower one 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.870
 to bring back into the exercise 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.940
 second, I give my latissimus 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.140
 here when I move forward ago 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.090
 I always have to choose a bit 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.979
 if I move forward here afterwards 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.920
 your shoulders are a bit too 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.700
 with and I'm here in the country is 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.240
 needs more stretching than if i do not like that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.640
 go far through this little one 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.180
 movement radius I give as I said the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.159
 land is I have to hunt another 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 of course always try to stretch 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.640
 cross I wanted to tell the back 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.860
 of course just to keep 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.619
 you'll see it here right away 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.900
 only the explanation for the rowing on 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.720
 Tournament, see also I prefer very much 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.780
 far down so I'm pulling with the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.909
 Elbow down more in the pure 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.369
 Genital area I have a lot of people 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.530
 train here and then but me e 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.729
 write mail that you do not back 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.890
 Feel neat 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.079
 the back of the latissimus is here 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.030
 really responsible for this here 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.829
 to move in a circular motion 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.590
 We create this circular motion by 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.869
 we pull down from above here 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.330
 if you do that with a controlled one 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.970
 swing combined then you have 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.070
 longer a greater range of motion the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.200
 goes directly to racism and then 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.630
 you probably feel the back rather 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.100
 better with this exercise than the one or 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.950
 others maybe right now 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.690
 problems has in this exercise only so much 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.500
 I'll show you around now 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.070
 tour and later today still follows 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.090
 entire everyday life of a bit 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.630
 I was reduced to the bayern 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.790
 bend 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.040
 But I have to take it out today 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.460
 Saturdays nicely made up we'll see each other 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.460
 again something
