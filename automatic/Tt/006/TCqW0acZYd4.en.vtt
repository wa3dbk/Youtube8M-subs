00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.180
Step 1: On the right side of the front hairline, take a section of hair from the top and divide into four parts. 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.460
Step 2: Start braiding on the left side of the split. Take the leftmost strand (the first strand) and put it over the second, under the third, and use the fourth strand (far right) to wrap around the first. 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:53.940
Step 3: Continue braiding, but with the tieback. Start weaving from the left side; take the leftmost strand (the first one) and add a strand of loose hair from the left side, combining both. Place the second strand under the third. Then take a strand of loose hair from the right side and combine it with the strand of the braid on the extreme right (the fourth strand) and wrap it with the first. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:02:08.380
Step 4: Continue braiding the four strands with the tieback. Keep braiding until the nape of the neck is reached. The braid should go diagonally! 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:19.540
Step 5: At the nape of the neck, secure the braid with a band and leave the rest of the hair in a ponytail. 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:36.220
Step 6: Take a thin strand of hair from the ponytail and wrap it around the band so as to cover it. Use a pin to secure the piece of hair.
