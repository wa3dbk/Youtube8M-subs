00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.070
 who did not call me by the fact is 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.320
 which is in this location here plus or 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.899
 less stays right here 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.969
 but it was the cars they have is what they are 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.940
 cars every day at this time has 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.829
 this party and they come with the tornado and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 also with the worst team I do not know if I am 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.629

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 cars much of the time I think and 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.970

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.030

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.689
 his car, but finally I'm going to steal 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.759
