00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.370
 if we're going to do today 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:11.389
 it's something very simple that is to nourish 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.710
 the skin and makes us look younger 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.960
 here we are going to use these tools that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.560
 we have honey 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.529
 we have olive oil and natural oil 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.750
 ok this helps us so that the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.850
 skin stay younger during 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.970
 Over time we will use 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.730
 cotton normal honey can be any 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.620
 kind of honey the oil as I told you 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.999
 of times it can be natural or the oil 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.440
 olive oil and olive 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:40.469
 I recommend because it is one more oil 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 virgin and can help us to nurture 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.429
 skin and that the piece looks more beautiful 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.839
 we would start with honey already as you 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.749
 come we have a little bit of shit in the 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.659
 jar let's wet the thing with this 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:55.720
 honey, we can do this all 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:58.550
 days in the house we can also use 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.440
 we can use this 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.930
 a little bit of cotton all together more 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.790
 large so that it can be shared is 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.740
 We can use all the skin on the face 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.990
 I will use it in my hand 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.650
 because it's something that I can show you how 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.320
 do it we put it on the whole skin if the 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.600
 cord in the bad 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.729
 It's very good, that is, not all 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.040
 People like to protect their hands 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.920
 Sometimes the hands also age 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.100
 then let's put the honey like that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.600
 We are going to distribute the entire skin 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.910
 let's go to this process what are we going to do 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.740
 for 25 minutes for 25 minutes in 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.650
 this case I 'm not going to do it I'm not going 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.530
 to give for 25 minutes but you in 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.270
 house should do it ok after 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.640
 we have the same game where we 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.640
 we want to use it we are going to massage it 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.950
 imagine that I have all the harvest 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.570
 put on the whole body imagine that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.210
 this is the process that we are going to make a 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.770
 message 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.770
 It is very good to use your hands 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.570
 this is going to make us 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.570
 young 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.260
 and it's a very simple process not 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.959
 we need so many things sometimes we are 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.579
 in one place and use the products and it's a 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.620
 product behind the other we do not know what 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.430
 do so like this simple product 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.069
 it's honey and oil we're going to have a 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.459
 very beautiful skin 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.709
 ok after we 've got beyond the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.389
 opening that a little time that are 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.189
 25 minutes we'll leave it there yes 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:40.889
 then in mind without agreement with the 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.710
 We will go and look for the water 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.280
 cool 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.280
 of Malabar 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.040
 let's make those that we will be 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.410
 very very soft already be the honey as 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.980
 you know they have many properties 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.200
 curative 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.540
 if they put it on their face they will feel 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.860
 the same will feel a lot of softness go 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.819
 to feel that the skin will remain 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.310
 as delicious as to do it 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.230
 again and again and again 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.360
 ok then we are going to look for some 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.530
 paper wipes 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.530
 let's take the hand 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.420
 then let's praise apostolic 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.420
 ah 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.580
 ah 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.740
 then in this step we are going to use the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.740
 olive oil 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.040
 we do not see how much depends on the 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.280
 amount that we will use for the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.280
 body 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.720
 we are going to make an oil cap 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.220
 which I think is enough to 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.960
 the most mara with the cotton ball and 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.180
 we are going to distribute this as 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.870
 We did with honey, we 're going to do it in 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.489
 the skin 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.099
 so getting 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.229
 that the place where we want to be 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.740
 see more hydrated cover like oil 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.740
 olive 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.180
 once we have also finished what 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.820
 let's leave for the time that we 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.250
 we want we can cover this with a 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.250
 towel used in the house 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.200
 and the oil has many properties and 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.690
 the environment that we see ourselves very young if 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.980
 we do this in the face we are going to 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.520
 stay face with tremendous 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.520
 hydration 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:02.129
 so we can do it every day 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.959
 to me in the whole body 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.520
 everything we can cover as oil 

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:09.699
 we would be good every day face 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.419
 and I heard the neck then we 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.419
 let's massage 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.790
 once finished with this oil what 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.919
 we leave there the time that we 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.320
 we want with the cassette we do not have to 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.100
 worry about the time simply 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.529
 the time that we want 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.549
 have it in the body 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:39.859
 then after we have finished already 

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:42.289
 we can use in any soap but 

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:46.369
 normally you like me I like it 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:48.979
 use a lot of neutral hina because it's a 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:51.229
 thing that is prepared simply for 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.969
 the skin but if they do not have others in the 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.459
 house can use anything not 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.040
 you have to do is exactly the same 

00:05:55.459 --> 00:06:01.360
 product that I use 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:05.620
 and with this they are going to have 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.060
 a skin you see better care that's 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.599
 all I hope you liked the 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.050
 video and soon we will be in other videos 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.550
 different with very natural products 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.729
 I hope you like it 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.729
 it is understood
