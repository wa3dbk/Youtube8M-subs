00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 here we go again the procedure 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.720
 so here I disconnected the lambda probe 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.090
 and I unplugged the probe from 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.929
 intake air temperature so the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.279
 woman potentiometer it's emails 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.220
 contacts we will go to see the side of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.039
 our help 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.930
 so there we see the led lit what says 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.710
 means that there is at least one 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.679
 failure to store ok so we will support 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.040
 on the button about five seconds and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.579
 we release 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:42.510
 so this is the display procedure 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:53.969
 start 2 so we'll count the number 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:57.329
 many times it flashes 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.329
 so we have the defect 23 22 we have a 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.629
 long display in the image no that's it 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.629
 one and it will start again 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.629
 2 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.550
 3 2 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.890
 and so he repeats the defect 23-22 he goes 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.690
 repeat it indefinitely which all this 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:30.610
 what we will see is the following fault 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:32.920
 will then have 5 seconds and release and the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:41.729
 counting for the second fault is going 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.729
 start 1 2 1 2 3 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:55.310
 2 3 4 1 2 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.300
 when the default 23.42 a long display 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:15.920
 and it starts again with the display of 23 42 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:18.319
 1 2 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 so 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:28.250
 23 42 we will see if a third defect 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:32.450
 pressing 5 seconds and release at 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.000
 the long ignition image have it there so we 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.980
 is at the end of the procedure late ribs 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.010
 defect in what good two ribs default 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.590
 intra 22 23 42 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:49.790
 so here he tells us that it was the end 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:53.000
 the list we will press to finish the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.010
 reading and it goes back into configuration 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.790
 like when we put the contact so 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.790
 lights on waiting 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.790
 here
