00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
tried to do a hard reset didn't do

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.630 
tried to do a hard reset didn't do
anything<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:27.890> basically<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:29.220> happens<00:00:29.550> is

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
anything and basically what happens is

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.370 
anything and basically what happens is
the<00:00:29.760> screen<00:00:30.029> stayed<00:00:30.300> black<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> could<00:00:31.199> hit

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the screen stayed black but I could hit

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.709 
the screen stayed black but I could hit
the<00:00:31.590> power<00:00:31.980> button<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.210> Vizio<00:00:35.420> well<00:00:36.420> when

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the power button and the Vizio well when

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.830 
the power button and the Vizio well when
I<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:36.870> plugged<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.559> Vizio<00:00:38.629> logo<00:00:39.629> at<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I was plugged in the Vizio logo at the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.450 
I was plugged in the Vizio logo at the
bottom<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:40.530> change<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:41.100> amber<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:42.300> white

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
bottom would change from amber to white

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.810 
bottom would change from amber to white
but<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> screen<00:00:44.820> would<00:00:44.969> stay<00:00:45.210> black<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
but the screen would stay black so I

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.010 
but the screen would stay black so I
decided<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.969> take<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> back<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.430> try<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
decided to take the back off and try and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.840 
decided to take the back off and try and
figure<00:00:52.020> out<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> problem<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.489> looked

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
figure out what the problem was I looked

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.529 
figure out what the problem was I looked
at<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> main<00:00:54.149> board<00:00:54.390> everything<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:55.020> good

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
at the main board everything was good

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.450 
at the main board everything was good
look<00:00:57.539> at<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.719> power<00:00:57.960> supply<00:00:58.379> tested<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.190> on

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
look at the power supply tested up on

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.299 
look at the power supply tested up on
and<00:01:01.520> I<00:01:03.320> don't<00:01:04.320> exactly<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:05.040> what<00:01:05.220> this

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and I don't exactly know what this

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.100 
and I don't exactly know what this
plates<00:01:05.640> called<00:01:05.909> right<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.630> there's<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
plates called right here but there's a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.130 
plates called right here but there's a
cover<00:01:07.380> right<00:01:08.210> here<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> lean<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> back

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
cover right here if you lean on the back

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.340 
cover right here if you lean on the back
on<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> left<00:01:10.409> side<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.920> TV<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:13.080> undid

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
on the left side of the TV and I undid

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.440 
on the left side of the TV and I undid
that<00:01:13.409> cover<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.820> was<00:01:14.939> looking<00:01:15.210> at<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
that cover and I was looking at the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.010 
that cover and I was looking at the
capacitor<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:20.630> don't<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
capacitor there and don't know if you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.660 
capacitor there and don't know if you
can<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> very<00:01:22.619> well<00:01:24.170> but<00:01:28.070> this<00:01:29.070> capacitor

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
can see it very well but this capacitor

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.289 
can see it very well but this capacitor
right<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.829> went<00:01:32.009> bad<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:36.000> don't

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
right here is what went bad so I don't

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.289 
right here is what went bad so I don't
know<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.630> tell<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:38.000> there's<00:01:39.000> dark

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
know if you can tell but there's dark

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.789 
know if you can tell but there's dark
stuff<00:01:39.570> flowing<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.049> end<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
stuff flowing out the end of it and

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
stuff flowing out the end of it and
that's<00:01:41.520> how<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.939> tell<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that's how you can tell that the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.580 
that's how you can tell that the
capacitor<00:01:42.990> went<00:01:43.170> bad

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
capacitor went bad

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.130 
capacitor went bad
basically<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.790> seal<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.149> busted<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
basically the seal got busted on it and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.920 
basically the seal got busted on it and
it's<00:01:46.380> totally<00:01:46.619> trashed<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:50.689> then<00:01:51.689> that's

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it's totally trashed now so then that's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.010 
it's totally trashed now so then that's
the<00:01:52.020> only<00:01:52.229> thing<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.500> found<00:01:52.799> wrong<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.340> it

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
the only thing I found wrong with it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.330 
the only thing I found wrong with it
gonna<00:01:55.020> replace<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.100> little<00:01:56.250> bit

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
gonna replace it here in a little bit

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.940 
gonna replace it here in a little bit
and<00:01:56.670> I'll<00:01:57.630> keep<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.049> posted<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.829> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
only problem with the TV and it should

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.740 
only problem with the TV and it should
be<00:02:00.780> able<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:02.149> screen<00:02:03.149> back<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
be able to get the screen back on and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.219
