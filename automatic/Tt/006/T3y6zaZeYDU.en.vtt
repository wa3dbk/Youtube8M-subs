world<00:03:38.769> but<00:03:39.100> not<00:03:39.250> only<00:03:39.550> is<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:39.940> just<00:03:40.120> beautiful

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
but we get to see so much of it we

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.400 
but we get to see so much of it we
learned<00:03:43.209> about<00:03:43.360> how<00:03:43.660> their<00:03:43.870> government<00:03:44.050> works

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
learned about how their government works

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.040 
learned about how their government works
we<00:03:45.070> see<00:03:45.310> different<00:03:45.760> aspects<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.540> Kingdom

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.350 
we see different aspects of the Kingdom
and<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.560> Empire<00:03:48.040> we<00:03:48.370> see<00:03:48.580> different<00:03:49.030> towns

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
and cities and we see them interact with

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.850 
and cities and we see them interact with
each<00:03:51.790> other<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.510> aren't<00:03:53.019> really<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.350> part<00:03:53.709> of

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
each other that aren't really a part of

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.250 
each other that aren't really a part of
the<00:03:53.920> major<00:03:54.250> overlying<00:03:54.880> story<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:55.989> felt

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
the major overlying story and it felt

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.530 
the major overlying story and it felt
like<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.620> was<00:03:56.769> just<00:03:56.950> this<00:03:57.190> living<00:03:57.940> world<00:03:58.269> I

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
like it was just this living world I

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.910 
like it was just this living world I
felt<00:03:58.690> they<00:03:58.870> did<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.110> great<00:03:59.320> job<00:03:59.500> of

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
felt they did a great job of

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.800 
felt they did a great job of
world-building<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.820> action<00:04:01.180> itself<00:04:01.600> was

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
world-building the action itself was

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.259 
world-building the action itself was
also<00:04:02.290> enjoyable<00:04:02.830> as<00:04:03.130> each<00:04:03.370> of<00:04:03.610> these<00:04:03.730> dragons

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
also enjoyable as each of these dragons

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.990 
also enjoyable as each of these dragons
embody<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.930> special<00:04:05.739> skill<00:04:06.040> which<00:04:06.280> allows<00:04:06.730> them

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
embody a special skill which allows them

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.600 
embody a special skill which allows them
to<00:04:07.180> take<00:04:07.360> on<00:04:07.570> many<00:04:07.810> enemies<00:04:08.380> at<00:04:08.560> once

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
to take on many enemies at once

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.280 
to take on many enemies at once
considering<00:04:09.610> that<00:04:09.850> this<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.420> fantasy<00:04:10.930> it's

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
considering that this is a fantasy it's

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.259 
considering that this is a fantasy it's
normal<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:11.980> see<00:04:12.190> certain<00:04:12.430> characters<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.180> a

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
normal to see certain characters in a

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.960 
normal to see certain characters in a
series<00:04:13.600> that<00:04:14.080> are<00:04:14.320> so<00:04:14.530> legendary<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:15.700> this

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
series that are so legendary like this

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.150 
series that are so legendary like this
and<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.600> really<00:04:16.870> liked<00:04:17.080> how<00:04:17.320> they<00:04:17.500> limited<00:04:18.010> the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
and I really liked how they limited the

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.219 
and I really liked how they limited the
amount<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.669> overpower<00:04:19.390> characters<00:04:19.989> in<00:04:20.140> the

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
amount of overpower characters in the

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.650 
amount of overpower characters in the
series<00:04:20.410> however<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:21.220> felt<00:04:21.789> like<00:04:22.000> hawk<00:04:22.300> was<00:04:22.630> a

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
series however I felt like hawk was a

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.020 
series however I felt like hawk was a
bit<00:04:23.020> overpowered<00:04:23.890> but<00:04:24.070> then<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.280> realized<00:04:24.880> that

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
bit overpowered but then I realized that

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.520 
bit overpowered but then I realized that
if<00:04:25.390> he<00:04:25.570> wasn't<00:04:26.080> as

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
if he wasn't as

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.530 
if he wasn't as
strong<00:04:26.800> as<00:04:27.010> he<00:04:27.160> was<00:04:27.370> then<00:04:27.880> he<00:04:27.910> would<00:04:28.240> become

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
strong as he was then he would become

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.080 
strong as he was then he would become
obsolete<00:04:28.960> as<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.470> bodyguard<00:04:29.950> once<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.639> dragons

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
obsolete as a bodyguard once the dragons

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.270 
obsolete as a bodyguard once the dragons
were<00:04:31.240> introduced<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.110> only<00:04:32.380> major<00:04:32.620> complaint

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
were introduced the only major complaint

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.400 
were introduced the only major complaint
I<00:04:33.430> have<00:04:33.670> about<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.090> combat<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:34.720> how<00:04:34.900> whenever

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
I have about the combat is how whenever

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.590 
I have about the combat is how whenever
Yona<00:04:35.950> gets<00:04:36.310> into<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> struggle<00:04:37.120> with<00:04:37.270> somebody

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
Yona gets into a struggle with somebody

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.710 
Yona gets into a struggle with somebody
she<00:04:37.690> always<00:04:38.080> has<00:04:38.470> these<00:04:38.790> fearful<00:04:39.790> eyes<00:04:40.240> these

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
she always has these fearful eyes these

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.480 
she always has these fearful eyes these
eyes<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.260> a<00:04:41.350> beast<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.860> will<00:04:42.010> scare<00:04:42.370> away

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
eyes of a beast that will scare away

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.030 
eyes of a beast that will scare away
everybody<00:04:43.210> around<00:04:43.630> her<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.139> I<00:04:44.680> thought<00:04:44.860> that

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
everybody around her and I thought that

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.340 
everybody around her and I thought that
this<00:04:45.190> was<00:04:45.460> detrimental<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.660> her<00:04:47.020> character

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
this was detrimental to her character

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.440 
this was detrimental to her character
development<00:04:47.950> instead<00:04:48.760> of<00:04:48.910> showing<00:04:49.210> the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
development instead of showing the

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.300 
development instead of showing the
fruits<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.900> her<00:04:50.020> labor<00:04:50.050> in<00:04:50.590> her<00:04:50.740> combat

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
fruits of her labor in her combat

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.150 
fruits of her labor in her combat
training<00:04:51.669> she<00:04:52.360> just<00:04:52.660> uses<00:04:53.169> these<00:04:53.590> eyes<00:04:53.860> and

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
training she just uses these eyes and

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.159 
training she just uses these eyes and
gets<00:04:54.460> away<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:54.790> easily<00:04:55.210> I'm<00:04:55.600> not<00:04:55.810> saying<00:04:56.080> that

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
gets away so easily I'm not saying that

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.960 
gets away so easily I'm not saying that
Yona<00:04:56.590> should<00:04:56.950> have<00:04:57.040> killed<00:04:57.310> characters<00:04:57.820> that

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
Yona should have killed characters that

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.810 
Yona should have killed characters that
started<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.540> fight<00:04:59.230> with<00:04:59.260> her<00:04:59.560> but<00:04:59.830> she<00:05:00.580> should

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
started a fight with her but she should

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.000 
started a fight with her but she should
have<00:05:00.850> at<00:05:01.060> least<00:05:01.090> had<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.600> struggle<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.590> defend

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
have at least had a struggle to defend

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.490 
have at least had a struggle to defend
herself<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.730> ultimately<00:05:04.480> win<00:05:04.900> maybe<00:05:05.260> with

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
herself and ultimately win maybe with

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.590 
herself and ultimately win maybe with
the<00:05:05.650> aid<00:05:05.860> of<00:05:05.890> others<00:05:06.430> but<00:05:06.700> it's<00:05:07.090> something

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
the aid of others but it's something

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.480 
the aid of others but it's something
that<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.810> felt<00:05:08.320> would<00:05:08.680> show<00:05:08.980> off<00:05:09.250> her

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
that I felt would show off her

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.580 
that I felt would show off her
progression<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.210> little<00:05:10.510> bit<00:05:10.630> more<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.110> pacing

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
progression a little bit more the pacing

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.650 
progression a little bit more the pacing
of<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.770> story<00:05:12.160> was<00:05:12.430> smooth<00:05:12.760> but<00:05:13.300> it<00:05:13.510> was

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
of the story was smooth but it was

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.900 
of the story was smooth but it was
ultimately<00:05:13.870> limited<00:05:14.860> by<00:05:15.040> how<00:05:15.340> short<00:05:15.730> the

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
ultimately limited by how short the

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.750 
ultimately limited by how short the
series<00:05:16.240> was<00:05:16.480> this<00:05:17.080> was<00:05:17.320> only<00:05:17.500> 24<00:05:18.070> episodes<00:05:18.520> for

this first season here and they told

characters history and they do so much

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.659 
characters history and they do so much
with<00:05:28.330> in<00:05:28.450> these<00:05:28.600> 24<00:05:29.020> episodes<00:05:29.590> that<00:05:30.160> they

with in these 24 episodes that they

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.640 
with in these 24 episodes that they
don't<00:05:30.910> really<00:05:31.090> have<00:05:31.240> enough<00:05:31.750> time<00:05:32.110> to<00:05:32.350> develop

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
don't really have enough time to develop

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.050 
don't really have enough time to develop
certain<00:05:32.979> characters<00:05:33.520> that<00:05:33.700> need<00:05:33.729> it

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
certain characters that need it

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.480 
certain characters that need it
technically<00:05:34.570> this<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:34.990> considered<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:35.950> shoujo

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
technically this is considered a shoujo

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.760 
technically this is considered a shoujo
and<00:05:36.820> usually<00:05:37.450> in<00:05:37.630> show<00:05:37.900> joe's<00:05:38.200> men<00:05:38.530> are

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
and usually in show joe's men are

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.820 
and usually in show joe's men are
developed<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.490> lease<00:05:39.729> but<00:05:40.390> in<00:05:40.810> this<00:05:41.110> case<00:05:41.470> I

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
developed the lease but in this case I

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.650 
developed the lease but in this case I
know<00:05:41.890> that<00:05:42.370> they<00:05:42.520> can<00:05:42.580> create<00:05:43.360> a

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
know that they can create a

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.960 
know that they can create a
well-developed<00:05:44.380> characters<00:05:44.650> so<00:05:45.400> I<00:05:45.729> really

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
well-developed characters so I really

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.670 
well-developed characters so I really
don't<00:05:46.210> think<00:05:46.240> they<00:05:46.450> have<00:05:46.600> an<00:05:46.720> excuse<00:05:47.169> outside

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
don't think they have an excuse outside

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.500 
don't think they have an excuse outside
of<00:05:47.860> just<00:05:48.039> time<00:05:48.400> constraints<00:05:49.120> because<00:05:49.390> the

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
of just time constraints because the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.300 
of just time constraints because the
story<00:05:49.750> does<00:05:50.020> so<00:05:50.229> much<00:05:50.410> in<00:05:50.620> so<00:05:50.770> little<00:05:50.950> time

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
story does so much in so little time

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.310 
story does so much in so little time
