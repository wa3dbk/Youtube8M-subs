when I hear somebody talk about oh I
used<00:03:07.320> too<00:03:07.530> much<00:03:07.560> mouthpiece<00:03:08.190> pressure<00:03:08.550> or

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
used too much mouthpiece pressure or

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.990 
used too much mouthpiece pressure or
someone<00:03:10.050> says<00:03:10.290> well<00:03:11.280> your<00:03:11.400> problem<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.880> you

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
someone says well your problem is you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.750

don't<00:03:12.180> use<00:03:12.330> enough<00:03:12.600> air<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:14.160> know<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.550> always

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
don't use enough air you know I always

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.780 
don't use enough air you know I always
want<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.210> say<00:03:15.360> well<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.540> may<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.840> true<00:03:16.020> but

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
want to say well that may be true but

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.610 
want to say well that may be true but
it's<00:03:17.790> hard<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.120> sometimes<00:03:18.690> pinpoint<00:03:19.260> what<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
it's hard to sometimes pinpoint what the

it's hard to sometimes pinpoint what the
real<00:03:19.770> problem<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.340> because<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:21.480> really<00:03:21.600> a

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
real problem is because it's really a

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.260 
real problem is because it's really a
total<00:03:22.620> machine<00:03:23.010> there<00:03:23.250> are<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:23.490> many<00:03:23.610> factors

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
total machine there are so many factors

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
the exact intonation that you want to

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.390 
the exact intonation that you want to
achieve<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.690> there's<00:04:04.080> a<00:04:04.170> lot<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.500> constant

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
achieve so there's a lot of constant

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.920 
achieve so there's a lot of constant
variables<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:08.880> me<00:04:09.000> it's<00:04:09.150> like<00:04:09.300> focusing<00:04:09.780> a

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
variables and to me it's like focusing a

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.570 
variables and to me it's like focusing a
camera<00:04:09.960> of<00:04:10.410> course<00:04:10.440> nowadays<00:04:10.800> it's<00:04:11.250> all<00:04:11.400> these

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
camera of course nowadays it's all these

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.160 
camera of course nowadays it's all these
digital<00:04:11.970> cameras<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.510> do<00:04:12.600> everything<00:04:12.720> for

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
digital cameras that do everything for

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.960 
digital cameras that do everything for
you<00:04:13.290> but<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:14.130> know<00:04:14.250> if<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.460> can<00:04:14.640> think<00:04:14.760> back

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
you but you know if you can think back

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.180 
you but you know if you can think back
to<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.240> older<00:04:15.480> cameras<00:04:16.190> professional

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
to the older cameras professional

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.370 
to the older cameras professional
cameras<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.670> had<00:04:17.820> several<00:04:18.090> lenses<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:19.230> had

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
cameras that had several lenses you had

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.740 
cameras that had several lenses you had
to<00:04:19.500> adjust<00:04:19.590> one<00:04:20.040> for<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> distance<00:04:20.790> one<00:04:21.540> for

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
to adjust one for the distance one for

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.530 
to adjust one for the distance one for
the<00:04:21.840> actual<00:04:22.170> focus<00:04:22.590> on<00:04:22.890> that<00:04:23.040> distance<00:04:23.540> then

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
the actual focus on that distance then

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.210 
the actual focus on that distance then
you<00:04:24.570> had<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.750> set<00:04:24.960> set<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.380> shutter<00:04:25.650> speed<00:04:25.830> the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
you had to set set the shutter speed the

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.610 
you had to set set the shutter speed the
mouth<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:27.180> allow<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.780> correct<00:04:28.290> amount<00:04:28.560> of

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
mouth to allow the correct amount of

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
light to come into the camera so there

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.080 
light to come into the camera so there
if<00:04:31.230> any<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.740> those<00:04:31.890> variables<00:04:32.460> were<00:04:32.580> off<00:04:32.760> then

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
if any of those variables were off then

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.560 
if any of those variables were off then
the<00:04:33.180> photo<00:04:33.390> isn't<00:04:33.870> perfect<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:35.390> we're<00:04:36.390> like

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
pilot trying to figure it out and then

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.430 
pilot trying to figure it out and then
take<00:04:52.260> off<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.420> what<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:54.810> try<00:04:55.140> to<00:04:55.170> do

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
take off and and so what I try to do

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.160 
take off and and so what I try to do
really<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:56.070> just<00:04:56.550> look<00:04:57.420> for<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.660> telltale

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
really is just look for the telltale

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.540 
really is just look for the telltale
signs<00:04:58.590> of<00:04:59.600> what<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.720> problem<00:05:01.080> might<00:05:01.230> be<00:05:01.550> not

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
signs of what the problem might be not

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.980 
signs of what the problem might be not
really<00:05:02.880> trying<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.240> second-guess<00:05:03.720> what<00:05:03.930> I

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
really trying to second-guess what I

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.350 
really trying to second-guess what I
think<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.470> is

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
think it is

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.300 
think it is
and<00:05:06.449> I<00:05:06.840> think<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.199> more<00:05:07.379> you<00:05:07.409> do<00:05:07.680> with<00:05:08.159> your

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
and I think the more you do with your

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.649 
and I think the more you do with your
teaching<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.240> course<00:05:09.419> we're<00:05:09.569> all

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
teaching and of course we're all

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.740 
teaching and of course we're all
teaching<00:05:10.050> ourselves<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:12.090> can<00:05:12.300> start<00:05:12.539> to<00:05:12.629> look

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
teaching ourselves you can start to look

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.020 
teaching ourselves you can start to look
for<00:05:12.960> these<00:05:13.050> problems<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:14.460> begin<00:05:14.819> to<00:05:14.969> identify

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
for these problems and begin to identify

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.330 
for these problems and begin to identify
them<00:05:15.719> for<00:05:15.900> instance<00:05:16.110> if<00:05:16.439> the<00:05:16.919> lips<00:05:17.099> are<00:05:17.310> too

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
them for instance if the lips are too

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.330 
them for instance if the lips are too
relaxed<00:05:18.210> they're<00:05:18.689> too<00:05:18.900> loose<00:05:19.169> or<00:05:19.860> not<00:05:20.099> enough

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
relaxed they're too loose or not enough

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.240 
relaxed they're too loose or not enough
pucker<00:05:20.669> as<00:05:21.270> some<00:05:21.659> people<00:05:21.780> say<00:05:21.960> then<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:23.009> tone

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
pucker as some people say then the tone

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.149 
pucker as some people say then the tone
lacks<00:05:23.939> fullness<00:05:24.539> and<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.500> center<00:05:25.919> of<00:05:26.039> the

tone<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:26.819> sometimes<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.509> even<00:05:27.539> has<00:05:28.319> a<00:05:28.639> lack<00:05:29.639> of

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
tone and sometimes it even has a lack of

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.170 
tone and sometimes it even has a lack of
control<00:05:30.860> if<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:32.009> lips<00:05:32.189> are<00:05:32.370> too<00:05:32.400> tight

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
control if the lips are too tight

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.719 
control if the lips are too tight
you<00:05:33.509> get<00:05:33.659> a<00:05:33.689> very<00:05:33.840> pinched<00:05:34.259> tone<00:05:34.530> if<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:35.550> lower

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
you get a very pinched tone if the lower

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.629 
you get a very pinched tone if the lower
jaw<00:05:36.060> is<00:05:36.300> too<00:05:36.539> low<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:37.560> get<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.879> real<00:05:38.879> spread<00:05:39.629> the

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
jaw is too low you get a real spread the

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.719 
jaw is too low you get a real spread the
dull<00:05:41.639> spread<00:05:42.210> sound<00:05:42.569> if<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.530> jaw<00:05:43.800> lower<00:05:44.430> jaw

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
dull spread sound if the jaw lower jaw

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.899 
dull spread sound if the jaw lower jaw
is<00:05:44.789> too<00:05:45.090> high<00:05:45.360> maybe<00:05:45.780> you<00:05:45.930> clench<00:05:46.319> your<00:05:46.409> teeth

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
is too high maybe you clench your teeth

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.629 
is too high maybe you clench your teeth
then<00:05:47.909> you<00:05:48.030> get<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.180> very<00:05:48.240> nasal<00:05:49.009> sound<00:05:50.009> in<00:05:50.400> the

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
then you get a very nasal sound in the

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.249 
then you get a very nasal sound in the
middle<00:05:50.909> and<00:05:51.060> low<00:05:51.180> register<00:05:51.659> sometimes<00:05:52.139> it

middle and low register sometimes it

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.379 
middle and low register sometimes it
sounds<00:05:52.560> like<00:05:52.680> a<00:05:52.710> duck<00:05:53.039> and<00:05:53.370> if<00:05:54.000> you<00:05:54.090> remember

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
sounds like a duck and if you remember

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.659 
sounds like a duck and if you remember

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
high sometimes it sounds sharp even

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.709 
high sometimes it sounds sharp even
though<00:06:52.110> it's<00:06:52.289> tuned<00:06:53.089> correctly<00:06:54.089> to<00:06:54.270> the<00:06:54.300> to

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:54.719 
though it's tuned correctly to the to

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:57.619 
though it's tuned correctly to the to
the<00:06:54.839> tuner<00:06:55.430> I<00:06:56.430> think<00:06:57.060> it's<00:06:57.180> important<00:06:57.599> to

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:57.629 
the tuner I think it's important to

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:00.290 
the tuner I think it's important to
always<00:06:57.779> play<00:06:58.110> with<00:06:58.740> a<00:06:58.800> centered<00:06:59.219> sound<00:06:59.550> that

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
always play with a centered sound that

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.860 
always play with a centered sound that
is<00:07:00.569> that<00:07:00.900> the<00:07:01.050> aperture<00:07:01.500> itself<00:07:02.099> the<00:07:02.400> opening

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
is that the aperture itself the opening

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.040 
is that the aperture itself the opening
needs<00:07:03.870> to<00:07:04.080> be<00:07:04.169> as<00:07:04.379> small<00:07:04.889> as<00:07:05.190> possible<00:07:05.839> to<00:07:06.839> play

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
needs to be as small as possible to play

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.040 
needs to be as small as possible to play
a<00:07:07.080> given<00:07:07.469> pitch<00:07:07.909> obviously<00:07:08.909> low<00:07:09.150> notes<00:07:09.419> or

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
a given pitch obviously low notes or

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.800 
a given pitch obviously low notes or
will<00:07:10.710> be<00:07:10.830> a<00:07:10.860> larger<00:07:11.310> aperture<00:07:11.639> higher<00:07:12.180> notes<00:07:12.569> a

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
will be a larger aperture higher notes a

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.709 
will be a larger aperture higher notes a
smaller<00:07:13.110> aperture<00:07:14.120> we<00:07:15.120> want<00:07:15.300> to<00:07:15.389> keep<00:07:15.509> it<00:07:15.630> as

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:15.719 
smaller aperture we want to keep it as

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:16.639 
smaller aperture we want to keep it as
small<00:07:15.870> as<00:07:16.050> we<00:07:16.380> can

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:16.649 
small as we can

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:19.970 
small as we can
that's<00:07:17.190> why<00:07:17.370> soft<00:07:17.699> practice<00:07:18.270> is<00:07:18.659> so<00:07:19.020> important

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
that's why soft practice is so important

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.310 
that's why soft practice is so important
the<00:07:20.280> players<00:07:20.580> I<00:07:20.820> find<00:07:21.090> that<00:07:21.270> play<00:07:21.540> loud<00:07:21.960> all

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320 
the players I find that play loud all

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.530 
the players I find that play loud all
the<00:07:22.380> time<00:07:22.620> that's<00:07:23.100> all<00:07:23.280> they<00:07:23.430> do<00:07:23.490> they<00:07:24.270> can't

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540 
the time that's all they do they can't

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.240 
the time that's all they do they can't
play<00:07:24.720> soft<00:07:25.020> and<00:07:25.290> they<00:07:25.350> wonder<00:07:25.620> why<00:07:25.770> well<00:07:26.130> all

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
play soft and they wonder why well all

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.860 
play soft and they wonder why well all
they<00:07:26.370> get<00:07:26.550> their<00:07:27.000> lips<00:07:27.240> are<00:07:27.360> too<00:07:27.540> far<00:07:27.780> apart

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
they get their lips are too far apart

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.800 
they get their lips are too far apart
and<00:07:28.590> they<00:07:28.680> sound<00:07:28.890> like<00:07:28.950> this<00:07:32.360> just<00:07:33.360> everything

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.810 
and they sound like this just everything

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.350 
and they sound like this just everything
so<00:07:34.050> open<00:07:34.410> of<00:07:34.500> course<00:07:34.530> you<00:07:34.950> know<00:07:35.150> we<00:07:36.150> need<00:07:36.330> to

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
so open of course you know we need to

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.840 
so open of course you know we need to
get<00:07:36.600> it<00:07:36.720> as<00:07:36.900> close<00:07:37.260> as<00:07:37.530> we<00:07:37.680> can<00:07:37.890> so<00:07:38.130> very<00:07:38.580> very

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:38.850 
get it as close as we can so very very

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.280 
get it as close as we can so very very
delicate<00:07:39.090> soft<00:07:39.600> playing<00:07:39.900> what<00:07:40.080> I<00:07:40.110> call

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.290 
delicate soft playing what I call

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.680 
delicate soft playing what I call
whisper<00:07:40.650> tones<00:07:40.890> are<00:07:41.100> really<00:07:41.130> good<00:07:41.540> just<00:07:42.540> as

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.690 
whisper tones are really good just as

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.110 
whisper tones are really good just as
soft<00:07:42.990> as<00:07:43.170> you<00:07:43.290> can<00:07:43.440> play<00:07:43.650> like<00:07:44.580> a<00:07:44.640> clarinet

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
soft as you can play like a clarinet

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.150 
soft as you can play like a clarinet
playing<00:07:45.360> really<00:07:45.750> a<00:07:45.780> sub<00:07:46.320> tone<00:07:46.590> as<00:07:46.830> they<00:07:46.950> call

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 
playing really a sub tone as they call

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.500 
playing really a sub tone as they call
it<00:07:48.860> if<00:07:49.860> you<00:07:50.040> take<00:07:50.250> a<00:07:50.280> decibel<00:07:50.790> meter<00:07:51.090> I<00:07:51.270> have

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.510 
it if you take a decibel meter I have

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.450 
it if you take a decibel meter I have
one<00:07:51.660> in<00:07:51.780> my<00:07:51.810> office<00:07:52.290> a<00:07:52.500> decibel<00:07:53.340> meter

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 
one in my office a decibel meter

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.070 
one in my office a decibel meter
measures<00:07:55.280> volume<00:07:56.280> and<00:07:56.490> there's<00:07:57.210> a<00:07:57.270> needle<00:07:57.750> and

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 
measures volume and there's a needle and

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.390 
measures volume and there's a needle and
so<00:07:58.890> to<00:07:59.520> go<00:07:59.730> from<00:08:00.060> if<00:08:00.540> you<00:08:00.750> play<00:08:00.930> a<00:08:00.960> crescendo

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 
so to go from if you play a crescendo

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.550 
so to go from if you play a crescendo
from<00:08:02.400> absolute<00:08:03.120> zero<00:08:03.540> which<00:08:03.870> of<00:08:04.050> course<00:08:04.080> is<00:08:04.380> no

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 
from absolute zero which of course is no

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.660 
from absolute zero which of course is no
sound<00:08:04.830> at<00:08:04.980> all<00:08:05.100> to<00:08:06.030> maybe<00:08:06.390> 80<00:08:06.810> decibels<00:08:07.670> it's

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:08.670 
sound at all to maybe 80 decibels it's

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.170 
sound at all to maybe 80 decibels it's
very<00:08:08.910> easy<00:08:09.120> that's<00:08:09.420> basically
