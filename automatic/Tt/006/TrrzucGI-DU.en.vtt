fewer<00:00:56.640> clicks<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.289> back<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:59.780> by

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
fewer clicks so if we go back here by

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.329 
fewer clicks so if we go back here by
going<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:01.230> video<00:01:01.800> mode<00:01:02.120> here<00:01:03.979> this<00:01:04.979> isn't<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
going into video mode here this isn't a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830 
going into video mode here this isn't a
complete<00:01:05.729> final<00:01:05.939> bill<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> same

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
complete final bill this is in the same

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.750 
complete final bill this is in the same
bill<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.350> rolling<00:01:07.560> out<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.430> 12

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
bill that will be rolling out on the 12

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.840 
bill that will be rolling out on the 12
so<00:01:09.390> there's<00:01:09.570> still<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.810> few<00:01:09.990> kinks<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.220> but

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
so there's still a few kinks in this but

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.539 
so there's still a few kinks in this but
here<00:01:12.299> I've<00:01:12.990> got<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.590> real-time<00:01:14.100> effects

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
here I've got a little real-time effects

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
here I've got a little real-time effects
here<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> does<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> facial<00:01:16.259> recognition

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
here it does have the facial recognition

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.160 
here it does have the facial recognition
features<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.580> android<00:01:18.000> 4.0<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.080> you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
features that are in android 4.0 so you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.719 
features that are in android 4.0 so you
knew<00:01:19.290> photomanipulation<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.250> real<00:01:20.430> time

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
knew photomanipulation in real time

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.780 
knew photomanipulation in real time
there's<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.720> cool<00:01:21.960> feature<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.280> it

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
there's a really cool feature but it

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.870 
there's a really cool feature but it
does<00:01:24.180> record<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.810> full<00:01:25.350> 1080p<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.700> we're<00:01:26.790> going

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
does record in full 1080p so we're going

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.120 
does record in full 1080p so we're going
to<00:01:26.970> keep<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.770> we've<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.890> some<00:01:29.070> other

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
to keep going here we've got some other

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.609 
to keep going here we've got some other
cool<00:01:29.220> features<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.909> android<00:01:30.810> 4.0<00:01:31.259> has

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
cool features like android 4.0 has

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230 
cool features like android 4.0 has
native<00:01:32.040> folder<00:01:32.490> support<00:01:32.880> that's<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> lot

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
native folder support that's a lot

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
native folder support that's a lot
better<00:01:33.509> than<00:01:33.750> previous<00:01:34.229> versions<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.650> android

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
better than previous versions of android

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
better than previous versions of android
so<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.180> folder<00:01:36.570> that's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
so right here this is a folder that's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
so right here this is a folder that's
included<00:01:37.200> right<00:01:37.290> off<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> bat<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.040> your
