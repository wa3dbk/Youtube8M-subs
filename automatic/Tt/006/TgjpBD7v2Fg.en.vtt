00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Salve Salve 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.240
 I'm gabriel tubelo, we're talking. 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.330
 plus a check point the daily news 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.580
 here from dj resident wu academy master 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.250
 It was a complete success and ensures 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.049
 Sales for beating shard and now 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.789
 guys want to repeat the dose with the other 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.680
 resident evil series game is talking 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.380
 from resident evil zero it 's good to have 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.060
 announced the remedy also the game was 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.760
 revealed early on Tuesday 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 ending the game exclusivity 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.000
 resident evil series 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.980
 In the shooting game the game will go through a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.160
 process similar to what we saw in the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.170
 remastering the remaster and counting the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.890
 days before the game event 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.540
 original 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.309
 for those who do not remember the game brings a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.770
 copying scheme similar to what the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.809
 people saw in revelations 2 with rebecca 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.850
 chambers and pecking and in charge 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.510
 resident evil zero will arrive for pc 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.270
 playstation 3 playstation 4 xbox 360 e 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.980
 xbox the year in early 2016 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.960
 and it's not only the resident evil is coming back 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.969
 not everyone should know that they have a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 star wars battlefront returning to 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.920
 games and point out that a lot of people thought 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.930
 it is a continuation but the rebound 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.490
 who said this was the jaycee who 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.380
 commented that a decision was reached by a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.600
 rebound after analyzing the points 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.790
 positive and negative of the games 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.110
 rather than attempting to create a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.729
 game over the others 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 the developer thought it would be better 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.150
 start from scratch 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.700
 even so, the core of the proposal is 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.009
 continue and the game will do a lot 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.810
 more sense as regurgitating wars for 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.990
 front comes to stores on 17 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.720
 November for playstation 4 pc and xbox 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.790
 live hotmail we see and pictures 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.740
 trailers and even full games being 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 leaked before the hour, huh? 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.850
 and now we have two examples that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.860
 were leaked there by pure marcelo be 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.689
 only the first one is a tv station 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.369
 began to show details of the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.470
 circuit of Singapore as if it were the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.240
 most normal thing in the world and until 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.939
 now the codemasters had not shown 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.950
 almost nothing from f1 2015 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.380
 the version of the game shown yesterday the three 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.329
 months is enough movement but it already gives 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.399
 to have a good notion there in the system of 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.329
 lighting of the game and also other 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.070
 Details 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.020
 liked it then that a video 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.429
 game official should appear soon 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.709
 since the 2015 f1 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.799
 still on July 9 to pc 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.420
 playstation 4 and xbox flat another vacillus 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.549
 was made by one of the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.200
 developers to be 'citizens' 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.269
 that game that gained enough prominence 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.189
 for getting a high 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.549
 kickstarter and also for mixing 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.260
 simulation with fps and mm rpg 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.540
 because it is because of a failure 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.239
 developer released part of a url 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.489
 which directed the principal director of 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.230
 title files there a galley 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.120
 have been able to complete the link and 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.220
 48 gb of content 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.930
 before the developer realized the trick 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.019
 to make everything even more complicated 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.659
 the guys took the files and ran a 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.709
 understanding client up to video 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.359
 Do you see there? 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.129
 obvious that in the final version things 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.620
 should be quite different but just that 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.510
 Early in looks only yesterday was 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.060
 commenting on the river quay project 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.739
 this Tuesday in the river and a vicente 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.689
 sent a comment there saying that he 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.340
 I was a bit upset with the pressure of the xbox 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.590
 the year that also trains some bugs there 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.540
 What bothers you a lot and then why? 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.090
 coincidence of fate with tears 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.169
 studios has announced that direct x 12 will 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.479
 improve a lot 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.159
 the version of the year and speaking in xbox has 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:21.760
 an exclusive version 3 60 in brazil 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.620
 arriving there the creator of the car project 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.659
 said the new version of the packages 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.790
 microsoft graphics should improve 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.599
 clearly with the performance of the game in the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.099
 console 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.229
 but that's not all they are 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.870
 working no improvements should come to 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:36.970
 all versions and specifically for 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.919
 the physics of the game in xbox one 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.620
 soon there should also be new 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.359
 tracks and vehicles is a 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.000
 joy to everyone except for 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.189
 version of the river that continues without news 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.229
 but if you are part of it by chance 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.909
 guys who're getting a 360 now 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.530
 maybe I also played my're through 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.379
 better people's paradise 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.659
 microsoft announced a new kenji 360 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.549
 for brazil this version will come with two 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.949
 already factory controls and with the 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.560
 table of 999 reais 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.269
 the world of competitive games only grow 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.349
 to bring down in the xp frame this 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.930
 only joy 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.209
 florence should only just everywhere 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.430
 very competitive wonderful should not 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.340
 bloom 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.859
 online good night anyway it does not matter if 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.389
 you on the way if you are from the games of 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.880
 first-person shooter if you're from 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.160
 where that motor's struggle to deposit there not 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.229
 It matters if you like sports and people. 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.630
 Today you have people who know that you 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.710
 spend more money on games because the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.710
 general public 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.870
 it's just a research it's a juvenile kitten 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.400
 chain beyond cupira you thought 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.229
 It was only out of love in the heart. 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.540
 they had both big and 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.130
 success stories linked to the product 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.340
 and shops of pc 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.870
 The advice is always to see the 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.389
 money to the devil 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.100
 the research was done by age I think 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.590
 that's how the specialized company talks 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.010
 in the video game market analyzes 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.560
 sports fans spend an average of 250 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.440
 dollars more than non-fans to 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.080
 mount your pc can of this money of course 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.900
 that goes on mice keyboards and headsets 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.400
 high quality that of giraldo ben 10 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.830
 depending on your age 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.380
 but it is not only this that we do not spend on 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.100
 consoles games and even games for 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.050
 cell phone 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.020
 this public almost 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.669
 $ 100 more each year wants 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.740
 see all data in detail a and 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.110
 quiet very calm then run to 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.450
 full story in bjc is here 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.979
 Registration does not a week that 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.080
 Tim Key's staff announced that we 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.630
 will have information soon 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.300
 on your next tribe title in neco 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.669
 the gigantic title Procon in abdomen 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.310
 the zune but now the guys started to 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.450
 jump the chaotic pits on a website of 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.860
 fetus humor, right? 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:53.440
 sinister information then it is time to 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.120
 investigate before we start people is 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.760
 I am speaking here of the company for leaves 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.099
 low shock form and ex mafia 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.720
 for then the account of the rain that 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.630
 fall on twitter today was marked by 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.460
 Company disclosure warned to have a 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.099
 responsible company because the cities 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.229
 offer 24 hour protection 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.449
 for its residents and manipulation 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.460
 genetics capable of eliminating using this 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:19.100
 wow that's amazing 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.509
 but the same footprint that lacks promise 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.199
 much like the bar reptile 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.419
 mall 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.220
 both on the site and the tweets they hide 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.069
 secret messages of a resistance 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.590
 contrary to this corporation which seems to 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.990
 be just a facade of terror 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.229
 it is more likely that the event is not 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.449
 the name of the game but rather that the advent already 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.800
 one of the main points of the 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:41.870
 history of this game 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.770
 and then what do you think and even more about 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.319
 What do you want? 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.900
 the shock the dystopic future the brand 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:50.150
 cyber punk or new risked in the footprint of 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.919
 apocalypse gives a check in the 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.910
 news and a joke in the 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.979
 Apr website 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.810
 It's really cool there that you find the 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:59.449
 secret messages that appear to 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.880
 hard on the page is the first step 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.830
 towards the hype of this new game is 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.870
 whatever it is he is very likely to 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.360
 more information about this project 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.240
 advent and appear in e3 we'll go 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.250
 to be there talk in body, not investigating 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.340
 everything close and also here in the bjc 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.470
 hygiene records of the news there 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.990
 you make excuses istomin sick starts 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.820
 means I'm there we'll see but we 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.770
 which was presented here for a long time 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.630
 enjoying and taking always gives that jewel 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.759
 subscribe to the channel to be a part 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.710
