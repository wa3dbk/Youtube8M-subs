00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.320
 so we repair glow plugs 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.939
 they are located with us 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:53.059
 here it is generally remove here they are ours 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:53.059
 candles so 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:04.619
 holding back the wires these two on such 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.159
 strong on feeling that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.159
 afraid to break 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.170
 one 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:40.909
 for loosening you need a key for 10 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:44.409
 I use the elongated head like this 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.409
 soviet length key 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.140
 hexagon by 8 millimeters then 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:58.390
 shank inserted very so 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.390
 productively obtained by unscrewing 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.560
 Well, here's the first chip with the first candle 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.930
 checked started with 15 amps warm up 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:38.080
 finished 9 the vampire checking the second 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.080
 candle 16 amp start 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:03:00.080
 all red hot 1110 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:00.080
 distemper everything so with the third candle 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.990
 so humbles them plus in Russia 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.879
 so 16 amps started 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.670
 1211 10 amps 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.670
 it's all red warmed up 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:53.200
 so the last candle is all hot 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:27.060
 so 16 amperes 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:27.060
 15 stand and 1211 here just warmed up 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:40.180
 all normal candles and so stuck 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:43.240
 I will plug in the candles now 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.320
 ignition and look like really 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.320
 they run high 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.949
 concluded 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:09.990
 we red Russia heats up even with 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.990
 first time you share sheet 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.290
 2 1 key 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.650
 even how beautiful 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.659
 but 3 spun 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.569
