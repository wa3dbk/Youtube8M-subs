00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
white I'd only have one little flaw if

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.410 
white I'd only have one little flaw if
you<00:00:09.900> look<00:00:10.050> at<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.170> tuning<00:00:10.590> key<00:00:11.340> for<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> low<00:00:12.389> E

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
you look at the tuning key for the low E

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.390 
you look at the tuning key for the low E
there's<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.870> little<00:00:13.049> tab<00:00:13.349> sticking<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.190> as

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
there's a little tab sticking out as

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.640 
there's a little tab sticking out as
supposed<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.849> stick<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> wood<00:00:15.529> when<00:00:16.529> they

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
supposed to stick in the wood when they

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.849 
supposed to stick in the wood when they
screw<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:18.140> it's<00:00:19.140> not<00:00:19.230> even<00:00:19.439> worth<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
screw it in it's not even worth the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.349 
screw it in it's not even worth the
trouble<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.310> fixing<00:00:20.699> until<00:00:20.939> next<00:00:21.060> time<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
trouble of fixing until next time I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.660 
trouble of fixing until next time I
change<00:00:21.600> strings<00:00:22.160> even<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.310> might<00:00:23.550> just

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
change strings even then I might just

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.200 
change strings even then I might just
leave<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:23.939> alone<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.779> really<00:00:25.109> nice<00:00:25.260> white

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
leave it alone it's really nice white

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.540 
leave it alone it's really nice white
it's<00:00:27.210> very<00:00:27.420> heavy<00:00:27.599> actually<00:00:28.140> like<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.550> real

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it's very heavy actually like a real

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.330 
it's very heavy actually like a real
Fender<00:00:29.970> Stratocaster<00:00:31.040> so<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> difference

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
Fender Stratocaster so the difference

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940 
Fender Stratocaster so the difference
between<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.910> one<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> plays

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
between this one really is that it plays

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.720 
between this one really is that it plays
just<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.399> nice<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.380> cost<00:00:37.590> me<00:00:37.710> 129<00:00:38.489> bucks

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
just as nice and it cost me 129 bucks

00:00:38.730 --> 00:01:16.660 
just as nice and it cost me 129 bucks
instead<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:40.309> anything<00:00:41.309> more<00:00:41.460> than<00:00:41.610> that

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.219 

it's<00:01:17.670> got<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.060> nice<00:01:18.180> action<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.960> very

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
it's got really nice action it's very

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
it's got really nice action it's very
very<00:01:19.560> soft<00:01:20.160> like<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> good<00:01:26.149> it's<00:01:27.149> great<00:01:27.450> for

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
