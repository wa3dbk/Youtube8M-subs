where I basically started meet the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.799 
where I basically started meet the
paralyzer<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.280> um<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.390> light<00:00:39.600> up<00:00:39.690> all

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
paralyzer and um we just light up all

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
paralyzer and um we just light up all
the<00:00:39.870> crystal<00:00:40.140> balls<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.800> first<00:00:41.100> three<00:00:41.340> are

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the crystal balls the first three are

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.260 
the crystal balls the first three are
before<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> manner<00:00:42.899> which<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.350> manner<00:00:44.270> which

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
before the manner which is manner which

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
before the manner which is manner which
I<00:00:45.629> would<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.230> last<00:00:46.969> because<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.180> um<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:49.579> don't

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579

know I don't explain it it's which is
men<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.370> tough<00:00:53.579> plus<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> go<00:00:54.000> through

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
men is kind of tough plus you go through

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.160 
men is kind of tough plus you go through
if<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.360> don't<00:00:54.480> know<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.629> you're<00:00:54.750> doing<00:00:55.020> or

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
if you don't know what you're doing or

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.500 
if you don't know what you're doing or
if<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> group<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.890> people<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.270> go

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
if you have a group of people if you go

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.029 
if you have a group of people if you go
through<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> time<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.829> like

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
through you know one at a time it's like

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.290 
through you know one at a time it's like
easier<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.730> make<00:00:59.879> sure<00:00:59.969> everybody<00:01:00.210> else

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
easier and make sure everybody else

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.910 
easier and make sure everybody else
spread<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.719> within<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> town<00:01:01.940> um<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.769> go

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
spread out within the town um so we go

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
spread out within the town um so we go
through<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.299> did<00:01:06.450> dive<00:01:06.780> off

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
through here and I think I did dive off

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.469 
through here and I think I did dive off
of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.500> edge<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.490> goes<00:01:08.700> oh<00:01:08.939> yeah<00:01:09.090> because<00:01:09.330> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
of the edge it goes oh yeah because I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.719 
of the edge it goes oh yeah because I
the<00:01:09.630> instant<00:01:10.229> perk<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:10.560> permanent<00:01:11.010> PhD

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the instant perk or permanent PhD

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
the instant perk or permanent PhD
flopper<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.020> by<00:01:13.260> jumping<00:01:13.560> off

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
flopper and you get that by jumping off

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.200 
flopper and you get that by jumping off
a<00:01:13.890> sort<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.130> high<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> couple<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> times<00:01:14.970> like

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
a sort of high a couple of times like

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.260 
a sort of high a couple of times like
five<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.689> ten<00:01:15.869> times<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.320> heard<00:01:16.640> um<00:01:17.640> yeah<00:01:18.030> so

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
five or ten times I heard um yeah so

five or ten times I heard um yeah so
it's<00:01:18.390> pretty<00:01:18.509> cool<00:01:18.750> instant<00:01:19.140> perk<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.189> it's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it's pretty cool instant perk and it's

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.800 
it's pretty cool instant perk and it's
pretty<00:01:20.580> nice<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.180> around<00:01:21.390> three<00:01:21.750> in

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pretty nice you see you around three in

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the bank and here's the third crystal

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.609 
the bank and here's the third crystal
ball<00:01:32.250> unity<00:01:32.670> shine<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.200> fourth<00:01:34.470> one

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
ball unity shine at a for the fourth one

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.289 
ball unity shine at a for the fourth one
is<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.950> once<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.790> through<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:36.119> which<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
is out once you go through them which is

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.630 
is out once you go through them which is
a<00:01:36.329> manner<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:37.259> around<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
a manner you go around the back and

a manner you go around the back and
there<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> crystal<00:01:39.450> ball<00:01:39.689> right<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.110> it's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
there is a crystal ball right there it's
