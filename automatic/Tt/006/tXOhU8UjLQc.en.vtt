00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.689 

and<00:00:58.239> before<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.289> do<00:00:59.679> any<00:00:59.829> material<00:01:00.339> editing

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
and before you do any material editing

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.219 
and before you do any material editing
you<00:01:00.850> will<00:01:00.969> have<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:01.210> go<00:01:01.359> into<00:01:03.720> into<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.899> render

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
you will have to go into into the render

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.100 
you will have to go into into the render
setup<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.890> go<00:01:06.070> right<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.490> bottom<00:01:06.700> I<00:01:07.110> use

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110

mental<00:01:08.500> ray<00:01:08.619> I've<00:01:08.830> been<00:01:09.040> using<00:01:09.250> mental<00:01:09.640> ray

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
mental ray I've been using mental ray

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.219 
mental ray I've been using mental ray
for<00:01:10.060> most<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.479> it's<00:01:10.750> already<00:01:10.869> set<00:01:11.200> to

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
for most of this it's already set to

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.430 
for most of this it's already set to
mentally<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.880> now<00:01:13.690> you're<00:01:13.840> just<00:01:13.990> going<00:01:14.259> to<00:01:14.289> the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
mentally so now you're just going to the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.560 
mentally so now you're just going to the

mental ray architectural and design and

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
mental ray architectural and design and
then<00:01:22.090> first<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.780> get<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.880> texture

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.139 

that's<00:01:29.020> for<00:01:29.289> you<00:01:29.350> way<00:01:29.470> use<00:01:30.069> use<00:01:30.789> system

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
that's for you way use use system

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.880 
that's for you way use use system

usually<00:01:35.890> take<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.100> blur<00:01:36.369> off<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.850> base<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
usually take the blur off the base and

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.270 
usually take the blur off the base and
then<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.179> go<00:01:40.569> back<00:01:40.810> into<00:01:41.470> there<00:01:41.679> and<00:01:41.920> then<00:01:42.069> you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
then you go back into there and then you

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.080 
then you go back into there and then you
it's<00:01:42.520> near<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.819> bottom<00:01:43.270> here<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.979> bump<00:01:45.399> now

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
it's near the bottom here then bump now

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.840 
it's near the bottom here then bump now
you<00:01:46.149> go<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.450> normal<00:01:47.110> map<00:01:47.310> click<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.459> it<00:01:48.610> again

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
you go to normal map click on it again

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.289 
you go to normal map click on it again
and<00:01:49.149> then<00:01:50.020> normal<00:01:51.179> bitmap<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.979> then<00:01:54.039> this<00:01:54.369> and

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
and then normal bitmap and then this and

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.270 
and then normal bitmap and then this and
then<00:01:55.450> use<00:01:55.720> system<00:01:56.409> default<00:01:57.360> open<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.539> and<00:01:59.530> I

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
then use system default open that and I

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.380 
then use system default open that and I
use<00:02:01.060> use<00:02:01.329> local<00:02:01.780> XYZ<00:02:03.990> apply<00:02:05.700> apply<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:07.000> to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
use use local XYZ apply apply that to

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.180 
use use local XYZ apply apply that to
the<00:02:07.630> surface

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.700 

render<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:14.100> looks<00:02:14.280> fair<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:16.380> make<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
render it looks fair but I can make that

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.980 
render it looks fair but I can make that
it<00:02:17.010> look<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.370> little<00:02:17.520> more<00:02:17.670> realistic<00:02:18.210> by<00:02:18.660> just

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
it look a little more realistic by just

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.150 
it look a little more realistic by just
whoops<00:02:20.630> by<00:02:21.630> adjusting<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.680> setting<00:02:23.040> right

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
whoops by adjusting this setting right

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.040 
whoops by adjusting this setting right
here<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:24.350> usually<00:02:25.350> use<00:02:25.740> five<00:02:26.780> because<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.810> gives

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
here I usually use five because it gives

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.000 
here I usually use five because it gives
you<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.230> much<00:02:28.530> deeper<00:02:29.690> right<00:02:30.690> there<00:02:31.010> that's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
you a much deeper right there that's

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.360 
you a much deeper right there that's
much<00:02:32.280> deeper<00:02:32.580> now<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.900> also<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.560> might<00:02:35.100> want

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
much deeper now but also you might want

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.780 
much deeper now but also you might want
to<00:02:35.460> take<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.670> blue<00:02:35.880> off<00:02:35.910> for<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.630> too

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.550 

and<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.940> some<00:02:45.150> cases<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.800> well<00:02:47.520> um<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:48.560> turn

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
and in some cases it it well um I turn

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.160 
and in some cases it it well um I turn

lighting<00:02:52.440> effects<00:02:52.890> sometimes<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.090> will<00:02:54.470> seem

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
lighting effects sometimes it will seem

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.610 
lighting effects sometimes it will seem
black<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.630> noticed<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.780> seems<00:02:57.960> black<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.530> very

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
black I noticed it seems black and very

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.120 
black I noticed it seems black and very
glossy<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.460> just<00:02:59.930> zero<00:03:00.930> these<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:04.350> it

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
glossy so I just zero these and it

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.650 
glossy so I just zero these and it
usually<00:03:05.520> helps<00:03:09.590> just<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:12.090> will

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
usually helps just like that but I will

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.290 
usually helps just like that but I will
go<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> will<00:03:13.140> show<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.350> guys<00:03:13.620> uh<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.060> scene

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
go I will show you guys uh it in a scene

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:23.460 
go I will show you guys uh it in a scene
that<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:15.930> created<00:03:18.980> already

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.289 

there's<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.560> small<00:03:24.890> shadrach<00:03:25.459> UPS<00:03:25.760> shaded<00:03:28.299> it's
