00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.069
 to air 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.979
 the water engines that are wrapped in the secret game industry of that 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.659
 gram your son would agree to talk about the essential points 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.089
 this is what we call mini kerti 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.970
 It's a small car to the city. 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.029
 so I wanted to understand very modern 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.019
 yes it looks good 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.019
 what's on the bottom is what we want 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.420
 the motor area placed in the back of the basic structure or so 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.320
 and is moved by this fear daily visitors 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.080
 the size of sped 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.310
 this is what you want to put on the next manufactured vehicles 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.399
 how many liters have the idea that the delivery of the books 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.250
 It is quite tight from guns from private life with capacity with 300 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.460
 liters tiago 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.490
 How long has he been able to tie 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.880
 It's nice to have this type of car that is quite light has 550 pounds and 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.429
 we wait 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.680
 140 kilometers from the city of chicago the city of chicago 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.110
 this is enough to get up to 110 kilometers per hour 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.960
 I must have managed to score 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.160
 after experimenting 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
 and I bet they drove 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.930
 lets give 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.600
 confusion to start and will be in 3 hours and the tombini pedals that 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.970
 fascinates buildings 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.090
 I'll try 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.420
 its superleve fiberglass chassis means that it is incredibly cheap 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.600
 to put political rabbis of millÃ´r every 100 kilometers 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 without any punishment 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.640
 have cities where 60% of drivers drive less than 50 kilometers 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.109
 time he seems to be the only one 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.109
 we do not like interior 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.190
 when the car stops at the traffic light bike will not use unlike the engines at 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.610

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.520
 market in the next 18 months 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.029
 It seems like I'm driving a tractor. 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.939
 as every car also works as air compressors 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.779
 so when parked and can be connected to a normal outlet it will turn 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.779
 recharge the tanks with the 23 hours 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.549
 the company foresees the installation of points for water refueling 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.489
 next to the house door 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.300
 this means that when there is little rice tanks can be served in 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.659
 only three of us needed a little more boring than we have to do is 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.509
