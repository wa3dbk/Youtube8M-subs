00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.120
 thanks Peter, well, he did not talk about 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.970
 his career but I can 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.230
 say that he is a man that 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.880
 any of us that touch us the 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.030
 fortunate to fall into their hands is a 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.250
 good news and it leaves us beautiful 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.289
 glamorous make-up clear that according to 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.279
 the occasion but yes he is a connoisseur of 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.199
 the feminine beauty of all all now 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.929
 I have to tell you a little about my 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.140
 relationship with chalk and I do not speak in a 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.750
 employment relationship because first of all 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.600
 I remember when I'm going to send 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.680
 when my mom was little but I was born 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.500
 in the sixties 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.080
 It is worth mentioning then 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.250
 this then it turns out that my mom uses 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.550
 no exposure every day 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.340
 and I think it was part of his arrangement 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.400
 staff that I was most interested in witnessing 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.980
 because on the one hand I was amazed at the 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.480
 result not then he took them off and 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.180
 not that I used a new diary then 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.520
 then he took them off and washed them and 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.410
 rolled up I think in a pen or in a 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.890
 so then I had to maintain 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.920
 in a can or was it was an era 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.960
 project that each villain saw 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.600
 so pretty with the eyelashes and could not see 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.840
 nothing nice in the eyelashes justice in 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.820
 what time this can be something that 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.680
 you live all that is, not that you do not go 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.840
 this transformation what he said does 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.950
 Javier's time of the lady that I 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.470
 agreement that the mom of itatÃ­ cantoral 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.119
 for example her husband was married to 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.880
 roberto cantoral never saw her without 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.590
 never make up ever at 30 and I do not know 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.619
 how many years he slipped were 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.810
 together then I always said he wants to 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.640
 So great challenge to be a woman and see you beautiful 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.119
 arranged and that when it's fresh 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.500
 raised man be a decent one not you 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.850
 good to the eyelashes for me have always 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.920
 been the best accessory that a woman 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.940
 can have and I really mean it 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.950
 heart 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.800
 so good, my mom dares her eyelashes 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.230
 Italian dressings and have pretty eyes 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.560
 he has green cute snacks and 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.290
 said what's up with the tab then 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.570
 I always worried about finding more 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.910
 Mascara that was better for me was not afraid of 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.210
 will lengthen more for when I was 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.740
 arranged to see me better later because 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.500
 already after using they are allowed to use 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.270
 false eyelashes and then for the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.220
 television when when when do I 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.250
 television always used tabs 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.220
 false finally began to come out on 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.620
 boom to not suddenly suddenly one day 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.540
 a long time ago I see an announcement of a 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.160
 product that is called pencil and what 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.290
 announced brooke shields in magazines 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.860
 and I realized that the feature 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.570
 of the ad was just like you 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.700
 they demand in the USA that they have to 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.500
 announce the medicines you said what 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.540
 so funny thing is because they are 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.830
 announcing something that seems to have 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.710
 a cosmetic use 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.620
 or a cosmetic result only and 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.350
 is with all the specifications 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.819
 little letters that put the medicines in 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.790
 us that 10 o'clock 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.540
 is very demanding with that data did not call me 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.950
 attention 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.609
 I am well metiche even observer 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.109
 then I started to know what was the 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.609
 tease but I realized also good 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.379
 according to me it was a product that 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.540
 I would need until medical prescription 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.879
 because he had all that support 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.129
 scientific and therefore the result 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.659
 approval is not true good after 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.209
 Time passed and I still had not 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.639
 used the pencil and changed to the wing 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.489
 brooke shields by claire that we not 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.919
 I liked the truth so much then I would be 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.769
 good how interesting and such while 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:35.799
 both in Gothic city they started us 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.019
 bring certain more this masks and 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.430
 products and that this one that the other that you 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.670
 the eyelashes begin to grow 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.750
 and some buy someone else gave me 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.650
 And I mean eyelashes or 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.829
 they grew me up if they dropped me and I was and 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.510
 as this matter does not finally the 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.090
 The first time I used the pencil was 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.620
 because they sent it to me as a 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.189
 gift from the agency of 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.189
 public relations 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.989
 I must say one thing that is also 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:12.340
 very important talking about the backup 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.659
 scientist who endorses the tish for me 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.829
 I can be very vain and want to see me 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.340
 very good but for me it is more important 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:22.900
 my health and I do not get or get involved 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.210
 I do not like anything that does not have a 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.850
 backing because I care a lot in my 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.530
 family there has been an incidence 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.430
 terrible of cancer and things like that 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.710
 so 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.870
 I take a lot care of what I do with my health 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.699
 first of all and then later if partly not 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.849
 I can see well that father but it's not my 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.849
 priority
