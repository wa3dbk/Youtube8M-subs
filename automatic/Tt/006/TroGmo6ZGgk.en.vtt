flash according to the image and the
scenery<00:02:22.950> obviously<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.099> back<00:02:24.250> we've<00:02:24.430> got

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
scenery obviously on the back we've got

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.050 
scenery obviously on the back we've got
the<00:02:24.580> Apple<00:02:24.910> logo<00:02:26.010> etc<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.550> interesting<00:02:27.790> that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
the Apple logo etc it's interesting that

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.270 
the Apple logo etc it's interesting that
they<00:02:28.180> call<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.540> slate<00:02:28.930> because<00:02:29.440> if<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:30.160> look

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
they call this slate because if you look

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.220 
they call this slate because if you look
at<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:31.720> actually<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.349> black<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:34.230> gray

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
at it it's actually just black and gray

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.600 
at it it's actually just black and gray
from<00:02:35.500> last<00:02:35.680> year<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:37.360> they're<00:02:37.510> calling<00:02:37.810> this

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
from last year but they're calling this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.020 
from last year but they're calling this
space<00:02:39.610> grain<00:02:39.940> which<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.670> really<00:02:42.670> weird<00:02:42.790> name

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
space grain which is a really weird name

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.479 
space grain which is a really weird name
and<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:44.319> don't<00:02:44.379> think<00:02:44.620> they<00:02:44.890> want<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.160> be<00:02:45.280> seen

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
and I don't think they want to be seen

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.670 
and I don't think they want to be seen
as<00:02:45.900> producing<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.959> same<00:02:47.110> colors<00:02:47.379> as<00:02:47.500> last

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
as producing the same colors as last

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.559 
as producing the same colors as last
year<00:02:47.920> especially<00:02:48.459> when<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.640> iPhone<00:02:48.910> 5c<00:02:49.360> has<00:02:49.540> a

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
year especially when the iPhone 5c has a

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.860 
year especially when the iPhone 5c has a
bunch<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:49.930> new<00:02:50.050> colors<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.760> okay<00:02:52.450> whatever

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
bunch of new colors so okay whatever

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.920 
bunch of new colors so okay whatever

like the only key difference is here on

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.800 
like the only key difference is here on
the<00:03:29.100> front<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:29.940> I've<00:03:30.060> done<00:03:30.240> if<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.630> see

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
ID fingerprint sensor it actually looks

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.610 
ID fingerprint sensor it actually looks
different<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.900> home<00:03:37.020> button<00:03:39.590> which<00:03:40.590> is

is the touch ID any good and do we need
it<00:03:46.310> we'll<00:03:47.310> be<00:03:47.430> back<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.730> answer<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.510> what

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
it we'll be back to answer that so what

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.560 
it we'll be back to answer that so what

about the specs well underneath the hood

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.480 
about the specs well underneath the hood
so<00:03:51.570> inside<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.080> very<00:03:52.320> slim<00:03:52.650> body<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.280> is

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
so inside this very slim body that is

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.200 
so inside this very slim body that is
seven<00:03:54.450> point<00:03:54.600> six<00:03:54.870> millimeters<00:03:55.050> slim<00:03:56.210> we've
