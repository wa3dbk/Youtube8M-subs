39 USB battery on the top of the battery
you<00:00:29.149> see<00:00:29.300> we<00:00:29.390> have<00:00:29.509> two<00:00:29.660> USB<00:00:29.869> ports<00:00:30.640> here<00:00:31.640> and

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
you see we have two USB ports here and

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.180 
you see we have two USB ports here and
the<00:00:32.630> reason<00:00:32.870> why<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.110> have<00:00:33.200> two<00:00:33.380> ports<00:00:33.800> is<00:00:33.980> that

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
the reason why we have two ports is that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.670 
the reason why we have two ports is that
tablets<00:00:35.030> have<00:00:35.180> pretty<00:00:35.540> large<00:00:35.840> batteries<00:00:36.440> and

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
tablets have pretty large batteries and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.350 
tablets have pretty large batteries and
to<00:00:37.460> charge<00:00:37.730> efficiently<00:00:38.450> they<00:00:38.900> need<00:00:39.620> a<00:00:39.650> higher

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
to charge efficiently they need a higher

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.330 
to charge efficiently they need a higher
current<00:00:41.360> or<00:00:41.480> higher<00:00:41.600> power<00:00:41.900> output<00:00:42.530> then<00:00:43.100> what

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
current or higher power output then what

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.530 
current or higher power output then what
you<00:00:43.460> need<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.760> charge<00:00:43.970> your<00:00:44.090> phone<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:44.510> that

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
you need to charge your phone so that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.800 
you need to charge your phone so that
the<00:00:45.110> port<00:00:45.500> on<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.740> right<00:00:45.920> is<00:00:46.660> outputs<00:00:47.660> high

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
the port on the right is outputs high

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.410 
the port on the right is outputs high
power<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.710> charge<00:00:48.980> tablets<00:00:49.490> quickly<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.060> then

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
power to charge tablets quickly and then

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.970 
power to charge tablets quickly and then
port<00:00:50.660> on<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.810> left<00:00:51.020> is<00:00:51.260> probably<00:00:51.680> like<00:00:51.860> the

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
port on the left is probably like the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.740 
port on the left is probably like the
one<00:00:52.130> like<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.400> have<00:00:52.550> on<00:00:52.670> your<00:00:52.760> computer<00:00:53.150> it's

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
one like you have on your computer it's

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.920 
one like you have on your computer it's
a<00:00:53.840> low<00:00:53.960> power<00:00:54.230> port<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:54.710> we<00:00:54.800> use<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.160> charge

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
a low power port and we use it to charge

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.420 
a low power port and we use it to charge
electronics<00:00:56.930> like<00:00:57.470> your<00:00:57.739> cell<00:00:58.070> phone<00:00:58.250> or

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430

your computer well though it may not

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.230 
your computer well though it may not
have<00:01:35.930> as<00:01:36.049> much<00:01:36.170> power<00:01:36.229> as<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.799> USB<00:01:37.610> charger<00:01:38.090> that

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
have as much power as a USB charger that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.940 
have as much power as a USB charger that
came<00:01:38.390> with<00:01:38.600> your<00:01:38.690> device<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.380> might<00:01:39.590> take<00:01:39.920> a

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
came with your device so it might take a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.980 
came with your device so it might take a
little<00:01:40.130> longer<00:01:40.510> so<00:01:41.510> that's<00:01:41.630> what<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:41.930> you

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
little longer so that's what so you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.840 
little longer so that's what so you
charge<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.040> up<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.310> way<00:01:43.490> it's<00:01:43.640> pretty

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
charge it up that way it's pretty

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.660 
charge it up that way it's pretty
straightforward<00:01:44.150> if<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:45.500> get<00:01:46.159> our<00:01:46.280> spark

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
straightforward if you get our spark

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.130 
straightforward if you get our spark
tablet<00:01:47.119> case<00:01:47.299> which<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:48.229> solar<00:01:49.130> charger<00:01:50.140> the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
tablet case which is a solar charger the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.600 
tablet case which is a solar charger the
solar<00:01:51.409> panels<00:01:51.830> connecting<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.430> same

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
solar panels connecting the same

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.880 
solar panels connecting the same
location<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.299> they<00:01:54.020> connect<00:01:54.320> right<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:54.650> here

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
location and they connect right in here

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.020 
location and they connect right in here
I<00:01:55.040> guess<00:01:56.080> so<00:01:57.080> this<00:01:57.229> battery<00:01:57.710> when<00:01:57.950> full<00:01:58.369> will

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
I guess so this battery when full will

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.249 
I guess so this battery when full will
charge<00:01:59.600> your<00:01:59.900> iPad<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.470> little<00:02:00.560> bit<00:02:00.860> more<00:02:01.100> than

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
charge your iPad a little bit more than

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.620 
charge your iPad a little bit more than
once<00:02:03.259> we're<00:02:03.830> getting<00:02:03.950> about<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.880> hundred<00:02:05.390> and

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
once we're getting about a hundred and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.570 
once we're getting about a hundred and
ten<00:02:05.810> percent<00:02:06.259> charge<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.189> means<00:02:07.430> we're

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
ten percent charge so that means we're

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.729 
ten percent charge so that means we're
charging<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:07.970> fully<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.299> then<00:02:08.509> maybe<00:02:09.409> ten

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
charging it fully and then maybe ten

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.870 
charging it fully and then maybe ten
percent<00:02:10.069> more<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.329> battery<00:02:11.629> so<00:02:11.779> it<00:02:12.669> has

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
percent more in the battery so it has

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.880 
percent more in the battery so it has
a<00:02:14.030> lot<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.540> power<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.140> it'll<00:02:15.290> charge<00:02:15.650> your

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
a lot of power to it it'll charge your

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.280 
a lot of power to it it'll charge your
phone<00:02:16.100> probably<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.880> don't<00:02:17.540> know<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.780> exact

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
phone probably I don't know the exact

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.920 
phone probably I don't know the exact
map<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.710> probably<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.220> know<00:02:19.540> five<00:02:20.540> or<00:02:20.570> six

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
map of probably you know five or six

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.610 
map of probably you know five or six
times<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.850> what<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.570> can<00:02:23.660> do<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.960> you<00:02:24.590> can

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
times so what you can do is you can

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.170 
times so what you can do is you can
press<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.070> button<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.700> will<00:02:25.760> that's

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
press this button and that will that's

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.370 
press this button and that will that's
the<00:02:26.330> capacity<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.810> that'll<00:02:27.080> tell<00:02:27.260> you

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
the capacity and that'll tell you

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.320 
the capacity and that'll tell you
roughly<00:02:27.650> how<00:02:27.920> full<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.430> charging<00:02:28.940> charged

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
roughly how full it is charging charged

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.210 
roughly how full it is charging charged
indicators<00:02:29.780> are<00:02:29.960> not<00:02:30.110> it's<00:02:30.350> kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.590> an<00:02:30.740> exact

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
indicators are not it's kind of an exact

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.460 
indicators are not it's kind of an exact
science<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:31.760> if<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.720> see<00:02:32.900> four<00:02:33.140> lights<00:02:33.350> that

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
science but if you see four lights that

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.290 
science but if you see four lights that
means<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:33.980> roughly<00:02:34.220> full<00:02:34.490> if<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.790> see<00:02:35.030> one

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
means it's roughly full if you see one

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.720 
means it's roughly full if you see one
light<00:02:35.510> means<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.350> about<00:02:36.530> time<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.800> charge<00:02:37.580> it

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
light means it's about time to charge it

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.870 
light means it's about time to charge it
again<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.380> now<00:02:39.620> I'm<00:02:40.460> going<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.670> show<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.850> how

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
again so now I'm going to show you how

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.480 
again so now I'm going to show you how
you<00:02:41.000> charge<00:02:41.300> your<00:02:41.390> device<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:42.140> it's<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
you charge your device so it's the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.350 
you charge your device so it's the
simplest<00:02:43.850> way<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.300> if<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.870> have<00:02:45.110> an<00:02:45.520> iPad<00:02:46.520> and

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
simplest way is if you have an iPad and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.870 
simplest way is if you have an iPad and
put<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:47.840> here<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.580> comes<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:49.730> this

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
put this in here and comes with this

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.020 
put this in here and comes with this
charging<00:02:50.510> cable<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:52.340> simply<00:02:52.580> turn<00:02:52.970> on

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
charging cable and you simply turn on

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.370 
charging cable and you simply turn on
the<00:02:53.270> battery<00:02:53.360> by<00:02:53.720> holding<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.110> power<00:02:54.140> button

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
the battery by holding the power button

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.090 
the battery by holding the power button
down<00:02:54.770> for<00:02:55.010> three<00:02:55.190> or<00:02:55.280> four<00:02:55.400> seconds<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:57.100> you

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
down for three or four seconds and you

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.120 
down for three or four seconds and you
plug<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:58.720> there<00:02:59.720> we<00:02:59.900> see<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.350> the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
plug it in and there we see that the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.800 
plug it in and there we see that the
ipad<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.150> charging<00:03:02.930> there's<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.170> little<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:04.810> lot

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
ipad is charging there's a little a lot

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.360 
ipad is charging there's a little a lot
of<00:03:05.960> focus<00:03:06.140> but<00:03:06.290> there's<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.890> lightning<00:03:07.190> bolt

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
of focus but there's the lightning bolt

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:16.000 
of focus but there's the lightning bolt
is<00:03:07.520> showing<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:13.660> e39<00:03:14.660> also<00:03:15.140> comes<00:03:15.380> with<00:03:15.500> this

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
is showing the e39 also comes with this

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.400 
is showing the e39 also comes with this
