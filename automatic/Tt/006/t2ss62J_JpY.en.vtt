 Using a 3- car plateau camp village 3-26 zoom course 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.039
 Here is the start place I want to start for the first time 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.770
 The back side of this mountain will be the receptionist 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.950
 It is reception desk of this facility 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:46.090
 Let me climb the course all the time 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:50.980
 Well the top or the most marshy place 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:54.970
 Since it becomes a mountain locker is it cracker of Yappa from here 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.770

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.430
 Very road has become a three-dimensional but I'm going to 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.680
 The Tteyuu place say it Deko is Koide 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.940
 By force 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:34.360
 It is very dangerous if you try to get out 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:39.160
 It is good to move your body according to the unevenness according to the road surface as much as possible . 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.780
 Well, I try to accelerate along the road surface to avoid pedaling as much as possible 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:47.430
 Please try to image 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.430
 Then I think that I can go smoothly from top to bottom I think this is the first barrier first 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.560
 It is around was only half right here is 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.700
 Come feel good now feels straight road shook from here 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.920
 I will climb here a little 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.629
 I climb a bit and a third of the art goes down from here, but down from here 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.840
 I have a road 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:24.220
 Please to know what holding full brake speed even with a mind will be slightly faster in 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.220
 So we finally entered 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.800
 One third of the remaining climbs a little and climbs a little, so speed comes from here 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.370
 It becomes a section 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:42.310
 There is nothing towards the right 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:48.990

 I 'll climb a little, but I 'll make it a goal before the start of that little gain 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.120
