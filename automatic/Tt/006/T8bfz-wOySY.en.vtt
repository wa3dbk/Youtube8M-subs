00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:11.000
 After a crackling and very rich March of valuable releases, April was a month 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.209
 of transition. The few releases for the major platforms have allowed players to recover, 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.812
 and focus more on the digital delivery scene, where, in some cases, it really is 

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:25.510
 Spring has blossomed. Waiting for a May that will hold more than one surprise, 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.820
 let's see what is the April Game of the Month. 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:39.350
 Fire Emblem Awakening is not the best chapter in the historic saga. Because of a narration 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.850
 not always convincing, too linear and sometimes too stereotyped, but also because of it 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.550
 of certain problems in the management of the interface and the inventory. Even net of these 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.020
 imperfections, the tactical and strategic substrate of this new chapter is of absolute importance, 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.739
 thanks to new introductions that focus the player's attention on positioning 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.199
 troops and a more pleasant level-up system. Awakening therefore remains a very solid 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.460
 exponent of tactical role-playing games, still very harsh for neophytes but able to dispense 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.340
 to the veterans excellent satisfactions. 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:22.299
 Shootmania Storm has convinced us, and we are certain that it will quickly succeed in establishing itself in the area 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.861
 of competitive play and in E-sport. Once again Nadeo managed to propose a 

00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:31.730
 simple title but at the same time able to satisfy players of all types. 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.720
 Surely those who have never appreciated an FPS arena will not start doing it now, but who it is 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.680
 looking for a title that can shine even within a few minutes and guarantee 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.940
 at the same time a high level of challenge, he will surely be happy to meet Shootmania 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.159
 Storm. 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.759
 BattleBlock Theater amazes thanks to a captivating artistic direction, a plot 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.469
 tantalizing and gameplay enhanced by an always stimulating and purposeful level design. 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.290
 In its central part the adventure shows the side to some less successful moments, 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.979
 but these are trifles compared to the value of the global offer. BattleBlock Theater is 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.260
 an XBLA not to be missed. 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:24.640
 Injustice is a popular fighting game, which strives above all to please the great 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.400
 public and to propose a well-structured experience, rather than to refine and balance the dynamics 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.650
 of the combat system. Long-lived and certainly rich, Injustice is therefore not only interesting 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.900
 for fans of the DC world, who will find a varied and original roster, but for everyone 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.010
 fighting fans at general meetings. 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:55.180
 Our Game of the Month comes from the portable world. Guacamelee! enters the restricted right 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.980
 circle of the most exciting games ever released on PS Vita. The brilliant plot 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.400
 and successful, which is coupled with a sumptuous artistic direction and a wonderful soundtrack, 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.920
 will keep you glued to the console screen up to the end credits. The gameplay, deep 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.580
 and faithful to the canons dictated by the subgenus of Metroidvania, it alternates very platform phases 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.520
 intriguing to interesting fights. Recommended for anyone with a PS Vita 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.200
 Guacamelee! in short, our Game of the Month wins.
