outside<00:00:57.690> normally<00:00:58.379> that's<00:00:58.620> an<00:00:58.800> advantage<00:00:59.160> but

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
outside normally that's an advantage but

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
outside normally that's an advantage but
with<00:00:59.609> as<00:00:59.789> dry<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.449> tracks<00:01:00.750> getting<00:01:01.050> it's

got more of the bank's to come off the
corner<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> green<00:01:11.220> where<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
corner for the green where I have a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.429 
corner for the green where I have a
little<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.000> speed<00:01:12.240> work<00:01:12.450> where<00:01:13.080> he's<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
little more speed work where he's on the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
less part of the bank and it's hard for

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.130 
less part of the bank and it's hard for
him<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> pick<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> gas<00:01:15.240> back<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.840> keep<00:01:15.990> up

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
with me coming off a corner so I'd say

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
with me coming off a corner so I'd say
I'm<00:01:18.180> definitely<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> Vantage<00:01:19.140> by<00:01:19.680> being
