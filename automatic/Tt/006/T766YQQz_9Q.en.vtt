00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 slacks to all and welcome to me 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.140
 channel here 2 the gamer in minecraft mother 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.240
 mine 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.830
 to see what happens hey but first of all 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.830
 I want to send you a greeting because it's the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.440
 rustock's birthday today 24th 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.750
 October so congratulations pass it 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.400
 very well great and as I always say 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.740
 commit a piece of cake for me because 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.710
 I love them, you have to put in more English 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.660
 well a map of this ability 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.930
 skill that for me is fatal 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.180
 As you all know very well, so 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.719
 we wish luck we go well well 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.539
 at the moment it is not going very badly but 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.010
 to the edge but you know that I am very 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.570
 bad for this kind of 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.429
 what I'm going to do so that it does not 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.350
 very extensive again that I fall then 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.329
 I'm going to remove it better, this part of the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.659
 video said 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.990
 in general, let's continue what 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.660
 we can stop 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.160
 my mother I'm not going to stop it because 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.320
 want but because he is reading me everything 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.420
 the time and this is for sure 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.420
 the supposedly loved one will spend 15 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.450
 minutes but when I play I think that I 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.450
 15 minutes is 15 hours and that's right here 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.020
 nothing 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.030
 so the one that you are very manca I know that 's it 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.500
 who he has never said the opposite, and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 we're around here I had to restart the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.890
 computer so that it could work 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.710
 well in the game I was doing very badly and it was 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.950
 thing that has many open 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.149
 processes of these inactive and good 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.190
 managed to get a little bit further 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.260
 same as you go duty 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.250
 to see if later to reach that but 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.729
 it seems a little more complicated 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.400
 I think we go my heart is fine now 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.870
 I have to fall in the pool I guess 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:56.420
 because I do not see anything here so come 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:02:01.000
 the host is going well we have to go here 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.000
 to illuminate things 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.950
 but come on, the most complicated thing was 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.950
 fall like that 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:17.520
 so let's continue let's go we're already seeing 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.520
 again the other stage of the map u and I 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.410
 I fall and I'm hard to stay and now what 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.350
 happens just download the graphics to the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.210
 games that is already saying things I put them 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.330
 so that it was not detailed but a 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.569
 fast plan and now it is going well 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.409
 that we are going to continue with him 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.409
 all right 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.100
 and they are not staying so much, it's not worth 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.530
 now it takes 550 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.599
 by name 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.819
 I do not think wow oh how nice you do not fall 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.690
 Now damn I have done it really is 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.540
 what has been 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.540
 assume concentration well and this was 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.670
 something is not happening but good 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.520
 I think everyone is ok 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.870
 if we have not advanced and we do not understand 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.870
 well the goal of this one 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.870
 even though 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.610
