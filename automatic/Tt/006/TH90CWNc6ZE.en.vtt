00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
places where he can go so I may have to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.990 
places where he can go so I may have to
move<00:00:24.539> Lina<00:00:24.900> or<00:00:25.230> Talia<00:00:25.619> into<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> bouncer<00:00:26.580> with

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
move Lina or Talia into the bouncer with

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500 
move Lina or Talia into the bouncer with
Emily<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.689> would<00:00:28.109> prefer<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.490> Charlotte<00:00:30.119> in

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
Emily I would prefer it be Charlotte in

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.330 
Emily I would prefer it be Charlotte in
there<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:30.929> her<00:00:31.250> but<00:00:33.590> she's<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.980> little

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
there with her but she's in that little

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.290 
there with her but she's in that little
crib<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.380> don't<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.399> what<00:00:38.610> I'm<00:00:38.700> gonna<00:00:38.790> do

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
crib so I don't know what I'm gonna do

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.200 
crib so I don't know what I'm gonna do
he<00:00:39.480> had<00:00:39.980> figured<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
he had figured that out because I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150 
he had figured that out because I
probably<00:00:42.480> lay<00:00:42.870> him<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> I'll

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
probably lay him in the one and I'll

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.670 
probably lay him in the one and I'll
probably<00:00:44.370> lay<00:00:44.610> him<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.680> because

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
probably lay him in this one because

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
probably lay him in this one because
it's<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.430> neutral<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.390> don't<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it's more neutral and I don't have a

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510 
it's more neutral and I don't have a
blanket<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.200> him<00:00:49.260> yet<00:00:49.500> though<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.280> can't

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
blanket for him yet though so I can't

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.650

it's<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.030> cover<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.329> beneath<00:00:51.510> the
