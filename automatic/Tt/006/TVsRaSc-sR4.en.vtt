00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.040
 good to all my name is Luis from 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.779
 production channel or flow extreme and 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.110
 we're still here with the alphabet of 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.910
 graffiti wanted to tell you that today we are going 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.040
 to have two videos worth they are not going to be 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.830
 followed will be one now and another one 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.810
 here about three or four hours 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.840
 I also wanted to tell you that I'm going to 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.100
 do this to see if we finish this 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.230
 section before the end of the month 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.779
 so then I'm going to start climbing 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.880
 more followed videos like I upload two some 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.330
 day 3 another day and so to try 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.489
 finish it 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 it's a bit bitch to upload so many videos 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.000
 followed because you miss visits a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.350
 video cancels the other but good anyway 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.720
 we're going to do it for the visit, we're going 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.940
 to do so that each one of you 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.280
 have your lyrics and do the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.200
 lyrics that you like the most then 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.870
 saying this I also say that 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.560
 I'm going to do this because I have a couple of 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.020
 thought sections and one of them 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.950
 that I already mentioned the other day is that of 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.320
 do live graffiti it's worth explaining 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.110
 the materials different ways to use 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.740
 the spray distances the wall from 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 strokes nozzles and everything you have to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.520
 see with that subject then that section the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.540
 I want to start as soon as possible and 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 I want to end this 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.650
 we continue as you are seeing today I am 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.440
 making shadows and 3d is worth those 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.320
 They do not know where I'm going, I recommended them 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.300
 in the first videos that saw books 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.850
 about lights and shadows and about 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.340
 prospects is worth keeping it on 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.600
 that does not know where a 3d is going or 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.370
 Where is a shadow going? 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.370
 tutorials you can search for information in 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.770
 google of where you should put a 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.130
 shadow vanishing points for the 3d is and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.240
 other is important because that is a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.520
 thing that you have to learn by 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.160
 yourselves because you do not learn like that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.080
 because I say it here that you have to 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.080
 practice it and learn it 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.300
 we continue to see now I'm doing the 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.100
 lime I'm doing a 3d in and 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.440
 a bit arbitrary many times I do the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.390
 3d worth what it used arbitrary 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.479
 You have to do when you make a 3d 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.400
 shadow in arbitrary plan is to do it 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.980
 like you're doing it to post if not 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.960
 it loses like a little grace and it shows 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.520
 a lot like a failure you do not have to 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.190
 try not to be a fault something that you 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.160
 you want to make it worth something is done 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.070
 bet then do not lose grace without 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.900
 if it not is seen as a failure worth the 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.060
 failures often made bet no 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.490
 They seem flawed and they look better 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.230
 we continue after this advice then 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.920
 nothing is already running video and 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.830
 I wanted to tell you to continue and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.480
 subscribing if you like videos 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.000
 sharing the videos and giving him little hand 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.500
 up is worth and nothing thank you very much to 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.780
 everyone to see the video and from here a 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.780
 I'll be back with the l 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.330
