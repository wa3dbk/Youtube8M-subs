so<00:01:03.170> thing<00:01:03.410> is<00:01:03.500> we<00:01:03.650> have<00:01:03.739> to<00:01:03.860> build<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.280> car<00:01:04.580> as

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
so thing is we have to build the car as

the<00:01:14.810> car<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.050> a<00:01:15.229> different<00:01:15.590> level<00:01:15.790> we<00:01:16.790> probably

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
the car to a different level we probably

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.240 
the car to a different level we probably
had<00:01:17.450> at<00:01:17.540> that<00:01:17.570> time<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:18.200> best<00:01:18.380> engineers<00:01:18.979> and

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
had at that time the best engineers and

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.370 
had at that time the best engineers and
technical<00:01:19.700> people<00:01:20.180> in<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.810> country<00:01:21.200> working

technical people in the country working
for<00:01:21.770> us<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.399> a<00:01:22.430> lot<00:01:22.729> of<00:01:22.759> people<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.450> develop

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
for us so a lot of people to develop

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.630 
for us so a lot of people to develop
that<00:01:23.960> car<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:24.470> lot<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.800> things<00:01:25.009> we<00:01:25.160> made<00:01:25.430> on<00:01:25.610> that

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
that car a lot of things we made on that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.160 
that car a lot of things we made on that
car<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.600> made<00:01:26.840> in-house<00:01:28.479> we<00:01:29.479> had<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.600> switch<00:01:29.960> on

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
car we made in-house we had a switch on

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.340 
car we made in-house we had a switch on
the<00:01:30.229> console<00:01:30.830> where<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.759> was<00:01:31.910> mode<00:01:32.149> 1<00:01:32.450> 2<00:01:32.780> 3<00:01:32.810> and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
the console where it was mode 1 2 3 and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.300 
the console where it was mode 1 2 3 and
4<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.979> mode<00:01:34.759> one<00:01:35.090> was<00:01:35.360> rear-wheel<00:01:35.750> drive<00:01:35.930> only

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
4 and mode one was rear-wheel drive only

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.770 
4 and mode one was rear-wheel drive only
so<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.490> start<00:01:37.789> of<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.970> race<00:01:38.149> would<00:01:38.450> start

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
so the start of the race would start

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.450 
so the start of the race would start
with<00:01:38.840> rear-wheel<00:01:39.170> drive<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.890> I'd<00:01:40.039> say<00:01:40.250> on<00:01:40.310> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
with rear-wheel drive and I'd say on the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.820 
with rear-wheel drive and I'd say on the
radio<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.970> drivers<00:01:41.390> mode<00:01:41.660> too<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.619> that's<00:01:42.740> a

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
radio the drivers mode too and that's a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.430 
radio the drivers mode too and that's a
bit<00:01:42.979> of<00:01:43.069> all<00:01:43.250> God<00:01:43.610> then<00:01:44.179> you<00:01:44.330> go<00:01:44.479> mode<00:01:44.780> 3<00:01:45.080> and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
bit of all God then you go mode 3 and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.320 
bit of all God then you go mode 3 and
then<00:01:45.530> you've<00:01:45.679> got<00:01:45.800> some<00:01:45.950> forward<00:01:46.520> right<00:01:46.700> never

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
then you've got some forward right never

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.719 
then you've got some forward right never
sweat<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:47.899> going<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.200> mode<00:01:48.410> for<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:49.039> full<00:01:49.459> four

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
hour in around 25 metres do you place at

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.650 
hour in around 25 metres do you place at
25<00:04:21.769> meters<00:04:22.010> you've<00:04:22.700> done<00:04:22.850> 100<00:04:23.270> kilometers<00:04:23.570> an

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
25 meters you've done 100 kilometers an

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.010 
25 meters you've done 100 kilometers an
hour<00:04:23.750> that<00:04:24.610> just<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:26.060> amazing

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.589 

so<00:04:29.770> point<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.340> point<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.699> GDR<00:04:31.090> was<00:04:31.240> really

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
so point to point the GDR was really

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.119 
so point to point the GDR was really
quick<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.319> some<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.710> reasons<00:04:32.860> behind

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
quick and some of the reasons behind

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:34.920 
quick and some of the reasons behind
that<00:04:33.490> is<00:04:33.669> or<00:04:33.879> that<00:04:33.910> all<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.389> technology

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
that is or that all the technology

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.649 
that is or that all the technology
that's<00:04:35.020> in<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.229> car<00:04:35.440> we<00:04:36.340> have<00:04:36.550> fantastic<00:04:37.090> VDC

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
that's in the car we have fantastic VDC

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.300 
that's in the car we have fantastic VDC
system<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.229> fantastic<00:04:38.800> all-wheel<00:04:39.099> drive

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
system the fantastic all-wheel drive

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.399 
system the fantastic all-wheel drive
system<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.240> fact<00:04:40.539> that<00:04:40.629> it<00:04:40.780> puts<00:04:40.960> every

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
system and the fact that it puts every

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.409 
system and the fact that it puts every
single<00:04:41.860> kilobyte<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.460> every<00:04:42.819> single<00:04:43.180> Newton

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
single kilobyte and every single Newton

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.990 
single kilobyte and every single Newton
meter<00:04:43.569> to<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.780> ground<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.860> car<00:04:45.099> is<00:04:45.280> so

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
meter to the ground the car is so

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.580 
meter to the ground the car is so
clinically<00:04:46.419> quick<00:04:46.720> no<00:04:46.900> matter<00:04:47.050> where<00:04:47.259> you<00:04:47.289> are

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
clinically quick no matter where you are

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.680 
clinically quick no matter where you are
it<00:04:48.039> really<00:04:48.340> does<00:04:48.550> change<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:49.090> perception<00:04:49.569> on

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
it really does change the perception on

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.249 
it really does change the perception on
what<00:04:49.810> speed<00:04:50.139> really<00:04:50.319> is<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:51.990> think<00:04:52.990> that's<00:04:53.169> the

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
what speed really is I think that's the

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.589 
what speed really is I think that's the
key<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.740> our<00:04:53.770> 35<00:04:54.310> Judy<00:04:54.669> are<00:04:54.819> to<00:04:55.180> feel<00:04:55.419> that

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
key to our 35 Judy are to feel that

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.510 
key to our 35 Judy are to feel that
crushing<00:04:56.110> acceleration<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.009> car<00:04:57.250> when

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
crushing acceleration in the car when

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.490 
crushing acceleration in the car when
the<00:04:57.639> car<00:04:57.849> grips<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.930> noise<00:04:59.199> that<00:04:59.229> it

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
the car grips and the noise that it

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.649 
the car grips and the noise that it
makes<00:04:59.530> and<00:05:00.009> it<00:05:00.550> puts<00:05:00.789> you<00:05:00.909> back<00:05:01.060> in<00:05:01.120> that<00:05:01.300> seat

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
makes and it puts you back in that seat

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.360 
makes and it puts you back in that seat
is<00:05:01.900> something<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:02.889> will<00:05:03.069> never<00:05:03.220> ever

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
is something that I will never ever

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.849 
is something that I will never ever
forget
