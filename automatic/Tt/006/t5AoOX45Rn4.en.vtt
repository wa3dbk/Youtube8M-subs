00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
this flight because that's where it left

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.460 
this flight because that's where it left
off<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.820> episode<00:01:42.770> 254<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.689> i<00:01:45.689> want<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> say

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
off with episode 254 and i want to say

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.980 
off with episode 254 and i want to say
that<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.460> episode<00:01:48.060> next<00:01:48.720> episode

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
that I think this episode next episode

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.120 
that I think this episode next episode
is<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:50.689> mainly<00:01:51.689> between<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.950> two

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
is going to be mainly between the two

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.359 
is going to be mainly between the two
chikage<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.110> Bay<00:01:55.110> Dora<00:01:55.670> because<00:01:56.670> i<00:01:57.030> think<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
chikage and Bay Dora because i think the

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.039 
chikage and Bay Dora because i think the
episode<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.520> named<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> artist<00:02:00.509> returns

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
episode is named that the artist returns

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.639 
episode is named that the artist returns
so<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:02.250> put<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.549> emphasis<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.619> which<00:02:04.619> is

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
so they put on emphasis on that which is

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.310 
so they put on emphasis on that which is
you<00:02:05.430> know<00:02:05.460> why<00:02:05.759> i<00:02:05.790> believe<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:07.140> main

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you know why i believe that the main

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.770 
you know why i believe that the main
fight<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.310> between<00:02:08.610> non<00:02:09.000> chikage

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
Sundays but apparently that was just a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.650 
Sundays but apparently that was just a
