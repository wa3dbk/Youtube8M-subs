00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.430 
to apply this as a contour color on my
face<00:04:43.330> so<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.450> last<00:04:44.660> step<00:04:44.840> in<00:04:45.140> this<00:04:45.230> tutorial

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
face so the last step in this tutorial

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.670 
face so the last step in this tutorial
is<00:04:45.920> probably<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:47.060> hardest<00:04:47.090> step<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:48.020> do<00:04:48.140> the

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
is probably the hardest step to do the

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.070 
is probably the hardest step to do the
eyes<00:04:48.830> were<00:04:49.130> pretty<00:04:49.580> simple<00:04:50.090> pretty<00:04:50.300> easy<00:04:50.630> and

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
eyes were pretty simple pretty easy and

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.930 
eyes were pretty simple pretty easy and
you<00:04:51.650> really<00:04:51.920> didn't<00:04:52.190> have<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.400> have<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.640> lot<00:04:52.910> of

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
you really didn't have to have a lot of

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.020 
you really didn't have to have a lot of
skill<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.510> do<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:53.780> but<00:04:54.470> for<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.280> lips<00:04:55.490> they<00:04:55.880> had

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
skill to do it but for the lips they had

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.810 
skill to do it but for the lips they had
very<00:04:56.390> precise<00:04:57.170> and<00:04:57.470> distinct<00:04:58.100> shaped<00:04:58.490> lips

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
very precise and distinct shaped lips

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.060 
very precise and distinct shaped lips
and<00:04:59.150> it's<00:05:00.050> kind<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:00.560> going<00:05:00.680> to<00:05:00.770> be<00:05:00.860> difficult

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
and it's kind of going to be difficult

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.400 
and it's kind of going to be difficult
for<00:05:01.370> me<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.880> achieve<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:02.480> especially

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
for me to achieve that especially

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.750 
for me to achieve that especially
because<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:03.710> don't<00:05:03.980> have<00:05:04.040> a<00:05:04.160> lip<00:05:04.400> liner<00:05:04.610> that

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
because I don't have a lip liner that

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.720 
because I don't have a lip liner that
matches<00:05:05.360> my<00:05:05.390> lipstick<00:05:06.050> so<00:05:06.650> let's<00:05:07.250> just<00:05:07.520> hope

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
matches my lipstick so let's just hope

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.640 
matches my lipstick so let's just hope
everything<00:05:08.390> goes<00:05:08.570> okay<00:05:08.930> I'm<00:05:09.140> going<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.470> start

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
everything goes okay I'm going to start

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.770 
everything goes okay I'm going to start
off<00:05:09.770> by<00:05:09.830> applying<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.520> concealer<00:05:11.150> on<00:05:11.270> my<00:05:11.480> lips

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
off by applying a concealer on my lips

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.220 
off by applying a concealer on my lips
and<00:05:11.990> around<00:05:12.410> my<00:05:12.650> lips<00:05:13.750> this<00:05:14.750> is<00:05:14.990> probably

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
and around my lips this is probably

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.960 
and around my lips this is probably
extremely<00:05:15.800> creepy<00:05:16.130> because<00:05:16.430> now<00:05:16.670> I<00:05:16.700> look<00:05:16.940> like

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
extremely creepy because now I look like

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.890 
extremely creepy because now I look like
a<00:05:17.120> dead<00:05:17.630> flapper<00:05:18.050> which<00:05:18.530> is<00:05:18.860> kind<00:05:19.430> of<00:05:19.640> weird<00:05:20.090> so

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
a dead flapper which is kind of weird so

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.440 
a dead flapper which is kind of weird so
let's<00:05:21.710> go<00:05:21.890> ahead<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:22.160> apply<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.790> lip<00:05:23.180> liner

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
let's go ahead and apply the lip liner

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.630 
let's go ahead and apply the lip liner
as<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:23.990> said<00:05:24.050> before<00:05:24.260> I<00:05:24.650> don't<00:05:25.160> have<00:05:25.340> a<00:05:25.370> lip

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
as I said before I don't have a lip

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.610 
as I said before I don't have a lip
liner<00:05:25.820> that<00:05:25.970> matches<00:05:26.480> my<00:05:26.510> lipstick<00:05:27.140> so<00:05:27.410> I'm

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
liner that matches my lipstick so I'm

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.350 
liner that matches my lipstick so I'm
just<00:05:27.800> going<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:27.980> go<00:05:28.130> ahead<00:05:28.220> and<00:05:28.340> use<00:05:28.640> a<00:05:28.820> red<00:05:29.150> lip

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
just going to go ahead and use a red lip

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.240 
just going to go ahead and use a red lip
liner<00:05:29.630> and<00:05:29.960> really<00:05:30.560> just<00:05:30.770> hope<00:05:30.919> for<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.160> best

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
liner and really just hope for the best

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.690 
liner and really just hope for the best
so<00:05:31.850> what<00:05:32.000> I'm<00:05:32.120> doing<00:05:32.150> is<00:05:32.570> basically<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:33.350> am<00:05:34.040> over

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
so what I'm doing is basically I am over

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.000 
so what I'm doing is basically I am over
arching<00:05:35.090> my<00:05:35.630> Cupid's<00:05:36.110> bow<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.680> then<00:05:36.860> I'm

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
arching my Cupid's bow and then I'm

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.430 
arching my Cupid's bow and then I'm
making<00:05:37.430> my<00:05:37.520> lips<00:05:37.850> a<00:05:38.060> little<00:05:38.300> bit<00:05:38.540> smaller<00:05:38.960> than

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
making my lips a little bit smaller than

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.100 
making my lips a little bit smaller than
they<00:05:39.860> are<00:05:40.040> and<00:05:40.340> sort<00:05:40.610> of<00:05:40.700> kind<00:05:40.970> of<00:05:41.060> dull<00:05:41.720> like

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
they are and sort of kind of dull like

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.540 
they are and sort of kind of dull like
I'm<00:05:42.410> just<00:05:42.710> going<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:42.890> go<00:05:42.950> ahead<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:43.370> draw<00:05:43.520> it

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
I'm just going to go ahead and draw it

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.190 
I'm just going to go ahead and draw it
out<00:05:43.760> because<00:05:44.000> it's<00:05:44.300> really<00:05:44.630> difficult<00:05:44.810> to

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
out because it's really difficult to

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:54.309 
out because it's really difficult to
talk<00:05:45.410> and<00:05:45.680> line<00:05:46.010> my<00:05:46.280> lips<00:05:46.700> at<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.030> same<00:05:47.210> time

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.620 

the<00:05:55.319> next<00:05:55.740> step<00:05:55.949> is<00:05:56.009> to<00:05:56.220> use<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.819> black<00:05:57.270> cherry

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
the next step is to use a black cherry

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.080 
the next step is to use a black cherry
well<00:05:57.930> to<00:05:58.229> use<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:58.770> black<00:05:59.069> cherry<00:05:59.400> lipstick<00:05:59.849> by

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
well to use the black cherry lipstick by

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.400 
well to use the black cherry lipstick by
Revlon<00:06:00.690> but<00:06:01.229> you<00:06:01.319> can<00:06:01.500> use<00:06:01.770> any<00:06:02.009> kind<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:03.410> berry

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
Revlon but you can use any kind of berry

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.800 
Revlon but you can use any kind of berry
color<00:06:04.770> that<00:06:05.130> you<00:06:05.160> have<00:06:05.520> that<00:06:05.789> is<00:06:05.940> similar<00:06:06.270> but

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
color that you have that is similar but

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.689 
color that you have that is similar but
I'm<00:06:07.110> going<00:06:07.410> to<00:06:07.500> be<00:06:07.620> using<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:08.099> black<00:06:08.370> cherry
