00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 are all guys to welcome back all 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:09.900
 wrong here is nicola barbieri to tender 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.639
 with the ready who and where it comes from 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.379
 we do it so mechanically 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 every day every hour some every minute 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.020
 of one's life maybe even 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.320
 that we don't realize from 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.210
 because we say ready made a tour of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.689
 terrible words to get here yes 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.120
 is wrapping the tongue pike flight 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 anyway because he says he is ready before 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.239
 get to the Italian ready we leave 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.460
 from the beginning 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.730
 because the patent this cabbage of 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.450
 graham bell phone in 1876 indeed 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.670
 patented the phone he says or 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.989
 at least it was reported is reported on 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.730
 history books that answer then 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.070
 at the start of the receiver, say a 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.039
 we then have then a term used 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.860
 in the naval context when they had to 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.280
 climb the migrants on board the ship then 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.549
 go up or what so and think from there 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.850
 that both everything is withdrawn and 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.900
 america say it and bonfire depending on it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.890
 of cases 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.020
 it is precisely from this that he later has in the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 1877 was just thomas edison to put 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.619
 a point to this situation indeed 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.890
 he sent a letter to the president 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.270
 the then telegraph company and 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.310
 he said he thought the best way 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.640
 to answer the phone was to say that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 it is from there later 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.860
 an important title is born for the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.259
 switchboard operators because it is not the case before 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.390
 he called and one answered how to do it 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.460
 today it was not called to the switchboard and the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.920
 switchboard put you in touch with 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.990
 another person and therefore these girls 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.340
 who answered on the phone and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.490
 they put you in touch with another 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.710
 person called themselves kellogg's ok 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.180
 this is what concerns history 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.670
 American 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.610
 but what year 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.220
 then because we say ready in Italy and I 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.340
 in fact most of the others 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.050
 They were to say and also in Germany 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.239
 the yellow or in Spain say yes 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.069
 says big cars gas dam the skies 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.819
 anyway because he says he is ready in Italy 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.760
 it is thought that in 1960 70 in other words 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.060
 years in which we also reached all 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.130
 use of the phone a little for everyone 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.470
 it was the switchboard operators and the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.080
 receptionists to coin the term 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.970
 ready because from the moment you 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.760
 put in contact with each other 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.799
 person said ready and put you 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.540
 in contact therefore from here the way of 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.420
 say has evolved and everyone 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.880
 they began to say when the phone 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.380
 became a thing for everyone and 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.610
 finally there is no longer any need for man 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.650
 good half 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.549
 from that moment everyone used 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.310
 ready to answer you what the fuck 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.670
 around to say why yes 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.350
 use ready you will understand something 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.350
