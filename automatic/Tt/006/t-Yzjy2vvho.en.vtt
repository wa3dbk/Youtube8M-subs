00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
for growing orchids in small spaces now

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
I have quite a small space it doesn't

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.700 
I have quite a small space it doesn't
look<00:00:20.880> like<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.060> but<00:00:21.240> it's<00:00:21.480> quite<00:00:21.779> narrow<00:00:22.140> so

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
look like that but it's quite narrow so

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.849 
look like that but it's quite narrow so
I<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> few<00:00:24.180> tricks<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.019> apply<00:00:25.619> with

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
I do have a few tricks that I apply with

I do have a few tricks that I apply with
my<00:00:25.890> orchids<00:00:26.519> now<00:00:27.000> let's<00:00:27.240> start<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:27.539> your

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
my orchids now let's start with your

my orchids now let's start with your
kids<00:00:28.109> themselves<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.830> course<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.400> safe<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
kids themselves of course it's safe to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.820 
kids themselves of course it's safe to
assume<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.029> smaller<00:00:30.449> orchids<00:00:30.990> take<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
assume that smaller orchids take up a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250 
assume that smaller orchids take up a
lot<00:00:32.130> less<00:00:32.430> space<00:00:32.489> than<00:00:33.059> bigger<00:00:33.360> orchids<00:00:33.960> now

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
to keep this fence stuck to the wall and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.500 
to keep this fence stuck to the wall and
since<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.220> orchids<00:02:22.520> are<00:02:22.640> really<00:02:23.030> not<00:02:23.240> very

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
since the orchids are really not very

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.440 
since the orchids are really not very
heavy<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:23.960> don't<00:02:24.320> need<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.770> support<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:26.000> very

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
heavy you don't need to support it very

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.480 
heavy you don't need to support it very
very<00:02:26.780> heavily<00:02:27.170> but<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.590> does<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.950> job<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:28.370> my

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
very heavily but it does the job in my

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.490 
very heavily but it does the job in my
environment<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.450> an<00:02:29.570> idea<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.290> can

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
environment so this is an idea you can

stuff like that but you will need to
water<00:03:06.710> them<00:03:07.040> more<00:03:07.700> frequent<00:03:08.240> now<00:03:08.510> if<00:03:08.690> you

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.860 
orchids really and of course the fact
that<00:03:27.830> they<00:03:28.100> can<00:03:28.370> drip<00:03:28.850> on<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.090> floor<00:03:29.510> so<00:03:29.810> you

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
that they can drip on the floor so you

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.630 
that they can drip on the floor so you
need<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.470> place<00:03:30.680> something<00:03:30.890> on<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.220> floor<00:03:31.430> so

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
need to place something on the floor so

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.120 
need to place something on the floor so
you<00:03:31.670> don't<00:03:31.910> spoil<00:03:32.180> your<00:03:32.300> carpets<00:03:32.900> or<00:03:33.110> floor<00:03:33.860> or

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
you don't spoil your carpets or floor or

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.330 
you don't spoil your carpets or floor or
whatever<00:03:34.490> you<00:03:34.700> have<00:03:34.880> but<00:03:35.510> other<00:03:35.780> than<00:03:36.110> that

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
whatever you have but other than that

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.400 
whatever you have but other than that
mounted<00:03:37.340> small<00:03:37.760> orchids<00:03:38.300> are<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.540> dream<00:03:39.140> and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
mounted small orchids are a dream and

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.230 
mounted small orchids are a dream and
there<00:03:39.770> really<00:03:39.980> are<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.400> lot<00:03:40.640> of<00:03:40.670> varieties<00:03:40.850> that

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
there really are a lot of varieties that

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.030 
there really are a lot of varieties that
are<00:03:41.420> quite<00:03:41.780> small<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.260> bloom<00:03:42.530> quite<00:03:42.770> nicely

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
are quite small and bloom quite nicely

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.830 
are quite small and bloom quite nicely
some<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.520> them<00:03:43.670> are<00:03:43.760> really<00:03:43.970> fragrant<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.690> any

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
some of them are really fragrant in any

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.470 
some of them are really fragrant in any
case<00:03:45.080> for<00:03:45.110> small<00:03:45.440> spaces<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:46.220> would<00:03:47.150> go<00:03:47.300> for

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
case for small spaces I would go for

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.510 
case for small spaces I would go for
something<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:47.990> this<00:03:48.200> or<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.500> wooden<00:03:49.310> fence

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
something like this or a wooden fence

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.699 
something like this or a wooden fence
like<00:03:49.820> I<00:03:49.940> showed<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.300> previously<00:03:50.450> now<00:03:51.290> second

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
like I showed you previously now second

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.380 
like I showed you previously now second
of<00:03:51.800> all<00:03:51.920> if<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.220> have<00:03:52.370> bigger<00:03:52.670> orchids<00:03:53.180> that

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
of all if you have bigger orchids that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.960 
of all if you have bigger orchids that
sit<00:03:53.750> in<00:03:53.870> pots<00:03:54.200> they're<00:03:54.500> not<00:03:54.709> mounted<00:03:55.220> don't

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
sit in pots they're not mounted don't

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.150 
sit in pots they're not mounted don't
only<00:03:56.270> think<00:03:56.630> on<00:03:56.780> a<00:03:57.170> horizontal<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.130> can

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
only think on a horizontal you can

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.020 
only think on a horizontal you can
actually<00:03:58.459> develop<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.300> collection<00:03:59.750> on<00:03:59.900> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
actually develop a collection on the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.520 
actually develop a collection on the
vertical<00:04:02.030> as<00:04:02.300> well<00:04:02.510> as<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:02.930> can<00:04:03.110> see<00:04:03.320> here

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
vertical as well as you can see here

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.410 
vertical as well as you can see here
maybe<00:04:03.709> this<00:04:03.950> is<00:04:03.980> not<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.370> best<00:04:04.700> example<00:04:05.300> as

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
maybe this is not the best example as

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.280 
maybe this is not the best example as
you<00:04:05.480> can<00:04:05.870> see<00:04:06.050> here<00:04:06.320> my<00:04:06.500> orchids<00:04:06.980> are<00:04:07.130> quite

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
you can see here my orchids are quite

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.410 
you can see here my orchids are quite
optimized<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:09.740> respect<00:04:10.250> I<00:04:10.520> have<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.060> layer

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
optimized in this respect I have a layer

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.310 
optimized in this respect I have a layer
or<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:12.170> row<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.830> orchids<00:04:13.280> on<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:14.480> top<00:04:14.750> the

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
or a row of orchids on the top the

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.400 
or a row of orchids on the top the
highest<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.860> can<00:04:16.100> go<00:04:16.340> actually<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:17.000> then<00:04:17.600> hangs

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
highest I can go actually and then hangs

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.310 
highest I can go actually and then hangs
to<00:04:18.739> them<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:19.130> have<00:04:19.400> another<00:04:19.790> row<00:04:20.090> of<00:04:20.299> orchids<00:04:20.989> if

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
to them I have another row of orchids if

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.780 
to them I have another row of orchids if
you<00:04:21.650> have<00:04:21.830> a<00:04:21.859> wall<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.460> can

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
you have a wall you can

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.790 
you have a wall you can
the<00:04:22.970> Mount<00:04:23.570> orchids<00:04:24.080> are<00:04:24.200> actually<00:04:24.500> arranged

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
the Mount orchids are actually arranged

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.010 
the Mount orchids are actually arranged
orchids<00:04:25.190> this<00:04:25.430> way<00:04:25.610> up<00:04:26.060> until<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.540> floor

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
orchids this way up until the floor

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.470 
orchids this way up until the floor
actually<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:28.190> this<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:28.730> another<00:04:29.000> good<00:04:29.330> way<00:04:29.450> of

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
actually so this is another good way of

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.200 
actually so this is another good way of
saving<00:04:30.020> space<00:04:30.490> developing<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.640> collection

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
saving space developing the collection

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.390 
saving space developing the collection
on<00:04:32.390> a<00:04:32.870> vertical<00:04:33.140> so<00:04:33.620> not<00:04:33.890> only<00:04:34.100> on<00:04:34.370> a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
on a vertical so not only on a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.670 
on a vertical so not only on a
horizontal<00:04:34.850> this<00:04:35.630> might<00:04:35.810> not<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:35.990> possible<00:04:36.260> in

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
horizontal this might not be possible in

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.040 
horizontal this might not be possible in
every<00:04:36.920> home<00:04:37.280> but<00:04:37.820> it<00:04:37.910> is<00:04:38.060> an<00:04:38.180> idea<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.570> keep<00:04:38.900> in

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
every home but it is an idea to keep in

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.810 
every home but it is an idea to keep in
mind<00:04:39.320> but<00:04:39.650> it's<00:04:39.800> not<00:04:39.980> only<00:04:40.190> can<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.580> pin

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
mind but it's not only can you pin

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.970 
mind but it's not only can you pin
bigger<00:04:41.240> pots<00:04:41.570> on<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.930> putts<00:04:42.140> above<00:04:42.500> if<00:04:42.770> you

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
bigger pots on the putts above if you

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.250 
bigger pots on the putts above if you
have<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> few<00:04:43.520> tiny<00:04:43.820> mounted<00:04:44.690> orchids<00:04:45.080> or

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
have a few tiny mounted orchids or

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.770 
have a few tiny mounted orchids or
bigger<00:04:45.500> orchids<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.550> can<00:04:46.790> actually<00:04:47.300> pin<00:04:47.570> them

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
bigger orchids you can actually pin them

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.100 
bigger orchids you can actually pin them
on<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.620> pots<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.580> already<00:04:50.120> have<00:04:50.450> so

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
on the pots you already have so

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.140 
on the pots you already have so
something<00:04:51.470> like<00:04:51.500> this<00:04:51.890> this<00:04:52.340> again<00:04:52.670> is<00:04:52.850> a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
something like this this again is a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.170 
something like this this again is a
space<00:04:53.690> limiting<00:04:54.470> idea<00:04:55.010> but<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.700> have<00:04:55.850> to<00:04:56.030> keep

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
space limiting idea but you have to keep

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.420 
space limiting idea but you have to keep
in<00:04:56.360> mind<00:04:56.390> that<00:04:56.750> water<00:04:57.140> from<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.830> pots<00:04:58.100> may

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
in mind that water from the pots may

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.610 
in mind that water from the pots may
trip<00:04:58.670> to<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.120> orchid<00:04:59.600> below<00:04:59.960> so<00:05:00.200> you<00:05:00.320> need<00:05:00.500> to

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
trip to the orchid below so you need to

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.990 
trip to the orchid below so you need to
be<00:05:00.740> careful<00:05:00.890> that<00:05:01.100> there<00:05:01.460> isn't<00:05:01.580> water

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
be careful that there isn't water

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.480 
be careful that there isn't water
trapped<00:05:02.390> in<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:02.690> leaves<00:05:02.900> also<00:05:03.290> if<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.280> know

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
trapped in the leaves also if you know

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.820 
trapped in the leaves also if you know
an<00:05:04.790> orchid<00:05:05.240> above<00:05:05.480> has<00:05:05.720> an<00:05:05.900> issue<00:05:06.050> better<00:05:06.470> not

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
an orchid above has an issue better not

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.210 
an orchid above has an issue better not
place<00:05:07.250> an<00:05:07.460> orchid<00:05:07.880> so<00:05:08.870> close<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.530> it<00:05:09.830> has

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
place an orchid so close to it it has

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.910 
place an orchid so close to it it has
its<00:05:10.490> risks<00:05:10.940> but<00:05:11.150> it's<00:05:11.480> another<00:05:11.870> idea<00:05:12.320> to<00:05:12.620> try

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
its risks but it's another idea to try

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.280 
its risks but it's another idea to try
to<00:05:12.950> limit<00:05:13.370> or<00:05:13.760> to<00:05:14.060> try<00:05:14.240> to<00:05:14.300> save<00:05:14.600> up<00:05:14.810> some<00:05:14.840> space

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
to limit or to try to save up some space

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.650 
to limit or to try to save up some space
so<00:05:15.560> if<00:05:15.650> you<00:05:15.740> have<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:16.040> few<00:05:16.490> tiny<00:05:16.700> orchids<00:05:17.240> you

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
so if you have a few tiny orchids you

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.660 
so if you have a few tiny orchids you
can<00:05:17.810> actually<00:05:17.960> hang<00:05:18.380> them<00:05:18.590> from<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.160> passi

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
can actually hang them from the passi

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.640 
can actually hang them from the passi
have<00:05:19.850> suspended<00:05:20.300> now<00:05:21.020> if<00:05:21.140> you<00:05:21.260> grow<00:05:21.440> your

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
have suspended now if you grow your

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.710 
have suspended now if you grow your
orchids<00:05:22.100> on<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.340> shelf<00:05:22.850> of<00:05:23.090> course<00:05:23.330> you'll<00:05:23.510> have

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
orchids on a shelf of course you'll have

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.870 
orchids on a shelf of course you'll have
bigger<00:05:24.110> orchids<00:05:24.620> with<00:05:24.770> bigger<00:05:24.980> pots<00:05:25.310> but<00:05:25.640> you

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
bigger orchids with bigger pots but you

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.670 
bigger orchids with bigger pots but you
might<00:05:26.090> have<00:05:26.300> some<00:05:26.540> smaller<00:05:26.840> orchids<00:05:27.320> as<00:05:27.440> well

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
might have some smaller orchids as well

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.010 
might have some smaller orchids as well
like<00:05:28.430> mini<00:05:28.760> Phalaenopsis<00:05:29.570> so<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:29.900> can

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
like mini Phalaenopsis so you can

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.990 
like mini Phalaenopsis so you can
actually<00:05:30.350> place<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.980> smaller<00:05:31.310> pots<00:05:31.700> in

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
actually place the smaller pots in

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.200 
actually place the smaller pots in
between<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:33.890> bigger<00:05:34.100> pots<00:05:34.430> if<00:05:34.670> your<00:05:34.820> shelf

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
between the bigger pots if your shelf

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.540 
between the bigger pots if your shelf
has<00:05:35.510> some<00:05:35.750> space<00:05:36.020> as<00:05:36.260> you<00:05:36.470> can<00:05:36.620> see<00:05:36.860> my<00:05:37.220> shelf

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
has some space as you can see my shelf

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.150 
has some space as you can see my shelf
which<00:05:37.820> is<00:05:37.850> a<00:05:38.000> bit<00:05:38.180> dirty<00:05:38.390> sorry<00:05:38.840> for<00:05:39.080> that<00:05:39.260> my

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
which is a bit dirty sorry for that my

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.480 
which is a bit dirty sorry for that my
shelves<00:05:40.400> cannot<00:05:40.760> keep<00:05:41.330> two<00:05:41.990> pots<00:05:42.380> on<00:05:42.710> the<00:05:43.280> same

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
shelves cannot keep two pots on the same

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.760 
shelves cannot keep two pots on the same
row<00:05:43.760> but<00:05:44.120> I<00:05:44.240> can<00:05:44.540> actually<00:05:44.960> put<00:05:45.260> some<00:05:45.500> smaller

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
row but I can actually put some smaller

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.940 
row but I can actually put some smaller
pots<00:05:46.160> in<00:05:46.460> between<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:47.030> bigger<00:05:47.270> pots<00:05:47.600> and<00:05:47.950> this

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
pots in between the bigger pots and this

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.250 
pots in between the bigger pots and this
will<00:05:49.190> save<00:05:49.370> up<00:05:49.550> quite<00:05:50.090> a<00:05:50.120> lot<00:05:50.420> of<00:05:50.450> space<00:05:50.900> so<00:05:50.930> if

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
will save up quite a lot of space so if

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.920 
will save up quite a lot of space so if
you<00:05:51.350> have<00:05:51.500> a<00:05:51.530> multitude<00:05:51.980> of<00:05:52.310> sizes<00:05:52.940> you<00:05:53.510> can

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
you have a multitude of sizes you can

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.200 
you have a multitude of sizes you can
try<00:05:54.110> to<00:05:54.170> optimize<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:55.040> shelf<00:05:55.340> you<00:05:55.460> have<00:05:55.850> and

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
try to optimize the shelf you have and

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.420 
try to optimize the shelf you have and
really<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:57.050> can<00:05:57.230> go<00:05:57.380> as<00:05:57.530> creative<00:05:57.980> as<00:05:58.130> you'd

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
really you can go as creative as you'd

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.670 
really you can go as creative as you'd
like<00:05:58.460> as<00:05:58.880> you<00:05:59.330> can<00:05:59.480> see<00:05:59.660> I<00:05:59.690> hang<00:06:00.050> an<00:06:00.290> orchid

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
like as you can see I hang an orchid

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.190 
like as you can see I hang an orchid
here<00:06:00.980> by<00:06:01.340> a<00:06:01.760> sort<00:06:02.180> of<00:06:02.270> decorative<00:06:02.660> wooden

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
here by a sort of decorative wooden

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.370 
here by a sort of decorative wooden
thingy<00:06:03.740> so<00:06:04.490> again<00:06:04.970> wherever<00:06:05.300> you<00:06:05.720> can<00:06:05.930> hang<00:06:06.200> an

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
thingy so again wherever you can hang an

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.520 
thingy so again wherever you can hang an
orchid<00:06:06.740> if<00:06:06.920> it's<00:06:07.190> tiny<00:06:07.520> if<00:06:07.850> it's<00:06:08.330> mountable<00:06:09.020> go

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
orchid if it's tiny if it's mountable go

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.170 
orchid if it's tiny if it's mountable go
ahead<00:06:09.770> and<00:06:09.920> mount<00:06:10.130> it<00:06:10.430> if<00:06:10.610> you<00:06:10.700> have<00:06:10.820> the<00:06:10.940> time

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
ahead and mount it if you have the time

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.980 
ahead and mount it if you have the time
to<00:06:11.330> water<00:06:11.570> it

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
to water it

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.110 
to water it
this<00:06:12.170> will<00:06:12.380> really<00:06:12.860> save<00:06:13.070> up<00:06:13.250> a<00:06:13.400> lot<00:06:13.610> of<00:06:13.640> space

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
this will really save up a lot of space

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.730 
this will really save up a lot of space
imagine<00:06:14.690> if<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.930> circuit<00:06:15.260> would<00:06:15.380> have<00:06:15.560> been

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
imagine if the circuit would have been

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.280 
imagine if the circuit would have been
potted<00:06:16.190> in<00:06:16.340> a<00:06:16.790> normal<00:06:17.150> pot<00:06:17.330> it<00:06:17.720> would<00:06:18.020> just

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
potted in a normal pot it would just

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.010 
potted in a normal pot it would just
take<00:06:18.440> up<00:06:18.650> some<00:06:18.890> space<00:06:19.160> on<00:06:19.400> my<00:06:19.670> shelf<00:06:20.030> but<00:06:20.660> since

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
take up some space on my shelf but since

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.200 
take up some space on my shelf but since
it's<00:06:21.200> mounted<00:06:21.770> and<00:06:22.040> this<00:06:22.400> can<00:06:22.580> be<00:06:22.700> any<00:06:22.910> type<00:06:23.180> of

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
it's mounted and this can be any type of

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.240 
it's mounted and this can be any type of
work<00:06:23.510> it<00:06:23.690> I<00:06:23.840> can<00:06:24.260> actually<00:06:24.380> pin<00:06:24.740> it<00:06:24.860> wherever

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
work it I can actually pin it wherever

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.340 
work it I can actually pin it wherever
either<00:06:25.880> on<00:06:26.240> a<00:06:26.270> different<00:06:26.720> pot<00:06:26.990> or<00:06:27.320> a

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
either on a different pot or a

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.030 
either on a different pot or a
declaration<00:06:28.130> or<00:06:28.280> a<00:06:29.000> fence<00:06:29.480> and<00:06:29.840> so<00:06:30.290> on<00:06:30.500> so

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
declaration or a fence and so on so

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.220 
declaration or a fence and so on so
these<00:06:31.250> are<00:06:31.460> my<00:06:31.669> ideas<00:06:32.030> of<00:06:32.060> optimizing<00:06:32.720> space

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
these are my ideas of optimizing space

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.350 
these are my ideas of optimizing space
for<00:06:33.500> growing<00:06:33.710> orchids<00:06:34.400> if<00:06:34.760> you<00:06:34.910> have<00:06:35.030> a<00:06:35.060> small

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
for growing orchids if you have a small

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.519 
for growing orchids if you have a small
space<00:06:35.690> you<00:06:35.720> can<00:06:36.020> actually

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
space you can actually

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:39.369 
space you can actually
be<00:06:36.589> very<00:06:36.919> very<00:06:37.039> creative<00:06:37.609> I<00:06:38.239> might<00:06:38.839> not<00:06:39.049> be<00:06:39.199> the

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:39.379 
be very very creative I might not be the

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:41.289 
be very very creative I might not be the
most<00:06:39.409> creative<00:06:40.399> person<00:06:40.549> when<00:06:40.759> it<00:06:40.879> comes<00:06:40.969> to

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:41.299 
most creative person when it comes to

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:43.299 
most creative person when it comes to
optimizing<00:06:41.659> space<00:06:42.079> but<00:06:42.409> the<00:06:42.919> things<00:06:43.129> that<00:06:43.279> I

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:43.309 
optimizing space but the things that I

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:45.009 
optimizing space but the things that I
told<00:06:43.579> you<00:06:43.759> really<00:06:44.089> helped<00:06:44.359> me<00:06:44.449> and<00:06:44.629> I<00:06:44.719> apply

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:45.019 
told you really helped me and I apply

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:47.289 
told you really helped me and I apply
them<00:06:45.259> and<00:06:45.439> they<00:06:46.009> work<00:06:46.189> pretty<00:06:46.519> good<00:06:46.639> for<00:06:46.819> me<00:06:47.119> so

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:47.299 
them and they work pretty good for me so

00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:49.539 
them and they work pretty good for me so
anyway<00:06:48.139> if<00:06:48.259> you<00:06:48.349> have<00:06:48.499> other<00:06:48.769> ideas<00:06:48.859> just<00:06:49.369> let

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:49.549 
anyway if you have other ideas just let

00:06:49.549 --> 00:06:51.129 
anyway if you have other ideas just let
me<00:06:49.639> know<00:06:49.759> in<00:06:49.939> a<00:06:49.999> comment<00:06:50.299> below<00:06:50.449> so<00:06:50.899> other
