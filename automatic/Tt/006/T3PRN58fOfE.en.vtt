00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:17.180 

I<00:00:12.889> think<00:00:13.889> they<00:00:14.009> demonize<00:00:14.480> immigrants<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:16.260> make

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
I think they demonize immigrants to make

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.029 
I think they demonize immigrants to make
them<00:00:17.580> look<00:00:17.990> fretful<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.170> society<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
them look fretful to society and so a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.910 
them look fretful to society and so a
lot<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.400> people<00:00:20.670> hold<00:00:20.930> prejudices<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.140> racist

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
lot of people hold prejudices and racist

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.340 
lot of people hold prejudices and racist
attitudes<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.789> think<00:00:24.480> immigrants<00:00:25.140> are

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
attitudes but I think immigrants are

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.080 
attitudes but I think immigrants are
just<00:00:25.769> normal<00:00:26.010> people<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.430> us<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:26.910> just

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
just normal people like us they just

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.830 
just normal people like us they just
come<00:00:27.240> from<00:00:27.359> another<00:00:27.570> country

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.519 

exactly<00:00:30.840> I'm<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> second-generation

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
exactly I'm a second-generation

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.090 
exactly I'm a second-generation
immigrants<00:00:32.340> home<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.620> believe

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
immigrants home and so so I believe

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500 
immigrants home and so so I believe
Society<00:00:38.579> didn't<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.910> people<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:39.360> myself

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
Society didn't have people like myself

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.350 
Society didn't have people like myself
up<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:39.989> from<00:00:40.260> my<00:00:40.410> community<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.879> wouldn't<00:00:42.239> be

the best procedure would be to allow
people<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:36.900> here<00:03:37.050> because<00:03:37.320> we<00:03:37.500> live<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.710> a
