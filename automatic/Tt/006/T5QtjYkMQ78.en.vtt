00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.020
 we have to see an onion remember that 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:19.500
 I do not throw it, save it for my soup 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.630
 of vegetables exactly and there I am 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.830
 lowering the rings 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.100
 I like onion articles 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.890
 heart 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.619
 surely they will love it first 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.690
 that's going to be I'm going to separate well separates 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.820
 they divide for themselves is very important 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.499
 that part I 'm not going to do it did not leave them 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.879
 doing you because it does not make you good 

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:41.039
 and do not worry let's start in 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.050
 height and they're going to start I do not even cry 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.030
 I think it's also for liquid truth 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.039
 it's good because look at everybody says that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.170
 it's for anything even because you're 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.729

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.460
