00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.990
 hello to all guys and welcome back in 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.990
 this new video on battlefield 4 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.180
 then we continue the video series 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.970
 focused on the new weapons of the dlc 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.970
 naval strike is precisely we have 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.270
 just unlocked the vs one 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.490
 light machine gun then for whom 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.529
 wanted to unlock the requirements for 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.160
 unlock this weapon then 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:40.510
 you will have to destroy three land vehicles 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.850
 three vehicles with c4 and make three tapes with 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.430
 any lmg so 18 kills 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.780
 perfect let 's try it right away 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.500
 and here it is mom you had me that 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.100
 show but so cumbersome 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100
 let's see how it goes 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:12.340
 come on let's go to the madonna how many there is 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.340
 did the carnage 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.210
 there is no one but go to shit go to fuck 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.299
 but for now it doesn't seem bad 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.030
 honestly I do not prefer this type 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.850
 of weapons and why they are very heavy 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.569
 cumbersome then a little penalize then 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.729
 for charity I have many friends who use them 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:53.209
 we see very good results 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.330
 also on the distance 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.330
 very well 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:09.049
 fuck is here that launches the new ma 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.049
 fuck off 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.390
 then 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.200
 let's see below but what the fuck is there 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:37.960
 our allies who put the fuck out of 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:45.760
 claymore that I hate them another grenade 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:49.140
 grenade but the game of grenades is not 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.140
 what the fuck if even the time of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.140
 resuscitate 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.810
 then guys i was looking at all the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.370
 weapons that can be unlocked by navarre 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.290
 strike and there is one that interests me 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.750
 particularly 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.870
 but not to use it or because of its own 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.580
 strange is not a sort of anti landmine 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.960
 aerial where a grenade receives a 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.170
 mine anti air that I don't know how to fuck 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.060
 it works very strange so me 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.070
 I will try to unblock it and I will do it for you 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.890
 see absolutely 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.200
 But it has their way of requirements 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.210
 difficult especially the second ie 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.920
 let out fuck do 5 jets with with 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.320
 the rpg 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.320
 I see it hard but we'll make it 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:55.719
 then then give and simone all 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:57.389
 balls here around here because of there 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:00.280
 however there is a such a story already 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:08.409
 so let's go from here look if the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:10.209
 people also charity no no no no 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.760
 it matters 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.150
 we are calm and relaxed because so much 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.070
 that game is always like that so it is 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.680
 useless to lose the stirrups indeed then yes 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.320
 plays worse because if you get pissed off 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.490
 however it always ends this way 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.449
 I always get pissed off this game though 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:37.990
 what the fuck most critical point is always 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:44.789
 this is always this here in itself 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.789
 wanted to do the madness but it went wrong 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.030
 but we always pass here we are always 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.030
 here 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.910
 ok ok 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.350
 out 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:15.120
 out you no fuck either 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:23.400
 no we have been arrested by bonanni but who is 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:26.509
 it was thanks to you like you how not to do it 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:33.900
 get pissed off when things happen 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:37.680
 that slut works thanks to this weapon mi 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.039
 it is convincing more and more and it is not 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.039
 bad 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:51.160
 gradually all this year dying 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.160
 here 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.000
 you too die then I played a 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.630
 graphic year 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.700
 no because we recharged food actor 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.140
 recharge this type of weapon 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.140
 we use the gun 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.920
 the fuck is ok 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.920
