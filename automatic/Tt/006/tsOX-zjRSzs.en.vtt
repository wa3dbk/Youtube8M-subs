00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.120
 hello to all these parties today too 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.550
 this time very easy to make and 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.500
 used the ping stand is a technique 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.060
 very simple though some girls 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.460
 they often write me to have some 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.890
 problem with this technique and therefore I have 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.110
 in short, I decided to make a video 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.270
 so maybe it may be that someone will say 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.970
 with an additional of what I added a 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.660
 letterino because I liked the blue with 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.580
 white and this beautiful basic rose 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.020
 anyway, that's all if you like it 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.379
 I leave you to the tutorial and send you a 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.800
 big kiss 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.800
 Hello 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.680
 the first thing to do is extend the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.120
 passed basic on all my nails and 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.890
 I'm using the first growth 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.120
 of the dark because as you see long 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.410
 quite short so I want 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.430
 speed up the time of 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.840
 regrowth 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.270

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.830

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.300

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.300
 single color on all my nails 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.720
