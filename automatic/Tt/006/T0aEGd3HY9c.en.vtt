I'm<00:00:00.510> here<00:00:00.690> with<00:00:00.750> Brian<00:00:00.930> from<00:00:01.350> code<00:00:01.650> 8<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.190> team

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
I'm here with Brian from code 8 the team

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.220 
I'm here with Brian from code 8 the team
from<00:00:02.610> Uganda<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.330> guys<00:00:03.480> have<00:00:03.689> created<00:00:03.840> a

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
from Uganda and you guys have created a

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.110 
from Uganda and you guys have created a
project<00:00:04.500> called<00:00:04.710> mati<00:00:05.100> Babu<00:00:05.520> tell<00:00:06.000> me<00:00:06.089> a

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
project called mati Babu tell me a

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.280 
project called mati Babu tell me a
little<00:00:06.180> bit<00:00:06.330> about<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.690> because<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:07.140> is

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
little bit about this because this is

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.780 
little bit about this because this is
this<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.740> really<00:00:07.919> important<00:00:08.340> project<00:00:08.490> I

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
this is a really important project I

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.940 
this is a really important project I
think<00:00:08.849> yeah<00:00:09.210> much<00:00:09.510> Babu<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.320> diagnose<00:00:10.740> for

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
think yeah much Babu is to diagnose for

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.709 
think yeah much Babu is to diagnose for
malaria<00:00:11.160> without<00:00:11.490> having<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.030> pick<00:00:12.360> your<00:00:12.509> body

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
malaria without having to pick your body

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.570 
malaria without having to pick your body
for<00:00:12.929> any<00:00:13.049> blood<00:00:13.290> sample<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.040> takes<00:00:14.250> around<00:00:14.370> 15

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
for any blood sample it takes around 15

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.269 
for any blood sample it takes around 15
minutes<00:00:14.880> for<00:00:15.269> animal<00:00:15.599> diagnosis<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.379> they

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
minutes for animal diagnosis and they

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.029 
minutes for animal diagnosis and they
pick<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.640> small<00:00:18.090> blood<00:00:18.330> sample<00:00:18.390> which<00:00:19.380> may<00:00:19.619> at

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
pick a small blood sample which may at

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.740 
pick a small blood sample which may at
early<00:00:20.369> stages<00:00:20.699> not<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.150> infected

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
early stages not be infected

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.599 
early stages not be infected
but<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.170> Matty<00:00:22.380> Bob<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.400> die

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
but with Matty Bob we are going to die

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.300 
but with Matty Bob we are going to die
agonized<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.630> blood<00:00:24.990> stream<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.439> 60

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
agonized of a blood stream for 60

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.820 
agonized of a blood stream for 60
seconds<00:00:26.730> which<00:00:27.269> gives<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> more<00:00:28.080> efficiency

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
seconds which gives it more efficiency

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.490 
seconds which gives it more efficiency
in<00:00:28.980> Africa<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:30.210> may<00:00:30.330> find<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.750> hospital<00:00:31.260> has<00:00:31.349> no

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
in Africa you may find a hospital has no

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
in Africa you may find a hospital has no
power<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:31.769> 24<00:00:32.489> hours<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.149> means<00:00:33.480> more

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
power for 24 hours and that means more

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.229 
power for 24 hours and that means more
children<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.620> dying<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.520> child<00:00:36.000> dies

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
children are dying because a child dies

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
children are dying because a child dies
every<00:00:36.450> minute<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.260> malaria<00:00:38.129> malaria<00:00:38.579> is

every minute of malaria malaria is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.020 
every minute of malaria malaria is
around<00:00:39.230> affecting<00:00:40.230> 160<00:00:41.190> countries<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.850> in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
around affecting 160 countries and in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.930 
around affecting 160 countries and in
Africa<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.510> 91%<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.770> moving<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.399> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
Africa it's 91% we are moving out to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.270 
Africa it's 91% we are moving out to
partner<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:45.690> associations<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:47.010> World

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
partner with associations like World

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.340 
partner with associations like World
Health<00:00:47.460> Organization<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.140> plug

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Health Organization so that we can plug

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.260 
Health Organization so that we can plug
into<00:00:49.559> their<00:00:49.739> distribution<00:00:50.100> patent<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.030> then

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
into their distribution patent and then

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510 
into their distribution patent and then
put<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.780> booth<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> village<00:00:52.890> where

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
put up a booth like in a village where

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.049 
put up a booth like in a village where
everybody<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:55.820> accessible<00:00:56.820> can

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
everybody can have this accessible can

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.790 
everybody can have this accessible can
you<00:00:57.180> operate<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.750> minimal<00:00:58.170> training<00:00:58.469> I'm

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you operate it with minimal training I'm

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.900 
you operate it with minimal training I'm
guessing<00:00:59.160> right<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.430> anybody<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.850> use

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
guessing right like anybody can use

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.090 
guessing right like anybody can use
training<00:01:00.300> no<00:01:01.109> training<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
training no training you just have to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.189 
training no training you just have to
tap<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.370> button<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.059> absolutely<00:01:03.930> no

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
tap a button which is absolutely no

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.350 
tap a button which is absolutely no
training<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.100> lead<00:01:05.460> me<00:01:05.580> through<00:01:05.610> how<00:01:06.030> mati

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
training so lead me through how mati

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.950 
training so lead me through how mati
Bobby<00:01:06.750> works<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.799> need<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.510> such<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> small

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
Bobby works all you need is such a small

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
Bobby works all you need is such a small
device<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> still<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.580> prototype

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
device but this is still a prototype

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.580 
device but this is still a prototype
that's<00:01:12.240> why<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.960> adrenal<00:01:13.409> board

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that's why you see the adrenal board

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.499 
that's why you see the adrenal board
around<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.549> why<00:01:14.729> are<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.939> using<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.360> light

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
around it so why are you using a light

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.850 
around it so why are you using a light
sensor<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.020> happens<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> put<00:01:16.680> my<00:01:16.710> finger

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
sensor what happens when I put my finger

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.789 
sensor what happens when I put my finger
in<00:01:17.189> umm<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.060> red<00:01:18.509> blood<00:01:18.750> cell<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.200> biconcave

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
in umm the red blood cell is biconcave

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.710 
in umm the red blood cell is biconcave
and<00:01:20.130> when<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.549> affected<00:01:21.000> by<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> malaria

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and when it's affected by the malaria

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
and when it's affected by the malaria
plasmodia<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.500> affects<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.040> light

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
plasmodia it affects that light

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.030 
plasmodia it affects that light
scattering<00:01:23.670> properties<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.020> put<00:01:25.530> red

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
scattering properties so if I put red

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.580 
scattering properties so if I put red
light<00:01:26.250> through<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.640> finger<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.060> different

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
light through your finger a different

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
light through your finger a different
wavelength<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:29.460> able<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.790> pick<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.240> testes

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
wavelength I'm able to pick in testes

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.830 
wavelength I'm able to pick in testes
and<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.710> over<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.150> you're<00:01:33.299> seeing<00:01:33.509> yeah

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and of that over so you're seeing yeah

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
and of that over so you're seeing yeah
the<00:01:34.020> red<00:01:34.200> blood<00:01:34.380> cell<00:01:34.590> gets<00:01:34.770> deformed<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the red blood cell gets deformed so

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.310 
the red blood cell gets deformed so
light<00:01:35.759> bounces<00:01:36.180> off<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.570> differently<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
light bounces off of it differently and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
light bounces off of it differently and
you<00:01:37.710> guys<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.070> able<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.670> difference

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
you guys are able to see that difference

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
you guys are able to see that difference
in<00:01:39.270> scattering<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.590> only<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> ship

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
in scattering actually not only the ship

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.310 
to tackle this I personally I suffered
from<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> disease<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.299> some<00:01:51.509> good<00:01:51.899> time<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
from the disease for some good time and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.429 
from the disease for some good time and
doing<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.430> moving<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.509> reach<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.930> clinic<00:01:55.290> no

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
doing that moving you reach a clinic no

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.649 
doing that moving you reach a clinic no
no<00:01:55.890> no<00:01:56.100> power<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:56.820> can't<00:01:57.030> diagnose<00:01:57.420> you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
no no power so they can't diagnose you

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.389 
no no power so they can't diagnose you
you<00:01:58.110> move<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> other<00:01:58.530> they<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> prick

you move to the other they have to prick

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.920 
you move to the other they have to prick
every<00:01:59.700> time<00:01:59.909> prick<00:02:00.270> every<00:02:00.509> time<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.840> they

sure<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.210> malaria<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.719> go<00:02:03.869> back<00:02:04.079> home<00:02:04.229> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
sure it's malaria you go back home you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.020 
sure it's malaria you go back home you
come<00:02:04.560> back<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.950> still<00:02:05.130> feeling<00:02:05.340> not<00:02:05.579> good<00:02:05.820> and

come back is still feeling not good and
then<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.540> keep<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.960> being<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> same<00:02:07.500> thing

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
then they keep on being the same thing
