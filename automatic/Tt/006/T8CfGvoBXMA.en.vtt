00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.460
 you can not be you because not because you 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.230
 you're a 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.129
 paragon of virtues greece 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.900
 icon of the tenderness of soon you 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:21.320
 you have shown everything daring bold of life 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:27.410
 as an adventurer but 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:31.130
 despite the constant knows the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.590
 women not only with other men because 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.350
 because I do not want to give him that focus or 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.670
 be I prefer to see it as though it is 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.100
 Market Stall 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.680
 I prefer to see her as a human being 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.750
 is looking for another human being who 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:53.659
 can give the tenderness that you can see 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:55.940
 place that can give you to look like a 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.149
 figure as the character that he carries with 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.399
 the movie is a television actress 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.399
 so I think it's a bit 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.140
 and he has done enough to his unit and in 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.970
 all 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.120
 in finding a person who sees her as 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.120
 a soul then regardless of 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.920
 your tastes and preferences I think it is 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.920
 a human being looking for another being 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.400
 this chapter of this conversation to 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.400
 risk of looking like a horrendous burgos 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:47.119
 and show you how many 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.400
 we must imagine that they have to see the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.620
 movie 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.040
 in the most common common place of all 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.040
 places 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:11.750
 if I have a person who has helped me 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:14.290
 in certain times that when they go to see 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.970
 I want the movie that is and are 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.500
 surviving the avatars that 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.860
 come with the Mexican is a 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:32.870
 bold history the women's catalog 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:36.380
 beautiful that is shown is a movie of 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.160
 art or is not a story deeply 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.310
 human and also that people know 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.440
 these things that we all feel 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.130
 and suddenly we want to assume there 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.970
 very hard parts as is the character of 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.160
 paola núñez where is a character that 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.319
 in order to ascend socially he does not 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.390
 matter to be used 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.390
 I would be what worries me 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:09.969
 if there is one and there is an east there is a 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.530
 question of who exercises control 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.180
 control because the wishes there are always 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.790
 someone who exercises control over the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.480
 the person with whom you wish to 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.090
 that seeks the desire the intimate desire of 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.329
 human being that at the end of the day love 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.480
 love and be loved for that when to me 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.870
 They qualify the character as a lesbian and 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.390
 said with all its letters 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.069
 and I think that's not important 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.260
 because the important thing is to find us 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.950
 as well as beings for music sound 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.860
 Y 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.410
 if there is a game of powers if there is one 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.640
 you can use the I describe the sex or the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:54.290
 sensuality to transcend to 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:57.590
 satisfy you worked for hunting a 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.010
 sort of model to put together the story 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.690
 Of course it is a model for 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.410
 put together or be art history 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.720
 exactly schnitzer is made cinemas 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.480
 all the stories are concatenated 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.060
 it's not like a kind of round by the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.910
 original title is the round where a 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.950
 make desirable choice since 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.070
 from there and as the same woman would say 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.910
 Joan of who I am an art lover and 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.410
 I am part of whom my love mistreats 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.620
 constant I want to see the one who kills me and 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.100
 abuse to which my love seeks constant 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.100
 it seems my wish 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.230
 but I for best match I choose 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.940
 who does not love me 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:56.150
 notice that you just condemned you 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:58.180
 happily again this program can 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.180
 be 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.610
 for now 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.360
 someone with the peeling that for you or 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:23.750
 waste why we should be in 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:26.180
 First place because she is such a good lady 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.350
 and if I ask a gentleman why because 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.240
 we are all the other old ones because it is 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.700
 a good movie to talk about a 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.550
 universal theme but in a very 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.110
 Mexican that is a movie where we go 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.560
 to see us portrayed not as Mexicans and 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.140
 world 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.490
 overwhelmed where we feel violated 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.520
 if we are victims 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.310
 normal that we live daily with 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.810
 individuals that we have the wishes of 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.420
 any society where we do not 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.570
 we present 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.150
 victim two buildings just like 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.000
 human beings with the pleasures wishes and 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.550
 character types a 100% movie 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.630
 Mexican with a thousand percent theme 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.020
 universal 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:14.640
 I love listening to you because you are the 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.640
 personification of those people 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:24.830
 because in addition the movies with which 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.540
 we the big productions are 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.130
 very complacent the exhibitors that 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.260
 you can say there are many interests 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.480
 created and you also have to say it like that and 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.360
 if later they give you because it doubles the 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.760
 movies in this case the portals of 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.580
