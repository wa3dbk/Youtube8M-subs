00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.630
 today in Bremerhaven because mine 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.450
 Ship 1 has returned 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.940
 at the beginning of 2009 the former became here 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.400
 celebrity galaxy rebuilt to my ship 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.769
 and after a good five years, that's it 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.330
 first probably fish from tui cruises again 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.279
 arrived at the lloyd yard 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.619
 in which areas my ship 1 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.670
 rebuilt or renewed will find that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.670
 I out for you today 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.840
 We are now closer to the dock below 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.330
 Said we are exactly under the tail 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.640
 and for me rolf nowak is captain of the 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.440
 my ship 1 Mr. Noack what will one 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.000
 captain actually in the yard if that 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.590
 Ship does not even drive a good one 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.460
 question 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.949
 Of course we do not have the normal one 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.559
 Operation in the yard will be in front of everyone 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.360
 Things made maintenance work 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.880
 About inspection work repair work 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.400
 which is not possible in normal operation 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.100
 So the ship you see it is 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.369
 dry we come to the rotors 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.830
 to the propellers to the stabilizers 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.820
 at all valves see boxes 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.479
 to examine this and find out 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.479
 to repair 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.259
 and what else is creating innovations 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.630
 the largest in the technical area 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.240
 renewal time we are us 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.190
 Equip new air conditioning systems around the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.619
 meet the latest environmental standards 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.850
 and above all, the environment 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.159
 less burden 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.380

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.380

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.990
 for our guests and I have gone back 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.750
 already talked to the captain about 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.070
 the work in the technical area was 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.890

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.550
 laid carpet 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.170

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.040
 woman Stadler then we are very curious 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.040
 on the final result 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.340
 behind me is just the floor of the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.019

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.720

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.630

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.440

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.150
