 my aunts or her friends I do not know but I 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.659

 please come in to see with me 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.290
 lets go see it 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.420
 ok to make this delicious dessert 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.420
 we're going to need cinnamon 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.670
 we're going to need sugar to taste a 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.650
 small water cup you can also 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.900
 make pure milk but I wanted that 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.420
 you put a little water 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.720
 we're going to need two and a half cups of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.030
 milk we are also going to need cookies 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.220
 of this redondita does not matter the brand 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.290
 we're going to need cornstarch this is the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.560
 important key to make our 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.270
 dessert or our ice cream cake what 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.970
 first thing we're going to do is put 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.890
 boil our cup of water and also you 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.380
 let's add the cinnamon 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.340
 put whole pieces of cinnamon like 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.340
 this first that putin 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.769
 while boiling our water we are going to 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.599
 Mix the cornstarch in the milk 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.540
 move it well because at the beginning it 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.250
 vomiting and this does not mean we 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.200
 it's going to help a lot so you have to 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.459
 move well and dissolve everything so that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.459
 those little balls are left 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.440
 now let's take a look at 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.270
 our water that we are already serving 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.950
 that I'm good to release the scent 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.990
 cinnamon we're going to start taking out the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.910
 pieces of cinnamon and then we're going to 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.040
 add the cornstarch with milk 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.740
 this step is super important because no 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.170
 you have to stop moving the moment 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.110
 maizena because if you are not going to stick and 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.330
 well then it smells like burned or you know 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.070
 burned but it will not come out so 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.710
 delicious so I recommend you not 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.570
 stop it moving no moment until 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.960
 that we put out the fire or until it's 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.960
 ready 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.610
 Now let's add the sugar these 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.800
 days to taste you can only try and see 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.720
 that you also like or not your vote so 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.240
 sweet because the cookies are also 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.430
 lights so it's your decision 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.800
 and good after as you can see already 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.580
 is getting thick and this is the point 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.500
 that we want to make you thick 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.210
 once it is already thick as 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.130
 can see here is let's leave it 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.880
 study to then start doing 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.040
 our cakes 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.770
 in any preferable container that 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.990
 be crystal let's put a layer of 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.510
 cornstarch and then we will put a layer 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.920
 of cookies and this is going to be the step or going 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.930
 to be the process to make our 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.330
 cake you will be putting a layer of 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.110
 cornstarch and another layer of cookies until 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.110
 that your recent 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.670
 once our dessert the crime 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.590
 let's take the refrigerator but not 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.900
 we're going to put it in the freezer what 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.209
 let's put on the bottom and 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.280
 well after three or four hours what 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.180
 let's take it out and move forward more than ready 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.180
 to enjoy it 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.729

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.449
