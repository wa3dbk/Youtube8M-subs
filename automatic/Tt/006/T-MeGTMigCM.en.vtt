00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.429
 so people 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.420
 that is a mate is from the canon 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.559
 650 that I have worried now and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.059
 they'll just come in now 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.560
 a little bit up the stairs I know 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.680
 not if I belong at all 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.449
 could and yes maybe that can 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.580
 one or the other already thinks what 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.849
 will come soon if I find myself a new one 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.760
 I bought a camera for filming 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.579
 but no expert but away from the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.290
 window else you know still without 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.270
 but i will be in the now 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.260
 read in a little bit the next time 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.260
 a little bit here to try the things 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.789
 this is only a small test 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:56.760
 video should i turn right 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:59.430
 na na na na na na na what was that it has 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.600
 seen that was the country match take 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.910
 Today I take that for another 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.830
 special on we just run 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.470
 further that as I said only one 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:16.520
 small camera test, let's see 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.520
 Search again so is the quality 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 OK 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.590
 back again and yes today or tomorrow 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.970
 will definitely be a new one 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.530
 comments come and go there 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.720
 do not worry 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:36.980
 We continue here through the area 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:41.050
 and come to my room what is 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:45.620
 because stocks here are music style 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:50.230
 namely nothing is going on here and will be 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.230
 go in there now 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.750
 it is apparently complete 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.610
 what does that mean people yes 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.070
 maybe the 50,000 subscribers 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.950
 Let's just take a look at what we do 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.550

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.550
