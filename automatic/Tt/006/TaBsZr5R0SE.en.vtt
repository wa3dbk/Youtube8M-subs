you how to make an era pocket bird trap

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.240 
you how to make an era pocket bird trap
or<00:00:07.500> better<00:00:07.859> known<00:00:07.950> as<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.280> mojave<00:00:08.870> bird<00:00:09.870> trap

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
or better known as a mojave bird trap

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.160 
or better known as a mojave bird trap
with<00:00:11.250> two<00:00:11.519> different<00:00:11.990> methods<00:00:12.990> of

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
with two different methods of

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.650 
with two different methods of
construction<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.219> two<00:00:15.030> different<00:00:15.330> methods

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
construction and two different methods

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.150 
construction and two different methods
of<00:00:16.010> triggering<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.160> trap<00:00:18.859> what<00:00:19.859> I'm<00:00:19.949> showing

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
of triggering the trap what I'm showing

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.609 
of triggering the trap what I'm showing
here<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.520> pretty<00:00:21.150> self-explanatory<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.500> know

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
here is pretty self-explanatory you know

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.500 
here is pretty self-explanatory you know
all<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.130> need<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.850> two<00:00:24.240> sticks

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
all you need to do is have two sticks

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.220 
all you need to do is have two sticks
parallel<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.080> each<00:00:25.170> other<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.420> tie<00:00:27.420> off<00:00:27.480> two

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
parallel to each other and tie off two

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.500 
parallel to each other and tie off two
pieces<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.590> string<00:00:28.800> across<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.760> sticks<00:00:30.330> over

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
pieces of string across the sticks over

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.740 
pieces of string across the sticks over
so<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.900> makes<00:00:31.080> an<00:00:31.230> X<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.859> slowly<00:00:32.750> intertwine

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
so it makes an X and slowly intertwine

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.350 
so it makes an X and slowly intertwine
each<00:00:34.020> stick<00:00:34.500> into<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.670> actual<00:00:35.969> framework

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
each stick into the actual framework

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.869 
each stick into the actual framework
which<00:00:37.050> will<00:00:37.230> end<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.530> making<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.920> cage<00:00:38.100> now

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
which will end up making the cage now

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.729 
which will end up making the cage now
don't<00:00:39.120> worry<00:00:39.329> it'll<00:00:39.540> feel<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.530> loose

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
don't worry it'll feel like it's loose

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.590 
don't worry it'll feel like it's loose
at<00:00:40.950> first<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> more<00:00:41.520> sticks<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.390> put

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
at first but the more sticks you put

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.930 
at first but the more sticks you put
into<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.100> actual<00:00:44.100> framework<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.850> are

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
into the actual framework that are

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.869 
into the actual framework that are
tighter<00:00:45.210> it'll<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:46.500> you'll<00:00:46.710> see

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
tighter it'll get and as you'll see

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.510 
tighter it'll get and as you'll see
it'll<00:00:47.879> start<00:00:48.170> firming<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.680> should<00:00:50.370> be

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it'll start firming up and should be

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.210 
it'll start firming up and should be
pretty<00:00:50.760> good

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.030 

um<00:00:54.700> please<00:00:55.600> excuse<00:00:56.200> my<00:00:56.410> poor<00:00:56.710> construction

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
um please excuse my poor construction

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.070 
um please excuse my poor construction
skills<00:00:57.940> at<00:00:58.210> this<00:00:58.360> point<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.780> video

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
skills at this point in the video

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.590 
skills at this point in the video
our<00:00:59.320> this<00:01:00.280> method<00:01:00.700> I'm<00:01:00.820> just<00:01:01.000> showing<00:01:01.240> as<00:01:01.540> a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
our this method I'm just showing as a

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.890 
our this method I'm just showing as a
form<00:01:02.050> of<00:01:02.170> demonstration<00:01:06.300> with<00:01:07.300> this<00:01:07.480> second

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
form of demonstration with this second

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.510 
form of demonstration with this second
method<00:01:08.170> all<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.500> really<00:01:08.740> need<00:01:08.980> to<00:01:09.010> do<00:01:09.160> is<00:01:09.280> tie

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
method all you really need to do is tie

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.160 
method all you really need to do is tie
each<00:01:09.760> stick<00:01:10.090> off<00:01:10.240> individually<00:01:10.900> to<00:01:11.050> one

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
each stick off individually to one

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.380 
each stick off individually to one
another<00:01:11.440> I<00:01:11.650> prefer<00:01:12.340> this<00:01:12.490> method<00:01:12.550> purely

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
another I prefer this method purely

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.360 
another I prefer this method purely
because<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:14.230> cage<00:01:14.470> is<00:01:14.650> a<00:01:14.680> lot<00:01:14.800> stronger<00:01:15.100> and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
because the cage is a lot stronger and

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.220 
because the cage is a lot stronger and
it's<00:01:15.490> better<00:01:15.730> for<00:01:15.880> catching<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.870> stronger

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
it's better for catching the stronger

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.039 
it's better for catching the stronger
birds

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.210 

okay<00:01:21.049> now<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.530> method<00:01:21.920> for<00:01:22.100> making

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
okay now this is the method for making

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.460 
okay now this is the method for making
my<00:01:22.549> preferred<00:01:23.000> trigger<00:01:23.420> for<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:23.750> trap<00:01:24.110> it's

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
my preferred trigger for this trap it's

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.340 
my preferred trigger for this trap it's
called<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.829> figure-four<00:01:25.399> trigger<00:01:25.899> now<00:01:26.899> all<00:01:27.140> you

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
called a figure-four trigger now all you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.020 
called a figure-four trigger now all you
really<00:01:27.560> need<00:01:27.799> to<00:01:27.829> do<00:01:28.039> is<00:01:28.189> have<00:01:28.399> three<00:01:28.729> separate

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
really need to do is have three separate

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.660 
really need to do is have three separate
sticks<00:01:29.299> at<00:01:29.630> three<00:01:30.590> marginally<00:01:31.280> different

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
sticks at three marginally different

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.240 
sticks at three marginally different
lengths<00:01:32.090> um<00:01:32.420> if<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.720> watch<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.140> video<00:01:33.380> it's

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
lengths um if you watch the video it's

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.779 
lengths um if you watch the video it's
pretty<00:01:34.549> self-explanatory<00:01:35.020> also<00:01:36.549> it's<00:01:37.549> all

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
pretty self-explanatory also it's all

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.179 
pretty self-explanatory also it's all
about<00:01:38.060> balance<00:01:38.509> with<00:01:38.750> these<00:01:39.439> card<00:01:39.679> traps<00:01:39.979> you

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
about balance with these card traps you

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.510 
about balance with these card traps you
know<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:41.299> same<00:01:41.869> goes<00:01:42.170> with<00:01:42.409> my<00:01:43.070> second

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
know that same goes with my second

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.980 
know that same goes with my second
method<00:01:43.759> which<00:01:43.939> will<00:01:44.119> come<00:01:44.420> up<00:01:44.570> later<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:44.960> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
method which will come up later in the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.350 
method which will come up later in the
video

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.810 

oh<00:01:50.740> you<00:01:51.740> want<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:51.950> place<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.160> break<00:01:52.490> for<00:01:52.700> this

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
oh you want to place a break for this

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.390 
oh you want to place a break for this
trap<00:01:53.120> on<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.420> stick<00:01:53.660> going<00:01:53.960> on<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.040> inside

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
trap on a stick going on to the inside

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.580 
trap on a stick going on to the inside
of<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.580> cage<00:01:55.910> now<00:01:56.780> anything<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.350> touches

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
of the cage now anything that touches

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.220 
of the cage now anything that touches
that<00:01:58.010> bait<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.490> going<00:01:58.730> to<00:01:58.910> make<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.300> whole

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
that bait is going to make the whole

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:17.550 
that bait is going to make the whole
cage<00:02:00.530> collapse<00:02:00.890> very<00:02:01.220> quickly

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.860 

now<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.740> second<00:02:19.220> method<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.760> trigger<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.840> a

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
now this second method of trigger is a

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.890 
now this second method of trigger is a
lot<00:02:21.320> harder<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.740> set<00:02:21.980> up<00:02:22.100> purely<00:02:22.700> because<00:02:22.900> it's

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
lot harder to set up purely because it's

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.570 
lot harder to set up purely because it's
