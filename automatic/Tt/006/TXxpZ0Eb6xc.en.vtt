00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.400
 Why did you want to become a fireman? 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.020
 I wanted to become a firefighter because I saw firefighters heroes 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.890
 I saw them greater than life 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.700
 Once I got the job itself I realized we were just human beings 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.340
 One day I saw more than one other person had seen in his whole life 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.890
 What do you see? 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.499
 I see the faces of death 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.390
 I see older people, young people and children 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.299
 There are pictures that are hard to erase 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.569
 I do not even realize I go home 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.190
 I can not fix someone's death 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.650
 I can not fix a broken person 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.950
 I can not control what is going on in my head and make me crazy 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.880
 Who is talking about this? 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.750
 The only time you'll see a fireman crying 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.830
 Is when one of his colleagues dies. 

00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:22.110
 Okay 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.080
 Can you tell me about one of those times when you could not save someone? 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.210
 I came out after receiving a call from a young girl in her early twenties 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.570
 They were celebrating the roof of an apartment building 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.360
 Hit and then hit the side of the walls and died 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.990
 But she had some signs of life 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.918
 I was the one who saved her with recovery 

00:01:55.918 --> 00:02:01.460
 I did not realize at the time that this incident would cause me a breakdown 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.960
 Some of these calls mess only with you. 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.900
 This call is futile to me. 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.740
 I wanted to start drinking alcohol to escape these feelings and emotions 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.990
 But it did not work. 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.450
 I was using prescription only because I wanted to lose my feeling 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.180
 You have been diagnosed with PTSD. Can you tell me about this? 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.750
 I recover from my injuries 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.030
 I will not fully recover because I was summoned last week and the incident affected me 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.000
 But I take it faster because I do not drink alcohol 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.430
 I eat healthy food and go up the stairs 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.860
 Tell me how you changed from drinking alcohol as a way of evading reality 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.470
 To climb the stairs as a new practice? 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.069
 Drugs and alcohol thrive. 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.060
 As I climb the stairs, I feel as if I am coming 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.200
 I try to walk 10,000 steps a day 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.860
 He is mentally a good smuggler because he makes you come out of yourself 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.090
 I began to realize I was trying to control 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.970
 Things I do not have the ability to control 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.570
 I try to control death 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.060
 You can not control death 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.570
 So I focus on trying not to think 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.060
 I just concentrate on trying to reach myself up the stairs 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.450
 I just focus on staying positive. 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.510
 I started encouraging my colleagues to join the boarding in honor 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.760
 For people killed on 9/11 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.420
 Now, we're wearing Xena 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.290
 We began to wear our wide trousers, 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.290
 And our fire extinguisher. We wear our helmets 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.610
 We get to a point where we want to surrender only 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.459
 Then think of people who can not do this 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:01.539
 People who are not here anymore, learn? 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.350
 Stairs are a metaphor for life 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.000
 Every step only. 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.730
 All the enthusiasm, energy, sweat and tears 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.040
 Gather up to the top 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:28.020
 Where it explodes and feels that the sky is open to feel so. Everyone has his experience. 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.190
 I suspect that many people think they can feel this in a grain, 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.530
 Or at the bottom of a cup. 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.650
 They do not have to go that far. 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.800
 When you can breathe fresh air 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.460
 You breathe life. 

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:49.569
 it is amazing 

00:04:49.585 --> 00:05:21.455
