00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.310 
bumper is um it has a muffler and
resonator<00:01:25.830> setup<00:01:26.340> where<00:01:27.119> originally<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:28.140> had

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
resonator setup where originally I had

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.060 
resonator setup where originally I had
the<00:01:28.829> resonator<00:01:29.549> delete<00:01:30.020> setup<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.740> give<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the resonator delete setup just give it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
the resonator delete setup just give it
a<00:01:32.100> little<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.430> grunt<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.140> tone

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
a little more grunt a little bit of tone

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.130 
a little more grunt a little bit of tone
because<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:35.060> absolutely<00:01:36.060> silent<00:01:36.509> before

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.740 
a thrush glass back on but you know what
I<00:01:50.070> decide

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
I decide

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.100 
I decide
I run<00:01:51.140> it<00:01:51.260> with<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> pipe<00:01:52.310> for<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.580> while<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.420> I

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
I run it with a pipe for a while and I

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.360 
I run it with a pipe for a while and I
liked<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.070> with<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.370> 2.3<00:01:55.940> we<00:01:56.600> have<00:01:56.780> a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
liked it so with the 2.3 we have a

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.210 
liked it so with the 2.3 we have a
manifold<00:01:58.370> catalytic<00:01:59.330> converter<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.220> a

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
manifold catalytic converter and a

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.160 
manifold catalytic converter and a
second<00:02:01.640> catalytic<00:02:02.210> converter<00:02:02.600> afterwards

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
second catalytic converter afterwards

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.860 
second catalytic converter afterwards
because<00:02:03.470> it's<00:02:03.650> supposed<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.520> be<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.910> partial

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
because it's supposed to be a partial

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.530 
because it's supposed to be a partial
zero<00:02:06.140> emissions<00:02:06.440> vehicle<00:02:06.860> or<00:02:07.600> super<00:02:08.600> low<00:02:08.810> you

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
zero emissions vehicle or super low you

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.760 
zero emissions vehicle or super low you
emissions<00:02:11.540> vehicle<00:02:11.720> or<00:02:12.110> whatever<00:02:12.230> they<00:02:12.560> call

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
emissions vehicle or whatever they call

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.240 
emissions vehicle or whatever they call
it<00:02:12.920> out<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.130> California<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.500> not<00:02:15.740> you

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
it out in California this was not you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.370 
it out in California this was not you
know<00:02:16.370> standard<00:02:16.760> out<00:02:17.360> here<00:02:17.750> where<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.959> am<00:02:18.140> in
