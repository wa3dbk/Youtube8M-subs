I've totally wrapped up and got out of
business<00:02:43.150> they<00:02:44.140> need<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.530> sell<00:02:44.739> they'll<00:02:45.069> take

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
business they need to sell they'll take

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.920 
business they need to sell they'll take
whatever<00:02:45.610> they<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:45.849> get<00:02:46.060> for<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.360> as<00:02:46.569> I<00:02:46.599> said

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
whatever they can get for it as I said

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.839 
whatever they can get for it as I said
if<00:02:47.349> they<00:02:47.530> could<00:02:47.709> give<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.010> away<00:02:48.220> at<00:02:48.459> this<00:02:48.610> point

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
if they could give it away at this point

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.000 
if they could give it away at this point
