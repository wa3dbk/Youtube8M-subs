00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.170
 Hi there, this is the market and today I decided 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.360
 record a video about your questions 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.580
 who do not give up in contact or in 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.039
 lichku 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.949
 So we start at the beginning of the kind of lot of 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.109
 banquet list with how you play on the beta 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.240
 we play for 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.430
 the guys on the betty have the opportunity 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.429
 you can copy your character 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.160
 do on those servers that respond 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.910
 for the passage of his hall link so 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.559
 called btr link service and there you can 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.520
 copy one of your own 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.600
 characters and the same thing they play like us 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.489
 father-in-law with their own Maine as if so 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.579
 how is testing now 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.030
 blood server then if you invite in 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.239
 a group of all the guys from different servers in 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.059
 this is the server then entering the raid anyway 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.670
 vi all things are scanned as needed 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.350
 to test the level 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.710
 so there are such chips when guys 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.530
 remove old old clothes for example 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.770
 there are 350 white in vivo 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.250
 luce 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.799
 actual and or maybe 500 second but with 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.140
 interesting articles 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.310
 entering the raid they are scanned 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.380
 accordingly there in some 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.110
 do not get more profitable things 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.810
 Therefore, the main play with them is sometimes more convenient and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.250
 more interesting and 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.729
 someone bother with this we have 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.700
 such in statics this way and played 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.470
 us in testing warlords of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.270
 draenor 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.360
 next, please tell me what 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.649
 servers do you play on what factions well 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.299
 now we my monk banquet is on 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.060
 also i have my twinks many 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.780
 what were the alliance 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.960
 on the guard not ttk dam 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:09.649
 war I have druids there 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.410
 low level and twink for the horde I have on 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.310
 Soulflayer 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.470
 so let's go further into the mushroom marriage 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.480
 what does he have to do with the raid 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.790
 games on him experiments did or 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.769
 magic you sirle or just to sklifa not 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.709
 Yli balls played decided to call to her 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.140
 live not up to date so in response to this 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.500
 I'll read you a question now that we are 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.690
 write about the mushroom bureau atlas giants 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.819
 iron hordes became anchored in the waters 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.310
 next to possession of the supreme hammer on 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.890
 drew attention to the cheers of the ancient flu 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.430
 dweller depth this giant leaves 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.849
 behind only mushroom spores and could it 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.110
 basic instinct is directed to the bottom 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.890
 destroy all traces of civilization on 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.819
 draenor so it's just ancient 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.880
 the creature we cling to see 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.030
 either side of our raid no 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.680
 direct relationship to the supreme ground 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.180
 or the giant of the iron horde he has not 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.150
 go ahead 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.130
 How much do you already play Monk Monk I 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.200
 I've been playing since spring last year 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.900
 the next question is what do you have 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.950
 now stand on the beta where you shook them 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:32.019
 I used to beta dBm I 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:37.010
 using scada i use ella 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.540
 K-line works well and old Kelvin 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.420
 everything 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.280
 I downloaded them to the interface. who is there 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.060
 there is a special section already addons 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.610
 that work for beta dry nora well 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.190
 specially such large don as dbm and 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.110
 tom i went to it on course just on myself 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.690
 project site for walking and watching 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.720
 copy for draenor of all her own 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.590
 coaching copy seems to be for 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.670
 premium accounts just distributed 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.980
 so I downloaded his sending his 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.610
 the guilds where you took her not 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.220
 I know like this, but here I come to show 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.709
 where he beat include addons 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.299
 but don guys turn on bypass for sure 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.980
 as well as live except for that 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.790
 that in the main menu there is another 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.430
 button 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.060
 when you skate press and there is there 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.250
 Madonnas 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.250
 You can addons these to include or 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.820
 turn off right out of the game they only 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:43.430
 going out and out of the characters there with putting down 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.830
 ticks in the modifications so go on 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.350
 what a don in such a minute with a useful 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.890
 dollar but this is a question from some 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.080
 Stream addons that scorch rare 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.350
 enpisi called in case that will 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.200
 worth he notices some rare 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.050
 creatures that are in his base 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.760
 put them tick any there 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.620
 skull well and screams the whole screen 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.610
 tell me the name of the tone to try on 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:19.860
 I don't wear clothes like that 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:22.650
 Don called he could it hello long ago 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.979
 You began to know the world of Vova and from what 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.640
 matches you play about the match did not understand 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:35.250
 I began to play somewhere two and a half 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:37.290
 years ago from the tail of the cataclysm there and 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.970
 The next question is also related to this. 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:44.180
 your first class wow it was druids so 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:48.300
 as I remember now, I ran a kitten and 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.550
 rocked after a kitten I had a hill 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.580
 second stack well and then bear 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.730
 so the next question is probably this 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.650
 time the latter means a banquet with tell 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.290
 how to stream on youtube and whether it is possible 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.130
 do mac os on youtube 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.900
 you can stream if you have it available 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:12.740
 The accent is a bit extra in 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.080
 channel settings if you are allowed 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.950
 live broadcasts then you can stream 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:22.400

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.190
 the same ones i'm using stream cook from 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.100
 open broadcaster software bs is developing 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.290
 in short it can be customized he has 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.830
 there stubs special for bundles with 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.310

 Stream key this key in just 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.060
