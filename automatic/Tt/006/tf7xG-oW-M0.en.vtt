always wanted the exhilaration of just

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.440 
always wanted the exhilaration of just
smashing<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.700> those<00:00:47.789> balls<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.390> in

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450

a<00:00:48.510> film<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.960> we're<00:00:49.050> doing<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.590> much<00:00:49.739> knowing

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
a film but we're doing as much knowing

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.420 
a film but we're doing as much knowing
that<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.460> die<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.820> eight<00:00:51.180> hours<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
that you're gonna die in eight hours I

that you're gonna die in eight hours I
think<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> suppose<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.910> sense<00:00:54.210> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
think I suppose it's the sense of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.420 
think I suppose it's the sense of
abandon<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.410> know<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> mean<00:00:55.860> maybe<00:00:56.010> I'd<00:00:56.190> murder

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
abandon you know I mean maybe I'd murder

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.880 
abandon you know I mean maybe I'd murder
a<00:00:56.550> person<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:58.020> how<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.739> know<00:00:58.859> i

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
a person you know how to see you know i

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.170 
a person you know how to see you know i
don't<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.340> i<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.699> i'd<00:00:59.820> probably<00:01:00.000> go

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
don't know but i think i'd probably go

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.000 
don't know but i think i'd probably go
mental<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:01.020> i<00:01:01.320> was<00:01:01.649> need<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> very

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
mental because i was need a very

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
mental because i was need a very
reserved<00:01:02.340> person<00:01:02.820> I've<00:01:03.000> always<00:01:03.090> I've<00:01:03.660> never

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.469 
gotten off I've never calls to run push
yeah<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.850> that's<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.060> worrying<00:01:06.450> thought

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
yeah but that's a worrying thought

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.649 
yeah but that's a worrying thought
because<00:01:07.700> we're<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> end<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> world

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
because we're at the end of the world

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.940 
because we're at the end of the world
for<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> end<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.710> world

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
for it to be the end of your world

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
for it to be the end of your world
because<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> lot<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.460> people<00:01:11.580> know<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
because a lot of people know that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.240 
because a lot of people know that
they're<00:01:12.510> terminally<00:01:13.049> ill<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:14.040> don't

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
they're terminally ill so they don't

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.530 
they're terminally ill so they don't
know<00:01:14.310> around<00:01:14.520> smashing<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:14.939> bars<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.299> killing

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
know around smashing at bars and killing

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.120 
know around smashing at bars and killing
people<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.110> suppose<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.740> there'll<00:01:17.100> be

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
people but I suppose I know there'll be

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.859 
people but I suppose I know there'll be
no<00:01:17.369> repercussions<00:01:17.549> ultimately<00:01:18.360> because

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
no repercussions ultimately because

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
no repercussions ultimately because
they're<00:01:19.170> gonna<00:01:19.290> die<00:01:19.439> no<00:01:19.710> everyone's<00:01:20.159> gone

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
there's not gonna be mourning families

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.420 
there's not gonna be mourning families

divorce myself from my morali that's
ingrained<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:28.160> because<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.550> doesn't<00:02:28.819> matter

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
ingrained just because it doesn't matter

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.059 
ingrained just because it doesn't matter
anymore<00:02:29.890> yeah<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.549> mean<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.379> honestly<00:02:33.379> to<00:02:34.040> me

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
anymore yeah but I mean I honestly to me

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.699 
anymore yeah but I mean I honestly to me
it<00:02:34.370> seems<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:35.349> we're<00:02:36.349> approaching<00:02:38.349> just<00:02:39.349> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
it seems that we're approaching just the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.190 
it seems that we're approaching just the
end<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.099> end<00:02:40.129> of<00:02:40.489> all<00:02:40.640> things<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.690> I'm

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
end the end of all things and so I'm

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.809 
end the end of all things and so I'm
saying<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.709> there's<00:02:42.980> something<00:02:43.340> about<00:02:43.459> the

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
saying that there's something about the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.569 
saying that there's something about the
fact<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.390> we're<00:02:44.900> all<00:02:44.930> going<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.500> end<00:02:45.650> that

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
fact that we're all going to end that

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.479 
fact that we're all going to end that
somehow<00:02:46.940> seems<00:02:47.420> very<00:02:47.660> liberating<00:02:48.400> what<00:02:49.400> would

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
somehow seems very liberating what would

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.660 
somehow seems very liberating what would
you<00:02:49.579> do<00:02:50.319> I've<00:02:51.319> always<00:02:51.500> wanted<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.890> kick<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.430> dick

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
you do I've always wanted to kick a dick

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.910
