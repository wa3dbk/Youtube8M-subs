00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 we will talk about a topic with leads 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.700
 by title tropisms dynasties of the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.700
 matter of plant physiology 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.000
 the tropisms are the movements 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.920
 permanent plant or some 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.049
 organ in response to a stimulus 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 external that acts in only one direction 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.080
 so that the plant grows towards the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.050
 encouragement let's observe 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.640
 note the plant is directed directly 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.590
 towards solar stimulus 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.570
 if the organ moves in the same 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.250
 direction that the stimulus is strong or 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.910
 tropism and if he does 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.720
 inclined is plagiarism tropism now a 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.610
 example of short tropism 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.310
 the intensity of light that enters 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.950
 directly through the window the plant the 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.360
 completely absorbs this is it 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.040
 called ortho tropism 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.050
 now an example of plagiarism tropism 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.090
 known because the plant presents 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.920
 a hard curve of its stem and the same 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.050
 shape absorbs light energy 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.210
 and the organ of the plant approaches the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.340
 stimulate the positive tropism and if the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.320
 plant moves away from stimulus is tropism 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.120
 negative 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.120
 main times of tropism 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.800
 foto tropismo recorded tropismo the other 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.800
 techno floor tropism and kim and another same 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.090
 photo tropismo 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.070
 again it is observed as the plant 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.590
 directly absorbs the incoming light 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.590
 through the window this is known as 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.520
 photo tropismo 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.460
 and gaby tropism known as well because 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.600
 Tree roots grow according to 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.600
 the gravity of the earth 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.200
 now an example of helium tropism 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.530
 known as well because both the stem and 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.850
 the leaves of the plant are directed towards 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.479
 the sunlight 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.930
 tecmo tropismo known as that the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.319
 plant instantly adheres to a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.769
 surface either wall tree or rock 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.739
 chemistry known as tropism because the 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:18.310
 plant reacts automatically with 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.600
 some kind of chemical liquid or with the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.380
 liquids inside the plant 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.380
 more days 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.390
 they are pretty fast movements that 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.130
 occur in the face of the presence u 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.380
 occurrence of a stimulus when 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.400
 we talk about asia we just indicate its 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.510
 movement 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.510
 types of in asia 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.300
 photo was born response to intensity 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.560
 light that causes the opening and 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.560
 close up of many flowers 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.450
 gymnastics movement response 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.010
 chemical substances like plants 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.370
 carnivores that trap in dry 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.060
 let's look at the image 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.269
 the carnivorous plant opens and closes what 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:16.090
 are their leaves to catch their food 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.090
 which in this case could be the flies 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.870
 so 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.489
 earthquake nastia response in stimuli 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.590
 mechanical or contact 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.660
 for example the closing of the folios and the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.540
 position of falling leaves a 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.380
 example of this is mimosa in terms of 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.800
 you touch her folios close 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:42.620
 it's like this friends how this recording has 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.620
 come to an end let's hope and it has been
