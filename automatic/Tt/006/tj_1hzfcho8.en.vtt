00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.819
 Y 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.020
 yes 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.160
 calls sings and plays the guitar and the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.660
 truth is that I left as with the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.330
 music out there in fact learn logar and 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.410
 guitar much more girl long before 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.840
 the drums and drums started playing like 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.419
 to the kings at 15 they gave me one of 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.390
 she for Christmas I asked her was everything 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.949
 super authorities at the beginning I 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.830
 friends fucking knee who also 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.800
 like to play and also a little known 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.650
 before the issue then we put together a 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.610
 band and we played everything that was like 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.910
 middle school education 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.750
 a year and a half ago I had already decided that 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.750
 I wanted to dedicate myself 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.460
 the first as well as great memory that 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.949
 I had it was the first time I played like 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.469
 in front of the public that was 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.360
 on a walk I think of the company where 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.549
 I was working in that time and I played with my 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.039
 loved we were the only ones to see a song 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.170
 very good in his minute he called me in 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.409
 field with guitar and I the company does not 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.100
 he knew how to do nothing but be unique 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.569
 but this death scared but but I 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.069
 I agree a lot because I was super 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.069
 happy after having done 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.560
 most of the time for work 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.420
 with men many times they protect me in 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.840
 many cases 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.200
 that the minds of the people of the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.820
 Suddenly there is a public that exists and 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.070
 that you want to be cute and always 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.470
 like there are people there helping me with 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.340
 the technical technicians that work the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.840
 rockies are they do not leave me anything without doing 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.600
 nothing if they are all take care of me a lot and yes and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.610
 I'm also lucky to work in 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.009
 the two bands that I have are pure 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.320
 women then the only men that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.870
 they are either the sound engineers or the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.120
 technical pains and nothing else then 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.549
 Of course there are few women in the field 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.920
 but I have to work with many of 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.879
 those women because I expect work as 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.879
 almost down 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.860
 my music school was always the side 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.020
 pop rock pop 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.010
 and this last 34 years has been a lot of 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.600
 soul and punk 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.330
 thanks to mamma soul too 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.140
 play listen to everything that arrived 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.060
 hip hop blues 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.569
 and I think that's where the mergers go 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.319
 more than if I had to touch many 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.460
 sometimes jazz or not 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.370
 another not sexy rock and roll style 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.710
 but the truth is that the school 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.930
 that I've listened to and what mostly 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.350
 had to touch has to do with how 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.000
 a mix of soul funk as with a 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.300
 little bit of pop that also what more 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.300
 like 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.610
 as I said before felt extra help 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.590
 until I left school 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.450
 and the one who is sorry to study 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.450
 music in a high school 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.070
 I was titled there I was five years ago 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.070
 three years that I left I continue studying 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.599
 private teacher 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:42.440
 giving you to stay to be better 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:45.560
 every day if we catch the machine a little 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.150
 or the fact of having a band we go soul 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.870
 and the other band that I have that is the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.489
 band in bloom 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.340
 they have taken me as ports roads 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.500
 super different super difficult too 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.060
 both because suddenly mom sun is 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.170
 much better known than the other band 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.970
 but also the reality of a band 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.060
 that starts here is how the band is the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.310
 band in bloom and what and who has to 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.610
 many times to plow in a lot of 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.780
 things 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.780
 that you close the doors 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.220
 as we see all the edges that have 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.220
 who has the music here 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.830
 I've had millions of lecterns millions 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.540
 of Gibraltar boom that I said already 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.090
 these serve me 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.330
 I have a huge variety for elegy of 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:40.210
 things and during I do not know if I need something 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.210
 specific that will exist that does not happen 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.100
 If I want some cages and I want 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.680
 something that reaches far bell as 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.490
 I'm going to have because there are millions of 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.960
 options to be able to do that then 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.960
 they accommodate me absolutely
