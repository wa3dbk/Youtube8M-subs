your<00:00:53.899> butt<00:00:53.989> well<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.260> problem<00:00:54.469> being<00:00:54.800> is<00:00:54.949> that

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
your butt well the problem being is that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.400 
your butt well the problem being is that
my<00:00:55.850> expectation<00:00:56.480> is<00:00:56.539> still<00:00:56.780> too<00:00:56.960> high<00:00:57.170> you

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
my expectation is still too high you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.520 
my expectation is still too high you
know<00:00:57.499> three<00:00:57.769> top-five<00:00:58.039> finishes<00:00:59.230> set<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.350> bar

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
know three top-five finishes set the bar

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.319 
know three top-five finishes set the bar
so<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.339> high<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:01.820> was<00:01:01.940> almost<00:01:02.089> impossible

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
so so high that it was almost impossible

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.899 
so so high that it was almost impossible
to<00:01:02.899> follow<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.859> that's<00:01:04.220> what<00:01:04.400> he's<00:01:04.519> struggled

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
to follow and that's what he's struggled

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.480 
to follow and that's what he's struggled
from<00:01:05.059> but<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:06.320> gotta<00:01:06.500> win<00:01:06.650> games<00:01:06.890> afoot<00:01:07.130> plain

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
from but you gotta win games afoot plain

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.890 
from but you gotta win games afoot plain
that<00:01:07.520> way<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:07.940> I<00:01:08.000> think<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.270> same<00:01:08.480> for<00:01:08.630> Stoke

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
that way and I think the same for Stoke

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.570 
that way and I think the same for Stoke
you<00:01:09.440> know<00:01:09.500> all<00:01:09.680> time<00:01:09.890> you're<00:01:10.070> winning<00:01:10.340> then<00:01:10.370> it

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
you know all time you're winning then it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.430 
you know all time you're winning then it
looks<00:01:10.730> after<00:01:10.910> itself<00:01:11.150> but<00:01:11.510> if<00:01:11.630> any<00:01:11.990> state<00:01:12.260> is

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
looks after itself but if any state is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.430 
looks after itself but if any state is
struggling<00:01:13.210> then<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:14.870> people<00:01:15.200> can<00:01:15.290> all

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
struggling then then people can all

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.080 
struggling then then people can all
you've<00:01:15.590> got<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:15.800> big<00:01:16.010> split<00:01:16.280> stick<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.760> beat<00:01:16.940> you

throwback<00:01:27.500> almost<00:01:28.040> back<00:01:28.190> to<00:01:28.370> what<00:01:28.550> we<00:01:28.670> used<00:01:29.150> to

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
throwback almost back to what we used to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.060 
throwback almost back to what we used to
it<00:01:29.750> was<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:29.960> good<00:01:30.050> result<00:01:30.410> but<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.620> previous

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
it was a good result but the previous

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.060 
sir well it could be in sure here
because<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:38.960> guess<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.290> Tottenham<00:01:39.650> team<00:01:39.890> who

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
because I guess the Tottenham team who

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.740 
because I guess the Tottenham team who
scored<00:01:40.400> five<00:01:40.670> goals<00:01:40.700> in<00:01:41.210> their<00:01:41.360> last<00:01:41.570> two

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
scored five goals in their last two

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.050 
scored five goals in their last two
games<00:01:41.780> now<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.260> of<00:01:42.290> those<00:01:42.410> came<00:01:42.680> against

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
games now one of those came against

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.220 
games now one of those came against
Preston<00:01:44.060> obviously<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.450> championship<00:01:44.990> side

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
Preston obviously a championship side

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.130 
Preston obviously a championship side
