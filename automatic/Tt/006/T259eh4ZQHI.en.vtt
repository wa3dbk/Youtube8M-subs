walking<00:00:56.190> forward<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:57.030> losing

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
walking forward and back and then losing

the<00:00:57.660> turret<00:00:58.129> left<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.600> it's<00:01:00.600> pretty

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899

9<00:01:59.030> 10<00:01:59.329> 11<00:01:59.390> years<00:01:59.689> ago<00:02:00.170> let's<00:02:00.859> rub<00:02:01.100> assets<00:02:01.520> which

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
9 10 11 years ago let's rub assets which

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.749 
9 10 11 years ago let's rub assets which
offers<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.719> a<00:02:02.750> lot<00:02:02.990> they<00:02:03.140> met<00:02:03.439> for<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:04.310> ring<00:02:04.579> in

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
offers you a lot they met for a ring in

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.550 
offers you a lot they met for a ring in
the<00:02:04.939> retina<00:02:05.659> or<00:02:05.840> other<00:02:06.170> school<00:02:06.640> cruise<00:02:07.640> ship

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the retina or other school cruise ship

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:24.670 
the retina or other school cruise ship
so<00:02:09.560> then<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.519> know<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:10.910> really<00:02:11.390> small<00:02:23.680> if

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
so then you know it's really small if

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.740 
so then you know it's really small if
you<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:24.980> walk<00:02:25.370> out<00:02:25.580> what<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:26.000> want<00:02:26.299> what<00:02:26.720> you

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
need that other spot and then you can

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.770 
need that other spot and then you can
just<00:02:28.430> come<00:02:28.670> like<00:02:28.730> those<00:02:29.120> yourself<00:02:29.330> by

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
just come like those yourself by

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.020 
just come like those yourself by
downloading<00:02:30.200> some<00:02:30.470> instructions<00:02:31.069> or<00:02:31.730> if<00:02:31.880> you

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
downloading some instructions or if you

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.520 
downloading some instructions or if you
really<00:02:32.360> really<00:02:32.540> want<00:02:32.660> I'll<00:02:33.049> try<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.380> make

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
really really want I'll try and make

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.380 
really really want I'll try and make
some<00:02:33.709> instructions<00:02:34.280> but<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.549> mean<00:02:34.760> I'm<00:02:35.269> gonna

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
some instructions but I mean I'm gonna

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.640 
some instructions but I mean I'm gonna
have<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.660> get<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:35.900> three<00:02:36.140> or<00:02:36.260> four<00:02:36.290> comments

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
have to get like three or four comments

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.190 
have to get like three or four comments
for<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.130> because<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:38.810> kind<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.049> pointless

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
for that because it's kind of pointless

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.460 
for that because it's kind of pointless
to<00:02:39.530> know<00:02:39.650> what's<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.099> but<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.989> need<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.440> of

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
to know what's that but you need one of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.920 
to know what's that but you need one of
these<00:02:42.730> bits<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.910> are<00:02:43.970> on<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.239> gun<00:02:44.660> like

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
these bits that are on the gun like

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.800 
these bits that are on the gun like
a<00:02:45.220> black<00:02:47.349> 2<00:02:48.349> by<00:02:48.500> 2<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:49.700> clips<00:02:50.239> onto<00:02:50.420> one<00:02:50.780> of

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
a black 2 by 2 that clips onto one of

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.210 
a black 2 by 2 that clips onto one of
these<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:52.549> make<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.879> kind<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.150> like<00:02:53.329> Benny

which I can't seem to click on there we

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.780 
which I can't seem to click on there we
go<00:03:01.030> let<00:03:02.030> me<00:03:02.180> something<00:03:02.510> down<00:03:02.660> there<00:03:02.870> them<00:03:03.790> so

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
go let me something down there them so

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
one but those bits which Clippers will

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.140 
one but those bits which Clippers will
go<00:04:43.910> out<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.300> they're<00:04:45.050> basically<00:04:45.410> the

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
go out that they're basically the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.060 
go out that they're basically the
they're<00:04:47.150> part<00:04:47.390> of<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.540> walkers<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:47.990> legs<00:04:49.060> yep

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
they're part of the walkers and legs yep

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.770 
they're part of the walkers and legs yep
the<00:04:52.070> six<00:04:52.610> of<00:04:52.760> them<00:04:52.940> two<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.300> them<00:04:53.540> with<00:04:53.660> those

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
the six of them two of them with those

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.260 
the six of them two of them with those
grove<00:04:53.990> it's<00:04:54.169> on<00:04:54.610> this<00:04:55.610> is<00:04:55.790> kind<00:04:56.030> of<00:04:56.060> like<00:04:56.150> a

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
grove it's on this is kind of like a

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.430 
grove it's on this is kind of like a
minifig<00:04:57.610> thing<00:04:58.610> like<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.360> bit<00:04:59.720> that<00:05:00.050> account

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
minifig thing like it a bit that account

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.130 
minifig thing like it a bit that account
carries<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:01.220> it<00:05:01.310> signals<00:05:01.729> um<00:05:02.000> aeroplanes<00:05:02.960> at

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
carries and it signals um aeroplanes at

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.000 
carries and it signals um aeroplanes at
the<00:05:03.290> airport<00:05:03.890> like<00:05:04.580> signal<00:05:05.000> isn't<00:05:05.090> like<00:05:05.360> that

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
the airport like signal isn't like that

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.300 
the airport like signal isn't like that
so<00:05:07.010> if<00:05:07.250> I<00:05:07.400> usually<00:05:07.880> has<00:05:07.970> a<00:05:08.000> stick<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.570> there

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
so if I usually has a stick on there
