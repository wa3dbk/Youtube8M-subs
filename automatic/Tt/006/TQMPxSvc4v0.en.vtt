like<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.460> think<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:49.850> would<00:02:49.970> probably<00:02:50.000> be

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
like that I think that would probably be

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.090 
like that I think that would probably be
pretty<00:02:51.200> tasty<00:02:51.770> too<00:02:53.020> as<00:02:54.020> soon<00:02:54.050> as<00:02:54.380> all<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.860> dry

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
pretty tasty too as soon as all the dry

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
pretty tasty too as soon as all the dry
stuff<00:02:55.340> is<00:02:55.670> wet<00:02:56.120> we<00:02:56.870> are<00:02:57.170> ready<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.850> cook<00:02:58.850> our

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
stuff is wet we are ready to cook our

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.530 
stuff is wet we are ready to cook our

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.870 
like most regular waffles but because
there's<00:04:20.180> chocolate<00:04:20.600> involved<00:04:21.080> I<00:04:21.200> think<00:04:21.880> these

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
there's chocolate involved I think these

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.670 
there's chocolate involved I think these
are<00:04:22.940> way<00:04:23.300> more<00:04:23.330> delicious<00:04:23.690> or<00:04:24.170> if<00:04:24.380> you<00:04:24.500> serve

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
are way more delicious or if you serve

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.620 
are way more delicious or if you serve
them<00:04:24.830> with<00:04:24.980> some<00:04:25.280> fruit<00:04:25.970> like<00:04:26.180> maybe<00:04:26.420> some

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
them with some fruit like maybe some

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.710 
them with some fruit like maybe some
more<00:04:26.720> sliced<00:04:26.990> bananas<00:04:27.410> or<00:04:27.680> some<00:04:28.720> strawberries

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
more sliced bananas or some strawberries
