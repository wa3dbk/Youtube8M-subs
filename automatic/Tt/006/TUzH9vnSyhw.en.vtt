00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
talk a little bit about that well the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.150 
talk a little bit about that well the
swing<00:00:24.689> you've<00:00:24.900> always<00:00:25.019> been<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:25.680> useful

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
swing you've always been really useful

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.920 
swing you've always been really useful
because<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.880> someone's<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.359> popped<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
because if someone's just popped up a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.599 
because if someone's just popped up a
high<00:00:28.080> floater<00:00:28.439> ball<00:00:28.740> especially<00:00:29.130> cuz<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> have

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
high floater ball especially cuz I have

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.189 
high floater ball especially cuz I have
a<00:00:29.640> pretty<00:00:29.820> big<00:00:30.000> first<00:00:30.240> serve<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.990> they

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
a pretty big first serve and they

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.720 
a pretty big first serve and they
usually<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.650> pretty<00:00:31.920> weak<00:00:32.099> return<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
usually have a pretty weak return I

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.370 
usually have a pretty weak return I
don't<00:00:32.969> know<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.570> take<00:00:33.719> time<00:00:34.110> away<00:00:34.140> from

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
don't know I can take time away from

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500 
don't know I can take time away from
them<00:00:34.710> by<00:00:35.219> taking<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> air<00:00:36.300> instead

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
them by taking it out of the air instead

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
them by taking it out of the air instead
of<00:00:36.600> letting<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.930> bounce<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.890> an

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
of letting it bounce so I really have an

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.709 
of letting it bounce so I really have an
offensive<00:00:38.460> advantage<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> shot<00:00:39.360> now

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
offensive advantage with the shot now

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.850 
offensive advantage with the shot now
I've<00:00:39.840> coached<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.260> guy<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.710> well

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I've coached this guy really well

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.920 
I've coached this guy really well
haven't<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.550> that's<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.239> key<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> if

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
haven't I so that's the key is that if

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.450 
haven't I so that's the key is that if
you<00:00:43.050> hit<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> good<00:00:43.440> serve<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> ball<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
you hit a good serve and the ball is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
you hit a good serve and the ball is
popped<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> air<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.989> know<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.260> much

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
popped in the air you know it's much

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.290 
popped in the air you know it's much
more<00:00:46.739> effective<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> confidence<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
more effective to have the confidence to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
more effective to have the confidence to
run<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.140> torque<00:00:49.800> your<00:00:49.950> forehand

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
run it in and just torque your forehand

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.069 
run it in and just torque your forehand
instead<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.180> come<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.629> give<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> little

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
instead of come in and give the little

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.990 
instead of come in and give the little
punch<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:53.010> maybe<00:00:53.399> you've<00:00:53.579> been<00:00:53.760> taught

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
punch that maybe you've been taught

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
punch that maybe you've been taught
before<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.050> don't<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
before because I don't know about you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.350 
before because I don't know about you
but<00:00:56.070> I've<00:00:56.340> been<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.520> situations<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.239> I've

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
but I've been in situations where I've

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.790 
but I've been in situations where I've
run<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.870> I've<00:00:57.930> done<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.289> little<00:00:58.440> punch

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
run in and I've done that little punch

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.400 
run in and I've done that little punch
and<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.640> very<00:00:59.910> difficult<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.809> put<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> ball

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and it's very difficult to put the ball

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
and it's very difficult to put the ball
away<00:01:01.440> sometimes<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.760> max<00:01:03.000> has<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.390> right

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
away sometimes so so max has that right

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.719 
away sometimes so so max has that right
off<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.989> serve<00:01:04.290> off<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> big<00:01:05.100> forehand<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
off of a serve off of a big forehand the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.640 
off of a serve off of a big forehand the
ball<00:01:05.909> floats<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.570> air<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.439> want<00:01:07.619> to

now<00:01:21.119> let's<00:01:21.689> talk<00:01:21.900> about<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.320> hands<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> some

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
now let's talk about the hands and some

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.649 
now let's talk about the hands and some
of<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.610> techniques<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.509> about

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
of the techniques that you think about

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.570 
of the techniques that you think about
running<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.320> ball<00:01:25.500> yeah<00:01:26.220> well<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
running up to that ball yeah well one of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
running up to that ball yeah well one of
the<00:01:26.700> main<00:01:26.880> things<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.840> tennis<00:01:28.229> shots

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the main things as with all tennis shots

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.319 
the main things as with all tennis shots
is<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> finish<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.400> making<00:01:29.790> sure<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> you

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
is to finish just making sure that you

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.609 
is to finish just making sure that you
get<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> racket<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.049> where<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.290> needs<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.530> be

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
get the racket to where it needs to be

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.590 
get the racket to where it needs to be
at<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> end<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> shot<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.670> then

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
at the end of the shot and then

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.569 
at the end of the shot and then
obviously<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.890> making<00:01:35.250> sure<00:01:35.400> you're

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
obviously just making sure you're

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
obviously just making sure you're
relaxed<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.720> that's<00:01:36.930> number<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.439> in

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
relaxed because that's number one in

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.920 
relaxed because that's number one in
tennis<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.509> video<00:01:39.780> we're

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930

tennis right so so in this video we're
not<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> talk<00:01:40.409> about<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.220> buggy<00:01:41.430> whip

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
not going to talk about the buggy whip

finish on the swinging volley that's
going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.200> maybe<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.680> another<00:01:43.950> lesson

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
going to be maybe for another lesson

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.160 
going to be maybe for another lesson
because<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:45.119> got<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> make<00:01:45.509> sure<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
guys are learning one tip at a time and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.440 
guys are learning one tip at a time and
so<00:01:48.890> max<00:01:49.890> talked<00:01:50.310> about<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> finish<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
so max talked about the finish and I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.429 
so max talked about the finish and I
want<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> little<00:01:51.990> demonstration

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
want to just do a little demonstration

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.319 
want to just do a little demonstration
for<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.100> right<00:01:53.280> now<00:01:53.310> basically<00:01:54.000> what

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
for that right now basically what

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.060 
for that right now basically what
happens<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> swinging<00:01:55.560> volley<00:01:55.710> it's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
happens on the swinging volley it's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
happens on the swinging volley it's
looks<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.759> ground<00:01:57.090> stroke<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:58.079> most

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
looks like a ground stroke but most

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.109 
looks like a ground stroke but most
likely<00:01:58.950> when<00:01:59.340> you're<00:01:59.460> coming<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.909> you're

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
likely when you're coming up you're

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.310 
likely when you're coming up you're
going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> hit<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.780> an<00:02:00.930> approach<00:02:01.290> shot

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
going to hit it like an approach shot

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.980 
going to hit it like an approach shot
and<00:02:01.770> when<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.490> swing<00:02:02.850> if<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> Western

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and when you swing if you have a Western

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.230 
and when you swing if you have a Western
grip<00:02:04.290> or<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> strong<00:02:05.130> semi<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.850> should<00:02:06.060> say<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
grip or a strong semi I should say a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.540 
grip or a strong semi I should say a
semi-western<00:02:06.810> grip<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.380> strong<00:02:07.979> semi-western

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
semi-western grip or strong semi-western

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.630 
semi-western grip or strong semi-western
grip<00:02:08.989> like<00:02:09.989> Djokovic<00:02:10.500> when<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.129> turn<00:02:11.430> your

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
grip like Djokovic when you turn your

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.450 
grip like Djokovic when you turn your
hand<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.090> wrap

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
hand that wrap

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.820 
hand that wrap
it<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:12.760> going<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:12.970> turn<00:02:13.210> over<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.440> I

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
it is going to turn over like this and I

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.280 
it is going to turn over like this and I
like<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.430> people<00:02:15.760> catch<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.240> racket<00:02:16.690> in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
like to have people catch the racket in

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.590 
like to have people catch the racket in
the<00:02:17.530> throat<00:02:17.830> like<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.610> you'll<00:02:19.330> notice

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
the throat like this and you'll notice

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.660 
the throat like this and you'll notice
that<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.130> gives<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.460> nice

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
that this just gives you a nice

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.030 
that this just gives you a nice
reference<00:02:21.910> point<00:02:22.390> if<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.600> look<00:02:22.780> at<00:02:23.040> Djokovic

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
reference point if you look at Djokovic

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.320 
reference point if you look at Djokovic
you<00:02:24.220> know<00:02:24.310> he's<00:02:24.490> going<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.730> swing<00:02:25.030> like<00:02:25.300> this

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
you know he's going to swing like this

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.630 
you know he's going to swing like this
on<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.200> it's<00:02:27.070> going<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.280> look<00:02:27.370> something

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
on it and it's going to look something

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.250 
on it and it's going to look something
like<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.360> people<00:02:28.780> catch<00:02:29.020> it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
like this I just have people catch it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.900 
like this I just have people catch it
because<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.530> find<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.040> helps<00:02:30.250> people<00:02:30.550> relax

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
because I find it helps people relax

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.820 
because I find it helps people relax
their<00:02:31.210> hand<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.810> gives<00:02:32.230> them<00:02:32.380> an<00:02:32.530> endpoint

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
their hand and it gives them an endpoint

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.100 
their hand and it gives them an endpoint
so<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.160> would<00:02:33.340> recommend<00:02:33.520> working<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.570> catching

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
so I would recommend working on catching

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.870 
so I would recommend working on catching
the<00:02:35.200> racket<00:02:35.650> you'll<00:02:36.010> notice<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.610> when<00:02:36.790> you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
the racket you'll notice that when you

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.750 
the racket you'll notice that when you
turn<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.360> hand<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:38.020> thumb<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.770> top<00:02:39.190> right

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
turn the hand the thumb is on top right

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.760 
turn the hand the thumb is on top right
here<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.270> very<00:02:40.390> important<00:02:40.960> distinction

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
here it's a very important distinction

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.830 
here it's a very important distinction
there<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.250> not<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:43.000> not<00:02:43.240> like<00:02:43.300> this

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
there it's not it's not like this

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.630 
there it's not it's not like this
because<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.530> would<00:02:44.680> be<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.800> flatter<00:02:45.160> swing

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
because this would be a flatter swing

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.580 
because this would be a flatter swing
okay<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.510> you're<00:02:46.720> going<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.870> turn<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.290> hand

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
okay so you're going to turn that hand

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.410 
okay so you're going to turn that hand
the<00:02:47.740> thumb<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.250> top<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.970> you'll<00:02:49.060> see<00:02:49.270> my

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the thumb is on top and you'll see my

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.870 
the thumb is on top and you'll see my

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
not catching it in my whole hand so this

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.570 
not catching it in my whole hand so this
is<00:02:56.050> going<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.230> help<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.770> get<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.040> ball<00:02:57.160> up<00:02:57.370> and

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
is going to help you get the ball up and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.280 
is going to help you get the ball up and
down<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.240> talked<00:02:58.450> about<00:02:58.600> aiming<00:02:59.080> just

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
down and we talked about aiming just

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.260 
down and we talked about aiming just
past<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.680> service<00:03:00.070> line<00:03:00.250> because<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.240> a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
past the service line because this is a

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.970 
past the service line because this is a
ball<00:03:01.510> where<00:03:01.750> if<00:03:01.900> you're<00:03:02.050> moving<00:03:02.260> up<00:03:02.620> you're

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
ball where if you're moving up you're

ball where if you're moving up you're
going<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.160> have<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.280> lot<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.670> momentum<00:03:03.970> and

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
going to have a lot of momentum and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.420 
going to have a lot of momentum and
there's<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.900> tendency<00:03:05.200> for<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:05.740> ball<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.100> fly

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
there's a tendency for that ball to fly

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.280 
there's a tendency for that ball to fly
or<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.820> shoot<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.630> want<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.840> make<00:03:08.020> sure

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
or to shoot so you want to make sure

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.260 
or to shoot so you want to make sure
that<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.620> aim<00:03:08.770> for<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:09.070> service<00:03:09.460> line<00:03:09.670> at<00:03:10.120> the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
that you aim for the service line at the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.030 
that you aim for the service line at the
same<00:03:10.510> time<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:11.080> want<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.260> get<00:03:11.350> under<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:11.830> ball

so that you don't hit it in the net

if you're not relaxed sometimes that

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.050 
if you're not relaxed sometimes that
ball<00:03:17.320> can<00:03:17.890> dump<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.400> net<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.790> want<00:03:19.000> to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
ball can dump in the net so you want to

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.910 
ball can dump in the net so you want to

make sure you get under the ball turn
that<00:03:21.160> hand<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:21.820> kind<00:03:22.330> of<00:03:22.450> create<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.810> arc<00:03:23.110> on

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440

that hand and kind of create that arc on
your<00:03:23.770> shot<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.790> think<00:03:25.000> also<00:03:25.180> max<00:03:25.570> will

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
your shot and I think also max will

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.300 
your shot and I think also max will
agree<00:03:25.990> with<00:03:26.080> me<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.860> don't<00:03:26.920> want<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.190> try

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
agree with me that you don't want to try

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.730 
agree with me that you don't want to try
to<00:03:27.370> hit<00:03:27.520> this<00:03:27.700> ball<00:03:28.000> Mach<00:03:28.450> 10<00:03:28.810> it's<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.500> very

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
to hit this ball Mach 10 it's a very

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.470 
to hit this ball Mach 10 it's a very
smooth<00:03:30.130> shot<00:03:30.430> because<00:03:30.640> if<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:30.940> time<00:03:31.270> it<00:03:31.450> right

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
smooth shot because if you time it right

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.090 
smooth shot because if you time it right
with<00:03:31.840> your<00:03:31.960> footwork<00:03:32.230> you're<00:03:32.800> going<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:32.980> get

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
with your footwork you're going to get

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.210 
with your footwork you're going to get
plenty<00:03:33.580> of<00:03:33.760> power<00:03:34.000> on<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.420> shot<00:03:35.010> now<00:03:36.010> if<00:03:36.130> you

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
plenty of power on the shot now if you

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.370 
plenty of power on the shot now if you
have<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> grip<00:03:36.700> that's<00:03:36.850> more<00:03:37.090> like<00:03:37.300> Federer<00:03:38.170> or

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
have a grip that's more like Federer or

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.780 
have a grip that's more like Federer or
if<00:03:38.530> you're<00:03:38.650> more<00:03:38.830> in<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.040> Continental<00:03:39.610> world

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
if you're more in the Continental world

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.400 
if you're more in the Continental world
I<00:03:39.970> think<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.450> can<00:03:40.690> still<00:03:40.900> well<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.170> know<00:03:41.260> you

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
I think you can still well I know you

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.020 
I think you can still well I know you
can<00:03:41.650> still<00:03:41.830> hit<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.040> swinging<00:03:42.370> volley<00:03:42.490> let's

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
can still hit a swinging volley let's

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.000 
can still hit a swinging volley let's
assume<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.450> you're<00:03:43.720> more<00:03:43.900> Eastern<00:03:44.440> when<00:03:44.890> you

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
assume that you're more Eastern when you

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.280 
assume that you're more Eastern when you
come<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.490> and<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:45.760> finish<00:03:46.210> that<00:03:46.690> racket<00:03:47.020> is

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
come in and you finish that racket is

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.810 
come in and you finish that racket is
going<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.530> kind<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.800> lay<00:03:47.980> flat<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.400> this

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
going to kind of lay flat like this

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.270 
going to kind of lay flat like this
guy's<00:03:49.090> like<00:03:49.300> Gael<00:03:49.540> Monfils<00:03:50.050> Roger<00:03:50.800> Federer

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
guy's like Gael Monfils Roger Federer

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.740 
guy's like Gael Monfils Roger Federer
you're<00:03:51.430> going<00:03:51.550> to<00:03:51.610> see<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.820> finish<00:03:52.240> like<00:03:52.450> this

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
you're going to see a finish like this

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.080 
you're going to see a finish like this
because<00:03:53.500> it's<00:03:53.650> just<00:03:53.860> dependent<00:03:54.490> on<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.640> grip

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
because it's just dependent on the grip

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.030 
because it's just dependent on the grip
as<00:03:55.450> soon<00:03:55.600> as<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.810> move<00:03:56.080> my<00:03:56.110> hand<00:03:56.620> towards<00:03:56.980> the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
as soon as I move my hand towards the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.610 
as soon as I move my hand towards the
semi<00:03:57.400> or<00:03:57.880> strong<00:03:58.360> semi-western<00:03:58.960> then<00:03:59.260> my<00:03:59.380> hand

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
semi or strong semi-western then my hand

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.200 
semi or strong semi-western then my hand
is<00:03:59.680> going<00:03:59.800> to<00:03:59.860> turn<00:04:00.130> more<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:00.880> it's<00:04:01.000> really

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
is going to turn more so it's really

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.790 
is going to turn more so it's really
grip<00:04:01.570> dependent<00:04:02.020> so<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.200> doesn't<00:04:02.470> matter<00:04:02.620> if

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
grip dependent so it doesn't matter if

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.560 
grip dependent so it doesn't matter if
you<00:04:02.920> have<00:04:03.040> an<00:04:03.160> Eastern<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:03.820> you<00:04:04.120> finish<00:04:04.390> like

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
you have an Eastern and you finish like

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.180 
you have an Eastern and you finish like
this<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:05.050> little<00:04:05.380> bit<00:04:05.560> lower<00:04:05.770> and<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.040> just

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
this a little bit lower and you just

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.520 
this a little bit lower and you just
kind<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.430> cover<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.030> ball<00:04:07.240> like<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.480> or<00:04:07.900> if

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
kind of cover the ball like that or if

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.230 
kind of cover the ball like that or if
you've<00:04:08.650> got<00:04:08.830> that<00:04:08.950> strong<00:04:09.340> semi-western

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
you've got that strong semi-western

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.720 
you've got that strong semi-western
and<00:04:10.390> your<00:04:10.840> hand<00:04:11.140> turns<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.680> Max's<00:04:12.340> case<00:04:12.580> he

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
and your hand turns and Max's case he

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
me is making sure I try and face the net

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.550 
me is making sure I try and face the net
and<00:04:37.820> keep<00:04:38.120> my<00:04:38.270> hands<00:04:38.600> out<00:04:38.690> in<00:04:38.750> front<00:04:38.900> here<00:04:39.380> when

I go and get the ball because if it

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.750 
I go and get the ball because if it
drops<00:04:41.690> down<00:04:41.810> here<00:04:42.440> or<00:04:42.620> I'm<00:04:42.770> too<00:04:43.040> sideways<00:04:43.520> then

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
drops down here or I'm too sideways then

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.189 
drops down here or I'm too sideways then
I<00:04:43.820> have<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:43.970> tendency<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.449> lose<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:45.050> ball

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
that's coming towards me and then I

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.370 
that's coming towards me and then I
thought<00:04:47.030> of<00:04:47.060> miss<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:47.570> curve<00:04:47.780> right<00:04:47.990> so

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
thought of miss it's a curve right so

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.290 
thought of miss it's a curve right so

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
focusing on finding the ball basically

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.520

or<00:05:07.729> stalking<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.600> ball<00:05:08.780> with<00:05:08.990> your<00:05:09.110> racquet

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
or stalking the ball with your racquet

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.379 
or stalking the ball with your racquet
in<00:05:09.650> your<00:05:09.770> hand<00:05:10.070> because<00:05:10.400> if<00:05:10.699> you<00:05:11.150> turn

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
in your hand because if you turn

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.810 
in your hand because if you turn
sideways<00:05:12.020> then<00:05:12.650> your<00:05:12.830> head<00:05:13.039> is<00:05:13.220> sideways<00:05:13.460> you

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
sideways then your head is sideways you

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.980 
sideways then your head is sideways you
can't<00:05:14.000> really<00:05:14.210> pick<00:05:14.360> up<00:05:14.479> the<00:05:14.570> ball<00:05:14.780> your

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
can't really pick up the ball your

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.990 
can't really pick up the ball your
racquets<00:05:15.440> back<00:05:15.620> here<00:05:15.979> or<00:05:16.280> your<00:05:16.460> racquets<00:05:16.820> back

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
racquets back here or your racquets back

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.850 
racquets back here or your racquets back
here<00:05:17.270> so<00:05:17.600> you<00:05:17.630> can<00:05:17.780> really<00:05:17.930> track<00:05:18.380> that<00:05:18.620> ball

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
here so you can really track that ball

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.310 
here so you can really track that ball
as<00:05:19.130> you're<00:05:19.280> running<00:05:19.400> up<00:05:19.699> to<00:05:19.729> it<00:05:19.970> also<00:05:20.180> you<00:05:21.139> can
