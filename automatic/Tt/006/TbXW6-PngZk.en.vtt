00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
jumper it's hard to see using this

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.340 
jumper it's hard to see using this
camera<00:01:17.140> but<00:01:17.620> there<00:01:18.190> is<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.550> there's<00:01:19.390> two<00:01:19.570> little

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
camera but there is a there's two little

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.330 
camera but there is a there's two little
nodes<00:01:20.790> down<00:01:21.790> in<00:01:22.090> there<00:01:22.300> right<00:01:22.810> below<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.860> it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
nodes down in there right below and it's

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.640 
nodes down in there right below and it's
me<00:01:24.910> just<00:01:25.180> remove<00:01:25.450> my<00:01:25.660> wide<00:01:25.870> angle<00:01:25.900> maybe<00:01:26.440> you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
me just remove my wide angle maybe you

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.160 
me just remove my wide angle maybe you
can<00:01:26.800> pick<00:01:26.980> it<00:01:27.040> up<00:01:27.250> now<00:01:27.540> yeah<00:01:28.540> you're<00:01:28.870> not<00:01:28.990> going

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
can pick it up now yeah you're not going

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.100 
can pick it up now yeah you're not going
to<00:01:29.260> be<00:01:29.350> able<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.560> see<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:30.540> anyhow<00:01:31.540> I'll<00:01:31.840> point

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
to be able to see it anyhow I'll point

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.620 
to be able to see it anyhow I'll point
to<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.500> so<00:01:32.800> you<00:01:32.890> can<00:01:33.130> kind<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.430> get<00:01:33.850> grasp<00:01:34.240> what

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
to it so you can kind of get grasp what

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.950 
to it so you can kind of get grasp what
they<00:01:34.780> look<00:01:35.020> like<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:36.460> is<00:01:36.760> too<00:01:37.660> little

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
they look like there is too little

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.830 
they look like there is too little
jumpers<00:01:38.710> right<00:01:39.010> there<00:01:39.460> two<00:01:40.180> little<00:01:40.420> pieces<00:01:40.600> of

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
jumpers right there two little pieces of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.290 
jumpers right there two little pieces of
