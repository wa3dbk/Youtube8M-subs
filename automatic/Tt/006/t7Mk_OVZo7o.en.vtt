00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
the little bolt right here that goes

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.180 
the little bolt right here that goes
right<00:02:12.340> there<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.910> center

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and you just thread that out and then

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.340 
and you just thread that out and then
just<00:02:17.190> pull<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.640> bulkhead<00:02:18.060> fitting<00:02:18.360> right<00:02:19.200> off
