00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.750
 Well now I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.850
 Remove the sound from the camera from 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.790
 any blackberry 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.080
 without using any one applies a 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.700
 application install anything 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.840
 well let's go to the 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.030
 what has to be done in summary is 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.410
 that we have to make a call to 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.050
 our service center 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.150
 to the customer of the telephone company of 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.210
 which we subscribe to do 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.730
 this because the sound of the camera 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.050
 thanks is no longer that you would be acting 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.199
 through the microphone 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.900
 mauricio de spa in front normal but that 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.360
 would be using the speaker the micro 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.780
 which is included within the call 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.550
 gum then when we take a photo 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.230
 the sound of the camera would not sound 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.780
 externally but it would sound as if 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.399
 this is for the headset itself so 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.710
 that we would be listening to my call 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.350
 so by doing that the only thing that 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.680
 we do is we're going to connect up 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.680
 make the calls 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:22.150

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.920
 I go to the camera screen I live in 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.950
 this moment is connected to the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.050

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.050

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.880

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.450
 and we're in the camera option and we're going 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.690
 to proceed to take a picture and listen 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.690

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.210

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.789
 we can say lower is that you 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.390

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.390
