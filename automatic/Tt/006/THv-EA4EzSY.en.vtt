00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
be able to see me playing at the same

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.499 
be able to see me playing at the same
time<00:00:11.429> as<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.550> see<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.820> screen<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.389> think

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
time as you see the screen so I think

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.999 
time as you see the screen so I think
that's<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.780> only<00:00:13.080> way<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.259> really<00:00:13.530> show<00:00:13.769> how

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
that's the only way to really show how

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.080 
that's the only way to really show how
things<00:00:14.280> work<00:00:14.519> with<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> Kinect<00:00:16.970> let's<00:00:17.970> just

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
things work with the Kinect let's just

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.540 
things work with the Kinect let's just
jump<00:00:18.240> right<00:00:18.330> into<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.400> right

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
jump right into it so what we have right

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.099 
jump right into it so what we have right
here<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.910> pause<00:00:21.090> maybe<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> played<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> couple

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
here is to pause maybe I played a couple

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.259 
here is to pause maybe I played a couple
times<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.560> kind<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.859> try<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.160> get<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
times just to kind of try to get it to a

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.450 
times just to kind of try to get it to a
handle<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> controls<00:00:25.310> didn't<00:00:26.310> really

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
handle on the controls didn't really

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519
