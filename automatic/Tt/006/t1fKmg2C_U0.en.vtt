00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
because that's the way I was last

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.080 
because that's the way I was last
positioned<00:03:05.440> with<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.310> special<00:03:06.700> dance<00:03:06.819> move

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
positioned with the special dance move

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.809 
positioned with the special dance move
and<00:03:07.349> now<00:03:08.349> I'm<00:03:08.650> actually<00:03:08.799> riding<00:03:09.159> on<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.640> wing

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
and now I'm actually riding on the wing

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.910 
and now I'm actually riding on the wing
or<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.390> head<00:03:10.569> of<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.840> pterodactyl<00:03:11.500> now<00:03:11.650> this

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
or the head of the pterodactyl now this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.910 
or the head of the pterodactyl now this
I<00:03:12.569> think<00:03:13.569> is<00:03:13.870> very<00:03:13.930> cool<00:03:14.290> just<00:03:15.220> because<00:03:16.920> it's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
I think is very cool just because it's

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.520 
I think is very cool just because it's
it's<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.730> glitch<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:19.690> haven't<00:03:20.349> really

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
it's a glitch that I haven't really

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.949 
it's a glitch that I haven't really
noticed<00:03:20.560> before<00:03:20.889> and<00:03:21.310> hopefully<00:03:22.060> it'll<00:03:22.780> be

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
noticed before and hopefully it'll be

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.460 
noticed before and hopefully it'll be
done<00:03:23.170> during<00:03:23.500> all<00:03:23.889> of<00:03:23.920> these<00:03:24.159> updates<00:03:25.000> that
