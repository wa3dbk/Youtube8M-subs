in<00:01:24.550> this<00:01:24.729> window<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:27.100> have<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.670> slideshow

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
in this window and we have a slideshow

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.050 
in this window and we have a slideshow
going<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.720> with<00:01:29.229> pictures<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:29.890> images<00:01:30.430> on

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
going on with pictures and images on

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.660 
going on with pictures and images on
this<00:01:31.270> window<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.680> if<00:01:32.770> we<00:01:32.830> bring<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.220> movie<00:01:33.520> up

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
this window so if we bring the movie up

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.540 
this window so if we bring the movie up
it<00:01:34.240> will<00:01:34.540> be<00:01:34.740> completely<00:01:35.740> smooth<00:01:36.130> there's<00:01:36.400> not

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
it will be completely smooth there's not

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.890 
it will be completely smooth there's not
going<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.700> be<00:01:36.760> any<00:01:36.910> drop<00:01:37.119> frames<00:01:37.390> right<00:01:37.690> that's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
going to be any drop frames right that's

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.660 
going to be any drop frames right that's
right<00:01:38.110> so<00:01:38.440> we're<00:01:38.770> going<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.100> bring<00:01:39.280> up<00:01:39.490> the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
right so we're going to bring up the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
right so we're going to bring up the
movie

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
movie

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.250 
movie
and<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:41.290> can<00:01:41.470> see<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.920> framerate<00:01:42.910> is<00:01:43.630> 24

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
and you can see that the framerate is 24

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.070 
and you can see that the framerate is 24
frames<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.430> keeps<00:01:45.640> up<00:01:45.820> with<00:01:46.330> all<00:01:46.660> of<00:01:46.720> the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
frames and it keeps up with all of the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.520 
frames and it keeps up with all of the
material<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:48.630> has<00:01:49.630> gone<00:01:49.870> into<00:01:49.930> making<00:01:50.170> the
