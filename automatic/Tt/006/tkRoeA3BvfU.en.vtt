00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.020
 always serves the kids who speak to you today 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:13.300
 to mister karachi and this is another 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:16.330
 battle the narrow 2 total war as the 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.699
 last machine and that I did 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.250
 see this also some time ago 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.590
 battle was recorded live and 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.769
 then the comment I 'm making now is 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.689
 obviously the reason for this was postponed 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.730
 what is too long and complex 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.760
 a few words complicated the creative though 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.649
 you make me play a little wet but it doesn't matter 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:42.370
 no matter let's concentrate on the confrontation 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.500
 roosters or better trees against Romans already 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.760
 the from the title of the battle does 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.610
 really really scared 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.250
 my army practically formed with 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.890
 all the armies that smiley rom 2 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.079
 all heavy infantry heart a little 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.949
 lancers four units of knights of a 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.989
 and in general on horseback while for 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.660
 as for the Romans then the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.659
 training a little more wrong though 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.820
 four units of and shooters I want 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.740
 immediately provide immediately 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 out because so after no less per year 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.229
 between the boxes and to tell the truth the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.670
 tactics he is using mine 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.009
 opponent is a bit strange because 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.360
 start before pulled forward too much 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.430
 forward armed with archers and then like 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.369
 support we see that has pulled ahead 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.810
 two fingers say short and clean of 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.070
 cavalry then others of units of 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.079
 cavalry on the right than now 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.240
 are coming and while the whole 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.460
 infantry and back, in short, we see that 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.250
 maybe he also planned and maybe a 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.150
 to the first experiences with the days 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.890
 from 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.950
 I therefore take advantage of it because I have fallen 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.870
 I remember you bastard rats inside you 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.810
 i make out 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.790
 and the unity of archers they were 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.010
 practically protected from any other 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.400
 what if i make it out 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.510
 also the cavalry units 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.400
 as for the unit of 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.960
 cavalry and I also use the units of 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.390
 spearmen who are always useful for 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.040
 these nonsense here and in the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.460
 Meanwhile the whole ok had arrived 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.120
 how much mine and infantry and I amazed 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.910
 more than an amazing substance 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.070
 I find myself practically with the sun 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.470
 half enemy army against all 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.330
 my army which is practically one 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.830
 ideal situation because doing so 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.870
 here in the meantime we see that during the 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.760
 battles easily to you because so 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.640
 doing practically you can kill 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.430
 much of the enemy units and without 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.080
 no effort the 6 Roman opponents 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.840
 they had also pulled forward their own 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.140
 infantry units before that 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.680
 they are doing maybe things would be 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.420
 however, everything could have gone differently 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.820
 added up I could complain and 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.410
 then it goes well of course regardless of 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.610
 how things are going regardless 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.030
 from my criticisms that I am always 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.709
 stupid i am really thank you 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.290
 all of my adversaries that I am 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.150
 there are also many people online 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.800
 free I recognize myself when I see they see 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.690
 clear you turn of chrome second of 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.940
 youtube will help youtube 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.010
 because if they tell me so on 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.050
 I'm really scared you don't owe me 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.170
 I'm not recognize if Venetian carat 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.560
 it's not me no I'm not ok but apart 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.870
 this shows who is advancing the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.810
 sixth advance is advancing a little 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.370
 Roman infantry and groups 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.390
 I therefore cannot to prepare myself for 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.010
 make the party 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.099
 what left me a little 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.470
 puzzled during the confrontation is that the 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.420
 infantry and human anemic and advanced 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.790
 first on one side because probably 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.260
 here was the cavalry 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.450
 Roman who has some difficulty than that 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.250
 he wanted to give him a hand 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.640
 and while another part began 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.060
 to advance a little so in layers to one to the 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.790
 time 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.519
 in short, after a poor man, even mine 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.500
 opponent I would have been terribly upset 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.720
 sorry a mess in any case to say 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.590
 surely the hotels are 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.530
 really or climate woman if I love them already 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.930
 he heard the name of instrument in the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.500
 I do off what I'm doing is 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.299
 practically with my cavalry ok 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.970
 surrounds enemy on one side 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.039
 and then the other for venues behind 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.039
 these are also quite obvious things 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.740
 obvious will send charge to the office too 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.860
 my general because I was hoping by now 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.240
 in fact, I was looking for, I wanted to conclude 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.460
 the battle the fastest 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.539
 possible for those who are black even a little 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.320
 stew and it forms a little this pit 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.789
 of people sowing to the right and to 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.099
 lacking that in short it is also a thing 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.680
 quite and sad 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.820
 in some respects but that we do not 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.490
 it matters 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.450
 we say that in these moments of the 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.639
 battle spas 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.740
 it's not that there's a lot of strategy 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.979
 the only thing I can do is continue 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.169
 to collect and load with mine 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.710
 cavalry although it must be said that 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.669
 when it is it is hiring the goat is 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.050
 really very dangerous flaw 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.599
 disengage and then load it 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.689
 because already a lowering of morale 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.189
 really monstrous in q2 it happened that 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.279
 all the units that were engaged 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:24.770
 fighting practically died 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.960
 then hit while the unit survives 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.930
 they could then retreat to load 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.659
 now you don't need to see if this is there 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.389
 what on the Roma 2 is never probable and is 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:38.270
 really a disastrous thing if you do 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.099
 but if you are ahead you can do it 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.590
 without any problem also because 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.300
 I am now loading the unit of the 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.370
 general I made it out without too many 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.069
 problems and I really feel like a child 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.289
 of the woman even if it is not true 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:54.469
 now where the battle has very little to 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:58.249
 say they are few Roman units still in 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:59.960
 around the 80 horses and so it seems to me all 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:03.259
 however, there are no infantry units 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.669
 I would swear and lido equipped with lancers who 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.360
 definitely always convenient 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.969
 and oh well I say what I can say is 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.740
 was a battalion but I am sorry 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.409
 for the guy who played against 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.840
 me that poor one will have been to the first ones 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:20.889
 arms but I really want them 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.889
 so much good 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.250
 and with this guys if you haven't 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.440
 done I remember to subscribe to mine 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.400
 facebook page or my google page 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.400
 plus 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.130
 now I greet you that I must go to 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.180
 prepare the next wood for i 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.180
 cursed Romans
