whatever<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.940> augmented<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.930> don't<00:00:37.260> know

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
whatever this is augmented I don't know

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.140 
whatever this is augmented I don't know
what<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:38.360> together

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
what it is together

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.370 
what it is together
and<00:00:41.300> then<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.110> verse<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:42.890> just<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:44.380> same

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
and then the verse is just the same

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.230 
and then the verse is just the same
thing<00:00:45.440> I<00:00:46.040> play<00:00:46.310> like<00:00:46.490> this<00:00:46.730> I<00:00:46.940> don't<00:00:47.000> know<00:00:47.150> if

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
thing I play like this I don't know if

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.090 
thing I play like this I don't know if
that's<00:00:47.390> right<00:00:48.100> Trenton<00:00:49.100> Road<00:00:49.370> ice<00:00:50.710> then<00:00:51.710> G

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
that's right Trenton Road ice then G

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.760 
that's right Trenton Road ice then G
with<00:00:52.400> a<00:00:52.430> D<00:00:52.670> minor

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.299 

and<00:00:57.219> an<00:00:57.340> F

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and an F

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.540 
and an F
and<00:01:00.309> you<00:01:00.399> do<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.700> couple<00:01:00.760> times<00:01:01.059> and<00:01:01.570> then

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and you do that a couple times and then

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.540 
and you do that a couple times and then
for<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.610> last<00:01:03.850> one<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.390> just<00:01:04.570> goes<00:01:05.250> down<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.520> a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
for the last one it just goes down to a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.420 
for the last one it just goes down to a
D<00:01:06.880> with<00:01:07.270> an<00:01:07.420> F<00:01:07.600> so<00:01:08.290> I<00:01:08.350> guess<00:01:08.650> that's<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.979> D<00:01:09.159> minor

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
D with an F so I guess that's a D minor

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.010 
D with an F so I guess that's a D minor
so<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.940> G<00:01:13.210> with<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.750> D<00:01:13.900> minor

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so and then the G with the D minor

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:33.539 
so and then the G with the D minor
Oh

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.310 

so<00:01:34.549> that's<00:01:34.729> just<00:01:34.850> be<00:01:37.150> what<00:01:38.150> that<00:01:38.330> is<00:01:38.510> either<00:01:38.659> be

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
so that's just be what that is either be

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.910 
so that's just be what that is either be
de<00:01:39.890> f<00:01:40.190> I<00:01:41.170> think<00:01:42.170> that's<00:01:42.350> what<00:01:42.530> they're<00:01:42.619> playing

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
de f I think that's what they're playing

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.219 
de f I think that's what they're playing
and<00:01:43.250> then<00:01:43.790> for<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.150> course<00:01:44.420> it's<00:01:44.690> just<00:01:44.750> quit

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
and then for the course it's just quit

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.310 
and then for the course it's just quit
breaking<00:01:46.130> my<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.820> then<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.540> do<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.690> sea<00:01:48.020> bass

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
breaking my and then you do a sea bass

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.410 
breaking my and then you do a sea bass
with<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.800> B<00:01:49.100> flat<00:01:49.550> chord

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.540 

just<00:01:56.200> back<00:01:56.380> into<00:01:56.710> what<00:01:56.830> their<00:01:57.010> plan<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.460> the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
just back into what their plan of the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.179 
just back into what their plan of the
purses

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:12.900 

be<00:02:04.189> in<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.460> cord<00:02:04.729> with<00:02:04.909> an<00:02:05.000> F

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.140 

you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.640 

and<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.300> sack<00:02:23.540> cell<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.050> just<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.410> same

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
and the sack cell is just the same

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.030 
and the sack cell is just the same
chords<00:02:25.190> there<00:02:25.900> um<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.020> think<00:02:27.530> that's<00:02:27.680> about<00:02:27.890> it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
chords there um I think that's about it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.550 
chords there um I think that's about it
except<00:02:28.550> for<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:28.760> one<00:02:29.060> little<00:02:29.290> break<00:02:30.290> part

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
except for that one little break part

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.380 
except for that one little break part
which<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:30.860> something<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:31.340> lean<00:02:32.030> out<00:02:32.180> there

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
which is something like lean out there

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:52.170 
which is something like lean out there
playing<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:37.450> where<00:02:38.450> they<00:02:38.630> play

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.600 

no<00:02:53.519> dink<00:02:54.519> t2<00:02:55.409> then<00:02:56.409> that<00:02:56.620> one<00:02:56.860> part<00:02:57.159> is<00:02:57.340> what<00:02:57.519> is

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
no dink t2 then that one part is what is

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.940 
no dink t2 then that one part is what is
that

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.809 

you

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
you

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.300 
you
you

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.500 

all<00:03:12.310> right<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.550> guess<00:03:12.880> that's<00:03:13.090> about<00:03:13.180> all<00:03:13.330> I

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
all right I guess that's about all I

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.770 
all right I guess that's about all I
know<00:03:13.540> hope<00:03:14.319> that<00:03:14.500> helps
