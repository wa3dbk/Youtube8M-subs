few things one is we're going to need
the<00:00:28.820> appropriate<00:00:29.060> Allen<00:00:29.599> wrenches<00:00:29.930> we<00:00:30.320> have

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
the appropriate Allen wrenches we have

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.080 
the appropriate Allen wrenches we have
this<00:00:30.590> one<00:00:30.830> here<00:00:31.099> that<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:31.400> use<00:00:31.430> for<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:31.849> truss

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
this one here that we use for the truss

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.750 
this one here that we use for the truss
rod<00:00:32.710> then<00:00:33.710> we<00:00:33.800> have<00:00:33.950> this<00:00:34.100> one<00:00:34.340> that<00:00:34.520> we<00:00:34.610> use

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
rod then we have this one that we use

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.189 
rod then we have this one that we use
for<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.180> saddle<00:00:35.870> height<00:00:36.620> adjustment<00:00:37.280> screws

for the saddle height adjustment screws
and<00:00:39.199> then<00:00:39.440> we<00:00:39.590> have<00:00:39.769> nut<00:00:40.580> files<00:00:40.850> of<00:00:41.090> the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
and then we have nut files of the

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.910 
and then we have nut files of the
appropriate<00:00:41.750> gauges<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:42.260> these<00:00:42.350> are<00:00:42.530> used<00:00:42.710> to

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
appropriate gauges and these are used to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.910 
appropriate gauges and these are used to
slide<00:00:43.190> out<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:44.110> string<00:00:45.110> slots<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.739> nut

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.430 
slide out the string slots and the nut
to<00:00:45.949> adjust<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.610> action<00:00:46.940> at<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.090> nut<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.690> we

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
to adjust the action at the nut and we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.310 
to adjust the action at the nut and we
also<00:00:48.620> need<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.330> capo<00:00:50.330> to<00:00:50.690> hold<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.050> strings

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
also need a capo to hold the strings

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.590 
also need a capo to hold the strings
forth<00:00:51.589> so<00:00:51.860> that<00:00:52.070> we<00:00:52.220> can<00:00:52.430> make<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.120> truss<00:00:53.360> rod

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
forth so that we can make the truss rod

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.880 
forth so that we can make the truss rod
adjustment<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:54.640> we<00:00:55.640> need<00:00:55.909> a<00:00:56.379> feeler<00:00:57.379> gauge<00:00:57.620> of

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
adjustment and we need a feeler gauge of

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.789 
adjustment and we need a feeler gauge of
the<00:00:57.920> appropriate<00:00:58.720> thickness<00:00:59.720> to<00:01:00.440> set<00:01:00.650> the

truss rod and also to set the action at
the<00:01:02.780> nut<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:03.559> then<00:01:04.250> finally<00:01:04.699> we're<00:01:05.420> going<00:01:05.449> to

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
the nut and then finally we're going to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.740 
the nut and then finally we're going to
need<00:01:05.840> a<00:01:06.110> six<00:01:07.040> inch<00:01:07.250> scale<00:01:07.610> calibrated<00:01:08.570> in

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
need a six inch scale calibrated in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.780 
need a six inch scale calibrated in
either<00:01:09.049> 30<00:01:09.409> seconds<00:01:09.860> or<00:01:09.950> 60<00:01:10.100> fourths<00:01:10.580> of<00:01:10.670> an

inch<00:01:10.940> to<00:01:11.450> actually<00:01:11.810> measure<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.229> action<00:01:12.619> or

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
inch to actually measure the action or

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.590 
inch to actually measure the action or
where<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.070> neck<00:01:13.220> joints<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.670> body<00:01:13.729> well

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
where the neck joints of the body well

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.320 
where the neck joints of the body well
we're<00:01:14.750> now<00:01:14.900> ready<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.520> do<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.640> setup<00:01:16.909> work<00:01:17.150> on

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
we're now ready to do the setup work on

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.929 
we're now ready to do the setup work on
the<00:01:17.450> base<00:01:17.799> it's<00:01:18.799> very<00:01:19.130> important<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:19.610> we<00:01:19.729> do

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
the base it's very important that we do

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.910 
the base it's very important that we do
our<00:01:20.180> adjustments<00:01:21.170> in<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.380> proper<00:01:21.710> sequence

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
our adjustments in the proper sequence

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.609 
our adjustments in the proper sequence
we<00:01:22.790> do<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.060> truss<00:01:23.299> rod<00:01:23.420> adjustment<00:01:23.570> first<00:01:24.350> as

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
we do the truss rod adjustment first as

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.830 
we do the truss rod adjustment first as
it's<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.010> foundational<00:01:25.640> adjustment<00:01:26.210> then<00:01:26.719> we

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
it's the foundational adjustment then we

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.080 
it's the foundational adjustment then we
do<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.109> action<00:01:27.530> at<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.679> bridge<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:28.369> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
do the action at the bridge and the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.669 
do the action at the bridge and the
action<00:01:29.450> at<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.600> nut<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.079> then<00:01:30.170> finally<00:01:30.560> we

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
action at the nut and then finally we

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.709 
action at the nut and then finally we
set<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.009> string<00:01:31.280> length<00:01:31.460> it's<00:01:32.240> also<00:01:32.450> very

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
set the string length it's also very

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.240 
set the string length it's also very
important<00:01:33.109> to<00:01:33.170> do<00:01:33.289> it<00:01:33.409> in<00:01:33.500> playing<00:01:33.770> position

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
important to do it in playing position

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.649 
important to do it in playing position
because<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.759> set<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.119> instrument<00:01:35.509> on<00:01:35.630> the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
because if you set the instrument on the

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.529 
because if you set the instrument on the
bench<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.369> weight<00:01:37.609> of<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.030> instrument<00:01:38.149> will

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
bench the weight of the instrument will

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.239 
bench the weight of the instrument will
actually<00:01:38.899> bend<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.380> neck<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.829> throw<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
actually bend the neck and throw the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.489 
actually bend the neck and throw the
adjustments<00:01:40.820> off<00:01:40.969> so<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:42.049> always<00:01:42.259> want<00:01:42.439> to

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
adjustments off so you always want to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:43.899 
adjustments off so you always want to
try<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.710> do<00:01:42.859> the<00:01:42.950> adjustments<00:01:43.490> when<00:01:43.640> possible

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
try and do the adjustments when possible

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.630 
try and do the adjustments when possible
in<00:01:44.780> playing<00:01:45.229> position<00:01:45.740> now<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.100> first<00:01:46.520> thing

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
in playing position now the first thing

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.499 
in playing position now the first thing
we're<00:01:46.789> going<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.939> do<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.179> we're<00:01:47.359> going<00:01:47.450> to

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.469 
we're going to do is we're going to
adjust<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.170> truss<00:01:48.770> rod<00:01:48.799> adjustment<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:49.729> so

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
adjust the truss rod adjustment and so

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.440 
adjust the truss rod adjustment and so
we<00:01:50.990> can<00:01:51.369> set<00:01:52.369> our<00:01:52.520> bank<00:01:52.729> temporarily<00:01:53.210> till<00:01:53.359> we

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
we can set our bank temporarily till we

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.880 
we can set our bank temporarily till we
get<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.719> Reg<00:01:53.869> now<00:01:54.109> in<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.319> case<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:54.829> has

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
get the Reg now in this case this has

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.039 
get the Reg now in this case this has
one<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.429> inserts<00:01:55.850> from<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.270> headstock<00:01:56.749> and

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
one that inserts from the headstock and

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.130 
one that inserts from the headstock and
then<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.439> uses<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.829> 3/16<00:01:58.640> inch<00:01:58.880> Allen<00:01:59.359> some<00:02:00.020> of

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
then it uses a 3/16 inch Allen some of

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.719 
then it uses a 3/16 inch Allen some of
them<00:02:00.289> have<00:02:00.439> adjustments<00:02:00.799> at<00:02:01.069> the<00:02:01.189> bottom<00:02:01.520> some

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
them have adjustments at the bottom some

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.309 
them have adjustments at the bottom some
other<00:02:01.909> use<00:02:02.210> other<00:02:02.420> different<00:02:02.840> sizes<00:02:03.200> of

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
other use other different sizes of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.770 
other use other different sizes of
ranches<00:02:03.679> some<00:02:03.859> are<00:02:04.009> metric<00:02:04.630> some<00:02:05.630> are

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
ranches some are metric some are

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.389 
ranches some are metric some are
actually<00:02:06.139> like<00:02:06.319> hex<00:02:06.619> nuts<00:02:06.859> and<00:02:07.100> things<00:02:07.249> like

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
actually like hex nuts and things like

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.609 
actually like hex nuts and things like
that<00:02:07.639> or<00:02:07.850> screwdriver<00:02:08.360> type<00:02:08.780> adjustments

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
that or screwdriver type adjustments

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.980 
that or screwdriver type adjustments
whichever<00:02:10.429> way<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.810> need<00:02:11.960> to

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
whichever way you have it you need to

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.630 
whichever way you have it you need to
have<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.380> appropriate<00:02:12.830> tool<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.160> do<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.460> work

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
have the appropriate tool to do the work

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
have the appropriate tool to do the work
so<00:02:14.300> we<00:02:14.480> insert<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.930> truss<00:02:15.200> rod<00:02:15.350> wrench<00:02:16.660> until

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
so we insert the truss rod wrench until

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.020 
so we insert the truss rod wrench until
it<00:02:17.780> engages<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.650> truss<00:02:19.010> rod<00:02:19.100> nut<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.670> then

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
it engages in the truss rod nut and then

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.530 
it engages in the truss rod nut and then
we're<00:02:20.660> going<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.840> take<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.650> capo<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:23.420> we're

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
we're going to take the capo and we're

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.510 
we're going to take the capo and we're
going<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.780> put<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.440> at<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.950> first<00:02:25.130> fret<00:02:25.490> and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
going to put this at the first fret and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.160 
going to put this at the first fret and
the<00:02:25.760> reason<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.090> do<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.780> be<00:02:26.959> able<00:02:27.020> to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
the reason we do that is to be able to

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.690 
the reason we do that is to be able to
make<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.410> measurement<00:02:27.800> we<00:02:27.890> need<00:02:27.920> three<00:02:28.310> hands

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
make the measurement we need three hands

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.520 
make the measurement we need three hands
and<00:02:29.270> most<00:02:29.420> people<00:02:29.720> don't<00:02:29.840> have<00:02:29.959> three<00:02:30.290> hands

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
and most people don't have three hands

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.620 
and most people don't have three hands
and<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:30.980> by<00:02:31.160> putting<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.640> capo<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.330> holds

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
and so by putting the capo on that holds

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.910 
and so by putting the capo on that holds
a<00:02:32.690> string<00:02:32.900> for<00:02:33.140> me<00:02:33.260> at<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.560> first

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
a string for me at the first

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.800 
a string for me at the first
prep<00:02:34.099> and<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.700> try<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.000> get<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.209> capo<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.660> it's

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
prep and I try and get the capo so it's

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.420 
prep and I try and get the capo so it's
right<00:02:36.020> at<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.380> fret<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.160> string

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
right at the fret so that the string

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.640 
right at the fret so that the string
isn't<00:02:37.610> arcing<00:02:38.060> up<00:02:38.209> over<00:02:38.599> the<00:02:38.780> fret<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.349> is

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
isn't arcing up over the fret that is

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.260 
isn't arcing up over the fret that is
sitting<00:02:39.950> flat<00:02:40.160> on<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:40.849> can<00:02:41.030> get<00:02:41.150> an

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
sitting flat on it so that I can get an

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.390 
sitting flat on it so that I can get an
accurate<00:02:41.750> measurement<00:02:42.110> then<00:02:43.069> I'm<00:02:43.220> going<00:02:43.340> to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
accurate measurement then I'm going to

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.800 
accurate measurement then I'm going to
take<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.790> base<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.180> hold<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.540> plank

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
take the base and hold it in plank

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.050 
take the base and hold it in plank
position<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.500> then<00:02:45.950> I'm<00:02:46.099> going<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.310> fret<00:02:46.610> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
position and then I'm going to fret the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.170 
position and then I'm going to fret the
neck<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:48.500> string<00:02:48.770> at<00:02:49.010> where<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.520> neck<00:02:49.880> joins

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
neck the string at where the neck joins

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.670 
neck the string at where the neck joins
the<00:02:50.360> body<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.840> then<00:02:51.050> I'm<00:02:51.170> going<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.319> take<00:02:51.530> my

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
the body and then I'm going to take my

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.229 
the body and then I'm going to take my
feeler<00:02:52.040> gauge<00:02:52.250> now<00:02:52.489> if<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.880> look<00:02:53.060> really

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
feeler gauge now if you look really

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.990 
feeler gauge now if you look really
carefully<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.930> feeler<00:02:54.230> gauge<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:55.000> 0.015

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
carefully the feeler gauge is 0.015

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.780 
carefully the feeler gauge is 0.015
inches<00:02:56.410> or<00:02:58.660> 0.38<00:02:59.660> one<00:02:59.930> millimeters<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:00.980> we're

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
inches or 0.38 one millimeters and we're

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.100 
inches or 0.38 one millimeters and we're
going<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:01.970> fret<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.480> here<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.870> then<00:03:02.989> we're

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
going to fret it here and then we're

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.809 
going to fret it here and then we're
going<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.260> go<00:03:03.410> down<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.890> about<00:03:04.310> halfway<00:03:04.580> down

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
going to go down to about halfway down

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.009 
going to go down to about halfway down
the<00:03:04.880> neck<00:03:05.120> which<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.330> usually<00:03:05.690> around<00:03:05.870> the

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
the neck which is usually around the

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.199 
the neck which is usually around the
seventh<00:03:06.350> fret<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.860> put<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.610> blade<00:03:07.819> in<00:03:07.850> and

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
seventh fret and put the blade in and

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.509 
seventh fret and put the blade in and
see<00:03:08.480> if<00:03:08.720> there's<00:03:09.110> any<00:03:09.260> space<00:03:09.650> now<00:03:09.980> if<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.340> look

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
see if there's any space now if you look

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.910 
see if there's any space now if you look
here<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.569> string<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:11.959> moving<00:03:12.319> just<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.650> little

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
here the string is moving just a little

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.280 
here the string is moving just a little
bit<00:03:13.100> so<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:14.090> may<00:03:14.630> need<00:03:14.840> just<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.260> little

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
bit so that it may need just a little

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.900 
bit so that it may need just a little
adjustment<00:03:15.890> let's<00:03:16.160> see<00:03:16.310> right<00:03:16.519> now<00:03:16.700> it's

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
adjustment let's see right now it's

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.930 
adjustment let's see right now it's
actually<00:03:17.269> lifting<00:03:17.720> up<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:19.130> if<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:19.610> lifting

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
actually lifting up so if it's lifting

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.370 
actually lifting up so if it's lifting
that<00:03:20.090> means<00:03:20.269> that<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.569> truss<00:03:20.780> rod<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.110> just<00:03:21.290> a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
that means that the truss rod is just a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.530 
that means that the truss rod is just a
hair<00:03:21.590> tight<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.100> we<00:03:22.220> need<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.519> loosen<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.940> to

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
hair tight so we need to loosen it to

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.270 
hair tight so we need to loosen it to
loosen<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:23.959> we<00:03:24.110> go<00:03:24.260> in<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.500> counterclockwise

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
loosen that we go in a counterclockwise

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.770 
loosen that we go in a counterclockwise
direction<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:28.190> once<00:03:28.760> we<00:03:28.970> do<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.180> we'll<00:03:29.540> take

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
direction so once we do that we'll take

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.960 
direction so once we do that we'll take
a<00:03:29.840> recheck<00:03:30.350> here<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.769> see<00:03:30.920> what<00:03:31.069> we've<00:03:31.220> got

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.430 

still<00:03:34.970> lifting<00:03:35.360> just<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.660> hair<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.049> we<00:03:36.200> need<00:03:36.350> to

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
still lifting just a hair so we need to

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.210 
still lifting just a hair so we need to
do<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.620> little<00:03:36.830> bit<00:03:36.950> more<00:03:38.799> usually<00:03:39.799> it's<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.040> very

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
do a little bit more usually it's a very

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.710 
do a little bit more usually it's a very
subtle<00:03:40.430> amount<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.850> adjustment<00:03:41.390> if<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.570> have

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
subtle amount of adjustment if you have

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.120 
subtle amount of adjustment if you have
to<00:03:41.870> do<00:03:42.019> too<00:03:42.200> much<00:03:42.350> or<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.650> doesn't<00:03:42.980> feel<00:03:43.070> like

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
to do too much or it doesn't feel like

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.250 
to do too much or it doesn't feel like
it's<00:03:43.459> working<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.510> might<00:03:44.690> want<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.019> check

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
it's working you might want to check

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.199 
it's working you might want to check
with<00:03:45.320> somebody<00:03:45.709> who<00:03:46.549> does<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.970> on<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.120> regular

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
with somebody who does it on a regular

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.449 
with somebody who does it on a regular
basis<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.470> don't<00:03:48.799> accidentally

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
basis so that you don't accidentally

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.520 
basis so that you don't accidentally
break<00:03:49.700> your<00:03:49.880> truss<00:03:50.120> rod<00:03:50.359> so<00:03:50.930> now<00:03:51.109> it's<00:03:51.320> set

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
break your truss rod so now it's set

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.970 
break your truss rod so now it's set
just<00:03:51.739> perfectly<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:53.470> gate<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.769> blade

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
just perfectly the the gate the blade

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.830 
just perfectly the the gate the blade
just<00:03:55.250> fits<00:03:55.489> in<00:03:55.700> without<00:03:56.060> lifting<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.480> string

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
just fits in without lifting the string

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.990 
just fits in without lifting the string
and<00:03:56.989> it<00:03:57.350> has<00:03:57.470> no<00:03:57.709> space<00:03:58.160> whatsoever<00:03:58.549> and

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
and it has no space whatsoever and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.800 
and it has no space whatsoever and
that's<00:03:59.150> what<00:03:59.329> we<00:03:59.450> want

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
that's what we want

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.810 
that's what we want
once<00:04:00.440> that's<00:04:00.680> done<00:04:00.890> then<00:04:01.100> we<00:04:01.310> can<00:04:01.459> proceed<00:04:01.760> to

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
once that's done then we can proceed to

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.550 
once that's done then we can proceed to
the<00:04:02.000> next<00:04:02.120> adjustment<00:04:02.959> which<00:04:03.079> is<00:04:03.109> bridge

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
the next adjustment which is bridge

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.400 
the next adjustment which is bridge
height<00:04:03.829> adjustment
