00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
this to charge up the computer itself as

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.279 
this to charge up the computer itself as
well<00:00:21.359> as<00:00:21.449> does<00:00:21.630> has<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> rechargeable<00:00:22.050> battery

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
marriage matrix dive computer as we

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
marriage matrix dive computer as we
mentioned<00:00:32.700> before<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> watch<00:00:33.930> styled
