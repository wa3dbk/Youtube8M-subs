00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
scoring or kicking a field goal so I

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.340 
scoring or kicking a field goal so I
think<00:01:55.149> like<00:01:55.360> Peyton<00:01:55.630> said<00:01:55.899> you<00:01:56.020> know<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.170> just

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
think like Peyton said you know you just

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.899 
think like Peyton said you know you just
you<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:56.710> find<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.190> way<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.369> win<00:01:57.520> at<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.729> end

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
you just find a way to win at the end

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.880 
you just find a way to win at the end
and<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.270> think<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.720> just<00:01:58.750> build<00:01:59.350> up<00:01:59.500> this<00:01:59.619> con

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
and I think you just build up this con

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.039 
and I think you just build up this con
for<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.220> level<00:02:00.429> in<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:00.729> belief<00:02:01.690> that<00:02:01.899> no

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
for this level in this belief that no

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.300 
for this level in this belief that no
matter<00:02:02.229> what<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.560> situation<00:02:03.130> we're<00:02:03.250> gonna

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
matter what the situation we're gonna

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.609 
matter what the situation we're gonna
find<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.759> way<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.090> sure<00:02:04.390> enough<00:02:04.569> we<00:02:04.720> did<00:02:04.750> 21

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
find a way and sure enough we did 21

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
deal with their defense but you also

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.610 
deal with their defense but you also
know<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:22.450> know<00:04:22.540> drew<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.170> their<00:04:23.290> office

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.460 
at some point you can't fall too far
behind<00:04:29.860> because<00:04:30.550> they're<00:04:31.330> so<00:04:31.570> explosive<00:04:31.930> but

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
behind because they're so explosive but

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.220 
behind because they're so explosive but
but<00:04:33.040> their<00:04:33.190> defense<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.850> so<00:04:34.230> opportunistic

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
but their defense is so opportunistic

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.950 
but their defense is so opportunistic
