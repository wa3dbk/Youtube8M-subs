now<00:00:55.510> this<00:00:56.079> came<00:00:56.590> about<00:00:57.010> when<00:00:57.219> I<00:00:57.250> was<00:00:57.430> playing

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
now this came about when I was playing

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.819 
now this came about when I was playing
the<00:00:58.210> enslave<00:00:58.870> of<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.230> play<00:00:59.440> through<00:00:59.680> this

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
the enslave of the play through this

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.190 
the enslave of the play through this
year<00:01:00.130> and<00:01:00.340> there<00:01:01.180> was<00:01:01.270> a<00:01:01.329> lot<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.570> platforming

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
year and there was a lot of platforming

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.109 
year and there was a lot of platforming
on<00:01:02.410> that<00:01:02.649> game<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.219> was<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.670> little<00:01:03.850> bit<00:01:03.969> unique

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
on that game I was a little bit unique

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.430 
on that game I was a little bit unique
because<00:01:04.390> it<00:01:04.660> was<00:01:04.690> a<00:01:04.809> little<00:01:05.140> bit<00:01:05.290> more

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
because it was a little bit more

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.109 
because it was a little bit more
free-flowing<00:01:05.800> than<00:01:06.280> other<00:01:06.460> platforming

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
free-flowing than other platforming
