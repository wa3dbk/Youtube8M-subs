 video then you are another company in 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.650
 2014 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.719
 in this video is a continuation of the mode 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.840
 career, right? 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.880
 continuing the series and this 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.859
 sharing is playing against the river 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.769
 the rockets from here I played it well 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.009
 I even helped the team to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.640
 victory and all the traffic here for you 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.090
 are forest from here the hair 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.120
 It went well the ball stole the ball in the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.120
 attack 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.360
 wrong 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.900
 but then I ended up playing well and it was not 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.180
 A match is so hard, it went well. 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.360
 played during the game but 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.470
 At the end we managed to open a 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:10.450
 good advantage and we ended up 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.450
 victory at home was important 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.250
 the exchange rate and the Chinese if another kiss 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.360
 glasses around what is joão 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:38.440
 rodrigues best choice neon indian wells 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:39.880
 in 6 nuno roque a fault in both 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.070
 previous right 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.430
 that part of the gain plus a few minutes 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.369
 on the court so I could be taking advantage 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.890
 more and more as I walk and second 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.800
 assists 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.850
 So try other games that I 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.340
 I played also that I had brought her, I already won. 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.929
 more minutes at each match then it was 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.770
 That's what I said at night. 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.979
 previous 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.420
 It's just you playing and that the traffic is going 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.420
 giving opportunities 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.730
 basically our part does not 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.700
 I could hit a few balls of three 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.340
 It's something that I was trying on the others. 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.600
 So that's when you got an ounce, not me. 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:30.910
 cheating and some other chances but 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:37.810
 it ended up on the floor coming in but that's how I said it 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:40.299
 is and improving the players increase 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.209
 his skills that facilitates 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.989
 enough but it is already quite enough already 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:51.780
 has improved a lot since the first match 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:54.820
 It's much easier to play now so it's 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.780
 from there it was as if only seeing 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.120
 we're missing out on a point it went well 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.730
 during the year thereafter 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.780
 only in ours the hot period gave a 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.190
 started and we were able to 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.280
 few of them is to open a greater and 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.280
 with this to achieve another victory 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.090
 it is also very difficult to win 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.090
 matches of brazil including increasing 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.900
 The difficulty level is to stay longer. 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.750
 challenging but this is something to be 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.110
 see after the long summer , matches are 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.630
 You see you're very 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.490
 It's very easy, I'll finish it. 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.340
 increasing the difficulty 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.530
 so this video is basically this 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.780
 delaying the works from June ai 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.880
 I hope you like it if I like it, I think 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.570
 Shocked I liked it and signed up if 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.760
 channel 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.610
 So that's it , I'll stay here and say 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.610
 and until the next league surf in our 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:15.020
 routine and indy fans' only 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:19.630
