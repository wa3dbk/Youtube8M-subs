00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
some long chain so i guess it's kind of

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.760 
some long chain so i guess it's kind of
unfortunate<00:01:24.960> they<00:01:25.259> didn't<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> break

right<00:01:33.390> i'm<00:01:34.079> gonna<00:01:34.259> look<00:01:34.560> there's<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.520> bug<00:01:36.350> for<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
right i'm gonna look there's a bug for a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.569 
right i'm gonna look there's a bug for a
lot<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> blacksmiths<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:40.549> stuff<00:01:41.549> just

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
lot of blacksmiths that stuff just

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.160 
lot of blacksmiths that stuff just
catches<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.299> fire<00:01:42.590> it's<00:01:44.509> like<00:01:45.509> randomly<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
catches on fire it's like randomly and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.210 
catches on fire it's like randomly and
it's<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.710> terrain<00:01:47.070> generation

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
it's all like terrain generation

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.609 
it's all like terrain generation
glitches<00:01:48.020> sometimes<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.350> doesn't<00:01:49.560> even

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
glitches sometimes it doesn't even

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.010 
glitches sometimes it doesn't even
happen<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> drain<00:01:51.420> generation<00:01:51.930> is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
happen I think the drain generation is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.870 
happen I think the drain generation is
very<00:01:52.200> buggy<00:01:52.409> unfortunately<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> i

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
very buggy unfortunately like I i

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.609 
very buggy unfortunately like I i
