00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
here clutch garden everything because

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.840 
here clutch garden everything because
the<00:00:44.700> predator<00:00:45.030> motor<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.570> wider<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.640> had<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> do

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the predator motor is wider I had to do

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.220 
the predator motor is wider I had to do
some<00:00:48.030> custom<00:00:48.420> stuff<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> clutch<00:00:48.989> guard

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
some custom stuff on the clutch guard

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.389 
some custom stuff on the clutch guard
now<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.440> project<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.920> actually<00:00:49.980> had<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
now this project I actually had the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.340 
now this project I actually had the
clutch<00:00:50.579> guard<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.629> chain<00:00:51.840> guard<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
clutch guard and the chain guard so that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.250 
clutch guard and the chain guard so that
made<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.530> nice<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> had<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:55.020> split

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
made it nice so I had to you know split

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
made it nice so I had to you know split
it<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.010> wider<00:00:56.219> taper<00:00:57.180> back

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

made<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.289> plate<00:00:58.590> out<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> aluminum<00:00:59.570> I'm<00:01:00.570> here

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
made this plate out of aluminum I'm here

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
made this plate out of aluminum I'm here
in<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.140> self<00:01:01.379> tap<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:01.800> screws<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.129> had<00:01:02.520> to

in just self tap some screws in had to
make<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.910> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.210> bracket<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.809> don't<00:01:04.049> like

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
I custom painted the chain guard kind of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.320 
I custom painted the chain guard kind of
faded<00:01:13.650> reverse<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> fenders

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

incepted had to actually take out a
couple<00:01:20.640> links<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.920> chain<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.729> other<00:01:23.880> than

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
couple links of chain but other than

know<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.170> custom<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.400> didn't<00:01:41.579> have

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
know all custom because I didn't have

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.260 
know all custom because I didn't have
anything<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.180> bike<00:01:42.770> but<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.189> didn't<00:01:45.149> use

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
anything with this bike but I didn't use

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.319 
anything with this bike but I didn't use
any<00:01:45.450> kits<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:46.049> any<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:47.520> know<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.090> had<00:01:48.210> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
any kits or any you know I just had to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.090 
any kits or any you know I just had to
redraw<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:50.450> motor<00:01:51.450> mounts<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.680> motor<00:01:52.979> is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
redraw the motor mounts this motor is

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700 
redraw the motor mounts this motor is
probably<00:01:53.399> gonna<00:01:53.520> say<00:01:53.729> stock<00:01:54.290> this<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.619> my

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
probably gonna say stock this is for my

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.010 
probably gonna say stock this is for my
dad<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.219> his<00:01:56.490> RV<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.299> stock<00:01:57.540> motors<00:01:57.899> are<00:01:57.990> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
dad in his RV so the stock motors are a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
dad in his RV so the stock motors are a
lot<00:01:58.200> quieter<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.920> he<00:01:59.369> don't<00:01:59.549> need<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> go<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
lot quieter and he don't need to go a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.459 
lot quieter and he don't need to go a
million<00:02:00.119> miles<00:02:00.329> an<00:02:00.540> hour<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.049> leave<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
million miles an hour I do leave the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
million miles an hour I do leave the
governors<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.119> because<00:02:03.119> there's<00:02:03.390> no<00:02:03.509> reason

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
governors in because there's no reason

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.209 
governors in because there's no reason
he<00:02:03.869> can't<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> top<00:02:04.590> speed<00:02:04.829> anywhere<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
he can't get up the top speed anywhere I

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.479 
he can't get up the top speed anywhere I
go<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.380> want<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> drag<00:02:07.829> bike<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.310> maybe

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
go so I want to do a drag bike but maybe

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.320 
go so I want to do a drag bike but maybe
someday<00:02:08.869> anyways<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.140> is

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.380 

maybe<00:02:13.330> turn<00:02:13.569> out<00:02:13.750> real<00:02:13.959> good<00:02:14.970> real<00:02:15.970> clean<00:02:16.240> on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
maybe turn out real good real clean on

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.710 
maybe turn out real good real clean on
it

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
it
