00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.949
 I'm back to a heart 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.529
 tips and tricks videos how to listen 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.250
 scholes giggs comes and you get them easier 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.140
 to reach 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.180
 In any case you have to first the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.010
 game mode position I am looking for games 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.990
 Here's a fight training against bots 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.630
 just to illustrate that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.350
 like that, it does not matter 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 Be there just a run show 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.050
 how it works properly 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.059
 In any case, you run immediately 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.770
 Special takes it once gets 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.620
 200 points if you have a position 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.559
 takes and always 120 points 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.870
 if you have an opponent out so if you are 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 is in the position and it is considered a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.940
 opponents and so you get too fast 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.590
 ep that means you can learn quickly and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.440
 of course for his graduation speech 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.969
 you click so much so be very fast 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.549
 Now I have the drone right now 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.750
 get caught and it's not even yes and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.030
 just a minute ago 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.310
 so now I'm working on that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.110
 p before that my team as well as points 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.150
 can give now gets only once 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.880
 threaten that is no longer unfortunately 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.450
 because the donots give me my drug down 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 but have in the ideal case remains 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 her upstairs and his team will get you 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.820
 hold also a few points 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.259
 Assist points and you think yourself 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.259
 of course a beneficial by 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.430
 stop up then see games 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.560
 I have the mp that I have now too 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.430
 same and once you have gp is one 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.390
 already won everything 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.280
 bp i think 25 points are good if 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.990
 an opponent has evolved now 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.409
 you also saw the position again 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.090
 changed 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.610
 I make myself right back out 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.560
 and that you can get back to 200 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.560
 points and thus gave almost 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.590
 my one swan achieved that not he 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.890
 in two minutes two minutes his 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.280
 reached swarm and that the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.719
 killstreaks builds the scores war service 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.070
 one stops so one takes one first 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.320
 small graduation speech the drone 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.819
 controller or something and builds 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.140
 then on a middle too and then 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.870
 you take one 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.330
 a high that is dogs vs. unit 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.920
 or as in the ideal case as the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:25.780
 highest sponge and the swarm which 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.490
 now more often enough but what should 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.700
 I'll say exactly I will now 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.310
 first hide and show where and how 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.780
 the judges so a few 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:40.540
 opportunities were inspiring thoughts like 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.140
 you set up your scores tricks and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.920
 Yes 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.450
 we'll be right up there and now 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.850
 already arrived in points series and 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.280
 Although as you can see I have here now 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.920
 for example, controller or something else 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.360
 you can watch it for my sake 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.160
 or think about it yourself 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.910
 In any case, I find a very good 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.880
 doctor to reach his points series 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.540
 You can all often play to him or her 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.250
 anything else 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.880
 So you stop with the thani one more 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.630
 traveling or few kills what else 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.730
 and I just leave now 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.410
 go through you can look me or 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.910
 make your own thoughts you can 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.769
 set it up the way you want it 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.400
 I just wanted to show you 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.080
 Show a little tip from me 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.630
 yes, I always like to play 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.940
 also marco rocket ag he and vs unit 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.269
 on the other hand, it is mostly or contact 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.310
 without mp and dogs or anywhere else goes though 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.350
 also there are many possibilities 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.269
 and yes then I say goodbye already 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.549
 I hope it helped you that 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.160
 small video of me four minutes or 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.140
 so well for the little tips and tricks 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.220
 how you definitely wanted me 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.750
 say goodbye and hope you have it 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.380
 We'll have three until next time 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.380
