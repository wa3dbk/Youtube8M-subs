huge<00:00:48.420> planetary<00:00:49.079> fortress<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.649> ready<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.010> dish

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
huge planetary fortress is ready to dish

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.229 
huge planetary fortress is ready to dish
out<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.700> pain<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.350> said<00:00:52.710> there's<00:00:52.890> 800

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
out the pain and so I said there's 800

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
out the pain and so I said there's 800
banelings<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.539> video<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
banelings in this video and that is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.520 
banelings in this video and that is
because<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.610> most<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> make<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.480> 400<00:00:58.379> if

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
because the most you can make is 400 if

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.810 
because the most you can make is 400 if
you<00:00:58.620> get<00:00:58.770> rid<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.129> your<00:00:59.160> drones<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.730> if

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you get rid of all your drones and if

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
you get rid of all your drones and if
you<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> unit<00:01:00.480> count<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:00.989> top<00:01:01.289> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you see the unit count at the top you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.260 
you see the unit count at the top you
see<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.539> 398<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.870> think<00:01:04.710> there's<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.119> 400<00:01:06.119> are

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
see I have 398 I think there's a 400 are

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.420 
see I have 398 I think there's a 400 are
going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> moment<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.979> think

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
going to be there in a moment I think

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.710 
going to be there in a moment I think
there's<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.820> couple<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.150> circlings

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
there's just a couple of circlings

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.240 
there's just a couple of circlings
hiding<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:10.710> there's<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> couple<00:01:11.070> more

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
hiding or there's a couple more

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.039 
hiding or there's a couple more
zerglings<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> way<00:01:12.000> there<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.299> are<00:01:12.330> two

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
zerglings on the way there they are two

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.840 
zerglings on the way there they are two
more<00:01:13.200> zerglings<00:01:13.710> they're<00:01:14.250> gonna<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:14.520> morphed

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
more zerglings they're gonna get morphed

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.929 
more zerglings they're gonna get morphed
into<00:01:15.000> banelings<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.909> are

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
into banelings and so if you if you are

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.300 
into banelings and so if you if you are
up<00:01:18.299> against<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.630> terran<00:01:19.049> player<00:01:19.200> who<00:01:19.860> does<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
up against a terran player who does this

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
up against a terran player who does this
kind<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.670> wall<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.150> who's<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.930> know

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
kind of wall in who's just like you know

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.749 
kind of wall in who's just like you know
what<00:01:22.229> you're<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.740> getting<00:01:23.159> into<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.520> base

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
what you're not getting into my base

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
what you're not getting into my base
then<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> sit<00:01:25.590> back

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
then all you have to do is sit back

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.890 
then all you have to do is sit back
build<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.869> 400<00:01:27.869> banelings<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:29.150> then<00:01:30.150> hit<00:01:30.810> them

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
build up 400 banelings and then hit them

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.109 
build up 400 banelings and then hit them
with<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.369> again<00:01:32.520> so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
with them and then do it again so

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.039 
with them and then do it again so
there's<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.540> you're<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> see

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.200 
there's going to be you're going to see
800<00:01:34.619> banelings<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.460> video<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.060> go

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
800 banelings in this video here we go

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
800 banelings in this video here we go
first<00:01:36.689> stuff<00:01:36.900> look<00:01:37.049> how<00:01:37.170> awesome<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.740> look

as they move they're moving into the
base<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.930> bunker<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.070> crap

let's look at all those they just I love
the<00:03:37.110> new<00:03:37.230> path<00:03:37.410> -<00:03:37.650> Starcraft<00:03:38.130> 2<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.880> much

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
the new path - Starcraft 2 so much

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.000 
the new path - Starcraft 2 so much
better<00:03:39.300> than<00:03:39.450> Starcraft<00:03:39.870> 1<00:03:40.110> where<00:03:40.320> things

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
better than Starcraft 1 where things

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.110 
better than Starcraft 1 where things
would<00:03:41.220> just<00:03:41.250> like<00:03:41.550> go<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.820> opposite

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
would just like go the opposite

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.460 
would just like go the opposite
direction<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.480> wanted<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.870> now<00:03:43.140> they<00:03:43.350> all

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
direction you wanted to now they all

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.300 
direction you wanted to now they all
just<00:03:43.680> move<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.600> awesome<00:03:45.600> together<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.440> it

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
just move so awesome together and it

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.070 
just move so awesome together and it
just<00:03:47.460> looks<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.150> great<00:03:48.390> like<00:03:48.690> when<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.900> see

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
just looks so great like when you see

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.260 
just looks so great like when you see
these<00:03:49.230> all<00:03:49.410> moving<00:03:49.740> I<00:03:50.090> think<00:03:51.090> they're<00:03:51.180> about

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
these all moving I think they're about

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.090 
these all moving I think they're about
to<00:03:51.450> I'm<00:03:51.600> gonna<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:52.320> by<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.530> way<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.770> have

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
to I'm gonna and I by the way I have

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.130 
to I'm gonna and I by the way I have
figured<00:03:53.400> out<00:03:53.520> that<00:03:54.000> there<00:03:54.210> is<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.420> maximum

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
figured out that there is a maximum

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.140 
figured out that there is a maximum
number<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.470> units<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.070> can<00:03:56.220> have<00:03:56.400> selected<00:03:57.000> I

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
number of units you can have selected I

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.000 
number of units you can have selected I
did<00:03:57.390> not<00:03:57.600> know<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:57.990> there<00:03:58.140> was<00:03:58.290> one<00:03:58.350> until<00:03:58.980> I

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
did not know that there was one until I

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.630 
did not know that there was one until I
made<00:03:59.430> this<00:03:59.700> and<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.690> maximum<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.440> 200<00:04:02.340> units

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
made this and that maximum is 200 units

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.390 
made this and that maximum is 200 units
so<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.390> apologize<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.440> ever<00:04:04.740> need<00:04:05.100> to

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
so I apologize if you ever need to

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.160 
so I apologize if you ever need to
actually<00:04:05.640> control<00:04:06.150> more<00:04:06.360> than<00:04:06.510> 200<00:04:06.870> units<00:04:07.080> at

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
actually control more than 200 units at

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.340 
actually control more than 200 units at
a<00:04:07.200> time<00:04:07.440> you're<00:04:07.980> going<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.370> have<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.730> do<00:04:08.880> two

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
a time you're going to have to do two

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.900 
a time you're going to have to do two
separate<00:04:10.350> groups<00:04:10.530> not<00:04:11.310> just<00:04:11.490> one<00:04:11.670> group

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
separate groups not just one group

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.730 
separate groups not just one group
that's<00:04:12.510> why<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.780> saw<00:04:12.990> that<00:04:13.140> group<00:04:13.380> split<00:04:13.620> off

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
that's why you saw that group split off

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.440 
that's why you saw that group split off
there<00:04:13.920> that's<00:04:14.100> 200<00:04:14.640> banelings<00:04:15.030> right<00:04:15.209> there

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
there that's 200 banelings right there

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.870 
there that's 200 banelings right there
doesn't<00:04:16.440> even<00:04:16.470> look<00:04:16.709> like<00:04:16.770> it<00:04:17.130> we're<00:04:17.670> up<00:04:17.790> to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
doesn't even look like it we're up to

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.490 
doesn't even look like it we're up to
300<00:04:18.390> banelings<00:04:18.690> now<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.020> let's<00:04:19.169> just<00:04:19.200> speed

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
300 banelings now so let's just speed

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.699 
300 banelings now so let's just speed
this<00:04:19.530> up

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
this up

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:28.860 
this up
up<00:04:20.829> to<00:04:21.070> 324<00:04:21.760> 330<00:04:23.790> 350<00:04:25.860> 370<00:04:26.860> 380<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.570> think

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
up to 324 330 350 370 380 and I think

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.810 
up to 324 330 350 370 380 and I think
we're<00:04:29.020> about<00:04:29.199> ready<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.620> move<00:04:30.040> on<00:04:30.310> in<00:04:30.580> there

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
we're about ready to move on in there

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.850 
we're about ready to move on in there
look<00:04:31.120> at<00:04:31.210> all<00:04:31.389> these<00:04:31.690> banelings<00:04:32.290> isn't<00:04:32.770> it

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
look at all these banelings isn't it

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.620 
look at all these banelings isn't it
that<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.400> most<00:04:33.639> awesome<00:04:34.120> thing<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.510> have

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
as you know making 800 banelings is not

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.270 
as you know making 800 banelings is not
the<00:04:40.419> most<00:04:40.570> sound<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.990> strategies<00:04:41.500> aliens<00:04:42.160> are

the most sound the strategies aliens are

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.120 
the most sound the strategies aliens are
awesome<00:04:42.760> they<00:04:43.120> do<00:04:43.180> bash<00:04:43.570> down<00:04:43.949> buildings<00:04:44.949> like

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
awesome they do bash down buildings like

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.650 
awesome they do bash down buildings like
you<00:04:45.220> have<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.400> make<00:04:45.520> sure<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.760> select<00:04:46.030> you

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
you have to make sure you select you

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.030 
you have to make sure you select you
right-click<00:04:46.840> on<00:04:47.080> attack<00:04:47.350> structure<00:04:47.800> so<00:04:47.949> they

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
right-click on attack structure so they

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.500 
right-click on attack structure so they
automatically<00:04:48.430> attack<00:04:48.610> buildings<00:04:49.000> but<00:04:49.360> here

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
automatically attack buildings but here

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.070 
automatically attack buildings but here
they<00:04:49.570> come<00:04:49.750> again

planetary fortress is like no way you

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.170 
planetary fortress is like no way you
ain't<00:04:58.810> getting<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.169> here<00:04:59.220> just<00:05:00.220> trying<00:05:01.120> to

surrounded<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.199> taken<00:05:05.530> down<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:06.580> now<00:05:06.699> the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
surrounded it taken down and now the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.060 
surrounded it taken down and now the
last<00:05:07.060> of<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.419> buildings<00:05:07.810> as<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.710> rest<00:05:08.889> of<00:05:09.010> the

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
last of the buildings as the rest of the

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.270 
last of the buildings as the rest of the
banelings<00:05:09.340> come<00:05:09.729> in<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.590> looks<00:05:11.590> like<00:05:11.860> I've<00:05:12.100> got

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
banelings come in so looks like I've got

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.420 
banelings come in so looks like I've got
200<00:05:12.820> banelings<00:05:13.180> left<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:14.650> means<00:05:15.130> it<00:05:15.310> only

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
200 banelings left so that means it only

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.180 
200 banelings left so that means it only
took<00:05:15.669> 600<00:05:16.419> banelings<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:17.260> take<00:05:17.530> down<00:05:17.770> that

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
took 600 banelings to take down that

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.650 
took 600 banelings to take down that
entire<00:05:18.340> Terran<00:05:18.880> base<00:05:19.060> now<00:05:19.300> they're<00:05:19.510> just

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
entire Terran base now they're just

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.210 
entire Terran base now they're just
going<00:05:19.750> to<00:05:19.810> go<00:05:20.350> around<00:05:20.560> for<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:20.710> little<00:05:20.889> victory

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.330 
lap here and I think they're just going
to<00:05:22.750> self-destruct<00:05:23.110> but<00:05:23.590> look<00:05:23.740> at<00:05:23.830> that<00:05:23.949> that's

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
to self-destruct but look at that that's

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.879 
to self-destruct but look at that that's
200<00:05:24.820> banelings<00:05:25.180> just<00:05:26.110> moving<00:05:26.380> around<00:05:26.470> just

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
to go in random directions because I

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.629

there they go

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.790 
there they go
that's<00:05:43.599> the<00:05:43.720> self-destruct<00:05:44.320> so<00:05:44.560> there's<00:05:44.740> a

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
that's the self-destruct so there's a

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.060 
that's the self-destruct so there's a
