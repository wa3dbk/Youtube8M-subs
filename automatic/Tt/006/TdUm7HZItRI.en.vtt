00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.420
 the day before a champions league 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.890
 Home game usually takes place in the 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.170
 alliance arena instead of the big one 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.530
 Football world has many eyes and needs 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.110
 space 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.910
 bayern munich will do after 7 2 1 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.039
 two weeks against the as rom well 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.390
 also the return match very concentrated 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.220
 Of course this also applies to 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.019
 mehdi ben attia she has often been 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.310
 Young boy should have thought everything 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.429
 done right with the change in the 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.429
 summer 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.199
 at the international level, bavaria has 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.820
 but to show a little more that say yes 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.129
 also the titles from the already won 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.690
 the history of Bavaria has been 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.230
 of course another compared to 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.149
 Rome 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.360
 you can bavaria with barcelona and madrid 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.910
 compare but what i say about rome 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.770
 It may be a great project you 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.020
 want to achieve something and this 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.940
 difference from seven to one that gives 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.070
 it does not unite between the two 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.100
 that can just happen arjen 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.879
 Robben faces his 83rd 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.280
 champions league game the biggest part 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.350
 of it in the jersey of the FC Bayern that he 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.560
 now in the sixth year dirt and always 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.640
 still with the highest ambitions 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.799
 I think we only have one goal and one 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.210
 that's going to be groups first and that 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.530
 means we have to win tomorrow 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.280
 we win tomorrow we are 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.369
 group first 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.320
 after four players and that 's natural 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.700
 especially if you are already after 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.650
 After four games you can say you are 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.140
 So groups is that 's our goal 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.640
 tomorrow and not less it will start again 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.049
 at zero and yes we have ours 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.149
 our top performance tomorrow again 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.270
 We want to get back here tomorrow 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.600
 win and I believe there it is 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.299
 Not 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.060
 with a little less we become 100 percent 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.329
 and then we have to 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.770
 Trust in a good result 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.210
 pep guardiola contests his sixth 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.920
 season in the champions league as 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.750
 trainer and therefore know pretty well 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.750
 what drives the opponent on Wednesday 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.540
 The players of Rome do not want that 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.700
 to experience once again they have theirs 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.470
 proud and loving your profession you keep 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.240
 to your club and to the fans and 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.140
 Do not want to disappoint again 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.970
 pep guardiola is with the development 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.580
 the team in its second year 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.800
 quite satisfied with an exception 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.580
 the self admitted has the yield 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.350
 after corners 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.030
 she is rather modest so maybe 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.540
 however, the roma occurs then ever 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.540
 improvement
