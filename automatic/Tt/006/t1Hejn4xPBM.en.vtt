want will do and you want to just let it
dry<00:00:21.539> completely<00:00:21.570> then<00:00:22.490> you<00:00:23.490> want<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.730> go<00:00:23.850> ahead

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
dry completely then you want to go ahead

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.450 
dry completely then you want to go ahead
with<00:00:24.390> some<00:00:24.420> striping<00:00:25.140> tape<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.340> just

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
with some striping tape and you just

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.429 
with some striping tape and you just
want<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.760> cut<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> into<00:00:27.210> pieces<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.990> place<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
want to cut it into pieces and place it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.310 
want to cut it into pieces and place it
on<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.590> nail<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.250> random<00:00:30.119> places<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:31.170> I've

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
on your nail in random places so I've

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.870 
on your nail in random places so I've
done<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.800> kind<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.130> creates<00:00:32.340> lots<00:00:32.759> of

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
done it so it kind of creates lots of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.170 
done it so it kind of creates lots of
triangles<00:00:34.040> but<00:00:35.040> yeah<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.370> paste<00:00:35.640> randomly

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
triangles but yeah just paste randomly

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.290 
triangles but yeah just paste randomly
so<00:00:36.390> each<00:00:36.540> finger<00:00:36.989> looks<00:00:37.320> slightly<00:00:37.649> different

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
so each finger looks slightly different

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.369 
so each finger looks slightly different
once<00:00:39.300> you've<00:00:39.420> stuck<00:00:39.629> down<00:00:39.809> all<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.110> bits<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
once you've stuck down all your bits of

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.780 
once you've stuck down all your bits of
tape<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.860> should<00:00:41.010> end<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.370> something

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
tape you should end up with something

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.760 
tape you should end up with something
that<00:00:41.940> looks<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.210> bit<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.649> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that looks a bit like this and then you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
that looks a bit like this and then you
can<00:00:43.860> go<00:00:44.040> ahead<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.850> your<00:00:44.879> colors<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.050> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
can go ahead with your colors so you can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.750 
can go ahead with your colors so you can
use<00:00:46.320> any<00:00:46.559> colors<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.920> like<00:00:47.160> I'll<00:00:47.460> list<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
use any colors you like I'll list the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.340 
use any colors you like I'll list the
colors<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.180> I've<00:00:48.300> used<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> description

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
colors that I've used in the description

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
colors that I've used in the description
box<00:00:49.500> below<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.160> I've<00:00:50.850> decided<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.870> each

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
box below and I've decided to go on each

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.810 
box below and I've decided to go on each
nail<00:00:52.260> different<00:00:53.070> shades<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.520> same<00:00:53.640> color

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
nail different shades of the same color

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.910 
nail different shades of the same color
but<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.719> mix<00:00:54.989> them<00:00:55.140> actual<00:00:55.440> colors<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
but you can mix them actual colors and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.920 
but you can mix them actual colors and
do<00:00:56.730> whichever<00:00:56.969> combination<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.780> like

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
do whichever combination that you like

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.479 
do whichever combination that you like
so<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> take<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> paintbrush

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
so I'm just going to take a paintbrush

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.819 
so I'm just going to take a paintbrush
and<00:00:59.789> start<00:01:00.180> filling<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.809> shapes<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and start filling in my shapes so the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
and start filling in my shapes so the
best<00:01:01.980> thing<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.149> two<00:01:03.629> thin

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
best thing to do is to do two thin

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.870 
best thing to do is to do two thin
layers<00:01:04.260> rather<00:01:04.589> than<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.489> thick<00:01:05.820> layer

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
layers rather than one thick layer

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.160 
layers rather than one thick layer
otherwise<00:01:06.479> you're<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:06.990> problems

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
otherwise you're going to have problems

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.429 
otherwise you're going to have problems
taking<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.220> tape<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.840> try<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> put

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
taking the tape off and I try not to put

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.929 
taking the tape off and I try not to put
the<00:01:10.530> same<00:01:10.740> colors<00:01:11.010> next<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> each<00:01:11.430> other<00:01:11.549> just

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the same colors next to each other just

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.609 
the same colors next to each other just
so<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.060> looks<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.630> random<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.470> bit

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
so it looks a bit more random and a bit

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
so it looks a bit more random and a bit
more<00:01:13.770> interesting<00:01:14.400> once<00:01:14.700> you've<00:01:14.850> filled<00:01:14.970> them

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
more interesting once you've filled them

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.789 
more interesting once you've filled them
all<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.869> carefully<00:01:16.259> start<00:01:16.439> taking

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
all in you can carefully start taking

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.080 
all in you can carefully start taking
your<00:01:16.920> tape<00:01:17.159> off<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> want<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:17.970> this

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
your tape off so you want to do this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.090 
your tape off so you want to do this
before<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.570> let<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> dry<00:01:19.020> too<00:01:19.080> much<00:01:19.439> otherwise

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
before you let it dry too much otherwise

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
before you let it dry too much otherwise
you<00:01:20.310> might<00:01:20.430> end<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.729> lifting<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> Polish<00:01:21.570> with

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
you might end up lifting the Polish with

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
you might end up lifting the Polish with
the<00:01:22.259> tape<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.250> carefully<00:01:23.580> peel<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.970> off

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the tape so just carefully peel it off

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
the tape so just carefully peel it off
and<00:01:24.330> you'll<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.570> hopefully<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:25.110> some<00:01:25.350> clean

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and you'll get hopefully get some clean

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
and you'll get hopefully get some clean
white<00:01:26.070> lines

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
white lines

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.980 
white lines
and<00:01:28.400> if<00:01:29.400> you're<00:01:29.520> left<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.880> any<00:01:30.150> lines<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and if you're left with any lines that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.390 
and if you're left with any lines that
aren't<00:01:31.230> as<00:01:31.380> perfect<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.860> you'd<00:01:31.980> like<00:01:32.040> them<00:01:32.370> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
aren't as perfect as you'd like them to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.340
