00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.690 
hey this is a quick update on my
WeatherTech<00:00:04.259> Floor<00:00:04.290> Liners<00:00:04.920> I<00:00:07.340> had<00:00:08.340> them<00:00:08.519> on

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
WeatherTech Floor Liners I had them on

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.030 
WeatherTech Floor Liners I had them on
for<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.330> few<00:00:09.570> weeks<00:00:09.719> now<00:00:10.250> I<00:00:11.990> do<00:00:12.990> like<00:00:13.440> them<00:00:13.710> they

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
for a few weeks now I do like them they

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.099 
for a few weeks now I do like them they
do<00:00:14.099> keep<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.089> breeze<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.360> turn<00:00:15.809> and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
do keep the breeze and turn and

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.609 
do keep the breeze and turn and
everything<00:00:16.590> off<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.699> carpet<00:00:18.439> it's<00:00:19.439> been

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
everything off the carpet it's been

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.700 
everything off the carpet it's been
raining<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> miners<00:00:22.380> as

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
raining here a lot and so the miners as

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.480 
raining here a lot and so the miners as
you<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.920> see<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.430> little<00:00:23.640> bit<00:00:23.730> wet<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.210> on

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
you can see it's a little bit wet but on

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.140 
you can see it's a little bit wet but on
the<00:00:26.490> problem<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:28.080> lot<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.380> people<00:00:28.500> say

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
the problem that a lot of people say

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.720 
the problem that a lot of people say
with<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> aligners<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.650> these<00:00:31.980> move<00:00:32.520> up

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
with the aligners is that these move up

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.490 
with the aligners is that these move up
a<00:00:32.969> tiny<00:00:33.600> bit<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.309> they<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.370> actually<00:00:36.200> you<00:00:37.200> can

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
a tiny bit and they do actually you can

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.340 
a tiny bit and they do actually you can
see<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> gap<00:00:38.239> or<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.050> more

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
see the gap or if you can see it more

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.690 
see the gap or if you can see it more
hair<00:00:40.969> but<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> tiny<00:00:43.079> gap<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.710> may

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
hair but it is like a tiny gap that may

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.760 
hair but it is like a tiny gap that may
be<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:48.510> should<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.020> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
be like that this you should be like you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.729 
be like that this you should be like you
know<00:00:49.800> exactly<00:00:50.520> flush<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.989> carpet<00:00:52.620> like

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
know exactly flush with the carpet like

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.020 
know exactly flush with the carpet like
that<00:00:53.000> but<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.629> drive<00:00:55.129> these<00:00:56.129> things<00:00:56.190> over

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that but as you drive these things over

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
that but as you drive these things over
time<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.320> move<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.980> shoved<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.309> tiny

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
time will move up and shoved up a tiny

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.359 
time will move up and shoved up a tiny
bit<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.809> won't<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.680> they'll<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
bit and it won't be like they'll be a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.980 
bit and it won't be like they'll be a
little<00:01:05.729> gap<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:08.240> what<00:01:09.240> I'm<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
little gap here what I'm going to do is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.359 
little gap here what I'm going to do is
what<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.920> I'm<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> put

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
back<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.740> velcro<00:01:13.740> tape<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.780> then<00:01:15.780> tape<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
back here a velcro tape and then tape it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.780 
back here a velcro tape and then tape it
against<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> carpet<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.580> it's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
against the carpet like this so it's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
against the carpet like this so it's
more<00:01:19.070> flush<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.630> no<00:01:21.630> gap<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:23.630> went<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.840> bought

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
more flush and no gap I went and bought

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.090 
more flush and no gap I went and bought
the<00:01:25.729> industrial-strength<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:28.200> double-sided

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the industrial-strength a double-sided

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.460 
the industrial-strength a double-sided
tape<00:01:29.420> double-sided<00:01:30.420> velcro<00:01:30.540> tape<00:01:30.990> actually

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
tape double-sided velcro tape actually

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.370 
tape double-sided velcro tape actually
and<00:01:31.970> hopefully<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.390> will<00:01:33.540> fix<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.020> problem

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and hopefully this will fix this problem

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740 
and hopefully this will fix this problem
it's<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.610> said<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.180> very<00:01:36.420> much

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it's not like I said it's not very much

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
I looked at it there's like nothing here

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.859 
I looked at it there's like nothing here
there's<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.250> no<00:01:53.430> dirt<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:53.880> debris<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.570> got

there's like no dirt or debris that got
underneath<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.920> no<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.630> does

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
underneath that but no it just it does

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.550 
underneath that but no it just it does
move<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.829> tiny<00:01:59.070> bit<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:02.270> I'm<00:02:03.270> gonna<00:02:03.509> put<00:02:04.290> like

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
move up a tiny bit so I'm gonna put like

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.139 
move up a tiny bit so I'm gonna put like
the<00:02:05.509> velcro<00:02:06.509> stuff<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.700> will<00:02:08.849> stay

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
the velcro stuff and see if it will stay

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
the velcro stuff and see if it will stay
like<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.560> passenger<00:02:11.039> side<00:02:11.069> there's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
like that on the passenger side there's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.610 
like that on the passenger side there's
no<00:02:11.520> problem<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.090> mean<00:02:12.330> it's

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
no problem I mean it's

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.149 
no problem I mean it's
then<00:02:12.769> fine<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.790> hasn't<00:02:14.209> moved<00:02:14.450> at<00:02:14.690> all<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.290> I'm

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
then fine it hasn't moved at all so I'm

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.800 
then fine it hasn't moved at all so I'm
pretty<00:02:16.370> happy<00:02:16.489> with<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.909> passenger<00:02:17.420> side<00:02:17.599> but

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
pretty happy with the passenger side but

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.470 
pretty happy with the passenger side but
the<00:02:17.930> driver<00:02:18.200> side<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.769> can<00:02:19.430> see<00:02:19.940> why<00:02:20.180> some

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
the driver side I can see why some

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.170 
the driver side I can see why some
people<00:02:20.750> say<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.290> does<00:02:21.530> move<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.909> mean

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
people say that it does move but I mean

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.309 
people say that it does move but I mean
it<00:02:23.360> moves<00:02:23.629> tiny<00:02:24.110> bit<00:02:24.440> not<00:02:24.980> much<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:26.319> that's

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
it moves tiny bit not much so that's
