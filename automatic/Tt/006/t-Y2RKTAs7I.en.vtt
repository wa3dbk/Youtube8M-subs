00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
guarantees very good performance we have

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.810 
guarantees very good performance we have
a<00:03:29.560> water<00:03:29.980> barrier<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:31.140> all<00:03:32.140> this<00:03:32.950> area<00:03:33.610> is

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
a water barrier and all this area is

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.100 
a water barrier and all this area is
waterproof<00:03:34.330> so<00:03:34.600> there<00:03:35.410> is<00:03:35.560> no<00:03:35.800> possibility<00:03:36.550> to

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
waterproof so there is no possibility to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.380 
waterproof so there is no possibility to
be<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.990> be<00:03:41.170> wet<00:03:41.590> because<00:03:42.250> simply<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.240> water

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
be to be wet because simply the water

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.130 
be to be wet because simply the water
doesn't<00:03:43.870> have<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.110> way<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.470> enter<00:03:45.070> ok<00:03:45.820> so<00:03:46.480> as<00:03:46.990> you

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
doesn't have a way to enter ok so as you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.230

all ce certified piece of equipment

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.440 
all ce certified piece of equipment
as<00:04:20.930> for<00:04:21.590> high<00:04:21.860> visibility<00:04:22.160> high<00:04:23.120> visibility

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
as for high visibility high visibility

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.060 
as for high visibility high visibility
is<00:04:23.750> very<00:04:23.840> important<00:04:24.470> because<00:04:24.560> when<00:04:24.890> it's

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
is very important because when it's

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.140 
is very important because when it's
raining<00:04:26.500> visibility<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.680> low<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.370> want

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
raining visibility is low and you want

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.790 
raining visibility is low and you want
to<00:04:29.210> be<00:04:29.330> as<00:04:29.540> much<00:04:30.200> visible<00:04:30.770> as<00:04:31.040> possible<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:32.800> cab

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
to be as much visible as possible so cab

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.150 
to be as much visible as possible so cab
driver<00:04:34.100> can<00:04:34.730> can<00:04:35.060> really<00:04:35.600> spot<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.200> from<00:04:36.740> far

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
driver can can really spot you from far
