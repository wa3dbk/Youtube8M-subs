then they said in order to close that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.980 
then they said in order to close that
they're<00:00:50.970> gonna<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.330> sniff<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> gum

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.840 
they're gonna have to sniff the gum
between<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.650> teeth<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.310> cut<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.790> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
between the teeth and cut it out and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.330 
between the teeth and cut it out and
then<00:00:54.150> I'd<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.540> wear<00:00:54.780> braces<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:56.310> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
then I'd have to wear braces and like a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.030 
then I'd have to wear braces and like a
head<00:00:56.640> unit<00:00:56.880> that<00:00:57.150> I'd<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.450> to<00:00:57.650> reel<00:00:58.650> in<00:00:58.890> at

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.680 
head unit that I'd have to reel in at
night<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.220> so<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.700> decided<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.150> that<00:01:00.240> was<00:01:00.540> way

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
night and so I decided that that was way

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.510 
night and so I decided that that was way
west<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.170> gap<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.590> kept<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.920 

I<00:01:06.780> build<00:01:08.520> BMX<00:01:09.520> bikes<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.330> I<00:01:10.420> just<00:01:10.659> started

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
rarely like things would come up and

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.190 
rarely like things would come up and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.840 
love it and I ride it as often as I can
and<00:01:25.720> then<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.229> got<00:01:26.409> so<00:01:26.560> addicted<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:27.220> it<00:01:27.460> I<00:01:27.640> built

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850

but<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.530> far<00:01:37.770> from<00:01:37.980> what<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.190> said<00:01:38.580> they<00:01:38.880> were

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
but so far from what I said they were

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
but so far from what I said they were
asking<00:01:39.720> me<00:01:39.780> specifically<00:01:40.770> about<00:01:41.100> guys<00:01:41.460> trying

should maybe not be so obvious about

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:00.520 
should maybe not be so obvious about
trying<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.260> pick<00:01:52.560> me<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.640> bar
