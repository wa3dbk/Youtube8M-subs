00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
doubt and then I take one of my

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.760 
doubt and then I take one of my
curlformers<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.360> take<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.720> hook<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.170> you

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
curlformers and I take the hook and you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.880 
curlformers and I take the hook and you
just<00:01:07.240> grab<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.420> end<00:01:08.600> of<00:01:08.810> it<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.140> slide<00:01:09.860> it

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
just grab the end of it and slide it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.580 
just grab the end of it and slide it
through<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.900> just<00:01:11.960> slide<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:12.380> all<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.500> way

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
through and just slide it all the way

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.550 
through and just slide it all the way
through<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.040> then<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:14.240> take<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.780> section<00:01:15.170> of

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
through so then you take a section of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.390 
through so then you take a section of
your<00:01:15.740> hair<00:01:15.800> um<00:01:17.020> I<00:01:18.020> tend<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.620> use<00:01:18.680> bigger

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
your hair um I tend to use bigger

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.070 
your hair um I tend to use bigger
sections<00:01:20.060> because<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.450> don't<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:20.690> that<00:01:20.780> many

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
sections because I don't have that many

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.720 
sections because I don't have that many
curlformers<00:01:21.470> if<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.130> can<00:01:22.280> use<00:01:22.400> smaller

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
curlformers if you can use smaller

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.450 
curlformers if you can use smaller
sections<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.870> be<00:01:24.080> better<00:01:24.260> so<00:01:24.800> my<00:01:24.950> sections

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
sections that be better so my sections

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.570 
sections that be better so my sections
are<00:01:25.670> usually<00:01:26.060> about<00:01:26.180> this<00:01:26.360> big<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.550> then<00:01:28.550> I

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
are usually about this big and then I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.730 
are usually about this big and then I
brush<00:01:28.940> through<00:01:29.360> it<00:01:29.480> because<00:01:29.960> if<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.619> don't

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
brush through it because if you don't

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.290 
brush through it because if you don't
brush<00:01:30.950> through<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:31.340> then<00:01:31.580> your<00:01:31.729> hair<00:01:31.970> will<00:01:32.180> get

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
brush through it then your hair will get

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.969 
brush through it then your hair will get
all<00:01:32.450> knotted<00:01:32.840> inside<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.290> crow<00:01:33.470> former<00:01:33.800> it'll

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
all knotted inside the crow former it'll

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.170 
all knotted inside the crow former it'll
be<00:01:34.130> really<00:01:34.790> painful<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.479> take<00:01:35.660> out<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:37.180> then

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
be really painful to take out and then

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.280 
be really painful to take out and then
you're<00:01:38.300> going<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.479> twist<00:01:38.630> your<00:01:38.840> hair<00:01:39.110> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
you're going to twist your hair and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.290 
you're going to twist your hair and
you're<00:01:40.250> going<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.430> take<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.850> hook<00:01:41.060> with<00:01:41.240> a

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
you're going to take the hook with a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.070 
you're going to take the hook with a
curl<00:01:41.570> former<00:01:41.869> on<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:43.600> hook<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.750> onto<00:01:44.900> your

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.620 
out on like hard and like crunchy and
they<00:02:39.230> didn't<00:02:39.530> look<00:02:39.890> real<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:41.209> they<00:02:41.360> didn't

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630

look<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:41.780> hair<00:02:42.230> they<00:02:42.410> looked<00:02:42.590> like

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
look like hair they looked like

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.220 
look like hair they looked like
something<00:02:43.010> had<00:02:43.160> been<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:44.060> set<00:02:44.510> into<00:02:44.810> my<00:02:44.930> hair

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
something had been like set into my hair

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.060 
something had been like set into my hair
and<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.620> didn't<00:02:46.370> look<00:02:46.400> good<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:47.450> now<00:02:47.950> I've<00:02:48.950> been

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
and it didn't look good so now I've been

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.009 
and it didn't look good so now I've been
using<00:02:49.280> them<00:02:49.519> dry<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.209> I've<00:02:50.450> actually<00:02:50.720> been

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
using them dry and I've actually been

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.770 
using them dry and I've actually been
getting<00:02:51.440> really<00:02:51.769> good<00:02:52.130> results<00:02:52.790> from<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.209> it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
getting really good results from it it

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.050 
getting really good results from it it
looks<00:02:54.110> like<00:02:54.320> my<00:02:54.470> spiral<00:02:54.860> curling<00:02:55.459> iron<00:02:55.730> curls

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
looks like my spiral curling iron curls

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.900 
looks like my spiral curling iron curls
and<00:02:56.440> um<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.709> probably<00:02:58.310> should<00:02:58.880> have<00:02:59.000> gotten<00:02:59.299> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
and um I probably should have gotten the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.760 
and um I probably should have gotten the
Giron's<00:03:00.300> these<00:03:00.570> are<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.930> normal<00:03:01.320> ones<00:03:01.530> long
