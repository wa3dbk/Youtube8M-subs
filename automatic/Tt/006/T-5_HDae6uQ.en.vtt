00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.260
Yo what's going on, guys?

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.160
Troy here with Muscle Tactics, chillin' up
here in Hollywood hills.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.580
We got the symbolic Hollywood sign behind
me.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.580
And you know what's crazy?

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.440
Every time I look at it, I'm like, That's
it.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.951
It's like people have this image in their
head that it's this gigantic sign and then

00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:17.860
you get up here and it's just a tiny, little
sign.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.330
Still pretty cool, still an amazing view.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.039
We got up here downtown Los Angeles.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.140
You could even see all the way if I can get
my camera guy to rotate all the way over - you

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.020
could even see Santa Monica beach and the
ocean in the background, so pretty much at

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.870
the top of L.A. up here.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.800
I actually just got back from the Mr. Olympia
Convention in Las Vegas.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.379
I met so many people that I just learned a
ton from, some of the top fitness models - had

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.239
a great chance to talk with Greg Plitt, someone
I've always looked up to in the fitness industry.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.399
I talked to Rob Riches, talked to Jim Stoppani
- the doctor from bodybuilding.com.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.070
I actually was in the gym at six in the morning
and saw Kai Greene, the dude who took second

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.260
at the Mr. Olympia contest.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.199
So brushed shoulders, talked to people at
the very top of the fitness industry, and

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.370
I learned some incredible knowledge on a lot
of great diet tricks on how to really get

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.950
big, how to manipulate those hormones.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:23.420
Two things that I learned that are really
powerful for lean muscle gains is the concept

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.580
of carbohydrate backloading and intermittent
fasting.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.790
I think that if you combine them both, it's
going to give you guys incredible results

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.760
- really powerful, anabolic overload on your
body.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.620
I don't want to dive into too much scientific
facts regarding intermittent fasting.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.840
I know the HodgeTwins have a channel &amp; I believe
it's just called FastingTwins.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.810
It's all about intermittent fasting and all
the science around it.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.140
But I think the combination of carb backloading
and intermittent fasting is really the best

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.170
of both worlds.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.740
Intermittent fasting is when you go &amp; you
have just an eating window.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.080
A really easy way to do it is you have, say,
an 8-hour window where you consume all your

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.360
food, then you go 16 hours without eating.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.349
This has really great hormonal benefits and
it increases your testosterone, increases

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.950
your HGH, helps you stay lean and actually
going to help you build muscle.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.549
I'm not going to dive into the science and
all that; that'll definitely be in another

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.489
video, but I want to combine that with carbohydrate
backloading.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.579
Carbohydrate backloading, I think, is one
of the best things that you can do as a naturally

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.239
skinny guy to maximize your lean muscle gains.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.129
I've been doing this recently, and I'm really
trying to get lean here over the next couple

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.090
of months, and I think carbohydrate backloading
is one of the best strategies for achieving

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.890
that, especially in conjunction with intermittent
fasting.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.099
How I do carbohydrate backloading is, first
off, I'll stop eating at around 6, 7 somewhere

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.400
between 6 and 8 pm the night before, and then
I'll wake up and I will work out actually

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.870
on an empty stomach.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.370
So when you combine this with intermittent
fasting, it's really easy to pull off.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.980
So obviously if I stop eating at 6 o'clock
the next night and I wake up at 8am, get my

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.450
workout in, and all of a sudden it's 10pm
- I've essentially gone 16 hours without eating

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.829
anything if you go from 6pm to 10am the next
day.

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.810
So it's really easy to incorporate the concepts
of intermittent fasting along with your carbohydrate

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.099
backloading.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.400
So how I do carbohydrate backloading - well
obviously, stop eating between 6 and 8pm the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.540
night before.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.069
I'll get up, I'll work out on an empty stomach
and then I will consume all my day's carbohydrates

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.749
after I work out.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:28.860
That's the whole backloading part.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.569
You're consuming all of your carbs post-workout.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.290
And I noticed somewhat - you'd think your
energy levels will be really low.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.670
Well my energy levels are sky high when I
do this.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.849
When I was - I couldn't believe one time,
I actually worked out in the gym where I hadn't

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.099
eaten anything in 18 hours, my energy levels
were sky high.

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.420
So you kind of reach that point where you're
hungry from hours, maybe 4 through 6 or 4

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.400
through 8, and then all of a sudden you get
to that point where you feel good because

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.269
- keep in mind that it takes energy to digest
a lot of food, and I notice when I eat really

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.300
big meals and I try to go to the gym, in an
hour or two hours after that I just feel a

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.959
little lethargic, a little slow.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.749
So I'll wake up, I'll drink a ton of water
- sometimes I'll have green tea or coffee.

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:11.749
And that's another thing.

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.639
If you guys take pre-workout, or you do coffee
or green tea, and you do it on an empty stomach,

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.950
it is very, very powerful.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.730
You're going to feel the effects of that caffeine,
feel the effects of that pre-workout a lot

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.730
more.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.360
So that is something that I highly recommend
that you guys do.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.640
Back to the carbohydrate backloading.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.360
I get in that great workout, and then post-workout
- instantly, I hit that post-workout insulin

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.640
spike, so the first thing that goes in my
body is my fast-digesting whey shake with

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.540
my fast-digesting dextrose or Maltodextrin
power.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.620
I have 50-60 grams of fast-digesting carbs
- that'll be my first meal.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.560
Then about an hour later, I will have more
fast-digesting carbs.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.260
I'll have some white rice or jasmine rice
- basmati rice, another personal favorite.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.640
Some kind of rapid-digesting carb, maybe some
white potato, but some other form of a simple

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.170
digesting carb, and then maybe about an hour
and a half to two hours later, I'll slowly

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.530
transition from those rapid-digesting carbohydrates
to the slower complex carbs.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.170
Now I'll start working in things like sweet
potatoes, oatmeal, black beans, quinoa, so

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.000
it's a transition from hitting those really
rapid-digesting carbs as I get that insulin

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.570
spike, then you go for those slow-digesting
complex carbohydrates.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.230
So I will consume all my carbohydrates for
my day, post-workout.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.130
This has the most anabolic effect.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.130
Keep in mind that post-workout insulin is
very anabolic, so you want to be consuming

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.170
all of your body - all of your carbohydrates
for the day post-workout, ideally, if you

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.450
want to maximize your insulin levels for lean
muscle building.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.320
Insulin is actually - I read in the book Nutrient
Timing - the most anabolic hormone in your

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.320
body.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.790
That's why pro bodybuilders are obviously
kind of guinea pigs where they're injecting

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.380
testosterone and HGH and all those crap in
their body, and obviously that's super dangerous.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.390
But one of the things they actually inject
is insulin just because it's so anabolic.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.940
So you guys can kind of do it the healthy
way and just carb backload, consume all of

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.160
your daily carbohydrates post-workout.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.150
That's a really easy way to do carb backloading;
obviously it's easy to mix in intermittent

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.530
fasting along with carb backloading if you
just cut off your meals, 5, 6, 7pm the day

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.530
before.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.630
So I highly recommend to you guys, try carb
backloading.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.170
It's always good to throw new things into
your diet to kind of shock it up, so if you

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.581
guys are having trouble with your lean muscle
gains, maybe trying carb backloading will

00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:22.200
really hit that heavy insulin spike post-workout.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:07:01.620
You guys will burst through that plateau and
see some incredible lean muscle gains.
