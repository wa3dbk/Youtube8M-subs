you know h1 h2 and h3 variants all them
are<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:23.760> pretty<00:00:23.939> form<00:00:24.619> but<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.010> finally<00:00:26.910> got

around<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.510> add<00:00:28.439> more<00:00:28.859> paint<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.179> RC<00:00:30.599> age

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
around to add more paint on the RC age

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.920 
around to add more paint on the RC age
and<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.820> working<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.480> pretty<00:00:33.660> well

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
and it's working out pretty well

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.319 
and it's working out pretty well
I<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.620> need<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> pound<00:00:35.309> line<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.030> maybe<00:00:36.270> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
I do need to pound line it and maybe I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.569 
I do need to pound line it and maybe I
don't<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.750> little<00:00:37.110> bit<00:00:37.200> more<00:00:37.320> touch-up<00:00:37.739> I'd

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
don't a little bit more touch-up I'd

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.750 
don't a little bit more touch-up I'd

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
go we have the RC each year and again

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.690 
go we have the RC each year and again
it's<00:00:48.719> based<00:00:49.050> off<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.530> guy<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> bought

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

this one I mean to make the kind of like
the<00:01:18.450> remote<00:01:18.720> control

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the remote control

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.630 
the remote control
I<00:01:19.670> remember<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.049> remember<00:01:22.920> seeing<00:01:23.220> RC

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
I remember you can remember seeing RC

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.789 
I remember you can remember seeing RC
with<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.000> type<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.540> control<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
with this type of control or it's like a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.819 
with this type of control or it's like a
gun<00:01:26.720> basically<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.409> that's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
gun basically it's it's that that's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.330 
gun basically it's it's that that's
rifle<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.390> separate<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.869> part<00:01:31.340> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
rifle you just separate that part and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.719 
rifle you just separate that part and
you<00:01:32.579> wind<00:01:32.880> up<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:34.579> a<00:01:35.579> wire<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.590> go

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
you wind up at a wire and there we go

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.510 
you wind up at a wire and there we go
got<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> remote<00:01:39.060> control<00:01:39.450> over<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:41.009> for

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
got a remote control over there and for

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.950 
got a remote control over there and for
the<00:01:41.579> RC<00:01:41.970> h<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:46.790> couple<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:48.060> things<00:01:48.299> as<00:01:48.810> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the RC h and a couple of things as you

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.190 
the RC h and a couple of things as you
can<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:52.140> first<00:01:52.799> off<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.040> need<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> base

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
can see so first off you need the base

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.670 
can see so first off you need the base
well<00:01:55.939> well<00:01:56.939> what's<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.630> called<00:01:57.810> I'm<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.590> like

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
well well what's it called I'm just like

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.200 
well well what's it called I'm just like
a<00:01:58.710> spaceship<00:01:59.280> where<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.850> put<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
a spaceship where you can put all the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.410 
a spaceship where you can put all the
armors<00:02:00.659> together<00:02:01.909> it's<00:02:02.909> right<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
armors together it's right there in the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.539 
armors together it's right there in the
middle<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.409> painted<00:02:04.740> block<00:02:05.009> right<00:02:05.490> in

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
middle it's the I painted block right in

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.350 
middle it's the I painted block right in
the<00:02:05.759> core<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.920> you'll<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.429> needing<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the core so you'll be needing that and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.479 
the core so you'll be needing that and
basically<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.739> see<00:02:10.979> here<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.459> have

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
basically as you can see here we have

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.809 
basically as you can see here we have
the<00:02:11.700> legs<00:02:11.910> here

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
the legs here

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.550 
the legs here
arms<00:02:13.230> Fortis<00:02:14.230> Paulo<00:02:15.480> tight<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.659> shoulder

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
arms Fortis Paulo tight the shoulder

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.229 
arms Fortis Paulo tight the shoulder
another<00:02:17.859> part<00:02:18.189> of<00:02:18.249> the<00:02:18.340> arm<00:02:18.549> I<00:02:18.909> think<00:02:18.939> just

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
another part of the arm I think just

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.649 
another part of the arm I think just
just<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> regular<00:02:19.870> hands<00:02:20.469> in<00:02:21.310> there<00:02:21.819> let's

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
just a regular hands in there let's

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:23.879 
just a regular hands in there let's
actually<00:02:22.810> think<00:02:23.139> of<00:02:23.200> putting<00:02:23.379> something<00:02:23.709> on

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
actually think of putting something on

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.300 
actually think of putting something on
the<00:02:24.010> bottom<00:02:24.189> here<00:02:24.579> but<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:26.319> space<00:02:26.889> is<00:02:26.920> limited

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the bottom here but the space is limited

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.110 
the bottom here but the space is limited

part if I want to or make me tilt on one

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.599 
part if I want to or make me tilt on one
side<00:03:21.870> it's<00:03:22.870> kind<00:03:23.379> of<00:03:23.409> like<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.620> Batman<00:03:24.189> tumbler

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
side it's kind of like a Batman tumbler

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.339 
side it's kind of like a Batman tumbler
and<00:03:25.169> I<00:03:26.169> really<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:26.680> how<00:03:26.829> this<00:03:27.009> turned<00:03:27.280> out

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
and I really like how this turned out

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.539 
and I really like how this turned out
yeah<00:03:29.349> again<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.919> still<00:03:30.099> need<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.370> do<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> little

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
yeah again I still need to do a little

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.050 
yeah again I still need to do a little
bit<00:03:30.729> of<00:03:30.819> touch-up<00:03:31.060> paint<00:03:32.340> maybe<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.609> little<00:03:33.939> bit

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
bit of touch-up paint maybe a little bit

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.409 
bit of touch-up paint maybe a little bit
of<00:03:34.859> like<00:03:35.859> oh<00:03:37.799> I<00:03:38.799> was<00:03:39.430> thinking<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.849> adding<00:03:40.060> a

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
of like oh I was thinking of adding a

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.999 
of like oh I was thinking of adding a
bit<00:03:40.569> more<00:03:40.599> design<00:03:41.049> on<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.259> wheels<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:41.859> it

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:42.009 
bit more design on the wheels so it

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.270 
bit more design on the wheels so it
looks<00:03:42.579> more<00:03:42.669> dynamic

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
looks more dynamic

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.689 
looks more dynamic
maybe<00:03:45.479> just<00:03:46.479> some<00:03:46.780> flames<00:03:47.439> or<00:03:48.040> some<00:03:48.370> spirals

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
maybe just some flames or some spirals

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.379 
maybe just some flames or some spirals
so<00:03:49.689> that<00:03:49.900> looks<00:03:50.169> like<00:03:50.290> it's<00:03:50.500> moving<00:03:51.239> but<00:03:52.239> yeah

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
so that looks like it's moving but yeah

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.969 
so that looks like it's moving but yeah
I<00:03:52.569> really<00:03:53.139> like<00:03:53.379> how<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.650> turned<00:03:53.680> out<00:03:54.479> in<00:03:55.979> yeah

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:56.979 
I really like how it turned out in yeah

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.699 
I really like how it turned out in yeah
so<00:03:57.729> this<00:03:57.849> is<00:03:57.909> just<00:03:58.060> an<00:03:58.209> h1<00:03:58.719> I<00:03:58.959> did<00:03:59.530> the

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
so this is just an h1 I did the

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.129 
so this is just an h1 I did the
spaceship<00:04:00.129> for<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.400> each<00:04:00.609> do<00:04:01.000> in<00:04:01.329> some<00:04:01.930> kind

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
spaceship for the each do in some kind

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.069 
spaceship for the each do in some kind
of<00:04:02.169> battle<00:04:03.299> battleship

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
of battle battleship

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.029 
of battle battleship
forward<00:04:05.859> h3<00:04:07.139> when<00:04:08.139> I<00:04:08.169> get<00:04:08.409> around<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.979> will

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:09.039 
forward h3 when I get around I will

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.749 
forward h3 when I get around I will
paint<00:04:09.669> those<00:04:09.879> and<00:04:10.239> show<00:04:10.659> those<00:04:10.979> but<00:04:11.979> I<00:04:12.009> did<00:04:12.459> I

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:12.759 
paint those and show those but I did I

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.449 
paint those and show those but I did I

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
think I'm not sure if I made a video of

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.159 
think I'm not sure if I made a video of
this<00:04:15.699> or<00:04:15.939> anyway<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.299> other<00:04:16.359> ones<00:04:16.719> when<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:16.989> was

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169

another<00:04:45.400> thing<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.819> it's<00:04:46.300> just<00:04:46.539> gotta<00:04:46.810> hold

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
another thing it it's just gotta hold
