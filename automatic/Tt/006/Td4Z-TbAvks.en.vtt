00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
biggest plane in the game and two it's

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.910 
biggest plane in the game and two it's
the<00:00:17.100> worst<00:00:17.550> plane<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.570> game<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:19.650> thing

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the worst plane and the game this thing

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.259 
the worst plane and the game this thing
right<00:00:20.130> here<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:21.650> abysmally<00:00:22.650> shit<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.580> every

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
right here is abysmally shit and every

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.589 
right here is abysmally shit and every
single<00:00:24.840> aspect<00:00:25.640> so<00:00:26.640> we're<00:00:27.119> there<00:00:27.240> couple<00:00:27.480> of

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
single aspect so we're there couple of

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.599 
single aspect so we're there couple of
games<00:00:27.779> I'll<00:00:28.199> review<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.920> I'll<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> couple

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
games I'll review and I'll do a couple

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.250 
games I'll review and I'll do a couple
of<00:00:29.670> comparisons<00:00:30.269> between<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.929> some<00:00:31.230> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
of comparisons between this and some of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.080 
of comparisons between this and some of
the<00:00:31.410> bear<00:00:31.560> planes<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> game<00:00:32.340> bombers<00:00:32.880> of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the bear planes in the game bombers of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.549 
the bear planes in the game bombers of
the<00:00:33.239> equivalent<00:00:33.600> tears<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.140> we'll<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the equivalent tears and we'll have a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:01:02.330 
the equivalent tears and we'll have a
couple<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> games<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.790> go

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.040 

so<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.460> g5<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:03.970> one<00:01:04.270> has<00:01:04.510> a<00:01:04.540> very<00:01:04.750> limited

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
so the g5 and one has a very limited

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.530 
so the g5 and one has a very limited
bomb<00:01:05.530> Lord<00:01:05.880> only<00:01:06.880> carries<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.660> maximum<00:01:07.960> of<00:01:08.470> four

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
bomb Lord only carries a maximum of four

1000 kilogram bombs and the secondary

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.200 
1000 kilogram bombs and the secondary
one<00:01:13.420> is<00:01:13.720> 12<00:01:14.110> 250<00:01:14.890> s<00:01:14.950> and<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.430> default<00:01:15.820> stock

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
one is 12 250 s and the default stock

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.280 
one is 12 250 s and the default stock
one<00:01:16.480> is<00:01:16.720> 24<00:01:17.260> 50s<00:01:18.270> personally<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.300> like<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.840> 12

one is 24 50s personally I like the 12
250<00:01:21.010> is<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.160> best<00:01:21.370> because<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:21.940> get<00:01:22.060> more

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
250 is the best because you can get more

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.480

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
had but so far this thing is complete

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
utter pig shit and you can just see it

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.260 
utter pig shit and you can just see it
so<00:01:46.990> bad<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.740> control<00:01:48.190> there's<00:01:49.030> absolutely

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
so bad to control there's absolutely

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.749 
so bad to control there's absolutely
nothing<00:01:50.110> good<00:01:50.650> about<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:50.920> thing<00:01:51.250> other<00:01:51.490> than

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
nothing good about this thing other than

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.249 
nothing good about this thing other than
the<00:01:51.910> fact<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.420> takes<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.720> couple<00:01:52.900> of<00:01:53.050> hits

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
the fact that it takes a couple of hits

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.780 
the fact that it takes a couple of hits
and<00:01:54.090> yeah<00:01:55.090> that's<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.229> pollen<00:01:56.740> right<00:01:57.490> so

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
and yeah that's just a pollen right so

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.320 
and yeah that's just a pollen right so
we<00:01:58.000> will<00:01:58.270> go<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:59.580> left<00:02:00.580> side<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.119> map

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
we will go to the left side of the map

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.029 
we will go to the left side of the map
because<00:02:01.600> there's<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.170> couple<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.470> times<00:02:02.710> as<00:02:03.009> a

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
because there's a couple of times as a

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.760 
because there's a couple of times as a
Colin<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.700> medium<00:02:04.060> ones<00:02:04.270> don't<00:02:04.450> know<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:04.899> I

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
Colin of medium ones don't know and I

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.570 
Colin of medium ones don't know and I
think<00:02:05.830> that's<00:02:06.039> probably<00:02:06.700> my<00:02:07.149> best<00:02:07.300> bet<00:02:07.660> now

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
think that's probably my best bet now

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.380 
think that's probably my best bet now
there's<00:02:09.580> one<00:02:09.729> thing<00:02:09.850> they<00:02:09.970> also<00:02:10.119> want<00:02:10.360> to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
there's one thing they also want to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.500 
there's one thing they also want to
point<00:02:10.539> out<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:10.929> machine<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:12.510> basically

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
point out in this machine is basically

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.910 
point out in this machine is basically
you<00:02:13.660> know<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.260> take<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> plane<00:02:14.740> into

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
you know you take a plane into

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.309 
you know you take a plane into
historical<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.390> performs<00:02:16.780> completely

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
historical and it performs completely

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.809 
historical and it performs completely
differently<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.770> lot<00:02:17.950> more<00:02:18.100> realistic<00:02:18.340> can't

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
differently a lot more realistic can't

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.840 
differently a lot more realistic can't
just<00:02:19.180> handles<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.990> bit<00:02:20.140> more<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.410> pig<00:02:20.850> well

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
just handles a bit more like a pig well

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.590 
just handles a bit more like a pig well
this<00:02:22.780> thing<00:02:23.050> basically<00:02:23.319> in<00:02:23.950> our<00:02:24.430> kid<00:02:24.730> handles

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
this thing basically in our kid handles

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.140 
this thing basically in our kid handles
like<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.900> should<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.230> historical<00:02:26.740> I<00:02:27.150> think

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
like it should be in historical I think

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.220 
like it should be in historical I think
they've<00:02:28.270> just<00:02:28.420> pity<00:02:28.600> historical<00:02:29.050> flight

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230

they've just pity historical flight
model<00:02:29.410> entire<00:02:29.860> kit<00:02:30.160> as<00:02:30.400> well<00:02:30.430> because<00:02:31.000> there's

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
model entire kit as well because there's

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.730 
model entire kit as well because there's
no<00:02:31.420> difference<00:02:31.810> between<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.260> arcade<00:02:32.590> model

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
no difference between the arcade model

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.850 
no difference between the arcade model
and<00:02:33.069> historical<00:02:33.490> model<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.910> exactly<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.540> same

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and historical model is exactly the same

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.230 
and historical model is exactly the same
which<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.010> kind<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.310> really<00:02:36.490> big<00:02:36.670> issue<00:02:36.910> and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
which is kind of really big issue and

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.300 
which is kind of really big issue and
look<00:02:37.569> it's<00:02:37.840> just<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.670> difficult<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:41.800> point<00:02:42.130> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
look it's just so difficult to point the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.650 
look it's just so difficult to point the
fucking<00:02:42.819> thing<00:02:43.090> out<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.840> targets<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:46.510> can

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
fucking thing out the targets you can

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.660 
fucking thing out the targets you can
see<00:02:46.840> what<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.020> mean<00:02:47.110> you're<00:02:47.319> just<00:02:47.590> lack<00:02:48.490> of

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
see what I mean you're just lack of

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.530 
see what I mean you're just lack of

so with a whole total of about two grand

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.010

happens<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.870> lot<00:03:44.020> of<00:03:44.050> bombers<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.590> be

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
happens and a lot of bombers to be

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.460 
happens and a lot of bombers to be
honest<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:46.090> is<00:03:46.270> why<00:03:46.420> high<00:03:46.630> tier<00:03:46.840> bombing<00:03:47.260> is

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
honest this is why high tier bombing is

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.670 
honest this is why high tier bombing is
useless<00:03:48.040> even<00:03:48.730> with<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.060> b-17s<00:03:49.720> or<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.470> year

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
to year two is at the exception because

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.400 
to year two is at the exception because
they're<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.540> best<00:03:52.750> bombers<00:03:53.080> in<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.230> game

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
they're the best bombers in the game

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.710 
they're the best bombers in the game
right<00:03:53.830> here<00:03:53.890> anyway<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:57.450> for<00:03:58.450> these<00:03:58.510> high

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
right here anyway but for these high

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.740 
right here anyway but for these high
tier<00:03:58.930> bombers<00:03:59.350> are<00:03:59.530> just<00:03:59.680> useless<00:04:00.750> complete

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
tier bombers are just useless complete

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.740 
tier bombers are just useless complete
and<00:04:01.930> utter<00:04:01.990> garbage<00:04:03.420> there's<00:04:04.420> really<00:04:04.630> nothing

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
and utter garbage there's really nothing

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.790 
and utter garbage there's really nothing
you<00:04:05.050> can<00:04:05.140> do<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:08.050> don't<00:04:08.230> even<00:04:08.350> have<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.590> worry

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
you can do you don't even have to worry

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.330 
you can do you don't even have to worry
about<00:04:09.010> jets<00:04:09.430> because<00:04:10.620> even<00:04:11.620> prop<00:04:11.830> planes<00:04:12.070> can

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
about jets because even prop planes can

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:22.080 
about jets because even prop planes can
just<00:04:12.520> destroy<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:15.989> another<00:04:16.989> I'm<00:04:17.560> goin<00:04:17.799> down

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.400 

not<00:04:23.050> very<00:04:23.320> good<00:04:23.620> at<00:04:24.040> all<00:04:24.840> no<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:25.990> we'll<00:04:26.110> move<00:04:26.230> on

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
not very good at all no so we'll move on

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.040 
not very good at all no so we'll move on
to<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.620> historical<00:04:27.190> battle<00:04:27.490> um<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:28.780> game

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
to the historical battle um this game

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.310 
to the historical battle um this game
was<00:04:29.500> an<00:04:29.680> HP<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:31.270> be<00:04:31.389> honest<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.870> was<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.110> bit

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
was an HP and to be honest it was a bit

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.770 
was an HP and to be honest it was a bit
better<00:04:32.440> actually<00:04:32.850> because<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:34.150> flight<00:04:34.570> model

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
better actually because the flight model

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.950 
better actually because the flight model
is<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.169> same<00:04:35.410> as<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.770> wasn't<00:04:35.919> arcade<00:04:36.930> for<00:04:37.930> some

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
is the same as it wasn't arcade for some

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.420 
is the same as it wasn't arcade for some
reason<00:04:38.380> I'm<00:04:38.470> able<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.710> just<00:04:38.949> get<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:39.130> couple

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
reason I'm able to just get a couple

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.629 
reason I'm able to just get a couple
more<00:04:39.610> kills<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:41.560> it's<00:04:41.680> not<00:04:41.770> entirely<00:04:42.100> all<00:04:42.430> that

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
more kills so it's not entirely all that

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.210 
more kills so it's not entirely all that
bad<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:47.050> cut<00:04:47.320> this<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.470> little<00:04:47.680> bit<00:04:47.889> and<00:04:47.979> get

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
bad so cut this a little bit and get

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.040 
bad so cut this a little bit and get
further<00:04:48.400> up<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.760> auction<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.300> here<00:04:49.900> we

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
further up to the auction and here we

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.500 
further up to the auction and here we
are<00:04:50.139> now<00:04:53.700> I've<00:04:54.700> got<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.910> first<00:04:55.120> line<00:04:55.360> up

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
are now I've got the first line up

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.260 
are now I've got the first line up
pretty<00:04:55.750> good<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:56.520> think<00:04:57.520> about<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.790> second<00:04:58.150> one

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
pretty good I think about the second one

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.810 
pretty good I think about the second one
as<00:04:58.389> well<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.770> then<00:05:02.950> I'll<00:05:03.190> just<00:05:03.220> start<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.729> go

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
as well and then I'll just start to go

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.230 
as well and then I'll just start to go
wrong<00:05:07.410> now<00:05:08.410> I've<00:05:08.530> not<00:05:08.710> really<00:05:09.669> been<00:05:09.820> hit<00:05:10.120> at

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
wrong now I've not really been hit at

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.940 
wrong now I've not really been hit at
all<00:05:10.389> yeah<00:05:10.630> it's<00:05:11.020> only<00:05:11.110> flag<00:05:11.440> that<00:05:11.620> shooting<00:05:11.889> at

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
all yeah it's only flag that shooting at

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.980 
all yeah it's only flag that shooting at
me<00:05:12.040> right<00:05:12.190> now<00:05:12.220> but<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:13.030> plane<00:05:13.330> handles<00:05:13.810> like

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
me right now but the plane handles like

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.469 
me right now but the plane handles like
it's<00:05:14.169> on<00:05:14.320> fucking<00:05:14.830> fire<00:05:17.400> I'm<00:05:18.400> trying<00:05:19.180> to<00:05:19.300> turn

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
it's on fucking fire I'm trying to turn

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.689 
it's on fucking fire I'm trying to turn
to<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.690> left<00:05:19.900> I'm<00:05:20.320> mashing<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:21.010> a<00:05:21.130> button<00:05:21.400> and

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
to the left I'm mashing the a button and

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.879 
to the left I'm mashing the a button and
I'm<00:05:22.690> actually<00:05:22.930> trying<00:05:23.289> to<00:05:23.410> turn<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.740> left

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
I'm actually trying to turn to the left

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.920 
I'm actually trying to turn to the left
and<00:05:24.130> hit<00:05:24.250> these<00:05:24.370> bolts<00:05:24.850> bears<00:05:25.449> not<00:05:25.600> letting<00:05:25.840> me

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
and hit these bolts bears not letting me

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.800 
and hit these bolts bears not letting me
it's<00:05:26.139> refusing<00:05:29.639> so<00:05:30.639> I<00:05:30.669> think<00:05:30.789> fuck<00:05:31.180> it<00:05:31.360> I'll

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
it's refusing so I think fuck it I'll

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.480 
it's refusing so I think fuck it I'll
just<00:05:31.990> go<00:05:32.110> for<00:05:32.260> this<00:05:32.380> one<00:05:32.440> instead<00:05:32.860> because<00:05:33.220> i'm

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
just go for this one instead because i'm

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.980 
just go for this one instead because i'm
not<00:05:33.639> going<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:33.880> go<00:05:34.000> to<00:05:34.060> turn<00:05:34.270> to<00:05:34.389> the<00:05:34.510> left<00:05:34.660> it

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
not going to go to turn to the left it

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.770 
not going to go to turn to the left it
doesn't<00:05:35.200> like<00:05:35.320> me<00:05:39.240> with<00:05:40.240> all<00:05:40.360> this<00:05:40.479> flak

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
doesn't like me with all this flak

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.240 
doesn't like me with all this flak
shouldn't<00:05:41.139> be<00:05:41.200> in<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.349> ass<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.770> it's<00:05:42.099> not

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
shouldn't be in the ass and it's not

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.480 
shouldn't be in the ass and it's not
really<00:05:42.310> helping<00:05:43.620> you<00:05:44.620> can<00:05:44.740> use<00:05:44.889> combat<00:05:45.280> flaps

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
really helping you can use combat flaps

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.060 
really helping you can use combat flaps
on<00:05:45.700> this<00:05:45.820> thing<00:05:46.000> but<00:05:46.410> so<00:05:47.410> far<00:05:47.650> there's<00:05:47.889> minimal

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
on this thing but so far there's minimal

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.670 
on this thing but so far there's minimal
difference

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.809 

alright<00:05:55.680> so<00:05:55.889> I've<00:05:56.039> finally<00:05:56.069> got<00:05:56.550> to<00:05:56.639> turn

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
alright so I've finally got to turn

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.320 
alright so I've finally got to turn
around<00:05:56.849> and<00:05:58.280> try<00:05:59.280> lighting<00:05:59.610> my<00:05:59.819> targets<00:06:00.240> up

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330
