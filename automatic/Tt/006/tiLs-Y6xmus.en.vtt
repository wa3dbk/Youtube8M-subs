chord meaning that the heating could the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.950 
chord meaning that the heating could the
heaters<00:01:19.510> are<00:01:19.659> always<00:01:19.960> on<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.170> back<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.840> you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
heaters are always on the back and you

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.169 

then<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.049> side<00:01:34.320> wall<00:01:34.590> will<00:01:34.770> come<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.179> and

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
then your side wall will come in and

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.529 
then your side wall will come in and
your<00:01:36.899> right<00:01:37.140> side<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:38.119> we'll<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.270> the

your right side well we'll have the
bench<00:02:09.619> okay<00:02:14.959> there<00:02:16.430> sometimes<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.549> can<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
bench okay there sometimes it can be a

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.550 
bench okay there sometimes it can be a
little<00:02:18.000> tricky<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.540> persuasiveness<00:02:19.140> makes

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
little tricky but persuasiveness makes

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.039 
little tricky but persuasiveness makes
it<00:02:19.709> work<00:02:19.920> now<00:02:20.819> your<00:02:21.030> next<00:02:21.209> pieces<00:02:21.569> are<00:02:21.900> going

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049
