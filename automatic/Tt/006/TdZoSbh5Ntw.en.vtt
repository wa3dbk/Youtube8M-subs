00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.820
 I'll fulfill my dream a trip to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:22.029
 to know the places 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:25.070
 best one of the world's dear diary 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.020
 After a long time researching, I'm going 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.210
 know the places where they are 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.210
 produced the best wines in the world 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.330
 I learned that the first vineyards were 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.780
 planted where today the junction 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.350
 between turkey and georgia 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.949
 this was more than five thousand years ago 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.199
 helena that already in the chip king of that region 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.649
 would have built a large wall for 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.750
 save the fighting animals in your court 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.239
 the rains were kept in jazz for 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.110
 be eaten out of season 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.390
 The Maharajas was once full of juice. 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.479
 the grapes frothed and there was a smell 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.420
 strange being left behind because they are 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.509
 inappropriate to eat and considered 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.229
 a possible poison a damsel donate 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.350
 She tried to kill herself by ingesting liquids 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.259
 death she found joy and restful 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 sound and the king saw that it was good and 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.259
 called that drink 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.710
 devine writing about wine wants 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.740
 any tips i know all about wines 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.750
 What a coincidence, I'm from the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.750
 wine a long time ago 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.380
 and I do not know that much for example 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.320
 where is the closest place to us that 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.869
 has the best wines for sure. 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.260
 argentina and chile that 's where I go 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.700
 know the grapes malbec carmine but not 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.240
 Can we forget about Uruguay? 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.570
 interesting 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.820
 I can go with you, legends do not lack for 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.950
 explain the origin of wine but the 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.070
 The first official reports were 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.160
 recorded by the ancient Egyptians 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.590
 the 1000s and 3000s before Christ in the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.260
 tombs of the pharaohs there are paintings 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.440
 details of the stages of 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.650
 in addition to scenes describing 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.920
 how wines were measured in the tomb of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.190
 tutancÃ¢mon were found 36 amphorae 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.640
 with inscriptions of the region harvested name of the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.470
 merchant and some stocking of which 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.630
 the wine is of good quality 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.910
 wine was incorporated into civilization 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.670
 profoundly western 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.000
 This is due to the ritual importance 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.480
 Greeks gave the bible Dionysius god 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.480
 Greek wine was worshiped there who 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.850
 philosophy and science and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.220
 policy in ancient Greece and will serve as 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.709
 the basis for Western thinking does not 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.680
 would have gone so far as to be a wine 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.450
 because the debates and symposia 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.549
 when the presents challenged the others 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.890
 in real intelligence battles 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.860
 were always watered with wine 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.630
 the Greek Plato philosopher used to say 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.010
 that wine was a great way to 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.840
 to test the character of one then to his 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.810
 name has to do with wine 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.910
 Yes, my father is a great connoisseur. 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.250
 mentioned almost everything I know 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.549
 now I want to learn more and become a 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.130
 great connoisseur and I too 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.030
 I know that wines can have several 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.870
 Colors 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.140
 Did you know that one I already knew but there is 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.799
 other things I know I 'm sure 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.049
 Yes 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.120
 when I came to Italy reached spread 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.420
 quickly across Europe 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.980
 as the Roman Empire advanced 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.980
 vineyards were implanted and beverages 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.469
 widespread in a short time the habit of 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.989
 drinking wine daily reached the 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:10.930
 most of the countries of the old continent 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.090
 later the European trailblazers 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.019
 vineyards to the countries of the new 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.680
 world like brazil united states chile 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:24.940
 argentina uruguay and south africa 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.940
 australia and others in the 19th century with 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.910
 integration of culture and the 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.880
 intensified in these countries. 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.270
 currently the European countries are the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.580
 major producers and consumers in 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.070
 contemporary society the concept of 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.099
 wine goes beyond a simple drink is 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.590
 a food every day are discovered 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.169
 disclosed new properties and 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.340
 benefits that it can bring a life 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.380
 is prescribed by many doctors 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.979
 as it was from antiquity to 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.710
 treat and prevent diseases 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:05.470
 hypocrisy the father of medicine already wore 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.880
 400 years before Christ to treat 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.000
 your patients 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.510
 perhaps for this reason the first miracle of 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.599
 Jesus was to turn water into wine and 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.389
 perhaps it is not by coincidence that in the 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:23.440
 last supper jesus e and a glass of wine 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:26.949
 who said this chalice and the new covenant of 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.050
 my blood do this every time I 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.050
 drink says in remembrance of me 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.169
 prepare to land on without 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.270
 Argentinian first stop begging 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.539
 new world wines 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:49.030
 then Chile and then Europe to two 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:52.720
 but old wine vineyards and good wine 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.479
 except they have different colors 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.280
 You'll even want to keep up with this. 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.169
 even willing to learn 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.680
 so you'll see how much difference 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.300
 exists among wines because of the skin 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.720
 the attitude of the climate and how much difference there is 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:14.070
 between the grapes and the very 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:21.979
 difference is actually I already knew 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:21.979
 I already wanted to test you on aaa.
