00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the lock screen and it'll simply open up

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.400 
the lock screen and it'll simply open up
your<00:00:33.030> multitasking<00:00:33.450> tray<00:00:33.930> where<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.320> now

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
your multitasking tray where you can now

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
center so there it is and I'm not sure

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.040

how<00:00:57.030> great<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.809> coming

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
how great this is going to be coming

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.150 
how great this is going to be coming
through<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> camera<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.949> looks

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
through the camera but this looks

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.459 
through the camera but this looks
absolutely<00:00:59.609> sweet<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:01.020> blurred<00:01:01.350> as

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
absolutely sweet I have it as blurred as

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.689 
absolutely sweet I have it as blurred as
it<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.010> course<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.550> lower

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
it can be and of course you can lower

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.340 
it can be and of course you can lower
the<00:01:02.879> blurriness<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
