00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.020 
run through batteries or anything like
that<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.500> runs<00:01:49.649> through<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.950> plug<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that it runs through a plug so so you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.920 
that it runs through a plug so so you
should<00:01:51.149> keep<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.600> mind

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
should keep that in mind

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.499 
should keep that in mind
so<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> need<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> splitter<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.520> an<00:01:53.759> extra<00:01:54.060> HDMI

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
then that's it basically it you'd hit

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.790

upload<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.080> straight<00:04:52.169> away<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:54.030> that's<00:04:54.270> pretty

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
upload it straight away so that's pretty

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.540 
upload it straight away so that's pretty
much<00:04:54.569> it<00:04:54.690> pretty<00:04:55.169> simple<00:04:55.530> way<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.740> do<00:04:56.069> it<00:04:56.220> and

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
much it pretty simple way to do it and

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.909 
much it pretty simple way to do it and
but<00:04:57.389> if<00:04:57.539> you<00:04:57.690> know<00:04:57.810> if<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.169> wanted<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.620> I

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
but if you know if you wanted to I

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.180 
but if you know if you wanted to I
thought<00:04:59.190> I'd<00:04:59.340> do<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.970> HD<00:05:00.449> and<00:05:00.780> wait<00:05:01.380> for<00:05:02.099> the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
thought I'd do the HD and wait for the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.010 
thought I'd do the HD and wait for the
ps3<00:05:02.460> because<00:05:02.970> not<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.180> lot<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.419> people<00:05:03.599> do<00:05:03.870> it

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
ps3 because not a lot of people do it

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.510 
ps3 because not a lot of people do it
most<00:05:04.259> people<00:05:04.409> connect<00:05:04.860> their<00:05:05.009> hate<00:05:05.280> there

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
most people connect their hate there

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.670 
most people connect their hate there
I'll<00:05:05.639> go<00:05:05.819> through<00:05:06.210> component<00:05:07.199> and<00:05:07.319> stuff<00:05:07.530> like

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
I'll go through component and stuff like

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.189 
I'll go through component and stuff like
that<00:05:07.860> but<00:05:08.039> I<00:05:08.280> wanted<00:05:08.819> to<00:05:08.880> do<00:05:09.000> micro<00:05:09.360> HDMI<00:05:09.870> yeah

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
that but I wanted to do micro HDMI yeah

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.990 
that but I wanted to do micro HDMI yeah
it<00:05:10.440> makes<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.770> lot<00:05:10.919> of<00:05:10.949> mess<00:05:11.250> as<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.610> can<00:05:11.789> see

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
it makes a lot of mess as you can see

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.939 
it makes a lot of mess as you can see
but<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.810> worth<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.289> because<00:05:13.349> you<00:05:13.620> get<00:05:13.860> the

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
but it's worth it because you get the

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.029 
but it's worth it because you get the
full<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.940> know<00:05:14.970> 720<00:05:15.960> quality<00:05:16.560> out<00:05:16.710> of<00:05:16.740> it

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
full you know 720 quality out of it

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.920 
full you know 720 quality out of it
instead<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.759> downgraded<00:05:18.240> component

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
instead of a downgraded component

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.260 
instead of a downgraded component
version<00:05:19.289> which<00:05:19.949> is<00:05:20.099> very<00:05:20.340> very<00:05:20.580> good<00:05:20.729> so<00:05:20.970> I
