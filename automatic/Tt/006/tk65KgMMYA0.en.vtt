00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
let's take a look it's two and a half

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.370 
let's take a look it's two and a half
could<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.470> two<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.860> half<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.939> nap<00:01:24.380> millimeter

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
could be two and half to nap millimeter

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.830 
could be two and half to nap millimeter
headset<00:01:25.770> jack<00:01:26.030> it's<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.119> little<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.450> tough<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
headset jack it's a little bit tough to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.190

actually remove here

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.020 
actually remove here
not<00:01:30.799> going<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.009> mess<00:01:31.159> around<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.610> right<00:01:31.790> now

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
not going to mess around that right now

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.410 
not going to mess around that right now
and<00:01:32.509> in<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.840> back<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.049> believe<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.770> has<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.420> 3
