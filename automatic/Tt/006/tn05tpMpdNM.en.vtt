bit so our collector's card is a TMO is

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.229 
bit so our collector's card is a TMO is
of<00:00:34.380> DNA<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.510> there<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> secret<00:00:36.960> code<00:00:38.239> hold

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
of DNA and there is a secret code hold

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
of DNA and there is a secret code hold
it<00:00:39.390> still<00:00:40.910> r9<00:00:41.910> UV<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.930> cue<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.480> cue<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.930> odd<00:00:46.770> it's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it still r9 UV a cue to cue be odd it's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.619 
it still r9 UV a cue to cue be odd it's
Dale<00:00:47.780> said<00:00:50.660> k9<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> whoever<00:00:54.449> gets
