to offer now compared to the WWE maybe

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.880 
to offer now compared to the WWE maybe
AJ<00:01:44.759> Styles<00:01:45.090> isn't<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.750> known<00:01:46.020> competitor<00:01:46.680> maybe

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
AJ Styles isn't a known competitor maybe

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.969 
AJ Styles isn't a known competitor maybe
isn't<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.340> top<00:01:47.610> commodity<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.810> AJ<00:01:49.409> Styles<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
isn't a top commodity but AJ Styles is

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.460 
isn't a top commodity but AJ Styles is
one<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> proven<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.540> tried<00:01:51.869> commodities

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
one of the proven and tried commodities

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.859 
one of the proven and tried commodities
of<00:01:52.619> TNA<00:01:53.430> Impact<00:01:53.850> Wrestling<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.750> is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
of TNA Impact Wrestling and that is

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.039 
of TNA Impact Wrestling and that is
where<00:01:55.049> AJ<00:01:55.439> Styles<00:01:55.799> has<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.880> gained<00:01:57.810> his

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
where AJ Styles has you know gained his

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.289 
where AJ Styles has you know gained his
most<00:01:58.290> exposure<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.520> maybe<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.030> would<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
most exposure and maybe it would be a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.149 
most exposure and maybe it would be a
mistake<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.810> AJ<00:02:01.079> Styles<00:02:01.409> were<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> leave<00:02:01.740> TNA

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
mistake if AJ Styles were to leave TNA

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.459 
mistake if AJ Styles were to leave TNA
to<00:02:02.549> go<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.939> WWE<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:03.869> we<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.229> seen

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
to go to the WWE because we have seen

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.740 
to go to the WWE because we have seen
how<00:02:04.950> other<00:02:05.219> performers<00:02:05.759> from<00:02:05.850> TNA<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.360> tried

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
how other performers from TNA have tried

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.380 
how other performers from TNA have tried
there<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.770> push<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.340> another<00:02:08.670> organization

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
there are push in another organization

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.360 
there are push in another organization
and<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:09.840> hasn't<00:02:09.989> gelled<00:02:10.410> well<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.160> maybe

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and it just hasn't gelled well so maybe

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.880 
and it just hasn't gelled well so maybe
long-term<00:02:12.090> AJ<00:02:12.569> Styles<00:02:12.930> best<00:02:13.200> plane

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
long-term AJ Styles best plane

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.830 
long-term AJ Styles best plane
would<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.280> stay<00:02:14.460> with<00:02:14.640> TNA<00:02:15.090> because<00:02:15.690> it

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
would be to stay with TNA because it

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.880 
would be to stay with TNA because it
could<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.350> uh<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:18.120> know<00:02:18.410> result<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.709> very
