00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it you can mess with a velocity settings

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.770 
it you can mess with a velocity settings
whether<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.440> an<00:00:43.530> easier<00:00:43.829> way

illumination<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.850> ambient<00:02:02.850> occlusion<00:02:03.469> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
15 okay and now if we render it out

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.959 

I'll<00:02:14.040> tell<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> what<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.610> will<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:14.939> work

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
I'll tell you what it will not work

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.780 
I'll tell you what it will not work
because<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.659> haven't<00:02:15.840> added<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.349> sky<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
because I haven't added a sky so I the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.899 
because I haven't added a sky so I the
sky<00:02:18.230> render<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.349> out<00:02:19.459> make<00:02:20.459> sure<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
sky render it out make sure you have the

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.899 
sky render it out make sure you have the
sky<00:02:21.590> otherwise<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.920> globalization<00:02:23.700> won't

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
sky otherwise the globalization won't

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.520 
sky otherwise the globalization won't
work<00:02:24.090> because<00:02:24.359> the<00:02:24.540> sky<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.079> global

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
work because the sky is the global

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.050 
work because the sky is the global
illumination<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.670> trending<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.819> here

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
illumination so it's trending out here

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.630 
illumination so it's trending out here
white<00:02:30.359> spots<00:02:30.720> are<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:30.989> points<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.349> light<00:02:31.640> and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
be refracting that like so and it's

like run through this before the tour
you<00:03:26.069> know<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.280> kind<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.459> does<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:26.669> straight

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
you know it kind of does it straight

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.629 
you know it kind of does it straight
away<00:03:27.000> but<00:03:27.530> oh<00:03:28.530> well<00:03:28.889> you<00:03:29.250> know<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:29.549> not

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
away but oh well you know it's not

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.369 
away but oh well you know it's not
taking<00:03:29.940> too<00:03:30.090> long<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.419> I'm<00:03:30.510> sixty<00:03:30.930> percent<00:03:31.049> now

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
taking too long so I'm sixty percent now

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.949 
taking too long so I'm sixty percent now
and<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.579> seems<00:03:32.699> to<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:32.849> frozen<00:03:33.269> somewhat<00:03:33.870> the

and it seems to be frozen somewhat the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.199 
and it seems to be frozen somewhat the
background<00:03:34.639> hopefully<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.699> program<00:03:36.060> doesn't

gone<00:03:43.040> MA<00:03:44.040> there<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:44.489> go<00:03:44.669> and<00:03:45.620> if<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:47.190> play<00:03:47.430> it

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
gone MA there we go and if you play it

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.159 
gone MA there we go and if you play it
out<00:03:47.699> you<00:03:48.180> notice<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.659> it<00:03:48.750> won't<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:48.959> anything

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
out you notice that it won't do anything

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.009 
out you notice that it won't do anything
you'll<00:03:49.379> just<00:03:49.530> sink<00:03:49.889> below<00:03:50.159> the<00:03:50.639> floor<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:51.209> is

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
you'll just sink below the floor that is

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.659 
you'll just sink below the floor that is
because<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.680> breaking<00:03:53.190> but<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.430> doesn't

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
because it's breaking but it doesn't

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.039 
because it's breaking but it doesn't
know<00:03:53.729> what's<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.120> floor<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:54.569> doesn't<00:03:54.810> want<00:03:54.930> to

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
know what's the floor so doesn't want to

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.649 
know what's the floor so doesn't want to

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
to the left and I'll explode like the

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.960 
to the left and I'll explode like the
left<00:07:01.680> will<00:07:01.830> explode<00:07:02.310> and<00:07:02.610> that<00:07:02.699> the<00:07:02.790> right

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
left will explode and that the right

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.990 
left will explode and that the right
will<00:07:03.120> crumble<00:07:03.650> they<00:07:04.650> can<00:07:04.830> make<00:07:04.919> a<00:07:05.000> sphere

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
will crumble they can make a sphere

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.500 
will crumble they can make a sphere
bigger<00:07:06.330> you<00:07:06.570> know<00:07:07.340> so<00:07:08.340> it's<00:07:08.490> a<00:07:08.550> big<00:07:08.790> meaty<00:07:09.330> old

just like there's like so but oh that's
how<00:07:25.950> to<00:07:26.010> create<00:07:26.250> explode<00:07:26.700> you<00:07:26.940> can<00:07:27.120> mess<00:07:27.300> with

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 
how to create explode you can mess with

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:33.610 
how to create explode you can mess with
the<00:07:27.479> velocity<00:07:27.750> settings<00:07:30.020> on<00:07:31.020> here<00:07:32.030> dynamics

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
the velocity settings on here dynamics

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.750 
the velocity settings on here dynamics
yeah<00:07:34.620> you<00:07:34.680> can<00:07:34.919> mess<00:07:35.070> with<00:07:35.220> these<00:07:35.280> velocity

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:35.760 
yeah you can mess with these velocity

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.820 
yeah you can mess with these velocity
sense<00:07:35.970> but<00:07:36.180> you<00:07:36.270> know<00:07:36.419> it's<00:07:37.350> always<00:07:37.500> fun<00:07:37.800> to

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 
add a big ball to the scene clunker

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.230 
add a big ball to the scene clunker
wrong<00:07:40.919> with<00:07:41.070> that<00:07:41.160> but<00:07:41.669> I<00:07:41.760> thanks<00:07:42.000> watching
