00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:17.939
 ai speaks crowd beauty mad cow game 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.099
 here making an annotated video that 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.899
 formula-1 2013 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.160
 I am using a template of formula 1 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.660
 in 2014 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.340
 just get another update 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.770
 here of gustavo in the update 1.2.1 500 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.910
 thousand in Portuguese without giving any or 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:45.000
 aquino name of the players there confer 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:48.320
 crisis may notice that the names now 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.320
 players so right 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 formerly of the bay when using that in 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.910
 Portuguese 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.770
 now the first seven are perfect 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.090
 races of the season and also he 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.090
 got the speed of cars 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.850
 put the cars at real speed 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.390
 They do not arrive today, right? 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.950
 the race of monte carlo it diminishes the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.729
 six-speed gearbox that you only used 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.420
 only six races from monaco on the mount 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.400
 carlo and decreased short pass in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.530
 evidence is moving in the car to see 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.290
 how are they missing fit in 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.979
 current formula 1 not only answered the mold 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.780
 here now and I, our car is 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.240
 running fast is at the speed that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 edited but the last one is not 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.990
 accompanying us goes through them 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 so flying they are looking like a 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 golzinho 1.0 and we 're looking like a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.439
 passing through it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.299
 Let's see if he can handle this. 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.240
 You are in the game there. 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.760
 way reading here but still people 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.650
 out of an already sensational curve I want 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.780
 here passing has everything 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.400
 so if he needs the kers or wing alone 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.410
 accelerate you will decide to go through 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.940
 world 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.240
 they are running around 20 and 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.770
 30 kilometers less than the people but the 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.250
 So it 's good, we have cars, that's it. 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.750
 altered and tunes car stickers 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.810
 badges 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.440
 How is it going? It 's five races. 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.120
 huh 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.690
 some cars did not change is 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.250
 trying to change a masculine but out 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.440
