00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
um I don't want to talk about rainbows

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.500 
um I don't want to talk about rainbows
today<00:00:23.110> but<00:00:23.920> that's<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:24.310> only<00:00:24.550> thing<00:00:24.790> song<00:00:25.330> I

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
today but that's the only thing song I

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.760 
today but that's the only thing song I
could<00:00:25.570> think<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:26.050> that<00:00:26.110> I<00:00:26.350> could<00:00:26.529> play<00:00:26.740> that

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
could think of that I could play that

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.080 
could think of that I could play that
was<00:00:27.189> even<00:00:27.490> close

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
was even close

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.310 
was even close
so<00:00:28.990> over<00:00:29.950> the<00:00:30.070> rainbow<00:00:30.430> it<00:00:30.580> is<00:00:30.780> today<00:00:31.780> I'd<00:00:32.110> like

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
so over the rainbow it is today I'd like

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.940 
so over the rainbow it is today I'd like
to<00:00:32.529> have<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:32.710> talk<00:00:32.980> about<00:00:33.309> an<00:00:34.950> optical

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
to have a talk about an optical

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.140 
to have a talk about an optical
phenomena<00:00:37.199> that<00:00:38.199> every<00:00:38.710> time<00:00:38.949> I<00:00:39.250> see<00:00:39.790> it<00:00:39.940> and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
phenomena that every time I see it and

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.610 
phenomena that every time I see it and
think<00:00:40.480> about<00:00:40.780> it<00:00:40.960> blows<00:00:41.290> my<00:00:41.710> mind<00:00:41.739> and<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:44.320> have

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
think about it blows my mind and I have

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.710 
think about it blows my mind and I have
here<00:00:45.070> something<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.640> draw<00:00:45.879> on<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.269> I<00:00:46.360> realize

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
here something to draw on and I realize

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.270 
here something to draw on and I realize
you<00:00:46.960> may<00:00:47.140> not<00:00:47.170> be<00:00:47.530> able<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.800> see<00:00:47.949> it<00:00:48.040> very<00:00:48.159> well

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
you may not be able to see it very well

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.710 
you may not be able to see it very well
in<00:00:48.489> this<00:00:48.610> video<00:00:48.790> but<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.210> drawings<00:00:49.479> gonna<00:00:49.659> be

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
in this video but the drawings gonna be

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.140 
in this video but the drawings gonna be
very<00:00:49.960> simple<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.620> over<00:00:51.370> time<00:00:51.610> maybe<00:00:51.879> I'll

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
very simple and over time maybe I'll

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.180 
very simple and over time maybe I'll
figure<00:00:52.360> out<00:00:52.540> how<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:52.809> do<00:00:53.050> this<00:00:53.290> so<00:00:53.769> that<00:00:53.800> when<00:00:54.159> I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
figure out how to do this so that when I

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.299 
figure out how to do this so that when I
draw<00:00:54.489> you<00:00:54.550> can<00:00:54.820> see<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:56.260> I<00:00:56.290> have<00:00:56.620> grown<00:00:57.070> up

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
draw you can see what I have grown up

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.710 
draw you can see what I have grown up
here<00:00:57.339> is<00:00:57.729> a<00:00:57.760> big<00:00:58.120> red<00:00:58.390> Sun<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:01.300> Sun<00:01:01.540> I've

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
here is a big red Sun and the Sun I've

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.689 
here is a big red Sun and the Sun I've
drawn<00:01:01.960> is<00:01:02.110> being<00:01:02.379> red<00:01:02.680> because<00:01:03.190> we've<00:01:03.489> already

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
drawn is being red because we've already

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.440 
drawn is being red because we've already
learned<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:05.409> Sun<00:01:05.620> is<00:01:05.860> more<00:01:06.330> appears<00:01:07.330> to

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
learned that the Sun is more appears to

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.980 
learned that the Sun is more appears to
us<00:01:07.479> more<00:01:07.780> red<00:01:08.140> than<00:01:08.170> blue<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:10.210> also<00:01:10.570> because

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
us more red than blue and also because

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.929 
us more red than blue and also because
that's<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.070> color<00:01:12.280> marker<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:12.880> have<00:01:14.909> by<00:01:15.909> the

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
that's the color marker I have by the

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.999 
that's the color marker I have by the
way<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:16.719> know<00:01:16.840> we<00:01:16.990> talked<00:01:17.229> about<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.680> stuff

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
way you know we talked about that stuff

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.980 
way you know we talked about that stuff
with<00:01:18.189> why<00:01:18.399> this<00:01:18.640> guy<00:01:18.820> is<00:01:18.880> you<00:01:19.329> know<00:01:19.420> as<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.719> Sun

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
with why this guy is you know as the Sun

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.899 
with why this guy is you know as the Sun
gets<00:01:20.229> farther<00:01:21.009> down<00:01:21.460> near<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.450> horizon<00:01:23.350> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
gets farther down near the horizon that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.310 
gets farther down near the horizon that
those<00:01:24.909> light<00:01:25.090> ways<00:01:25.329> actually<00:01:25.780> have<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.170> go

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
those light ways actually have to go

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.740 
those light ways actually have to go
through<00:01:26.649> more<00:01:26.890> atmosphere<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:28.030> depending

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
through more atmosphere and depending

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.840 
through more atmosphere and depending
upon<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.320> fair<00:01:29.530> conditions<00:01:30.100> that's<00:01:30.579> why

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
upon that is fair conditions that's why

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.340 
upon that is fair conditions that's why
it<00:01:30.909> appears<00:01:31.270> red<00:01:31.509> because<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.869> scatter<00:01:32.140> got

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
it appears red because the scatter got

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.770 
it appears red because the scatter got
even<00:01:32.619> more<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:33.009> blue<00:01:33.450> because<00:01:34.450> it's<00:01:34.630> gone

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
even more the blue because it's gone

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.469 
even more the blue because it's gone
through<00:01:34.990> more<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.350> atmosphere<00:01:35.890> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
through more in the atmosphere and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.959 
through more in the atmosphere and
because<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:38.259> atmospheric<00:01:38.740> conditions<00:01:39.579> anyway

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
because of atmospheric conditions anyway

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.719 
because of atmospheric conditions anyway
but<00:01:40.149> that's<00:01:40.329> that's<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.750> old<00:01:40.990> video<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:42.520> want

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
but that's that's the old video we want

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.099 
but that's that's the old video we want
to<00:01:42.759> talk<00:01:42.880> about<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.299> new<00:01:43.420> video<00:01:43.689> so<00:01:43.899> now<00:01:44.049> we

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
to talk about the new video so now we

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:49.499 
to talk about the new video so now we
have<00:01:44.469> our<00:01:44.859> red<00:01:45.399> Sun<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:48.520> we<00:01:48.789> have<00:01:49.030> some

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
have our red Sun and then we have some

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.169 
have our red Sun and then we have some
green<00:01:49.780> clouds<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:51.219> read<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.880> clouds

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
green clouds and the read that clouds

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.529 
green clouds and the read that clouds
are<00:01:52.659> green<00:01:53.200> for<00:01:53.549> no<00:01:54.549> good<00:01:54.789> reason<00:01:54.850> whatsoever

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
are green for no good reason whatsoever

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:02.969 
are green for no good reason whatsoever
and<00:01:56.049> now<00:01:56.679> I<00:01:56.710> can't<00:01:57.070> find<00:01:57.310> my<00:01:57.689> v<00:01:58.689> marker<00:01:59.170> sold<00:02:01.979> so

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
and now I can't find my v marker sold so

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.389 
and now I can't find my v marker sold so
we<00:02:03.130> have<00:02:03.310> some<00:02:03.490> clouds<00:02:03.820> here<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:06.189> we

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
we have some clouds here and here we

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.779 
we have some clouds here and here we
have<00:02:06.640> our<00:02:06.909> observer<00:02:08.280> perhaps<00:02:09.280> wearing<00:02:09.700> a

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
have our observer perhaps wearing a

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.170 
have our observer perhaps wearing a
baseball<00:02:10.030> cap

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
baseball cap

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.660

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
the son of his or her eyes except when

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.080 
the son of his or her eyes except when
they<00:02:16.790> look<00:02:16.970> up<00:02:17.180> at<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.599> Sun<00:02:18.040> now<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.519> have<00:02:19.790> all

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
they look up at the Sun now we have all

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.670 
they look up at the Sun now we have all
observed<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.989> think<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:23.079> we've<00:02:24.079> all<00:02:24.290> observed

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
observed I think and we've all observed

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.220 
observed I think and we've all observed
the<00:02:24.890> situation<00:02:25.519> where<00:02:26.180> we<00:02:26.390> see<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.810> sun's

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
the situation where we see the sun's

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.449 
the situation where we see the sun's
rays<00:02:28.150> come<00:02:29.150> down<00:02:30.189> and<00:02:31.189> hit<00:02:32.150> some<00:02:32.390> atmospheric

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
rays come down and hit some atmospheric

they<00:02:38.359> don't<00:02:38.569> probably<00:02:38.870> come<00:02:39.349> all<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.650> way

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
they don't probably come all the way

they don't probably come all the way
down<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:40.159> the<00:02:40.250> earth<00:02:40.430> but<00:02:40.760> they<00:02:40.939> come<00:02:41.209> up<00:02:41.359> here

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
down to the earth but they come up here

down to the earth but they come up here
and<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:43.430> see<00:02:43.670> them<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.180> they<00:02:44.780> always<00:02:45.170> appear

and we see them and they always appear

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.090 
make that leap your mind has to
understand<00:05:04.160> exactly<00:05:05.090> how<00:05:05.960> those<00:05:06.290> rays<00:05:06.710> are

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
understand exactly how those rays are

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.800 
understand exactly how those rays are
coming<00:05:07.400> as<00:05:07.760> they're<00:05:08.090> not<00:05:08.240> coming<00:05:08.690> down

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
coming as they're not coming down

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.860 
coming as they're not coming down
straight<00:05:09.290> like<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:09.530> they're<00:05:09.950> coming<00:05:10.220> at<00:05:10.580> us

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
straight like that they're coming at us

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.470 
straight like that they're coming at us
and<00:05:11.870> your<00:05:12.110> mind<00:05:12.410> has<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.950> perform<00:05:13.130> some<00:05:13.730> if

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
and your mind has to perform some if

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.970 
and your mind has to perform some if
your<00:05:14.720> mind<00:05:14.930> is<00:05:15.050> like<00:05:15.200> mine<00:05:15.440> has<00:05:15.680> to<00:05:15.830> perform

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
your mind is like mine has to perform

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:23.620 
your mind is like mine has to perform
some<00:05:16.490> incredible<00:05:20.590> trick<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:23.000> make<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.390> so<00:05:23.600> that

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
some incredible trick to make it so that

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.690 
some incredible trick to make it so that
you<00:05:23.930> see<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:24.560> are<00:05:24.590> standing<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.550> middle

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
you see you are standing in the middle

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.260 
you see you are standing in the middle
of<00:05:26.060> these<00:05:26.300> rays<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:29.690> that<00:05:30.050> they<00:05:30.230> are<00:05:30.530> parallel

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
of these rays and that they are parallel

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.130 
of these rays and that they are parallel
going<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.570> an<00:05:32.870> optical<00:05:33.530> infinity<00:05:34.930> now<00:05:35.930> what

going to an optical infinity now what

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.760 
going to an optical infinity now what
I'm<00:05:36.230> going<00:05:36.440> to<00:05:36.470> do<00:05:36.710> is<00:05:37.190> stop<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:38.500> maybe<00:05:39.500> make<00:05:39.740> a

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
I'm going to do is stop and maybe make a

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.040 
I'm going to do is stop and maybe make a
video<00:05:40.160> again<00:05:40.910> in<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.180> future<00:05:41.540> what<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:41.810> would

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
video again in the future what I would

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.910 
video again in the future what I would
like<00:05:42.230> you<00:05:42.290> to<00:05:42.530> do<00:05:42.860> as<00:05:43.130> an<00:05:43.340> assignment<00:05:44.090> is<00:05:44.920> to

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
like you to do as an assignment is to

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.890 
like you to do as an assignment is to
pay<00:05:46.100> attention<00:05:46.670> for<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:46.940> next<00:05:47.210> few<00:05:47.360> days<00:05:47.420> when

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
pay attention for the next few days when

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
see if you can observe any time when you

my life where I sat there and stared at

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
it long enough that I realized how that

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.450 
it long enough that I realized how that
could<00:06:32.090> be<00:06:32.170> every<00:06:33.170> other<00:06:33.200> time<00:06:33.590> I<00:06:33.620> try<00:06:34.010> usually

I'm<00:06:34.580> driving<00:06:34.910> a<00:06:34.940> little<00:06:35.240> more

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
or something like that I just can't get

and I've been thinking about it for a

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.360 
and I've been thinking about it for a
couple<00:06:42.319> of<00:06:42.349> days<00:06:42.469> now<00:06:42.529> that<00:06:42.919> I<00:06:42.979> knew<00:06:43.129> I<00:06:43.159> was

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
couple of days now that I knew I was

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.529 
couple of days now that I knew I was
going<00:06:43.460> to<00:06:43.520> make<00:06:43.639> this<00:06:43.789> video<00:06:44.029> and<00:06:44.300> I<00:06:44.360> have<00:06:44.509> a

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
going to make this video and I have a

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.350 
going to make this video and I have a
couple<00:06:44.779> of<00:06:44.960> ideas<00:06:45.110> of<00:06:45.680> tricks<00:06:46.610> of<00:06:46.879> what<00:06:47.150> to

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
couple of ideas of tricks of what to

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.360 
couple of ideas of tricks of what to
tell<00:06:47.629> your<00:06:47.900> minds<00:06:48.559> so<00:06:48.770> that<00:06:48.949> you<00:06:49.099> see<00:06:49.339> the

tell your minds so that you see the

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:56.619 
tell your minds so that you see the

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:56.629 
radial propagation of the Rays and yet

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:01.209 
radial propagation of the Rays and yet
you<00:06:56.990> still<00:06:57.349> realize<00:06:58.069> in<00:06:58.460> your<00:06:59.180> mind<00:06:59.839> and<00:07:00.349> in

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:01.219 
you still realize in your mind and in

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:05.589 
you still realize in your mind and in
your<00:07:01.249> heart<00:07:01.629> that<00:07:02.629> those<00:07:02.900> rays<00:07:03.169> are<00:07:03.379> parallel
