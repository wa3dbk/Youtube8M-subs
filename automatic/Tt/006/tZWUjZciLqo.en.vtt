 48 tokaev view that opened ska under 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.210
 different there 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.589
 wheel models 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:10.799
 but she seemed to paint on the model 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.109
 the very last person was the dearest lady 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.039
 but ready to show because she 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.909
 man will not be able to understand 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.539
 Well, in general, carried away opens 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.119
 turns on on equipped 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.550
 electronics in particular 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.849
 pregnancy it will make papers gas ed 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.119
 from paper 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.359
 even with what gift and under the hood 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.220
 option 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.380
 accurate to the millimeter earned 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.810
 2 9 billion already recognized, perhaps even worth it 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:35.560
 penny 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.420
 what will happen to them open time 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.990
 will be seen cylinder to all 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.990
 running engine 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.640
 this guy does everything himself and yet without 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.090
 I don't know the paper 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.170
 it can not own my car 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.560
 pump it up 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.600
 the owner of which starts a project any 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.320
 machines are curious what starts here 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.650
 machine selection this will be a command not 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.780
 will be able to replace 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.950
 yes in general 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.150
 but this model as a year is inspired by such 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.680
 movies like the fast and the furious milan the fast and the furious games 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 underground first second part 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.730
 their wheels also do not turn from 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.550
 steering what's there pregnant 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 gears 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.810
 trunk mounted speakers 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.520
 that is, if you connect them to real 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.250
 as I remember sound reproducing 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.909
 devices than music will play with him in 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.840
 the car 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.880
 but the percentage where to take an example 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.049
 size of order to skip real 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.990
 machines with a tape measure yes yes I just 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.820
 I was interested in acquiring a magazine 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.860
 various taxes there need 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.840
 at the same time as usual at the end gives low 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 machine characteristics or dimensions 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.790
 naturally machine and it is 8 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.230
 calculated and how it would matter the scale that is 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.830
 here is this car she 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.820
 however, sixteen that is 16 times less from 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.180
 original much better on paper court 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.790
 that three drawing paper as well soman paper materials glue 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.840
 scotch and where you can sometimes can not 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.980
 wire 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.480
 prostitution covered with snow spasskaya 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.760
 which bottle was used 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.060
 nis how long does it take to create 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.810
 such a miracle 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.810
 such a machine she made for three months 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:16.829
 so two cars are not alone 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.649
 limited transport such a 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:21.519
 still here about exemplary collections 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.139
 I'll show you now 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.719
 urban transport 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.569
 Samara 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.959
 this is the subway he 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.239
 bus 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.180
 but will create to already beloved 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.099
 Samarans 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.189
 tram Mamsurov 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.999
 also all the models acting here 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.349
 for example if you take about a tram 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.540
 second tsapok affect juice 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.629
 receiver 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.590
 we also open the doors ix i remember myself 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.279
 development of door opening systems 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.589
 performers 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.709
 income front door opened 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.889
 tons per hour second third 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.889
 not closing 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.699
 but for example, well you can take sizes 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.130
 in order to create a layout 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.550
 car such as the interior ministry 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.540
 tram with accuracy you need all the same 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.869
 colleagues on the idea of ​​a sandpiper 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.659
 but narrowing here is just the size of the eye 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.219
 that is, make it clean so that it looks like 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.859
 that is, the same model is no longer 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.719
 They have only parameters as they say 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.519
 happen only at the factory 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.999
 and here you only have to 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.479
 pure rewards 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.969
 as well as departments two models can say 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.299
 now on an example 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.159
 I did this on my own 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.999
 concept car development that is 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.069
 there are no analogues in the world 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.269
 here is purely his own style 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.509
 own design 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.079
 Well, for example, I have the first model 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.759
 attacked i earned melts as throws the answer 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.459
 Lamborghini Harare 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.389
 location 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.389
 the tree opens 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.869
 after all too 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:51.339
 Gritsevets 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.489
 work here features then here 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.619
 if you can catch the problem that 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.059
 to make it easier to get in the car with 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.819
 fields turn side exit 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:01.639
 to 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.759
 how were all this sets a goal seat 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.759
 turns back 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:06.789
 one 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.529
 spouse for it 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.439
 also country project dolphins is not 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.609
 more expensive yes the SUV became form 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.179
 body hours it is like in 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:17.680
 modification pickup 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.160
 he has a case from this country 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.639
 ordinary habitual 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.740
 for 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.849
 modern man and on the other hand with 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.870
 passenger 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.470
 weight is an unusual two which 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.360
 as if passenger she opens access 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.569
 immediately to both rows of seats 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.159
 and here for example if he 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:37.269
 This is an hour pickup and we need for example 

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:40.239
 wagon here limit pushing hiding 

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:40.730
 here 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.939
 schedule he could already as a wagon 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:46.319
 and then now for example 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.770
 This version of the urban suspension here 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.610
 and if this method you want to ride 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.280
 intercom park country roads 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.129
 tons here we will do everything 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.379
 large suspension in general glasses 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.870
 seconds 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.870
 in general we will have 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:05.680
 normal proper 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.499
 earned yes 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:10.129
 we cheat already 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.129
 SUV 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.419
 Bulgarians canvas sang what's left 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.370
 of life 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.499
 from paper model learn to do 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:21.370
 real paper money 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.210
 that is, those who lead their goods should 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.330
 learn to sell 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.439
 no offers were received then he 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.900
 may be a sewage treatment manufacturer 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.000
 tried to hitherto how to mess because 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.159
 that your idea is not connected tass but 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.189
 such is the percentage of such a profession of us 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.960
 is the concept I have no opportunity 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.159
 what to go there and study there is everything 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.120
 Samara is here to study the Academy of Culture 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.139
 how do you say hello to my group 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.099
 academy of culture all art sabiha 5 10 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.960
 hello to all my friends all who are me 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.710
 knows 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.189
 and here I am now very strange 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:54.739
 offices interiors future can work 

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:56.169
 as if 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.580
 design interior advertising 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.990
 also here is the amount in your profile 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.870
 I represent, for example, the drives of the model 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.870
 that I will work the poster firm 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.069
 and for example I want to do this 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.210
 the company airbrushing on bodywork 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.080
 cars that is painting 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.060
 I think maybe I'm wrong it will be that they 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.800
 completely exclusive to themselves because 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.189
 theater 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:18.959
 brains work the front sight the other side 

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:21.349
 airbrush percentage is already a commonplace 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:22.419
 here 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.680
 but what exactly is he 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.600
 I only have one left early 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.550
 four admiration for kabule huge 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.570
 thank you for coming told seemed 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.020
 its
