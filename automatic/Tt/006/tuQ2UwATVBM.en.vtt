we're<00:00:17.789> gonna<00:00:17.910> do<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.210> while<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.500> button

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
we're gonna do this while the the button

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.150 
we're gonna do this while the the button
is<00:00:20.130> still<00:00:20.600> in<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.900> metal<00:00:22.199> panel<00:00:22.590> but

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
is still in the metal panel but

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.890 
is still in the metal panel but
essentially<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:23.880> we're<00:00:24.000> trying<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.630> is

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
take out the micro switch from one

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.749 
take out the micro switch from one
button<00:00:28.369> that's<00:00:29.369> bad<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.109> put<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.949> good

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
button that's bad and put in a good

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.970 
button that's bad and put in a good
micro<00:00:33.120> switch<00:00:33.390> from<00:00:33.630> another<00:00:33.870> button<00:00:34.140> but

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
micro switch from another button but

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.880 
micro switch from another button but
once<00:00:35.579> you've<00:00:35.820> removed<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.930> quick<00:00:37.469> connects

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890

count like it is now you can then either
go<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> other<00:01:49.799> side<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.720> do<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> same

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
go to the other side and do the same

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.660 
go to the other side and do the same
thing<00:01:52.520> on<00:01:53.520> there<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.270> push<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.200> side<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
thing on there to push that side in and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.480 
thing on there to push that side in and
up<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:59.060> your<00:02:00.060> ultimate<00:02:00.600> goal<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.490> just

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
up and your ultimate goal is to just

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.910 
up and your ultimate goal is to just
kind<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> push<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:03.509> enough<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.799> know

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
kind of push it up enough it you know

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.459 
kind of push it up enough it you know
from<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.479> sticking<00:02:06.930> up

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
from so that it's sticking up

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.889 
from so that it's sticking up
that<00:02:07.979> was<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> bit<00:02:08.399> probably<00:02:09.030> more<00:02:09.479> than<00:02:09.750> you're

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that was a bit probably more than you're

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.770 
that was a bit probably more than you're
gonna<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.170> likely<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.560> get<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.480> even<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.599> it's

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
gonna be likely to get but even if it's

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.750 
gonna be likely to get but even if it's
just<00:02:12.870> up

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
just up

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.199 
just up
say<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.840> much<00:02:15.170> at<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.340> point<00:02:16.610> just<00:02:16.790> go

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
say this much at that point just go

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.390 
say this much at that point just go
ahead<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.720> grab<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.230> top<00:02:18.409> plunger<00:02:18.950> here<00:02:19.190> and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
ahead and grab the top plunger here and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.970 
ahead and grab the top plunger here and
pull<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:20.599> separate<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.709> from<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:22.310> button<00:02:23.980> so

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
pull and separate it from the button so

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.160 
pull and separate it from the button so
now<00:02:25.760> here's<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.299> inside<00:02:26.659> of<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.870> button

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
now here's the inside of the button

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.570 
now here's the inside of the button
which<00:02:27.379> would<00:02:27.590> be<00:02:27.709> able<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.950> see<00:02:28.069> from<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.340> top

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
which would be able to see from the top

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.910 
which would be able to see from the top
but<00:02:29.209> we're<00:02:29.450> still<00:02:29.720> gonna<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:29.930> looking<00:02:30.319> at<00:02:30.500> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
but we're still gonna be looking at the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.850 
but we're still gonna be looking at the
bottom<00:02:31.849> side<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.299> it<00:02:32.450> because<00:02:33.110> we're<00:02:33.410> leaving

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
bottom side of it because we're leaving

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.820 
bottom side of it because we're leaving
it<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.670> panel<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:36.019> next<00:02:36.290> part<00:02:36.590> is

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
it in the panel and the next part is

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.509 
it in the panel and the next part is
going<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.129> be<00:02:37.900> removing<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.230> actual<00:02:39.860> micro

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
going to be removing the actual micro

going to be removing the actual micro
switch<00:02:41.290> now<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.620> micro<00:02:43.010> switch<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.730> can

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
switch now on the micro switch you can

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.780 
switch now on the micro switch you can
see<00:02:44.349> on<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.560> side<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.250> black<00:02:46.519> part

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
see on the side of this black part

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.009 
see on the side of this black part
there's<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.989> little<00:02:48.379> raised<00:02:48.620> area<00:02:49.129> here<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.019> on

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
there's a little raised area here and on

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.699 
there's a little raised area here and on
the<00:02:51.290> opposite<00:02:51.829> side<00:02:52.129> there<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.359> one<00:02:53.720> right

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
the opposite side there is one right

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.030 
the opposite side there is one right

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.580 
here a little bit and on this side I'm
gonna<00:03:35.090> do<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.299> same<00:03:35.540> thing<00:03:35.810> I'm<00:03:36.169> gonna<00:03:36.319> push

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
gonna do the same thing I'm gonna push

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.409 
gonna do the same thing I'm gonna push
it<00:03:36.769> in<00:03:36.919> while<00:03:37.400> I'm<00:03:37.489> pushing<00:03:37.700> up<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.209> just

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
it in while I'm pushing up and I just

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.509 
it in while I'm pushing up and I just
heard<00:03:38.599> it<00:03:38.690> popped<00:03:38.959> out<00:03:39.169> and<00:03:39.590> when<00:03:40.430> that

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
heard it popped out and when that

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.720 
heard it popped out and when that
happens<00:03:41.000> your<00:03:41.630> micro<00:03:42.079> switch<00:03:42.380> will<00:03:43.370> come<00:03:43.519> out

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
happens your micro switch will come out

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.900 
happens your micro switch will come out
of<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.970> button<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:45.220> that's<00:03:46.220> what<00:03:46.549> actually

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
of the button and that's what actually

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.620 
of the button and that's what actually
goes<00:03:47.060> bad<00:03:47.419> in<00:03:47.660> these<00:03:47.840> things<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.530> so

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
goes bad in these things and so

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.520 
goes bad in these things and so
basically<00:03:50.630> you're<00:03:50.989> going<00:03:51.109> to<00:03:51.169> go<00:03:51.319> through

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
basically you're going to go through

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.520 
basically you're going to go through
this<00:03:52.040> hole<00:03:52.280> same<00:03:52.519> process<00:03:53.180> on<00:03:53.480> another<00:03:54.139> button

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
this hole same process on another button

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.000 
this hole same process on another button
probably<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:56.660> one<00:03:56.840> on<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.049> far<00:03:57.319> right<00:03:57.980> side

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
probably the one on the far right side

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.800 
probably the one on the far right side
the<00:03:58.579> one<00:03:58.609> that's<00:03:58.849> used<00:03:59.030> for<00:03:59.090> like<00:03:59.269> your<00:03:59.450> your

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
it's the hole here is a little more

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.249 
it's the hole here is a little more
rectangular<00:04:33.830> than<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:34.979> is<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.490> know

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
rectangular than it is you know

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.300 
rectangular than it is you know
square<00:04:37.259> and<00:04:38.449> there's<00:04:39.449> only<00:04:39.720> one<00:04:40.410> way<00:04:40.650> that

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
square and there's only one way that

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.490 
square and there's only one way that
this<00:04:41.370> micro<00:04:42.060> switch<00:04:42.389> will<00:04:42.720> fit<00:04:42.990> in<00:04:43.139> there<00:04:43.320> and

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
this micro switch will fit in there and

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.320 
this micro switch will fit in there and
you<00:04:43.770> can<00:04:43.889> kind<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.130> see<00:04:44.310> it's<00:04:45.030> more

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
you can kind of see it's more

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.370 
you can kind of see it's more
rectangular<00:04:45.840> than<00:04:46.199> square<00:04:46.650> also<00:04:46.919> and<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:48.419> you

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
rectangular than square also and so you

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.490 
rectangular than square also and so you
need<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.830> drop<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.550> into<00:04:50.759> the<00:04:51.000> button<00:04:51.470> from<00:04:52.470> the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
need to drop it into the button from the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.210 
need to drop it into the button from the
top<00:04:53.120> just<00:04:54.120> like<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.840> that's<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.949> way<00:04:56.070> that

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
top just like so and that's the way that

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.330 
top just like so and that's the way that
it<00:04:56.370> goes<00:04:56.520> in<00:04:56.930> basically<00:04:57.930> those<00:04:58.410> holes<00:04:58.800> that<00:04:58.949> we

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
it goes in basically those holes that we

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.879 
it goes in basically those holes that we
poked<00:04:59.699> the<00:05:00.180> allen<00:05:00.900> wrench<00:05:00.930> in<00:05:01.289> in<00:05:01.710> the

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
poked the allen wrench in in the

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.330 
poked the allen wrench in in the
beginning<00:05:02.840> those<00:05:03.840> holes<00:05:04.800> should<00:05:05.580> be

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
beginning those holes should be

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.670 
beginning those holes should be
perpendicular<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:09.710> this<00:05:10.710> little<00:05:12.259> cross<00:05:13.259> piece

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
perpendicular to this little cross piece

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.210 
perpendicular to this little cross piece
here<00:05:14.039> this<00:05:14.669> cross<00:05:15.090> piece<00:05:15.710> here<00:05:16.710> should<00:05:17.039> be

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
here this cross piece here should be

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.140 
here this cross piece here should be
pointing<00:05:17.880> to<00:05:18.210> these<00:05:19.169> little<00:05:19.759> wings<00:05:20.759> on<00:05:21.030> the

pointing to these little wings on the

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.510 
pointing to these little wings on the
side<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.479> button<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:21.930> keep<00:05:22.199> them<00:05:22.520> in

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
place and on the case so they don't you

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.640 
place and on the case so they don't you
know<00:05:26.310> slide<00:05:27.060> out<00:05:27.330> but<00:05:27.990> anyways<00:05:28.320> once<00:05:28.500> you've
