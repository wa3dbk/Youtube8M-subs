haven't even talked about the master

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.390 
haven't even talked about the master
voltage<00:06:00.690> right<00:06:00.960> no<00:06:01.440> we<00:06:01.710> haven't<00:06:01.890> yet<00:06:02.040> we<00:06:02.220> can

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
voltage right no we haven't yet we can

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.340 
voltage right no we haven't yet we can
dial<00:06:02.640> this<00:06:02.820> down<00:06:02.880> where<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:03.420> output<00:06:03.900> if<00:06:04.200> you

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
dial this down where the output if you

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.780 
dial this down where the output if you
look<00:06:04.500> at<00:06:04.620> this<00:06:04.800> over<00:06:05.040> here<00:06:05.370> this<00:06:05.520> is<00:06:05.700> the

look at this over here this is the
master<00:06:06.180> voltage<00:06:06.630> so<00:06:07.380> I<00:06:07.440> drop<00:06:07.680> it<00:06:07.830> down<00:06:07.920> to<00:06:07.980> five

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370
