00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.760 
mummy zombies have always been an idea
with<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.480> studio<00:03:00.870> according<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.500> them<00:03:01.650> I

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
with this studio according to them I

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.830 
with this studio according to them I
guess<00:03:01.800> however<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.940> never<00:03:03.150> really<00:03:03.360> got<00:03:03.600> any

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
guess however it never really got any

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.020 
guess however it never really got any
true<00:03:04.200> attention<00:03:04.710> until<00:03:04.860> now<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:05.880> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
true attention until now and this is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.340 
true attention until now and this is
expected<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:06.510> be<00:03:06.570> shipped<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.170> game

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
expected to be shipped with the game

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.290 
expected to be shipped with the game
however<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.220> also<00:03:08.430> likely<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.060> come<00:03:09.150> as

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
however it is also likely to come as

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.930 
however it is also likely to come as
part<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.930> DLC<00:03:10.440> package<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.400> depends<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
part of a DLC package it depends on the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.030 
part of a DLC package it depends on the
time<00:03:12.240> of<00:03:12.540> completion<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.680> we're<00:03:13.800> not<00:03:13.860> exactly

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
time of completion so we're not exactly

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.340 
time of completion so we're not exactly
sure<00:03:14.340> with<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.760> yet<00:03:15.060> either<00:03:15.270> but<00:03:15.780> mummy

stuff we're not going to see that on the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.460 
stuff we're not going to see that on the
zombies<00:03:53.100> but<00:03:53.670> they<00:03:53.790> do<00:03:53.850> have<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.239> new<00:03:54.510> AI<00:03:54.750> system

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.170 
zombies but they do have a new AI system
that<00:03:55.620> allows<00:03:55.860> them<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.220> be<00:03:56.520> more<00:03:56.550> intelligent

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
that allows them to be more intelligent

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.510 
that allows them to be more intelligent
than<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:57.959> previous<00:03:58.170> Call<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.590> Duty<00:03:58.890> titles<00:03:59.310> and

zombies<00:04:05.640> but<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.270> also<00:04:06.390> fits<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:06.900> with<00:04:07.020> this

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.519 
together a lot better and I think that
we're<00:04:34.569> really<00:04:34.719> going<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.960> be<00:04:35.020> impressed<00:04:35.409> by
