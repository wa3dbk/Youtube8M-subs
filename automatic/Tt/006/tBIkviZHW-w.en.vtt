00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.500
I used to rule the world

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:27.200
Chunks would load when I gave the word

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:31.300
Now every night I go stow away

00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:35.200
Hide from the mobs I used to slay

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.200
They once were terrified

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.300
Every time I looked into their eyes

00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:59.200
Villagers would cheer my way

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:02.000
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:06.000
One minute we had it all

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.900
Next our world began to fall

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:13.300
Away from all that it had once become

00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:16.000
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.500
I gaze off into the boundless skyline

00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:24.000
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.500
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.000
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.200
And hope one day that this chaos and

00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:37.200
Destruction turns for the better

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:41.000
Never a bow in hand

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:44.001
And that was when I ruled the land

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.700
It was the creepers and Skeletons

00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:04.600
Blew down the doors and boxed us in

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:08.600
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light

00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:11.700
I tried all that I could to stay and fight

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:15.700
As the undead roamed the street

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:18.300
Families broken at my feet

00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:22.500
Life itself suspended by a thread

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.900
Oh, why is it that I wasn't dead

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000
I gaze off into the boundless skyline

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.500
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:37.000
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:40.400
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield

00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:44.000
If this battle should leave me slain

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:47.000
I know that Herobrine calls my name

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.500
Better to take a stand

00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:54.000
And that was when I ruled the land

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.000
I gaze off into the boundless skyline

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.300
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine

00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:32.600
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield

00:03:32.601 --> 00:03:36.400
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:39.600
If this battle should leave me slain

00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:42.800
I know that Herobrine calls my name

00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:46.500
Better to take a stand

00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:49.900
And that was when I ruled the land
