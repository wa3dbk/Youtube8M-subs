00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello everyone I hope you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.290
 be fine then today I will you 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.460
 presents a tutorial to make a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.599
 little candy box for halloween in 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.850
 bat shape 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.010
 so here we are again for the rest 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.900
 with the material and the explorations 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.090
 realize your no bat steps there 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.090
 will you need a piece of rolls 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.779
 a cardboard like this one is paper 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.910
 of wyeth be a robot of sopalin that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.399
 you have cut to the desired size 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.600
 you will need paper too 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.110
 black style tension have a sheet 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.550
 white glue or without stick either 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.550
 mikic when your summer 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.400
 we're going to need glue and a 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.350
 point with the brush and then finally d 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.730
 like this until he wanted to 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.440
 so 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.940
 if you do not have small eyes 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.180
 amazed you just take off 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.460
 cut up by filling a little bigger and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.080
 then a noir novel appetite that the pass to 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.390
 inside and confess tease works and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.729
 So here we are with the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.330
 explanations for the first step 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:22.940
 we just started by painting in black 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:25.190
 the roll so recover or cut off 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.650
 depending on the size of the rau du 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.979
 departure so I took the size of a 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.720
 roll of toilet paper that makes a 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.869
 little too big so my painting is from 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.890
 black acrylic paint 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.430
 here I am used to working with 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.440
 acrylic paint for that 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.450
 crack the mans and that's so much better than 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.450
 the gouache paint 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.030
 so in fact just do it 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.780
 all the way then following the facts that 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.200
 you want to take a roll or 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.200
 a brush 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.740
 I wanted this last and then we 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.140
 found for the area once you 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.830
 have it by your roll and that it has dried 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.890
 in fact we will loot so in 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.200
 glass ingots actually we'll take the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.200
 cardboard and we will fold it like these 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:31.030
 and like that so history to make a 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:34.380
 tip and close like this here 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.380
 if we are going to do the same thing downstairs 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.640
 and here we are, our little ones 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.710
 berlingots that will serve me as a box 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.870
 candy and then support to make 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.670
 our bat so here we will have the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.650
 ears we will put wings to 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.760
 the back and then we will continue to 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:01.200
 decor and all that so for your wings there 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:09.030
 need here a leaf are black or 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:12.270
 you are going to draw the wings so of a 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.500
 proportional size we will say to the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.320
 size of your bat game 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.280
 depending on the size you took if 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:24.060
 you have cups and other pipes or 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.480
 bread here I'll make small 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:32.000
 wings like that one handles folded in half for 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.000
 do something symmetrical 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.100
 and then have discovered a little bit 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.100
 biggest problem 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.879
 c 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.239
 so if you go to my site 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.189
 yad'other bat tutor you 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.620
 may have found patterns 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.709
 of her if you really need them 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.239
 six months a message I would put by the 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.280
 following a pattern for the wings 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:14.189
 so here we go and then we'll come 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:17.299
 stick here at the back so a little 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.299
 glue point in the middle 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.850
 hop 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.440
 I like to a little dirty 1 I have not very 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.440
 clean but that's it and that's it 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.090
 so once we put the zebras on 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.090
 will put little eyes 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.840
 we can get closer here you do 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.220
 after you do like his babies 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.250
 and then then we will come from 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.740
 cuts and small ones in my fire department 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.910
 so what I'm going to do is I 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.140
 take a little white stripe like that 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:30.120
 I'm going to fold it in half to make it 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:34.070
 well symmetrical on each side here and 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.070
 then I cut myself 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.930
 small that 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.219
 by making triangles 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.350
 the problem 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.470
 who 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.470
 like that 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.100
 louvre 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.270
 com 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.040
 so here I see that it's a little 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.640
 current so I'm going to cut the first 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.640
 triangle 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.490
 and there I think it's going to be pretty good I 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.490
 I'll do it 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.139
 and once we have stuck 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:35.090
 small teeth and barras delivered 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.090
 There's more to fill than moore 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.490
 so I put two 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.510
 here 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.069
 rivalis case that gives once completed 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.619
 ap 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:57.460
 so here you go more than open and 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:07:00.060
 then slide the little bag of candy 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.650
 to children 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.210
 so I hope this little tutorial has you 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.610
 longer you can find me on my 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.820
 website to create to such an extent fr 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.590
 on my facebook page created bull and then 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.270
