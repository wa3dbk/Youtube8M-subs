00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.120
 a youtuber recently told me that 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.280
 proposal given 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.860
 hey make a video 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.920
 if you brand new fish in aquariums 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.560
 I thought I'm doing okay 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.090
 me that and that's exactly what I want it to be 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.619
 many are now thinking I'm doing 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.809
 but the old fish of mine just 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.120
 out and the new rooms and it is 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:36.579
 it happens so experienced 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.770
 no, it does not work like that 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.129
 the new ones are slowly starting to fish it 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.949
 warm water from you slowly at it 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:50.470
 accustom 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:53.949
 very important now why the water of 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.800
 to come to your new fish 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.890
 or you have picked others 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.479
 temperatures and qualities like eurac 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.100
 warm water in your room and therefore 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.910
 It would be too big a shock if you can 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.320
 The fish instantly does this in and cleans 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.670
 some will die painfully 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.240
 but this does not happen 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.360
 some vial eg an old beer head like 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.880
 I with her the water of yours 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.130
 aquarium in the vessel where yours 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.220
 Lead new fish into it 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.490
 but can also be careful of the after and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.580
 it is not allowed for her therefore 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.099
 feel full again of yours 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.179
 new fish because that could be too 

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:45.310
 cause a blatant shock 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.459
 and something is important and so 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.709
 small fish and the need for longer 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:54.429
 Do you draw between the water 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.030
 I'll show it to you just apropos 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.340
 fishes 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.770
 some have already bitched enough 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.770
 I have to my 20 aquarium 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.900
 I'm just saying 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:18.780
 this statement has done as big 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:25.050
 this Berlin later but now also to 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:32.370
 draw as usual until the stars the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:34.980
 Cover carefully with my 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.050
 last video is me the LED lamp 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.660
 I should have fallen down 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.320
 maybe not happen to 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.220
 flow 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:50.330
 I was with my jug school this 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:53.330
 once it was full of water 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.330
 carefully 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:10.260
 into the vessel for the first first one 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.599
 Later I can see if I can 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.130
 still increase 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.030
 I have a menu from now on 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.980
 lied to 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.650
 because I still have one in this vessel 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.110
 Scheibenputzer fish in it then have about 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.400
 three times as big as a goldfish 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.569
 okay with the small circa five times the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.569
 bright the slices of magic 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.269
 and at this disc cleaner fish 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.489
 about three times as big as that 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.530
 biggest goldfish here i can get this 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.239
 then a little earlier like that 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.180
 other goldfish I'm worried 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.170
 I use the aquarium 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.670
 but now it is said with such a network 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.670
 fishing for the old fishermen 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.640
 now the last fish is outside too 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:10.930
 after 25 minutes is the fifth book 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.930
 finished 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.430
 I plant the plants here first 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.430
 one and then always 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:37.120
 always so torturing demonstration how big 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:39.360
 this plant has to be the good one 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.360
 meter 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.290
 Now I have a good place high 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.730
 the tv sits in its place and 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:59.300
 you have another plant before 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.300
 found her place on the left 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.520
 this is another plant you 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.060
 look at it later with light 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.460
 after 30 minutes is the time 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.940
 come to the window cleaner now 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.940
 to free 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.880
 since that's not very exciting 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:24.020
 I'll show you right here in this one 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.020
 aquarium looks like 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:34.990
 who sees him first ok I have to go 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.850
 and swim a bit if this 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.850
 black long little piece that's 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.440
 after that with light we can do even better 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.440
 consider 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.120
 now are the little goldfish 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.419
 in the aquarium 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.159
 since I am very minis you can do without 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.159
 led light not 10 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:11.020
 so the judge on his position 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.020
 Let's see if fish find 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.910
 maybe just hiding 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.020
 cited 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.230
 this meeting already gone there 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.230
 was a fish 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:48.020
 So as you can see are the very menu around 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.020
 this net housing is there to 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.550
 snails to produce offspring 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:02.360
 who still dare to be together now 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:06.590
 far too little plant in it 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.590
 the effect on the lid 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:14.360
 Now I have to go to the window cleaner 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.360
 look for fish and then introduce yourself 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.150
 sorry but i can not find him her 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.669
 can not see him and therefore say 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.900
 I already and hope you this 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.900
 video has fallen
