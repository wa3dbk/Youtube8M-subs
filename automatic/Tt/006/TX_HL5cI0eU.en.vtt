years<00:00:04.710> since<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.160> thing<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.549> seen<00:00:05.759> light<00:00:06.029> or

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
years since this thing is seen light or

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.000 
years since this thing is seen light or
pretty<00:00:06.660> damn<00:00:06.810> close<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.230> two<00:00:07.350> years<00:00:07.379> but

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010

which<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.170> kind<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.469> wish<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.889> maybe<00:00:14.460> maybe

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
which I kind of wish I maybe maybe

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.790 
which I kind of wish I maybe maybe
hadn't<00:00:15.420> done<00:00:15.570> maybe<00:00:16.020> or<00:00:16.289> things<00:00:16.500> were<00:00:16.650> gonna

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
hadn't done maybe or things were gonna

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.580 
hadn't done maybe or things were gonna
change<00:00:17.690> initially<00:00:18.690> when<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.170> designed

run<00:00:35.489> through<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> differential<00:00:36.120> gearbox<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
run through a differential gearbox and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.130 
run through a differential gearbox and
that<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.770> got<00:00:37.920> way<00:00:38.040> too<00:00:38.070> complicated<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
that just got way too complicated and

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.650 
that just got way too complicated and
just<00:00:40.140> didn't<00:00:40.350> make<00:00:40.440> sense<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> wanted<00:00:41.460> a

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
just didn't make sense that I wanted a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.060 
just didn't make sense that I wanted a
two-stroke<00:00:42.660> engine<00:00:43.050> screaming<00:00:43.559> inside<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.980> my

two-stroke engine screaming inside of my
head<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.610> hours<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.120> end<00:00:45.180> while<00:00:45.539> we're<00:00:45.660> mill

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
head for hours on end while we're mill

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.490 
head for hours on end while we're mill
and<00:00:46.020> logs<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> designs<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.170> changed

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
and logs so the designs kind of changed

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.779 
and logs so the designs kind of changed
a<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.770> bit<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> two<00:00:50.489> things<00:00:50.730> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
a little bit one of the two things that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
a little bit one of the two things that
I'm<00:00:50.969> happy<00:00:51.360> about<00:00:51.629> first<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.260> happy<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
I'm happy about first of all I'm happy I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.979 
I'm happy about first of all I'm happy I
didn't<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.250> didn't<00:00:54.030> well<00:00:54.210> these<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> bars

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
didn't I didn't well these are the bars

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110 
didn't I didn't well these are the bars
that<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.320> gonna<00:00:55.500> ride<00:00:55.800> along<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.550> angle<00:00:57.000> iron

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
that are gonna ride along the angle iron

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.229 
that are gonna ride along the angle iron
on<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.449> log<00:00:57.960> bed<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.520> didn't<00:00:59.850> weld<00:01:00.059> these

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
on that log bed and I didn't weld these

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.970 
on that log bed and I didn't weld these
on<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> feet<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.500> wanted<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.829> see

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
on to the feet because I wanted to see

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.560 
on to the feet because I wanted to see
where<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> center<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.550> gravity<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:03.210> once

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
where the center of gravity was once

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.870 
where the center of gravity was once
that<00:01:03.809> snowmobile<00:01:04.320> engine<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.739> mounted<00:01:05.250> so

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that snowmobile engine was mounted so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.149 
that snowmobile engine was mounted so
dependent<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.659> where<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.229> run<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.799> forward

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
dependent on where I run that forward

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.649 
dependent on where I run that forward
and<00:01:08.250> back<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.240> after<00:01:09.630> that

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and back was going to be after that

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.570 
and back was going to be after that
engine<00:01:10.049> got<00:01:10.170> mounted<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.159> glad<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> never

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
engine got mounted and I'm glad I never

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.179 
engine got mounted and I'm glad I never
made<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> determination<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.170> welded<00:01:14.159> that

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
made that determination and welded that

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.440 
made that determination and welded that
in<00:01:14.430> place<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
in place because now we have a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.590 
in place because now we have a
completely<00:01:15.869> different<00:01:15.960> thought<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:17.250> mind<00:01:17.600> I'm

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
completely different thought in mind I'm

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.320 
completely different thought in mind I'm
happy<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:20.040> able<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.610> come<00:01:20.880> across<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
happy that I was able to come across I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.429 
happy that I was able to come across I
have<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> friend<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.869> works<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> garage

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
have a friend that works for a garage

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
have a friend that works for a garage
door<00:01:22.770> open<00:01:22.950> her<00:01:23.040> company<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.850> he<00:01:24.450> gave<00:01:24.630> me

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
door open her company and he gave me

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.200 
door open her company and he gave me
this<00:01:24.930> 60-inch<00:01:25.560> spring<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.490> I've<00:01:26.970> seen

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this 60-inch spring and I've seen

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.510 
this 60-inch spring and I've seen
several<00:01:27.570> different<00:01:27.780> ways<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.500> how<00:01:28.530> these

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
several different ways on how these

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.660 
several different ways on how these
these<00:01:30.060> homemade<00:01:30.750> band<00:01:31.680> mills<00:01:31.950> are<00:01:32.310> put

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
these homemade band mills are put

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.420 
these homemade band mills are put
together<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.530> I<00:01:34.530> thought<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.950> would<00:01:35.100> try<00:01:35.400> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
together and I thought I would try it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
together and I thought I would try it
this<00:01:35.700> way<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.540> I've<00:01:36.659> seen<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
this way I don't know that I've seen it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.510 
this way I don't know that I've seen it
this<00:01:37.259> way<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.710> an<00:01:37.860> overhead<00:01:38.220> garage<00:01:38.369> door

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
this way with an overhead garage door

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.969 
this way with an overhead garage door
spring<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.420> basically<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.320> we're<00:01:40.619> gonna<00:01:40.710> do

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
spring and basically what we're gonna do

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.219 
spring and basically what we're gonna do
is<00:01:41.189> come<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.659> temporarily

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
is come in and this was just temporarily

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
is come in and this was just temporarily
I<00:01:43.350> tacked<00:01:43.680> some<00:01:43.920> 3/4<00:01:44.369> inch<00:01:44.490> bolts<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.909> here

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
I tacked some 3/4 inch bolts in here

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060 
I tacked some 3/4 inch bolts in here
into<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.079> inside<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> pipe<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.009> you

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
into the inside of the pipe and then you

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
into the inside of the pipe and then you
can<00:01:47.159> put<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> breaker<00:01:47.490> bar<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.090> raise<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
can put a breaker bar on there raise and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.590 
can put a breaker bar on there raise and
lower<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.520> once<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.759> weight<00:01:50.970> gets<00:01:51.240> determined

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
lower it once the weight gets determined

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.230 
lower it once the weight gets determined
with<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> engines<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.939> power<00:01:53.939> train

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
with the engines here and power train

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.670 
with the engines here and power train
and<00:01:54.420> wheels<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.750> whatever<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.110> decide<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.500> do

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and wheels and whatever we decide to do

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.880 
and wheels and whatever we decide to do
this<00:01:56.750> spring<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.140> adjusted<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.649> where

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
this spring can be adjusted to where

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.370 
this spring can be adjusted to where
it's<00:01:59.070> essentially<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.729> neutral<00:02:00.210> weight<00:02:00.390> so

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it's essentially a neutral weight so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.319 
it's essentially a neutral weight so
getting<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> up<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:01.979> down<00:02:02.130> should<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:03.000> pretty

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
getting it up and down should be pretty

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.929 
getting it up and down should be pretty
easy<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.530> I've<00:02:05.219> made<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> few<00:02:05.729> errors

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
easy you can see I've made a few errors

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.839 
easy you can see I've made a few errors
which<00:02:06.509> I'm<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> correct<00:02:07.399> this<00:02:08.399> cable

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
which I'm going to correct this cable

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.949 
which I'm going to correct this cable
comes<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.270> at<00:02:09.420> an<00:02:09.539> angle

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
comes in at an angle

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.619 
comes in at an angle
so<00:02:10.500> I'm<00:02:10.799> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> take<00:02:11.159> this<00:02:11.340> whole<00:02:11.629> assembly

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
so I'm going to take this whole assembly

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.119 
so I'm going to take this whole assembly
spring<00:02:13.109> assembly<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.620> slide<00:02:13.859> it<00:02:14.010> back

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
spring assembly and slide it back

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.709 
spring assembly and slide it back
probably<00:02:14.519> three<00:02:14.879> three<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.239> half<00:02:15.359> inches

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
probably three three and a half inches

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.750 
probably three three and a half inches
that<00:02:16.290> way<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.769> that's<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.189> to<00:02:17.250> allow<00:02:17.430> us<00:02:17.459> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
that way and that's going to allow us to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.849 
that way and that's going to allow us to
fit<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:18.030> motorcycle<00:02:18.629> engine<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.049> chassis

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
fit the motorcycle engine and chassis

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.160 
fit the motorcycle engine and chassis
and<00:02:20.189> everything<00:02:20.549> in<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.060> had<00:02:21.659> done<00:02:21.900> these

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
and everything in here I had done these

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.369 
and everything in here I had done these
t<00:02:22.920> handles<00:02:23.310> make<00:02:24.299> sure<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.450> can<00:02:24.540> see<00:02:24.719> that<00:02:24.930> I

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
t handles make sure you can see that I

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.709 
t handles make sure you can see that I
can't<00:02:25.799> see<00:02:25.950> anything<00:02:26.069> in<00:02:26.219> the<00:02:26.280> camera<00:02:26.719> when

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
can't see anything in the camera when

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.000 
can't see anything in the camera when
you<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.230> height<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.560> want<00:02:28.739> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
you get it to the height you want and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.559 
you get it to the height you want and
we'll<00:02:29.159> delineate<00:02:29.459> once<00:02:29.909> it's<00:02:30.120> all<00:02:30.269> said<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
we'll delineate once it's all said and

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.420 
we'll delineate once it's all said and
done<00:02:30.840> we're<00:02:31.079> gonna<00:02:31.170> we're<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> put<00:02:32.219> some

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
done we're gonna we're going to put some

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.550 
done we're gonna we're going to put some
sort<00:02:32.639> of<00:02:32.760> demarcation<00:02:33.480> device<00:02:34.049> here<00:02:34.319> four

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
sort of demarcation device here four

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
sort of demarcation device here four
inches<00:02:34.859> and<00:02:35.069> then<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.819> tighten<00:02:36.090> your<00:02:36.239> little

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
inches and then you tighten your little

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.110 
inches and then you tighten your little
thumb<00:02:36.719> screws<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.639> that'll<00:02:38.639> lock<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.000> in

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
thumb screws and that'll lock it in

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.459 
thumb screws and that'll lock it in
place<00:02:39.239> while<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.599> make<00:02:39.840> your<00:02:39.989> cut<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.290> I've

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
place while you make your cut and I've

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.000 
place while you make your cut and I've
got<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.799> on<00:02:40.889> each<00:02:41.040> side<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:42.859> they<00:02:43.859> work

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
got one on each side and they work

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.750 
got one on each side and they work
pretty<00:02:44.040> well

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
pretty well

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.270 
pretty well
still<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:46.379> thing's<00:02:46.680> been<00:02:46.799> sitting<00:02:46.859> on<00:02:47.159> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
still this thing's been sitting on the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.440 
still this thing's been sitting on the
cover<00:02:47.459> for<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:47.819> long<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.090> had<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.269> wipe

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
cover for so long I had to wipe

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.800 
cover for so long I had to wipe
everything<00:02:48.629> down<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.079> have<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.409> Rio<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:50.689> one<00:02:51.689> of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
everything down I have to Rio it one of

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.699 
everything down I have to Rio it one of
the<00:02:51.870> things<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.169> wish<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.470> had<00:02:52.560> done<00:02:52.650> differently

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the things I wish I had done differently

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.619 
the things I wish I had done differently
too<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.519> I<00:02:53.609> wish<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.939> had<00:02:54.030> allowed<00:02:54.239> for<00:02:54.299> more

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
too is I wish I had allowed for more

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.039 
too is I wish I had allowed for more
clearance<00:02:55.109> on<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:56.669> part<00:02:57.359> of<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
clearance on this part of the of the

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.159 
clearance on this part of the of the
trolley<00:02:58.290> because<00:02:59.250> it's<00:02:59.639> it's<00:03:00.090> tight<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.780> I'm

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
trolley because it's it's tight and I'm

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.709 
trolley because it's it's tight and I'm
just<00:03:01.500> too<00:03:01.799> anal<00:03:02.040> about<00:03:02.459> measurements<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.510> and

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
just too anal about measurements and and

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.209 
just too anal about measurements and and
clearances<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.349> stuff<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:04.859> should<00:03:05.099> have

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
clearances and stuff and I should have

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.209 
clearances and stuff and I should have
made<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.489> little<00:03:05.609> bit<00:03:05.790> looser<00:03:06.290> maybe<00:03:07.290> maybe

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
made it a little bit looser maybe maybe

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.580 
made it a little bit looser maybe maybe
it<00:03:08.400> would<00:03:08.549> it'll<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:09.299> would<00:03:09.450> have<00:03:09.540> gone<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.469> and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
it would it'll it would have gone up and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.839 
it would it'll it would have gone up and
down<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.739> little<00:03:10.889> easier<00:03:11.250> maybe<00:03:11.280> not<00:03:11.639> I<00:03:11.790> don't

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
down a little easier maybe not I don't

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.490 
down a little easier maybe not I don't
know<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.719> too<00:03:12.840> late<00:03:12.870> now<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.260> already

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
know it's too late now it's already

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.610 
know it's too late now it's already
built<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.819> yeah<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.449> let's<00:03:15.720> mess<00:03:16.290> with<00:03:16.470> this<00:03:16.560> a

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
built so yeah so let's mess with this a

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:26.170 
built so yeah so let's mess with this a
little<00:03:16.799> bit<00:03:16.949> and<00:03:17.069> see<00:03:17.280> where<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.549> go

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.870 

so<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.300> have<00:03:27.390> every<00:03:27.720> intention<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.880> continue

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
so we have every intention to continue

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.930 
so we have every intention to continue
to<00:03:30.030> use<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.360> engine<00:03:30.780> in<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.710> frame<00:03:32.010> because

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
to use the engine in the frame because

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.500 
to use the engine in the frame because
the<00:03:33.210> air<00:03:33.390> horn<00:03:34.310> horn<00:03:35.310> blows<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.790> air<00:03:36.120> box<00:03:36.330> and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
the air horn horn blows the air box and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.060 
the air horn horn blows the air box and
everything<00:03:36.930> are<00:03:37.080> kind<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.320> incorporated<00:03:37.920> into

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
everything are kind of incorporated into

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.740 
everything are kind of incorporated into
the<00:03:38.250> backbone<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.820> frame<00:03:39.090> first<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.660> all

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
the backbone of the frame first of all

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.310 
the backbone of the frame first of all
secondly<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:41.010> mounting<00:03:41.730> for<00:03:42.180> how<00:03:42.840> we<00:03:42.900> want

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
secondly the mounting for how we want

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.870 
secondly the mounting for how we want
the<00:03:43.530> engine<00:03:43.860> mounts<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.340> how<00:03:44.550> we're<00:03:44.700> going<00:03:44.760> to

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
the engine mounts and how we're going to

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.449 
the engine mounts and how we're going to
have<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.180> flip<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:46.230> rear<00:03:46.500> end<00:03:46.530> now<00:03:47.280> I<00:03:47.370> don't

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
have to flip this rear end now I don't

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.920 
have to flip this rear end now I don't
know<00:03:47.640> all<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.850> details<00:03:47.970> yet<00:03:48.300> so<00:03:48.630> don't<00:03:48.750> ask

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
know all the details yet so don't ask

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.230 
know all the details yet so don't ask
the<00:03:49.050> details<00:03:49.380> because<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:49.709> still<00:03:49.950> kind<00:03:50.130> of

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
the details because I'm still kind of

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.490 
the details because I'm still kind of
chewing<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.480> we're<00:03:51.690> both<00:03:51.870> still<00:03:52.200> kind<00:03:52.440> of

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
chewing and we're both still kind of

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.140 
chewing and we're both still kind of
chewing<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.890> in<00:03:53.070> our<00:03:53.190> heads<00:03:53.430> how<00:03:53.640> we<00:03:53.700> want<00:03:54.000> this

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
chewing it in our heads how we want this

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.440 
chewing it in our heads how we want this
done<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.950> primarily<00:03:56.150> primarily<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.300> reason

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
done and primarily primarily the reason

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.030 
done and primarily primarily the reason
why<00:03:57.720> I'm<00:03:57.840> keeping<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.260> frame<00:03:58.470> intact<00:03:58.860> is

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
why I'm keeping this frame intact is

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.650 
why I'm keeping this frame intact is
because<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.640> numbers<00:03:59.940> are<00:04:00.120> still<00:04:00.300> visible

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
because the numbers are still visible

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.630 
because the numbers are still visible
now<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.530> remember<00:04:01.890> I'm<00:04:02.040> taking<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.459> thing

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
now you remember I'm taking this thing

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.840 
now you remember I'm taking this thing
out<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.940> state<00:04:03.209> I'm<00:04:03.570> taking<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.459> across<00:04:05.459> state

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
out of state I'm taking it across state

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.220 
out of state I'm taking it across state
lines<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.510> don't<00:04:06.540> want<00:04:06.780> there<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:07.020> any

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
lines and I don't want there to be any

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.080 
lines and I don't want there to be any
question<00:04:07.440> about<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.190> authenticity<00:04:08.489> or

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
question about the authenticity or

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.150 
question about the authenticity or
origin<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:10.260> any<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.650> parts<00:04:10.890> on<00:04:11.040> this

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
origin of any of the parts on this

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.310 
origin of any of the parts on this
motorcycle<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.760> do<00:04:11.820> have<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.239> title<00:04:12.600> which

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
motorcycle I do have the title which

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.430 
motorcycle I do have the title which
matches<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.370> frame<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.900> engine<00:04:16.169> numbers

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
matches the frame and the engine numbers

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.930 
matches the frame and the engine numbers
you<00:04:16.950> know<00:04:17.070> this<00:04:17.220> thing<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.430> going<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.579> be<00:04:17.730> used

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
you know this thing is going to be used

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.390 
you know this thing is going to be used
in<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.180> woods<00:04:18.390> on<00:04:18.570> private<00:04:18.900> property<00:04:19.400> it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
in the woods on private property it

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.980 
in the woods on private property it
might<00:04:20.640> be<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.470> overcautious<00:04:22.760> possibly

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
might be and overcautious possibly

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.150 
might be and overcautious possibly
possibly<00:04:24.990> but<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.500> just<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.830> don't<00:04:25.890> want<00:04:26.100> to

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
possibly but I just I don't want to

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.950 
possibly but I just I don't want to
hassles<00:04:26.520> so<00:04:26.880> if<00:04:27.690> we<00:04:27.900> don't<00:04:28.080> really<00:04:28.290> gain<00:04:28.590> much

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
hassles so if we don't really gain much

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.100 
hassles so if we don't really gain much
anyway

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
anyway

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.540 
anyway
it's<00:04:31.470> gonna<00:04:31.590> work<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.070> I'll<00:04:32.220> show<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.430> how

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
it's gonna work and I'll show you how

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.190 
it's gonna work and I'll show you how
it's<00:04:32.669> gonna<00:04:32.729> work<00:04:33.000> I<00:04:33.150> think<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.750> think<00:04:33.930> we<00:04:34.050> have

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
it's gonna work I think I think we have

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.740 
it's gonna work I think I think we have
the<00:04:34.320> details<00:04:34.470> sorted<00:04:35.010> out<00:04:35.160> I<00:04:35.400> think<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:36.330> I

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
the details sorted out I think it's I

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.570 
the details sorted out I think it's I
think<00:04:36.930> it's<00:04:37.229> gonna<00:04:37.350> work<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:38.130> guys<00:04:38.280> recognize

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
think it's gonna work you guys recognize

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.090 
think it's gonna work you guys recognize
the<00:04:38.760> cherry<00:04:38.970> picker<00:04:39.290> that's<00:04:40.290> right<00:04:40.560> it's<00:04:41.070> a

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
the cherry picker that's right it's a

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.100 
the cherry picker that's right it's a
universal<00:04:41.669> joint<00:04:41.850> we<00:04:42.570> weren't<00:04:42.750> sure<00:04:42.900> if<00:04:43.020> it

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
universal joint we weren't sure if it

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.840 
universal joint we weren't sure if it
was<00:04:43.169> a<00:04:43.260> universal<00:04:43.740> or<00:04:43.979> a<00:04:44.010> constant<00:04:44.760> velocity

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
was a universal or a constant velocity

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.480 
was a universal or a constant velocity
joint<00:04:45.419> so<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.810> is<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.930> universal<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:47.250> runs

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
joint so it is a universal that runs

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.610 
joint so it is a universal that runs
this<00:04:47.669> driveshaft<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.020> think<00:04:49.110> that's<00:04:49.470> going

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
this driveshaft so I think that's going

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.530 
this driveshaft so I think that's going
to<00:04:49.680> make<00:04:49.770> our<00:04:50.070> fabrication<00:04:50.580> easier<00:04:51.060> on<00:04:51.270> how<00:04:51.479> we

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
to make our fabrication easier on how we

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.330 
to make our fabrication easier on how we
have<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.140> flip<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:53.780> swing<00:04:54.780> arm<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.340> again

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
have to flip this swing arm and again

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.980 
have to flip this swing arm and again
I'm<00:04:56.850> not<00:04:57.090> quite<00:04:57.330> sure<00:04:57.360> how<00:04:57.600> we're<00:04:57.720> gonna<00:04:57.780> do

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
I'm not quite sure how we're gonna do

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.659 
I'm not quite sure how we're gonna do
that<00:04:58.020> but<00:04:58.410> we'll<00:04:59.310> see

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
that but we'll see

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.130 
that but we'll see
this'll<00:05:00.090> all<00:05:00.150> fit<00:05:00.419> in<00:05:00.510> there<00:05:00.630> it's<00:05:00.870> all<00:05:00.990> gonna

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
this'll all fit in there it's all gonna

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.500 
this'll all fit in there it's all gonna
be<00:05:01.290> centered<00:05:01.650> it's<00:05:01.800> all<00:05:01.950> gonna<00:05:02.220> be<00:05:02.370> nice<00:05:02.580> so

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
be centered it's all gonna be nice so

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.490 
be centered it's all gonna be nice so
yeah<00:05:04.880> progress<00:05:05.880> is<00:05:06.060> good<00:05:06.300> this<00:05:06.960> is<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.260> kind

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
yeah progress is good this is the kind
