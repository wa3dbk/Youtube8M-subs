this before i get rid of my iphone 4 so
while<00:00:13.500> i<00:00:13.530> have<00:00:13.799> all<00:00:14.099> these<00:00:14.309> devices<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:15.030> front

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
while i have all these devices in front

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.300 
while i have all these devices in front
of<00:00:15.330> me<00:00:15.420> let's<00:00:16.020> get<00:00:16.230> started<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.859> some<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
of me let's get started so some of the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.010 
of me let's get started so some of the
speed<00:00:17.670> tests<00:00:18.029> i<00:00:18.090> will<00:00:18.270> be<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.539> over<00:00:18.720> today

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
speed tests i will be going over today

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.679 
speed tests i will be going over today
are<00:00:19.410> some<00:00:19.890> boot<00:00:20.070> up<00:00:20.220> tests<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> speed

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
are some boot up tests for the speed

down<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.690> devices<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.289> once<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:47.789> three

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
down all the devices at once the three

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.630 
down all the devices at once the three
device<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> Left<00:00:48.809> go<00:00:49.800> first<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
device on the Left go first and then the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.569 
device on the Left go first and then the
two<00:00:50.940> iphone<00:00:51.390> 4s<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> four<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.399> right

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
two iphone 4s and the four on the right

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.069 
two iphone 4s and the four on the right
will<00:00:53.789> go<00:00:53.910> second<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.480> we'll<00:00:54.629> start<00:00:54.840> off<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
will go second here we'll start off the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
will go second here we'll start off the
counter<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> roughly<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:59.030> 10<00:01:00.030> seconds

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
counter so roughly about 10 seconds

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.820 
counter so roughly about 10 seconds
later<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.579> iphone<00:01:03.000> 5<00:01:03.500> which<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
later or so the iphone 5 which is in the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.789 
later or so the iphone 5 which is in the
center<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:05.909> first<00:01:06.409> followed<00:01:07.409> by<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
center will go first followed by the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.789 
center will go first followed by the
iphone<00:01:08.310> 5c<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> 5s<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> left

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
iphone 5c and then the 5s on the left

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.690 
iphone 5c and then the 5s on the left
and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.240> later<00:01:12.600> after<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
and then a little bit later after that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.960 
and then a little bit later after that
your<00:01:14.700> iphone<00:01:15.210> 4s<00:01:15.869> which<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.070> user<00:01:17.340> running

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
your iphone 4s which is a user running

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.380 
your iphone 4s which is a user running
iOS<00:01:18.540> 7<00:01:18.990> should<00:01:19.740> pop<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.070> there<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.210> your

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
iOS 7 should pop up there and then your

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.530 
iOS 7 should pop up there and then your
iphone<00:01:21.750> 4<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.740> come<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.250> last<00:01:23.640> mainly

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
iphone 4 will come in last mainly

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.999 
iphone 4 will come in last mainly
because<00:01:24.720> well<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.350> an<00:01:25.470> older<00:01:25.770> generation

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
because well it's an older generation

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.640 
because well it's an older generation
device<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:27.360> we'll<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.720> doing<00:01:27.960> some<00:01:28.200> Geekbench

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
device now we'll be doing some Geekbench

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.100 
device now we'll be doing some Geekbench
3<00:01:28.880> benchmark<00:01:29.880> tests<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
3 benchmark tests so you can see all the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.190 
3 benchmark tests so you can see all the
model<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> OS<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.460> processor<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
model the OS the processor all the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200 
model the OS the processor all the
memory<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.799> each<00:01:35.009> device<00:01:35.400> has<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.119> you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
memory that each device has so if you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.840 
memory that each device has so if you
want<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> stop<00:01:36.600> individual<00:01:37.400> frames<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.640> see

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
want to stop individual frames to see

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.819 
want to stop individual frames to see
all<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.500> after<00:01:40.650> about

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
all that you can do that so after about

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.850 
all that you can do that so after about
34<00:01:41.430> seconds<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> iphone<00:01:42.869> 5s<00:01:43.290> will<00:01:43.590> come

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
34 seconds or so the iphone 5s will come

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.160 
34 seconds or so the iphone 5s will come
out<00:01:43.979> first<00:01:44.310> followed<00:01:45.149> by<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.659> after<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
out first followed by that after a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.560 
out first followed by that after a
minute<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.860> five<00:01:47.100> seconds<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> iphone<00:01:48.030> 5c

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
minute and five seconds the iphone 5c

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.730 
minute and five seconds the iphone 5c
and<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.020> five<00:01:50.030> should<00:01:51.030> follow<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.590> can

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and the five should follow and you can

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.800 
and the five should follow and you can
see<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> numbers<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.329> 5s

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
see some of the numbers there the 5s

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.469 
see some of the numbers there the 5s
well<00:01:55.290> advanced<00:01:55.920> over<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> other<00:01:56.549> iphones<00:01:57.180> in

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
well advanced over the other iphones in
