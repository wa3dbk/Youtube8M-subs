00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.779
 hello friends and friends today we come with a 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.590
 new project that is going to be a baby 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:13.969
 This is the body that is the face so 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.279
 that many asked me how it was done 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.350
 good that we are going to need for the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.990
 body we just do it in some 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.539
 of the cute baby and we will use 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.269
 this mold yes and we are going to sew it we are going to 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.030
 leave here open we fill it closed 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.500
 with invisible tip and then we do 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.530
 here with some tapes and we take it if in 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.100
 all the openings we're going to do the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.950
 patita this little leg you have it 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 as it is done in one of the tutorials 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.370
 that is full foot so they look for the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.969
 little hand we also have it is the little hand 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 with five fingers and the zero point below 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.150
 if they also have it in the tutorials 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.960
 the one that does not know how to do it so he looks for it 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:11.370
 good for the duckling use a circle 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 in polyamide of 12 5 centimeters for 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.150
 the little hands use a circle of 8 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.150
 centimeters 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.290
 I'm going to the body and I told you this 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:31.460
 mold yes I'll show it there in my 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:35.840
 blog www.guardian.co.uk 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.640
 for the hat I did it in modal if 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.640
 use this mold 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.210
 I'll also put it on the blog and what 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.480
 is what we're going to do is also a 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.869
 little circle with the same fabric to paste 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.390
 then pull out a pompom 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.530
 for the face use a circle on 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:02.240
 16 centimeters polyamide the point 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:06.979
 zero goes back I did the style on the nose 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.929
 tied the traditional type face yes and 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.290
 Once the face is done, I'll go 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.720
 to do these waves here I will extend the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.780
 I also think that there is in one of 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.620
 the dolls show them where they are going 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.590
 from here to costadito and they go to the point 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.620
 zero and the same do the other side and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.790
 the eyes stick them higher not here 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.450
 but higher up they see then they're going to 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.810
 get this little face that they asked me so much 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.850
 that show how they see is very easy 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.930
 so what am I going to do 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.850
 first I will locate here the little hands 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.850
 let's put glue 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.360
 around to adapt the hands this 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:02.610
 You have to do it with patience 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.610
 so that it is not bad 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.540
 being careful not to burn 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.490
 as I always tell you in the house 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.880
 they will do it with much more 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.880
 tranquility 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.569
 yes 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.499
 then it will go much better 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.499
 more verbose 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.940
 same here 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.329
 MMM 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.390
 let's put the tootsies after 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.100
 you plug this with a cap if 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.860
 they can be in the same polyamide 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.569
 they can cover the hole there or with cloth 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.549
 color what you want 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.549
 let's put here also 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.009
 let's see that they do well 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.340
 and the other 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.340
 the same 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.930
 I thought I was wrong 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.250
 the place of the foot quoted 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.250
 and bahamas 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.920
 yes 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.730
 a party 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.590
 see how it is going 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.590
 and here we are going to locate the hat 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:26.509
 we are going to put the point well 

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:26.509
 zero here 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.599
 there 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.320
 Lets put 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.950
 if he reads jail finger 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.950
 Tweet 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.630
 discard well 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.780
 if we are going to put him 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.629
 silicone and we're going to paste too 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.629
 a pompom 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.710
 and we will sustain 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.350
 so that it sticks well 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:53.940
 and we're going to hit last 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:58.670
 the face to the body 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.670
 if we are going to put silicone here 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.620
 and we are going to support the little face 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:17.590
 holding the good 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:20.830
 so that it hits well this would be 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:25.050
 our little boy I hope you have them 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:29.720

 they have this beautiful our little boy 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.080
 It is very easy to do and it serves to
