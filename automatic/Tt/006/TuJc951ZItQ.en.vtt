00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
like a huge old 30-foot wide painting

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.020 
like a huge old 30-foot wide painting
where<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.200> feels<00:01:32.470> like<00:01:32.679> this<00:01:33.009> scope<00:01:33.789> and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
where it feels like this scope and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.219 
where it feels like this scope and
that's<00:01:34.210> something<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.600> Bradford

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
that's something that Bradford

absolutely excels in painting these

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.219 
absolutely excels in painting these
pictures<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.799> this<00:01:39.040> very<00:01:39.280> wide<00:01:39.549> palette<00:01:40.240> it's

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
pictures in this very wide palette it's

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.050 
pictures in this very wide palette it's
hard<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.500> photograph<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:42.130> city<00:01:42.310> that's<00:01:42.490> totally

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
hard to photograph a city that's totally

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.330 
hard to photograph a city that's totally
360<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.170> what<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.409> used<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.740> be<00:01:44.770> in<00:01:45.070> New<00:01:45.280> York

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
360 of what it used to be in New York

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.399 
360 of what it used to be in New York
City<00:01:45.670> is<00:01:45.790> really<00:01:46.119> hard<00:01:46.329> to<00:01:46.420> find<00:01:46.750> those<00:01:46.960> funky

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
City is really hard to find those funky

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.020 
City is really hard to find those funky
little<00:01:47.530> corners<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.220> show<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.610> sort<00:01:48.909> of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
little corners to show the sort of

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.530 
little corners to show the sort of
refined<00:01:49.780> quality<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.829> decay<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.299> think

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
refined quality of decay and I think

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.940 
refined quality of decay and I think
that's<00:01:52.750> what<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:53.229> was<00:01:53.469> hoping<00:01:53.560> we<00:01:53.829> could

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
that's what I was hoping we could

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.010 
that's what I was hoping we could
achieve<00:01:54.040> with<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.549> film<00:01:54.790> is<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.210> frame<00:01:55.810> the

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
achieve with the film is to frame the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.469 
achieve with the film is to frame the
decay<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.590> period<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.219> a<00:01:57.369> more<00:01:57.670> sharp<00:01:58.149> and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
decay of that period in a more sharp and

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.319 
decay of that period in a more sharp and
precise<00:01:59.290> way<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.369> for<00:02:00.670> me<00:02:00.790> it<00:02:00.880> was<00:02:00.969> all<00:02:01.119> about

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
precise way so for me it was all about

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.100 
precise way so for me it was all about
growth

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
growth

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.160 
growth
could<00:02:02.260> learn<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.440> lot<00:02:02.620> in<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.920> shot
