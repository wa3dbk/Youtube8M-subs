to<00:02:36.980> get<00:02:37.070> into<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.460> hardware<00:02:37.850> this<00:02:38.090> hardware

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
to get into the hardware this hardware

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.040 
to get into the hardware this hardware
is<00:02:38.810> absolutely<00:02:39.350> insane<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:39.890> are<00:02:40.010> running<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.490> a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
is absolutely insane we are running on a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.050 
is absolutely insane we are running on a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
one now now there's also a single 40

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.310 
one now now there's also a single 40
nanometer<00:03:25.970> chip<00:03:26.390> which<00:03:26.660> contains<00:03:27.080> both<00:03:27.260> the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
nanometer chip which contains both the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.310 
nanometer chip which contains both the
CPU<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.220> GPU<00:03:28.330> gather<00:03:29.330> then<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.110> two

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
CPU and GPU gather then the two

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.710 
CPU and GPU gather then the two
dedicated<00:03:31.070> 90<00:03:32.030> got<00:03:32.780> 90<00:03:33.500> nanometer<00:03:34.720> graphics

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
dedicated 90 got 90 nanometer graphics

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.810 
dedicated 90 got 90 nanometer graphics
in<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.200> xbox<00:03:36.560> 360<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.550> is<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:38.050> is<00:03:39.050> great

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
in the xbox 360 so that is that is great

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.090 
in the xbox 360 so that is that is great
because<00:03:40.820> that<00:03:41.060> makes<00:03:41.300> it<00:03:41.480> smaller<00:03:41.920> runs<00:03:42.920> it

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
because that makes it smaller runs it

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.520 
because that makes it smaller runs it
better<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.520> I<00:03:44.390> am<00:03:44.510> looking<00:03:44.630> forward<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.200> it

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
better and I am looking forward to it

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.170 
better and I am looking forward to it
the<00:03:46.520> processor<00:03:47.210> in<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:49.180> completely

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
the processor in it is completely

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.570 
the processor in it is completely
reinvented<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.380> is<00:03:51.650> going<00:03:51.800> to<00:03:51.860> run<00:03:52.070> game<00:03:52.280> so

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
reinvented it is going to run game so

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.940 
reinvented it is going to run game so
much<00:03:52.700> smoother<00:03:53.090> without<00:03:53.270> flag<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.830> also

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
much smoother without flag and it also

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.940 
much smoother without flag and it also
has<00:03:55.160> 8<00:03:55.910> gigabytes<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.630> RAM<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.530> you

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
has 8 gigabytes of RAM so that is you

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.190 
has 8 gigabytes of RAM so that is you
can<00:03:58.160> run<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.700> much<00:03:58.880> stuff<00:03:59.210> at<00:03:59.420> once<00:03:59.480> most

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
can run so much stuff at once most

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.010 
can run so much stuff at once most

one and one thing I am worried about is

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.720 
one and one thing I am worried about is
going<00:04:17.420> to<00:04:17.540> be<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.989> price<00:04:18.350> now<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:19.549> buy<00:04:19.700> a

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
going to be the price now to buy a

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.789 
going to be the price now to buy a
computer<00:04:20.090> with<00:04:20.570> 8<00:04:20.840> gigabytes<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:21.410> RAM<00:04:21.620> you're

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
computer with 8 gigabytes of RAM you're

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.380 
computer with 8 gigabytes of RAM you're
looking<00:04:22.070> at<00:04:22.160> about<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.400> thousand<00:04:22.910> dollars<00:04:23.210> I

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
looking at about a thousand dollars I

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.240 
looking at about a thousand dollars I
know<00:04:24.080> they're<00:04:24.350> not<00:04:24.380> going<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.710> charge<00:04:24.919> that

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
know they're not going to charge that

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.830 
know they're not going to charge that
for<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.520> Xbox<00:04:25.940> one

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
for the Xbox one

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.070 
for the Xbox one
because<00:04:27.530> all<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.669> other<00:04:28.699> xboxes<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.870> have

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
because all the other xboxes that have

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.860 
because all the other xboxes that have
come<00:04:30.350> out<00:04:30.410> have<00:04:30.889> been<00:04:31.060> reasonably<00:04:32.060> priced<00:04:32.419> to

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
come out have been reasonably priced to

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.090 
come out have been reasonably priced to
fit<00:04:33.070> most<00:04:34.070> people's<00:04:34.699> budgets<00:04:35.150> um<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.919> is

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
fit most people's budgets um but it is

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.560 
fit most people's budgets um but it is
going<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.430> be<00:04:37.520> expensive<00:04:37.729> all<00:04:38.330> of<00:04:38.479> the

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
going to be expensive all of the

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.150 
going to be expensive all of the
hardware<00:04:38.840> that<00:04:39.020> went<00:04:39.199> into<00:04:39.290> this<00:04:39.500> alone<00:04:39.919> is

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
hardware that went into this alone is

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.700 
hardware that went into this alone is
going<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.520> be<00:04:40.729> a<00:04:40.760> lot<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.150> money<00:04:41.350> but<00:04:42.350> hopefully

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
going to be a lot of money but hopefully

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.870 
going to be a lot of money but hopefully
we<00:04:42.830> can<00:04:42.979> see<00:04:43.100> this<00:04:43.250> thing<00:04:43.370> come<00:04:43.550> out<00:04:43.639> for
