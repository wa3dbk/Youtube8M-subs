quick review at the end of this video

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.319 
quick review at the end of this video
that<00:00:31.590> package<00:00:32.279> will<00:00:32.550> get<00:00:32.700> into<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.149> two

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that package will get into in two

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.060 
that package will get into in two
seconds<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.170> i'm<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.829> showing<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
seconds and i'm just showing here the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.709 
seconds and i'm just showing here the
you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.430> scan<00:00:38.969> are<00:00:39.149> meeting<00:00:39.510> their

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you can see that scan are meeting their

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.970 
you can see that scan are meeting their
sort<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.250> obligations<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.579> green<00:00:42.649> being<00:00:43.649> green

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
sort of obligations to green being green

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.610 
sort of obligations to green being green
and<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.940> mean<00:00:45.450> how<00:00:45.570> much<00:00:45.690> excess<00:00:46.079> places<00:00:46.500> in

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and I mean how much excess places in

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.100 
and I mean how much excess places in
this<00:00:46.739> box<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.129> ridiculous<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.780> suppose

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
this box is ridiculous but I suppose

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.080 
this box is ridiculous but I suppose
things<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.649> hdd's<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.550> kept<00:00:50.910> in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
things like hdd's have to be kept in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.240 
things like hdd's have to be kept in
transit<00:00:51.539> quite<00:00:51.840> still<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> suppose<00:00:53.039> what's

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
transit quite still so I suppose what's

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.549 
transit quite still so I suppose what's
the<00:00:53.399> reason<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.149> excess<00:00:54.780> air

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the reason for all this excess air

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.689 
the reason for all this excess air
packages<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
packages so as you can see here in that

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.750 
packages so as you can see here in that
original<00:01:00.059> package<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.199> 16<00:01:02.070> gigabytes<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
original package we have 16 gigabytes of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030 
original package we have 16 gigabytes of
Corsair<00:01:03.300> Vengeance<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.290> went<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> low

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
Corsair Vengeance and I went for the low

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.609 
Corsair Vengeance and I went for the low
profile<00:01:05.670> version<00:01:06.150> add<00:01:06.720> 8<00:01:07.020> gigabytes<00:01:07.470> of

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
profile version add 8 gigabytes of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.679 
profile version add 8 gigabytes of
kingston<00:01:08.040> hyperx<00:01:08.159> before<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:08.970> 10<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.299> upgrade

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
kingston hyperx before but 10 to upgrade

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.539 
kingston hyperx before but 10 to upgrade
and<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.650> I've<00:01:10.740> got<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> low<00:01:11.070> profile

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and you can see I've got the low profile

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.570 
and you can see I've got the low profile
here<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.090> cpu<00:01:12.869> fan<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.439> quite<00:01:14.010> low<00:01:14.369> on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
here because my cpu fan is quite low on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.910 
here because my cpu fan is quite low on
the<00:01:14.670> mother

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
the mother

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.490 
the mother
board<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.369> so<00:01:15.640> in<00:01:16.240> order<00:01:16.420> for<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.840> RAM<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.259> fit

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
board and so in order for the RAM to fit

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.020 
board and so in order for the RAM to fit
effectively<00:01:18.189> I<00:01:18.340> need<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.580> go<00:01:18.670> for<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.880> low

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
effectively I need to go for a low

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.770 
effectively I need to go for a low
profile<00:01:19.479> version<00:01:19.900> and<00:01:20.520> I've<00:01:21.520> also<00:01:21.780> upgraded

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
profile version and I've also upgraded

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.179 
profile version and I've also upgraded
the<00:01:23.200> SSD<00:01:24.070> from<00:01:24.820> my<00:01:25.000> old<00:01:25.210> six<00:01:25.540> TTYL<00:01:25.990> ocz<00:01:26.979> agility

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
the SSD from my old six TTYL ocz agility

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.380 
the SSD from my old six TTYL ocz agility
3<00:01:27.820> 2<00:01:28.090> 120<00:01:29.020> gigabytes<00:01:29.259> force<00:01:29.799> 3<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.610> lot<00:01:30.850> faster

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
3 2 120 gigabytes force 3 a lot faster

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.950 
3 2 120 gigabytes force 3 a lot faster
and<00:01:31.570> doesn't<00:01:32.049> put<00:01:32.440> my<00:01:32.619> pc<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.190> crash<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:34.750> you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
and doesn't put my pc to crash as you

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.100 
and doesn't put my pc to crash as you
can<00:01:35.080> see<00:01:35.229> I've<00:01:35.440> also<00:01:35.619> upgraded<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.899> APD<00:01:37.899> to<00:01:38.080> a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
can see I've also upgraded the APD to a

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.039 
can see I've also upgraded the APD to a
two<00:01:38.380> terabyte<00:01:38.729> seagate<00:01:39.729> barracuda<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
two terabyte seagate barracuda the

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.289 
two terabyte seagate barracuda the
reason<00:01:41.350> behind<00:01:41.409> this<00:01:41.710> is<00:01:41.890> because<00:01:42.220> HD<00:01:43.060> files

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
reason behind this is because HD files

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.139 
reason behind this is because HD files
on<00:01:43.509> a<00:01:43.840> huge<00:01:44.439> amount<00:01:44.680> of<00:01:44.770> space<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.280> so<00:01:45.520> I<00:01:45.820> need

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
on a huge amount of space and so I need

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.040 
on a huge amount of space and so I need
need<00:01:46.840> more<00:01:47.110> room<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:48.000> that's<00:01:49.000> not<00:01:49.179> that's<00:01:49.840> just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
need more room so that's not that's just

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.440 
need more room so that's not that's just
a<00:01:50.380> an<00:01:50.770> extra<00:01:51.159> drive<00:01:51.399> so<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.700> speak<00:01:52.000> because<00:01:52.210> I

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
a an extra drive so to speak because I

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.730 
a an extra drive so to speak because I
need<00:01:52.630> more<00:01:52.869> room<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.319> my<00:01:53.440> pc<00:01:55.289> okay<00:01:56.289> so<00:01:56.350> we're

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
need more room and my pc okay so we're

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.210 
need more room and my pc okay so we're
going<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:56.950> get<00:01:57.039> into<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.460> benq<00:01:58.179> boxing<00:01:58.720> here

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
going to get into the benq boxing here

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.210 
going to get into the benq boxing here
now<00:02:00.220> this<00:02:01.000> was<00:02:01.600> quite<00:02:02.020> an<00:02:02.259> expensive<00:02:02.530> monitor

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
now this was quite an expensive monitor

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.380 
now this was quite an expensive monitor
and<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:04.659> did<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.020> lot<00:02:05.229> of<00:02:05.259> research<00:02:05.740> with<00:02:06.009> some

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and I did a lot of research with some

slightly<00:02:17.769> more<00:02:18.069> than<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.450> there's<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.510> newer

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
slightly more than the there's a newer

version<00:02:19.840> which<00:02:20.560> technically<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.519> capable<00:02:21.850> of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
version which technically is capable of

144 hurts and also boasts of a 1

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.699 
144 hurts and also boasts of a 1
millisecond<00:02:25.570> response<00:02:25.840> time<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:26.560> also

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
millisecond response time and it's also

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.490 
millisecond response time and it's also
slightly<00:02:26.859> cheaper<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.720> lacks<00:02:29.079> quite<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
slightly cheaper but it lacks quite a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.160 
slightly cheaper but it lacks quite a
few<00:02:29.709> features<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.850> monitor<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.359> so<00:02:31.810> I

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
few features of this monitor and so I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.650 
few features of this monitor and so I
ended<00:02:32.859> up<00:02:32.980> going<00:02:33.160> for<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.549> one<00:02:33.609> and<00:02:34.030> I'll<00:02:34.540> go

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
ended up going for this one and I'll go

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.140 
ended up going for this one and I'll go
into<00:02:34.810> those<00:02:34.959> reasons<00:02:35.230> shortly<00:02:35.829> but<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:37.030> can

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
into those reasons shortly but you can

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.440 
into those reasons shortly but you can
see<00:02:37.299> there<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.600> comes<00:02:37.720> with<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.959> 120<00:02:38.829> Hertz<00:02:39.450> DVI

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
see there it comes with a 120 Hertz DVI

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.330 
see there it comes with a 120 Hertz DVI
cable<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.320> dvi-d<00:02:41.950> cable<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.989> guess<00:02:44.920> that's

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
cable the dvi-d cable and I guess that's

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.360 
cable the dvi-d cable and I guess that's
the<00:02:45.459> stand<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.239> also<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:47.230> monitor<00:02:47.980> cover<00:02:48.190> in

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
the stand and also a monitor cover in

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.250 
the stand and also a monitor cover in
case<00:02:48.519> you<00:02:48.700> wanted<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:48.970> put<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.630> into<00:02:49.780> transit

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
case you wanted to put it into transit

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.660 
case you wanted to put it into transit
and<00:02:50.380> move<00:02:50.530> around<00:02:50.769> whatever<00:02:51.160> keep<00:02:51.489> that

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
and move around whatever keep that

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.240 
and move around whatever keep that
beautiful<00:02:51.970> screen<00:02:52.480> safe<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:53.859> was<00:02:54.040> kind

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
beautiful screen safe and this was kind

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.030 
beautiful screen safe and this was kind
of<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.989> orgasmic<00:02:55.989> moment<00:02:56.350> where<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.500> first<00:02:56.799> got

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
of the orgasmic moment where I first got

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.740 
of the orgasmic moment where I first got

it doesn't have the response time and

it doesn't have the response time and

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
pc gaming to take it seriously so this

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.960 
pc gaming to take it seriously so this
one<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.859> replacement<00:03:18.220> I've<00:03:18.670> been<00:03:18.790> using

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
one is the replacement I've been using

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.170 
one is the replacement I've been using
my<00:03:19.120> brother's<00:03:19.500> samsung<00:03:20.500> syncmaster<00:03:21.459> for<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
my brother's samsung syncmaster for the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.420 
my brother's samsung syncmaster for the
last<00:03:22.389> six<00:03:22.959> months<00:03:23.110> or<00:03:23.349> something

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
last six months or something

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.640 
last six months or something
and<00:03:24.730> that's<00:03:25.030> kind<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.629> okay<00:03:25.750> but<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.260> the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and that's kind of okay but the the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.809 
and that's kind of okay but the the
response<00:03:27.010> times<00:03:27.250> like<00:03:27.400> eight<00:03:27.519> milliseconds

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
response times like eight milliseconds

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.429 
response times like eight milliseconds
and<00:03:28.359> it<00:03:28.480> certainly<00:03:28.689> I<00:03:28.870> don't<00:03:29.140> think<00:03:29.290> it's<00:03:29.379> even

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439 
and it certainly I don't think it's even

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.399 
and it certainly I don't think it's even
a<00:03:29.650> 60<00:03:29.980> Hertz<00:03:30.159> it<00:03:30.340> might<00:03:30.459> be<00:03:30.549> 60<00:03:30.879> Hertz<00:03:31.349> okay<00:03:32.349> so

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
a 60 Hertz it might be 60 Hertz okay so

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.199 
a 60 Hertz it might be 60 Hertz okay so
we<00:03:32.650> can<00:03:32.769> see<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:33.189> their<00:03:33.519> monitors<00:03:33.879> now<00:03:33.909> up

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
we can see that their monitors now up

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.959 
we can see that their monitors now up

i<00:03:44.170> was<00:03:44.290> looking<00:03:44.530> at<00:03:44.590> from<00:03:44.769> benq<00:03:45.219> is<00:03:45.489> the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
i was looking at from benq is the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.849 
i was looking at from benq is the
adjustability<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.840> patency<00:03:47.260> stand<00:03:47.709> that

comes with this and I don't believe it
was<00:03:50.409> a<00:03:50.439> feature<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.950> other<00:03:51.099> one<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:51.489> you

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
was a feature of the other one but you

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.250 
was a feature of the other one but you

this<00:04:02.260> funny<00:04:02.560> angle<00:04:02.950> if<00:04:03.099> you<00:04:03.250> require<00:04:03.639> to<00:04:03.790> do<00:04:03.939> so

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
this funny angle if you require to do so

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.000 
this funny angle if you require to do so
I<00:04:04.180> do<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.319> makes<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.650> easier<00:04:05.980> to

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
I do so because it makes it easier to

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.449 
I do so because it makes it easier to
access<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.549> cables<00:04:07.650> when<00:04:08.650> you're<00:04:08.829> setting<00:04:09.340> up

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
access the cables when you're setting up

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.670 
access the cables when you're setting up
and<00:04:09.669> whatever<00:04:09.879> but<00:04:09.969> I'm<00:04:10.180> not<00:04:10.329> really<00:04:10.510> sure<00:04:10.680> in

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
and whatever but I'm not really sure in

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.970 
and whatever but I'm not really sure in
what<00:04:12.000> real<00:04:13.000> life<00:04:13.290> computer<00:04:14.290> situation<00:04:14.500> you

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
what real life computer situation you

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.259 
what real life computer situation you
want<00:04:15.129> to<00:04:15.280> do<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.579> maybe<00:04:15.790> if<00:04:15.939> someone<00:04:16.180> could

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
want to do that maybe if someone could

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.520 
want to do that maybe if someone could
let<00:04:16.419> me<00:04:16.449> know<00:04:16.570> in<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.780> comments<00:04:17.139> below<00:04:17.169> that

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
let me know in the comments below that

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.520 
let me know in the comments below that
would<00:04:17.620> be<00:04:17.680> great<00:04:18.539> but<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.889> can<00:04:21.070> see<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:22.530> on

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
would be great but you can see that on

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.600 
would be great but you can see that on
top<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.889> this<00:04:24.039> you<00:04:24.490> get<00:04:24.759> two<00:04:25.090> USB<00:04:25.690> ports<00:04:25.720> and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
top of this you get two USB ports and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.219 
top of this you get two USB ports and
also<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:28.180> headphone<00:04:28.690> jack<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:30.750> then<00:04:31.750> I'll<00:04:32.020> show

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
also a headphone jack and then I'll show

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.070 
also a headphone jack and then I'll show
you<00:04:32.289> quickly<00:04:32.590> at<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.830> back<00:04:33.070> here<00:04:33.099> that

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
you quickly at the back here that

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.430 
you quickly at the back here that
they're<00:04:35.080> sort<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.349> input<00:04:35.740> points<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:36.280> get

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
they're sort of input points you get

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.250 
they're sort of input points you get
amongst<00:04:38.250> other<00:04:38.370> things<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.820> get<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.140> HTM<00:04:40.140> eyes

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
amongst other things you get to HTM eyes

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.560 
amongst other things you get to HTM eyes
although<00:04:40.560> from<00:04:41.040> knowledge<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.640> HDMI<00:04:42.210> only

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
although from knowledge the HDMI only

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.840 
although from knowledge the HDMI only
actually<00:04:42.930> covers<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.470> 60<00:04:43.920> Hertz<00:04:44.160> signal<00:04:44.670> so

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
actually covers the 60 Hertz signal so

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.790 
actually covers the 60 Hertz signal so
if<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.060> want<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.300> go<00:04:45.360> for<00:04:45.540> that<00:04:45.630> for<00:04:45.870> 120<00:04:46.620> hertz

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
if you want to go for that for 120 hertz

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.210 
if you want to go for that for 120 hertz
and<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:47.040> 3d<00:04:47.990> nvidia<00:04:48.990> settings<00:04:49.410> then<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:50.040> need

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
and a 3d nvidia settings then you need

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.260 
and a 3d nvidia settings then you need
to<00:04:50.400> be<00:04:50.550> using<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:51.150> jewel<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.960> dvi-d<00:04:52.410> cable

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
to be using the jewel the dvi-d cable

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.400 
to be using the jewel the dvi-d cable
that<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.300> actually<00:04:54.780> supplied<00:04:55.110> with<00:04:55.290> the

monitor<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.890> i<00:04:56.040> didn't<00:04:56.280> think<00:04:56.310> it<00:04:56.490> actually

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
monitor and i didn't think it actually

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.370 
monitor and i didn't think it actually
was<00:04:56.910> but<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.510> does<00:04:57.690> need<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:57.900> be<00:04:57.990> carrying<00:04:58.290> the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.160 
was but it does need to be carrying the
signal<00:04:58.740> well<00:04:58.950> so<00:04:59.280> that's<00:04:59.820> always<00:05:00.090> good<00:05:00.390> the
