00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.680
 yet there were only 5,000 spectators on bald heath in Kerkrade and they saw roda 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.380
 eagerly off the starting blocks, something wanted to make good after the 5 2 defeat 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.049
 at home against Volendam 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.200
 boerebach sees a few years it is the first minute of the match 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.099
 enne touches his countryman from the book 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.149
 in the maastricht goal and i am i can defender nineteen years 

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.149
 he is young wilson anja 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.539
 boerebach 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.510
 in the heart of the roda team barry always meet robbie de la haye 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.109
 and so did not enter the competition this is Eric Meijer 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.350
 who sent us this way and that site under borlÃ©es because of that she has me 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.070
 nothing pl 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.210
 in Kerkrade ahead 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.820
 0 against a bus 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.600
 hans fisherman 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.440
 beautiful pass of mine offside 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.760
 and Hans Fisher's turn to buy vitesse earlier 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.429
 he brings and too much head start to the grief of the pol hendrik beans 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.430
 the noisy 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.770
 pipes no thyssen reijners 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.650
 the left is going to be able to 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.620
 Chris Meijer and who is caught by Boris Haag who looks he does it or does it 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.740
 ie not she says the mate 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.740
 And they don't give away a penalty 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.380
 he looks at you and judges you 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.740
 marcel meijer is just 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.060
 with his feet 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.680
 roda escapes 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.730
 farmer debate 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.220
 paint a difficult competition such as roda 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.929
 the game progressed gradually 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.060
 increasingly difficult always steadily anticipating 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.730
 few made it to the back line 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.670
 hoffmann 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 go inside 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.399
 and that it scrape the wall 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.220
 and the rebound for Arnold the Australian 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.470
 the flashy response from again 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.650
 in the third week 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.830
 of the weather 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.610
 nice for defending them 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.610
 arnold and to year again 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.850
 and there 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 discuss roorda 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.710
 come to the fore from FC Twente 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.199
 the president jordens 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.009
 that will be replaced 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.589
 the shot of hiding roma that put back harmonix ball well 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.669
 and again the rescue of aegon prima goalkeeper 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.509
 van de leur with the free kicks so went a barrage of attacks 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.669
 continued with a header of hagen 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.399
 who injured his groin 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:33.099
 and the second half did not come back replacement was dundee trost 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:42.019
 difficult evening with lindes as an opponent here is the album by the way 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.229
 take the ball 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.180
 of a corner 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.180
 for roda 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.929
 headed away by linders 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.849
 and that has many good ones 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.329
 was also much smaller than a men's soccer field 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.569
 Hans's fisherman is coming 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.569
 and pay attention to the bar but in the center 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.619
 a shot of evil 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.159
 it goes astray 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.409
 quading who had entered the team for reijners 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.409
 who left the field injured in the first half 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.789
 the second half all in all 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:23.789
 the two finds increasingly uncertain play 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.199
 violation of the turn 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.219
 mvv I said that a lot 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.219
 small nimble players does not have many 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.989
 if a big strong guy waits 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.659
 meijer 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.019
 hoffmann 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.919
 then you go 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.369
 runners defended 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.369
 language again 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.719
 but you learn the france 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.339
 and there the free head chance of talpa 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.789
 that could be found more often in the front 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:03.789
 must make moves with this earth 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.539
 outward west 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.609
 roda kept trying 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.039
 it is a header of arnoldussen nice of transport basket 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:17.229
 but the game of the Kerkrade team 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.999
 full of anticipation, the game started this poverty 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.740
 anja puts them away 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.740
 he touches how all reacts perfectly 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.140
 also trainer koster 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.710
 lock with his assistants 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.710
 they know that road again what should you do now 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.529
 boerebach time and again with bella you in front of you 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:46.509
 yes of course good distance disease but the conviction at boerebach 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.999
 was missing from the evening 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.409
 he also doesn't like to play 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.659
 on the position but I had to act with sixteen so cross 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:56.919
 users 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.919
 disturbed in quadia 8 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:04.930
 in the evening 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.349
 for the boss 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.259
 those with exuberances 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.259
 and then hofman can participate 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.419
 the demand for the second line plays a role 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.430
 Users can defend well a shot from defender goal it touches 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.169
 hansson 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.699
 full in the face 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.169
 This is one of our can match the season 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.169
 fisherman's gordon 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.020
 and there the stable 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.270
 and who suddenly returns 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.349
 how to rhyme the album 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.650
 brings his team 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.839
 with the enemy 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.069
 at roda at 2 0 of course it is boerstra 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.879
 most of them go too far for their goal but all keepers do 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.879
 soccer is perfect 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:01.619
 a few minutes then 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:02.860
 pl 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.370
 is always going well the player again missed a chance of fisherman japan of hansen 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.860
 gabor westra prevents greater calamity 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.180
 51 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.409
 like the ten days ago 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:18.689
 roda volendam and now behind against mtv that did not win so this competition 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.149
 but now the winnings can no longer slip wilders 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.949
 really the very last minute 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.449
 Hoffmann with the last shot in the short corner, a save from Boelrestraat 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:30.990
 so roda loses again 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.500
 and wind mvv 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.560
 for the first time this competition in Kerkrade with 2 0
