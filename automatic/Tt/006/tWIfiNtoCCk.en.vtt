you know get one without my grandparents
open<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:19.040> anyway<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.280> isn't<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.330> one

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
open up anyway it isn't like this one

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.469 
open up anyway it isn't like this one
should<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.939> realist<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> don't

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
should be in the in realist I don't

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
should be in the in realist I don't
think<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> is

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
think it is

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.030 
think it is
anyway<00:01:26.660> so<00:01:27.660> let's<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.410> closer<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.830> look<00:01:28.890> at

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
anyway so let's get closer and look at

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.930 
anyway so let's get closer and look at
this<00:01:29.160> and<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.460> point<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.910> think

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
this and the point of if you think

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.960 
this and the point of if you think
another<00:01:30.270> fix<00:01:31.340> right<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.730> tell<00:01:32.880> what

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
another fix right or you can tell what

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
another fix right or you can tell what
