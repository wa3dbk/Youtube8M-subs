shoes they have enough room to be
comfortable<00:01:59.790> if<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.450> can't<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.170> or<00:02:01.380> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
comfortable if you can't do it or you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.350

feel<00:02:01.680> too<00:02:01.890> constricted<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.180> not

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
feel too constricted or it's not

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.300 
feel too constricted or it's not
comfortable<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.960> push<00:02:04.619> yourself<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:05.100> for<00:02:05.250> that

comfortable to push yourself up for that

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.039 
comfortable to push yourself up for that
moment<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:06.240> heels<00:02:06.509> may<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.780> too

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.240 
in some heels like Louboutins it's
actually<00:02:21.020> part<00:02:21.319> of<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> appeal<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:21.860> your
