00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:11.640
 let's make suckling pig 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:15.830
 for its preparation we will need 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.830
 a chopped suckling pig 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.880
 three heads of garlic 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.150
 three bay leaves 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.320
 one tablespoon of pepper in grain 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.900
 and a liter and a half of olive oil 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.340
 Well, I'm going to add some salt to the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.170
 Suckling pig added garlic laurel la 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:44.000
 pepper the oil 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.129
 and I'll put fire to at least one 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.789
 very low fire 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.220
 It has to be cooked between 60 and 90 degrees 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.760
 centigrade 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:59.470
 it has to be very slow by much 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.770
 suckling pig or 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.820
 piglet 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.550
 but that he is still taking breast milk 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.730
 What does this state consist of ? 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.880
 that fats are founded and that the 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.490
 very juicy meat inside cooking 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.080
 It is very good also for the lamb and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.080
 the duck 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.170
 when the two hours have passed he covered it 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.290
 He put out the fire and let it cool 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.900
 in this case I leave it from one day to the next 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.040
 he can not even leave two days without 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.660
 refrigerate 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.960
 well here I prepare the oven grill 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.990
 I light the oven at 180 degrees or 360 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:50.040
 Fahrenheit degrees 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.040
 and left it in 45 minutes 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.220
 this is so that to vote the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.860
 excess fat and the skin is browned 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.560
 I also take advantage of the tray and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.540
 some potatoes cut in half for 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.310
 to be cooked with the oil that has 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.069
 pulled the piglet 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.470
 It is very important to put it in the oven to 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.350
 to remove excess fat 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.940
 even though it has been cooked in 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.130
 oil stay behind 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.280
 good as they realize is a 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.560
 delicious preparation let's write your 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.560
