00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:23.770
 shampoo shampoo still you say but 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.710
 layers you should always 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:31.119
 laugh at yours you have to use your 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.629
 voice so her hair is type 4 c 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:39.720
 and there they are pretty sweet after 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:43.930
 the shampoo so you 're going to separate 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.140
 the hair in several parts me 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.140
 I have 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.829
 jacob so watch out for the trap 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.190
 with the heads of type 4 c it's not 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.660
 not take your hair and pull it 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.480
 like that because like goat are 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.210
 very few sites you want the risk 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.360
 to create nodes and higher that's it 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.840
 my dear delicately to you are the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.840
 patients 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.200
 here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 this 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.260
 and you proceed by part cclat 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.750
 a small scale 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.820
 always proceeded on course to 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.820
 facilitate demolding 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.310
 so here sorry girls I have more than 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.900
 drums 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.120
 so we've done the rest 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:58.380
 head you see that I proceeded by 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.420
 part i saw part but be able to do 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.790
 a lot more if you find that more 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.740
 easy 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.800
 So that's awarded to the last part 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.960
 all girls have hair of 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.429
 type 4 it's very very hard for you 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.050
 must recognize me a cage match 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.290
 it's longer for you than that 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.550
 the air 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:22.420
 so with your vapo you change the 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.420
 hair part 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.360
 insist on the points then you 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.820
 go take your hair styling or 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.810
 divine conditional brief that's it's 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.070
 more than you too you try to 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.070
 to make something without sulfate 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.510
 and now we know it all with a 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.280
 fat you have to know that more 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.230
 you have frizzy hair over you 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.290
 will need a fat 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.810
 heavy here I use on his 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.540
 hair a cocoa shea whipped cream 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.200
 but prefer oils like oil 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:16.740
 castor oil mustard and so on 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.750
 and so that's it 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.490
 we must have made the rag 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.890
 method to the other method so that's to 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:28.710
 say the water the water finally the vapo living and 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.860
 the fat we take our comb 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:38.760
 with wide teeth adam there I repeat or a 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.440
 tiger type brush tiger but I 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.100
 can do the comb with wide teeth and 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.000
 we begin to unravel the test 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.730
 always by the spikes 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.180
 we start with the points because then 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.180
 we go back 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.540
 so here I think these points have 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.640
 need a little cup but good king 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.640
 damsel named by 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.640
 and 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.359
 of what there you see I really 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.539
 gradually to the roots in 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.220
 holding each time we separate the 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:30.210
 hidden part of melee and the part in 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.919
 emails and already for them it helps because 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.370
 that you have more hold on the 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:39.870
 hair and in addition the person of 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.920
 meaning of the households whose 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.130
 nobody 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.330
 we are beyond the household 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.330
 no, but honestly it hurts you 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.670
 do you see to go up gradually 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.520
 in addition to proceeding like that I you 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.139
 ensures that it limits the breakage because 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.419
 when you start with the roots 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.309
 that is to say here and that you shoot and 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.740
 that you do not have scrums 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:20.059
 are going to create knots in fact she is 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.059
 twice as difficult to unravel 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.289
 you see now that I when 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.369
 I arrive 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.369
 to the roots 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.990
 Well, I can stay behind without 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:48.780
 have a big knot behind 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:51.780
 prevents me from continuing so more pay 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.350
 to small in even less frankly what 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.250
 that you have frizzy hair 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.950
 seriously happiness small teeth 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.350
 is to give completely if you want 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:08.180
 avoid breakage aggression of the look 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.180
 now I started the show again 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.639
 the additional time why 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.660
 short of being there I was talking to the cameraman 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:28.000
 apprentices in bella cheesa good 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:29.410
 so yes it is she saves to buy so 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.560
 why I prefer to make choices 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.360
 sensible hair because in my opinion that's 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:39.420
 time for hair only two valleys 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.420
 where you do when even the blood 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:56.690
 and not 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:58.040
 so we try well there set up and 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.060
 here 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.640
 beaten at all where we doubled 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.230
 hair and this is one of the households after 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.020
 shampoo so it's the disentangling that is 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.120
 reputed to be the most difficult the 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.040
 more complicated especially on hair 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.030
 which each enormously so here we go 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.360
 how to ask the conductors 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.360
 crinkly
