can see it's going to repeat everything

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.210 
can see it's going to repeat everything
by<00:02:36.950> itself<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:38.510> like<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.840> did<00:02:38.900> earlier

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.790 

so<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.510> how<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.720> use<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.320> workspace

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
so that is how you use the workspace

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.240 
so that is how you use the workspace
macro<00:02:47.310> pro<00:02:47.550> it's<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.600> bot<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.890> likes

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
macro pro it's a bot that it likes

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.250 
macro pro it's a bot that it likes
automatically<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.210> now<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.600> taps<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.140> you

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
automatically and now so it taps for you

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.280 
automatically and now so it taps for you
and<00:02:52.530> does<00:02:52.710> all<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.070> stuff<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:54.690> could<00:02:54.870> use<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
and does all the stuff you could use the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.559 
and does all the stuff you could use the
same<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:56.040> on<00:02:56.280> other<00:02:56.550> games<00:02:56.970> too

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:15.790
