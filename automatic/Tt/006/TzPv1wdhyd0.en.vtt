00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
how a matter of fact it looks like it's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.639 
how a matter of fact it looks like it's
been<00:01:35.000> built<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.450> creative<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.080> placed<00:01:36.470> in

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
been built and creative and placed in

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.010 
been built and creative and placed in
survival<00:01:37.220> but<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.550> is<00:01:37.670> not<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.940> case<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.780> did

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
survival but that is not the case it did

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.130 
survival but that is not the case it did
take<00:01:39.289> me<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.619> actually<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:40.720> basically<00:01:41.720> check<00:01:42.020> to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
take me to actually a basically check to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.630 
take me to actually a basically check to
see<00:01:42.289> that<00:01:42.320> myself<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:43.070> believe<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.550> because

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
see that myself to believe it because

see that myself to believe it because
without<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.270> thought<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.720> was<00:01:44.810> completely

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
without that I thought it was completely

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.340 
without that I thought it was completely
fake<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.850> not<00:01:47.090> now<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.630> seat<00:01:47.960> is<00:01:48.140> at

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
island and a matter of fact this seat

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.410 
island and a matter of fact this seat
doesn't<00:01:57.349> have<00:01:57.590> many<00:01:57.770> islands<00:01:58.250> asshole<00:01:58.849> it<00:01:59.090> is

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
explain a little bit about it so I

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.110 
explain a little bit about it so I
understand<00:03:07.650> when<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> do<00:03:08.010> check<00:03:08.340> them<00:03:08.520> out<00:03:08.610> no<00:03:09.090> I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.300 
understand when I do check them out no I
also<00:03:09.690> found<00:03:10.020> something<00:03:10.530> really<00:03:10.950> really<00:03:11.160> cool

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
also found something really really cool

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.340 
also found something really really cool
this<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.210> probably<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.540> biggest<00:03:12.750> island<00:03:13.080> on

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
this is probably the biggest island on

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.160 
this is probably the biggest island on
the<00:03:13.380> map<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.800> is<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:13.980> mushroom<00:03:14.520> island<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.600> so

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
the map it is a mushroom island and so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.780 
the map it is a mushroom island and so
we<00:03:16.290> are<00:03:16.350> going<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.560> head<00:03:16.710> down<00:03:16.740> here<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.430> pretty

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
we are going to head down here I pretty

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.340 
we are going to head down here I pretty
much<00:03:17.940> boring<00:03:18.270> my<00:03:18.480> way<00:03:18.630> down<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.110> straight

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
much boring my way down and straight

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.250 
much boring my way down and straight
away<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.560> found<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.250> mine<00:03:20.610> shaft<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:22.020> think

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
away I found a mine shaft so I think

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.230 
away I found a mine shaft so I think
this<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.560> one<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.890> three<00:03:23.430> mine<00:03:23.730> shafts<00:03:24.030> and

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
this is one of three mine shafts and

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.970 
this is one of three mine shafts and
they<00:03:24.360> kind<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.780> do<00:03:24.959> interlink<00:03:25.410> with<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.740> mine

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
they kind of do interlink with this mine

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.400 
they kind of do interlink with this mine
shaft<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.400> huge<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:27.240> very<00:03:27.720> very<00:03:27.990> big<00:03:28.200> it's

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
shaft is huge it's very very big it's

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.800 
shaft is huge it's very very big it's
linked<00:03:28.770> in<00:03:28.890> many<00:03:29.160> different<00:03:29.640> areas<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.120> mine

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
linked in many different areas and mine

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.449 
linked in many different areas and mine
shaft<00:03:31.080> I<00:03:31.200> always<00:03:31.470> do<00:03:31.650> seem<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.950> get<00:03:32.040> lost<00:03:32.280> for

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
shaft I always do seem to get lost for
