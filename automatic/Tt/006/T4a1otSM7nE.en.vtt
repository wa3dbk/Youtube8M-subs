my<00:00:01.620> first<00:00:01.920> question<00:00:02.070> has<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.550> be<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:03.480> did<00:00:03.689> you

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
my first question has to be how did you

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.740 
my first question has to be how did you
think<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.410> mix<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.750> african-american

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
think of the mix of of african-american

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.530 
think of the mix of of african-american
culture<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.560> then<00:00:07.859> samurai<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.360> make

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
culture and then samurai and to make

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.959 
culture and then samurai and to make
that<00:00:09.690> into<00:00:09.990> something<00:00:10.309> like<00:00:11.309> like<00:00:11.610> Afro

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
that into something like like Afro

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.560 
that into something like like Afro
Samurai<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.570> thought<00:00:13.160> actually<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:15.000> came<00:00:15.360> up

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
Samurai I thought actually it it came up

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.279 
Samurai I thought actually it it came up
as<00:00:15.920> his<00:00:16.920> mixing<00:00:17.730> his<00:00:18.000> favorite<00:00:18.539> things

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
as his mixing his favorite things

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.710 
as his mixing his favorite things
together<00:00:19.650> such<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> hip-hop<00:00:21.029> or<00:00:21.240> soul<00:00:21.480> music

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
together such as a hip-hop or soul music

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.070 
together such as a hip-hop or soul music
spaghetti<00:00:22.650> western<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.400> also<00:00:24.269> some<00:00:24.869> rye

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
spaghetti western and also some rye

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.279 
spaghetti western and also some rye
movies<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.710> he<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:26.220> took<00:00:26.490> all<00:00:26.820> those<00:00:27.289> things

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
movies so he just took all those things

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.780 
movies so he just took all those things
that<00:00:28.439> he<00:00:28.769> liked<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.420> mixed<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.510> into<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:31.790> one

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
that he liked and mixed it into one one

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.560 
that he liked and mixed it into one one
was<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> good<00:00:34.020> kind<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.530> Afro<00:00:35.399> Samurai<00:00:35.570> element

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
was a good kind of Afro Samurai element

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.910 
was a good kind of Afro Samurai element
or<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.469> concept<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:39.120> offer<00:00:39.360> some<00:00:39.629> things

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
or the concept don't offer some things

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.799 
or the concept don't offer some things
and<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.070> course<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.610> spaghetti<00:00:42.000> western<00:00:42.510> took

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and of course the spaghetti western took

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.450 
and of course the spaghetti western took
from<00:00:43.110> samurai<00:00:43.860> movies<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:45.300> turn<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.719> well

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
from samurai movies in turn as well

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.610 
from samurai movies in turn as well
actually<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.030> true<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.809> there's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
actually that is true and then there's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.220 
actually that is true and then there's
the<00:00:49.950> other<00:00:50.039> way<00:00:50.309> around<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.940> which<00:00:51.120> cross<00:00:52.020> our

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the other way around in which cross our

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.450 
the other way around in which cross our
films<00:00:52.680> are<00:00:52.949> kind<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:55.309> adapt<00:00:57.079> Western

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
all all these things created from a mix

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
all all these things created from a mix
of<00:01:05.519> different<00:01:05.880> elements<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.140> very

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
what what can sort of what what aspects

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.740 
what what can sort of what what aspects
of<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.810> their<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.280> offer<00:01:20.850> samurai<00:01:21.479> makes

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.700 

probably<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> point<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:28.110> players<00:01:28.380> are

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
probably the point that the players are

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.069 
probably the point that the players are
able<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.280> actually<00:01:29.520> move<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.570> main
