00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and you can put stuff on top and it gets

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.080 
and you can put stuff on top and it gets

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
displayed in a 3d manner on top of your

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.490 
displayed in a 3d manner on top of your
crates<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.509> I've<00:01:45.600> also<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.170> golden

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
crates and I've also got some golden

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.990 
crates and I've also got some golden
pipes<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.610> really<00:01:47.729> know

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
pipes right here and I don't really know

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.389 
pipes right here and I don't really know
why<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.299> mod<00:01:48.720> has<00:01:48.869> golden<00:01:49.290> pipes<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.189> I'm

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
why this mod has golden pipes but I'm

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.760 
why this mod has golden pipes but I'm
guessing<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.560> kind

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
guessing you know just because it's kind

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.399 
guessing you know just because it's kind
of<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.219> really<00:01:53.939> actually<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.540> no<00:01:54.899> idea<00:01:55.259> why

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
of I really actually have no idea why

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.590 
of I really actually have no idea why
they<00:01:55.530> put<00:01:55.710> golden<00:01:56.399> pipes<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.909> mud<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
they put golden pipes in this mud but it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.060 
they put golden pipes in this mud but it
does<00:01:57.869> look<00:01:57.899> cool<00:01:58.290> nevertheless<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:58.979> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
does look cool nevertheless so if you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.490 
does look cool nevertheless so if you
guys<00:01:59.189> kind<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.549> want<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.759> make<00:02:00.200> kind<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.469> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
guys kind of want to make kind of like a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.459 
guys kind of want to make kind of like a
cool-looking<00:02:02.250> mine<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.659> pipes<00:02:04.049> kind<00:02:04.350> of

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
cool-looking mine with pipes kind of

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.980 
cool-looking mine with pipes kind of
like<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.770> more<00:02:05.039> machinery<00:02:05.969> involved<00:02:06.659> I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
like it's more machinery involved I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.210 
like it's more machinery involved I
guess<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.320> could<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.009> there<00:02:08.130> really

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
guess you could do that but there really

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.740 
guess you could do that but there really
are<00:02:08.459> no<00:02:08.489> use<00:02:08.820> for<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> pipes<00:02:09.299> and<00:02:09.509> there's<00:02:09.630> no

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
are no use for the pipes and there's no

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.210 
are no use for the pipes and there's no

here<00:02:14.910> there's<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.480> couple<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.440> items<00:02:16.470> that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
here there's a couple of the items that

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.099 
here there's a couple of the items that
do<00:02:17.010> not<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.220> their<00:02:18.060> actual<00:02:18.390> textures<00:02:18.959> to

do not have their actual textures to

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.690 
do not have their actual textures to
displays<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.650> item<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.160> your<00:02:20.280> inventory

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
displays the item like in your inventory

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.910 
displays the item like in your inventory
for<00:02:20.880> example<00:02:21.329> our<00:02:21.540> shelves<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.380> not<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.739> any

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
for example our shelves do not have any

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.650 
for example our shelves do not have any
little<00:02:23.220> texture<00:02:23.640> right<00:02:23.790> here<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.239> then<00:02:24.570> our

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
little texture right here and then our

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.960 
little texture right here and then our
aprons<00:02:25.049> don't<00:02:25.320> either<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.739> that's<00:02:26.549> kind<00:02:26.850> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
aprons don't either so that's kind of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.550 
aprons don't either so that's kind of
why<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.239> mod<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.630> still<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> work<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.260> progress

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
why this mod is still a work in progress

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.500 
why this mod is still a work in progress
but<00:02:29.130> nevertheless<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.459> still<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.060> pretty<00:02:30.269> cool

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
but nevertheless it still is pretty cool

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.089 
but nevertheless it still is pretty cool
especially<00:02:30.629> if<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.230> guys<00:02:31.410> are<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.620> big<00:02:31.800> cook
