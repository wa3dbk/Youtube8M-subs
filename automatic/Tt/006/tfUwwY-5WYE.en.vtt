badass st you sandblaster paddles that
are<00:01:49.040> staggered<00:01:49.520> cut<00:01:49.700> in<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.880> rear<00:01:50.120> so<00:01:50.960> the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
are staggered cut in the rear so the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.810 
are staggered cut in the rear so the
stock<00:01:51.320> factory<00:01:51.620> horsepower<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.520> X<00:01:52.640> before

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
stock factory horsepower in the X before

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.820 
stock factory horsepower in the X before
is<00:01:53.150> good<00:01:53.330> enough<00:01:53.570> for<00:01:53.810> us<00:01:53.870> but<00:01:54.290> we<00:01:54.409> can<00:01:54.590> always

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
is good enough for us but we can always

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.560 
is good enough for us but we can always
use<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.010> little<00:01:55.130> bit

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
use a little bit

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.660 
use a little bit
that's<00:01:55.960> where<00:01:56.170> Yoshimura<00:01:56.710> cameras<00:01:57.190> they

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
that's where Yoshimura cameras they

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.580 
that's where Yoshimura cameras they
dialed<00:01:58.000> us<00:01:58.090> in<00:01:58.240> with<00:01:58.360> their<00:01:58.510> races<00:01:58.900> off<00:01:59.110> system

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
dialed us in with their races off system

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.830 
dialed us in with their races off system

fuel controller and piggyback programmer

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.990 
fuel controller and piggyback programmer
and<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.530> really<00:02:02.740> helped<00:02:03.070> open<00:02:03.220> this<00:02:03.490> motor<00:02:03.760> up

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
and it really helped open this motor up

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.300 
and it really helped open this motor up
it<00:02:04.240> runs<00:02:04.510> really<00:02:04.870> strong<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.800> conjunction

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
it runs really strong in conjunction

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.270 
it runs really strong in conjunction
with<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.790> Alba<00:02:07.210> Racing<00:02:07.690> dual<00:02:08.350> cam<00:02:08.710> and<00:02:09.009> pod

intake<00:02:09.729> system<00:02:10.179> because<00:02:10.899> we<00:02:11.050> are<00:02:11.170> widening<00:02:11.530> in

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
intake system because we are widening in

the<00:02:11.800> car

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the car

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.920 
the car
that<00:02:12.490> means<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.880> needed<00:02:13.150> longer<00:02:13.480> brake<00:02:13.720> line

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that means you needed longer brake line

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.600 
that means you needed longer brake line
so<00:02:14.200> we<00:02:14.320> called<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:14.740> stream<00:02:15.100> line<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.550> they

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
so we called on stream line and they

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.850 
so we called on stream line and they
dial<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.000> Sam<00:02:16.210> with<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> really<00:02:17.230> nice<00:02:17.410> set<00:02:17.710> of

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
dial the Sam with a really nice set of

dial the Sam with a really nice set of
extended<00:02:18.310> brake<00:02:18.520> lines<00:02:18.790> for<00:02:19.780> electrical<00:02:20.260> we

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
extended brake lines for electrical we

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.650 
extended brake lines for electrical we
went<00:02:20.620> pretty<00:02:20.770> lightweight<00:02:21.100> I<00:02:21.610> put<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> pump<00:02:22.510> in

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
went pretty lightweight I put a pump in
