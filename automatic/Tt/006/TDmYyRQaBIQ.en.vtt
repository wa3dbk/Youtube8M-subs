00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
I suppose realistically people sort of

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.230 
I suppose realistically people sort of
putting<00:02:19.160> him<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.430> second<00:02:19.760> tier<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.120> he's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
putting him in the second tier but he's

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.600 
putting him in the second tier but he's
really<00:02:20.450> stepping<00:02:20.690> up<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:20.960> it<00:02:21.050> yeah<00:02:21.590> he's<00:02:22.400> kind

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
really stepping up in it yeah he's kind

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.100

we<00:02:24.530> don't<00:02:24.680> really<00:02:24.830> find<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.220> because<00:02:25.580> we

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
we don't really find that because we

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.950 
we don't really find that because we
always<00:02:25.970> seem<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.300> sneak<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.750> get<00:02:26.840> the

by the post or at least turning for home
I<00:05:41.250> thought<00:05:41.460> somebody<00:05:41.699> might<00:05:41.880> have<00:05:42.060> jumped<00:05:42.270> out

but<00:05:42.509> they<00:05:42.840> all<00:05:42.990> say<00:05:43.259> I<00:05:43.620> thought<00:05:44.340> he<00:05:44.460> must<00:05:44.550> be

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
but they all say I thought he must be

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.339 
but they all say I thought he must be
confident<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.300> go<00:05:45.449> you<00:05:45.509> know<00:05:45.810> it's<00:05:46.139> not<00:05:46.199> like

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
confident to go you know it's not like

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:47.719 
confident to go you know it's not like
David<00:05:46.710> to<00:05:46.800> do<00:05:46.919> something<00:05:47.220> like<00:05:47.250> that<00:05:47.370> just<00:05:47.520> to

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
David to do something like that just to

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.640 
David to do something like that just to
sort<00:05:47.909> of<00:05:47.970> try<00:05:48.180> and<00:05:48.300> run<00:05:48.449> away<00:05:48.479> from<00:05:48.690> so<00:05:49.169> you

sort of try and run away from so you

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.830 
sort of try and run away from so you
know<00:05:49.710> I<00:05:49.770> thought<00:05:49.949> he<00:05:50.069> is<00:05:50.159> pretty<00:05:50.699> confident<00:05:51.210> if
