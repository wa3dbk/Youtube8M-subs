00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.830
 hey people here stefan from android me 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.629
 have me today for you in the 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.940
 Berlin urban jungle out dared 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.710
 to the smartphone user in his 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.500
 to observe natural habitat 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.509
 I have two phones with me 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.259
 something unusual for one 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:31.180
 asus from cat 7 inches and another 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.280
 extremely interested in me especially 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.989
 the question who the devil binds so 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.399
 a thing to the leg or ans 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.899
 wrist or turns into the 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.790
 public with such a giant on 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:46.030
 Oh, that's why I want to say that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:48.810
 just out 50 then yes yes but 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.260
 make music a bit 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.640
 unwieldy the migros at one time 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 see if it fits in the back pocket 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.340
 So as a mobile phone is just too big 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.060
 I mean, I would be quick too 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.790
 find a bag 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.240
 this is an oversized phone for me 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.340
 which for me as a business user is not 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.659
 in my jacket pocket so reinpasst 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.340
 I always have the font size 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.450
 of course that would be ideal if here 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 you can make the gros 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.049
 but if I imagine that sees 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.959
 then so run against through the area 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.909
 that a bit silly vegetable is something 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.380
 for stylish cape technique and have 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.439
 of course you know that somehow 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.749
 a headphone my children would have 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.649
 love it in the ages of seven to 14 

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.689
 years 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.429
 they would love it all four 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.659
 but i have no use i as 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.179
 adult and I am likely 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.420
 the one who has to pay 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.130
 because it is in the wrist and yes 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.430
 practical and easy so find that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.810
 Great 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.060
 So I think it's handy for 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.220
 People who travel a lot and everything 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.440
 honest evening but for me that would be 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.470
 nothing and the design what was something 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.170
 Does that appeal to you? 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.100
 a little more attractive will be great 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:11.690
 black checkered is not so great 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.430
 On the way, you can hike a lot and you 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.990
 Maybe you want to go on the phone 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.630
 massively put it off the backpack 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.330
 rausholen phone and with the you can 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.250
 now maybe so fast 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.070
 so it's like 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.360
 different areas of application and 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.590
 if you imagine that that off 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.790
 Would cost 300 euros 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.630
 there comes a bit on the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.060
 features on it to 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.790
 It's only now that he is even now 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.790
 not necessarily the price but yes so 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.820
 conclusion honestly I had with skepticism 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.430
 counted by the people then so yes 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.670
 a huge device for phoning 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.320
 that's not really aesthetically pleasing when it does 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.570
 also as a tablet, of course, quite practical 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.880
 is and what the smart watch is concerned so 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.320
 as much as I love knight rider but so 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.049
 I can not really imagine that 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.030
 Nevertheless, I was surprised how many 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.709
 avant- gardists out there were in all 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.660
 age classes so quite a few 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.670
 could imagine that very well and 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.280
 not even from the 300 euros for the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.450
 But the consensus was deterred 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.120
 it seems to be 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.989
 at least that tends to be 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.260
 humanity may not be mature yet 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.739
 is for a smart watch and so on 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.739
 big smartphone
