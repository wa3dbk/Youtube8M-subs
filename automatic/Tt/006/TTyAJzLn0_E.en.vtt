 the first room is sorry I feel 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.559
 earlier I was born the course 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.260
 groupings 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.600
 often it is by his investment 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.650
 makes me a little soul 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:53.310
 profile traveling especially with reviews 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.120
 so it's either at the same time 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.940
 welcome to montreal 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.890
 how did you find the welcome 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.210
 frankly it's nice and chandler and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.870
 that you will find the ages 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.510
 ok if everything seems to show that we are 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.740
 real supporters of the greens we know 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.800
 that you are the last drink to have 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.690
 marked against libya it was in 2007 2 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.310
 1 by a direct free kick by rafik 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.440
 fits so is what you are 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.880
 remember this match begins I know 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.560
 that the political context with libya 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.440
 was different at that time can be 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.210
 will have to expect something from 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.590
 different tomorrow do not hope is this 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.160
 that it went well in my faith 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.160
 with libya 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.280
 subscribers a little in the back we would have 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.110
 well done it's a magnate 2 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.110
 we did 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.369
 now that's it 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.040
 hello played a football game when you 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.770
 es 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.920
 science was only made and charles 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.660
 when there will be course it was a course 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.660
 to France and abroad 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.880
 let's say more experienced 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.040
 three four years back 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.390
 of that and the states by winning 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.230
 against teams 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.920
 constant that chaos 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.130
 on one side you have to be wary of one side 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.270
 do not give them 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.010
 until then of ribs and pressed a 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.650
 man this is our team he is fit 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.020
 and by valuing better prepared to my 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.230
 notice it will play on details 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.910
 we have the means to beat them after 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.710
 to speak is easy he does not forget 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.520
 by the way we will study them we will 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.220
 let go and I hope a shaman who 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.840
 are primarily a sect 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.730
 I hope he will not only win 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.290
 then so the last one for when the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.230
 last campaign of the last 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.239
 campaigns for the can 2010 the cup of the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.560
 world 2010 you were actors this 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.750
 time you find yourself as 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.430
 spectator and I hope supporters well 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.370
 sure what do you think of the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.810
 close to a new approach 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.879
 we have the impression that they play so 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.220
 more offensive the team it looks like is this 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.540
 did you notice that or I 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.010
 will find that this is only a 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.569
 impression it's true we did not have 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.980
 a lot of tests still we lived from 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.730
 friendly matches and matches against 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.430
 modest teams 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.430
 is what you are satisfied with the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.430
 close sir halilovic me I am 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.880
 the me who will be happy is especially 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.430
 their coach v 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.730
 the games to what 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.319
 me it's my results 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.260
 great seller as it takes 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.840
 create a wall of a group happened to 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.330
 mesquer is that she is part of the world 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.660
 in mauritius and in my opinion after that is the 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.770
 work that pays 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.530
 certainly now there is a new 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.710
 generation no we must not remain 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.320
 2010 I was always wanted to have 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.660
 continued one must always work and 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.050
 of voice was really safe all that 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.010
 but hey it's true there are good games 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.200
 certainly we are old that I was told that 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.910
 precede modest sum and after that it's 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.050
 true you have to trust me when 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.180
 these teams mendes 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.890
 you have to win you have to score they do 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.110
 not trusting players' attackers 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.410
 stuff like that we love so much as 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.930
 of tough teams and we mans 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.730
 did like me we will be in me prepare 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.800
 and most importantly makes this confidence speak 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.890
 we had when guys like that for 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.120
 earn what to finance 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.200
 I see things like this after 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.200
 each keeping the fields 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.610
 when you are on this cure and then a 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.410
 last word for our supporters who 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.890

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.910
