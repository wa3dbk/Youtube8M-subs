00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.749 
actual game on your iPhone so that's
really<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.860> i'll<00:01:47.100> show<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.369> how<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
really it i'll show you how the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.240 
really it i'll show you how the
accelerometer<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.750> again<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.470> accelerometer

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
accelerometer is again the accelerometer

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.859 
accelerometer is again the accelerometer
is<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> lot<00:01:50.759> harder<00:01:53.750> tap<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> screen<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.170> start

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
is a lot harder tap the screen to start

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.370 
is a lot harder tap the screen to start
it's<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.990> lot<00:01:58.229> harder<00:01:59.420> with<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> accelerometer

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it's a lot harder with the accelerometer

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.889 
it's a lot harder with the accelerometer
in<00:02:01.469> my<00:02:01.619> opinion<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:06.360> sawls

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
in my opinion just because the sawls

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.559 
in my opinion just because the sawls
yeah<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:08.220> ten<00:02:08.520> seconds<00:02:08.940> again<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> lot

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
yeah see ten seconds again it's a lot

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.300 
yeah see ten seconds again it's a lot
harder<00:02:09.720> than<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.110> accelerometer<00:02:10.679> once<00:02:11.220> you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
harder than the accelerometer once you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.309 
harder than the accelerometer once you
play<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.550> game<00:02:11.819> more<00:02:12.060> times<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:13.140> might

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
play this game more times on you might

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.000 
play this game more times on you might
want<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:13.739> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
want to go the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.860 
want to go the
accelerometer<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> pretty

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
accelerometer but it is a pretty

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.570 
accelerometer but it is a pretty
challenging<00:02:16.470> game<00:02:16.680> i<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.189> most<00:02:17.220> i've

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
challenging game i think the most i've

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.140 
challenging game i think the most i've
gotten<00:02:17.909> so<00:02:18.090> far<00:02:18.299> as<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.829> want<00:02:19.829> to<00:02:19.920> say

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
gotten so far as I want to say

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.460 
gotten so far as I want to say
20-something<00:02:21.150> seconds<00:02:21.540> maybe<00:02:21.659> 30<00:02:21.989> seconds

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
20-something seconds maybe 30 seconds

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.020 
20-something seconds maybe 30 seconds
it's<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.709> very<00:02:22.890> challenging<00:02:23.129> game<00:02:23.579> because<00:02:23.909> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
it's a very challenging game because the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.390 
it's a very challenging game because the
faster<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.079> longer<00:02:25.409> you<00:02:25.530> stay<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.799> faster

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
faster or the longer you stay the faster

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.280 
faster or the longer you stay the faster
faster<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.909> Sol's<00:02:27.150> get<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.569> that's<00:02:28.079> really

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
faster the Sol's get so that's really

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.289 
faster the Sol's get so that's really
the<00:02:28.530> game<00:02:28.709> there's<00:02:28.980> no<00:02:29.040> um<00:02:29.459> different<00:02:29.700> levels

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
the game there's no um different levels

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.619 
the game there's no um different levels
there's<00:02:30.870> no<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:32.430> just<00:02:32.579> three<00:02:32.879> saw<00:02:33.090> blades<00:02:33.420> I

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
there's no it's just three saw blades I

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.740 
there's no it's just three saw blades I
give<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.379> game<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:35.400> three<00:02:36.060> out<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> five<00:02:36.720> stars

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
give this game a three out of five stars

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.140 
give this game a three out of five stars
it<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.379> an<00:02:37.530> entertaining<00:02:37.950> game<00:02:38.129> a<00:02:38.459> very<00:02:38.790> unique

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
it is an entertaining game a very unique

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.080 
it is an entertaining game a very unique
game<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.920> enjoy<00:02:41.159> playing<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:41.670> little<00:02:41.760> bit

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
game and I enjoy playing it a little bit

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.759 
game and I enjoy playing it a little bit
graphic<00:02:42.569> like<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.840> said<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.470> saw<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
graphic like you said that you saw the

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.099 
graphic like you said that you saw the
of<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.280> kitties<00:02:44.939> head<00:02:45.090> gets<00:02:45.329> off<00:02:45.480> tough<00:02:45.780> but

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
of the kitties head gets off tough but

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.199 
of the kitties head gets off tough but
um<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.470> little<00:02:46.859> bit<00:02:47.040> graphic<00:02:47.400> game<00:02:47.579> maybe<00:02:47.879> I'm

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
um a little bit graphic game maybe I'm

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.089 
um a little bit graphic game maybe I'm
in<00:02:48.450> future<00:02:48.780> updates<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.260> might<00:02:49.470> suggest<00:02:49.650> maybe

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
in future updates I might suggest maybe

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.000 
in future updates I might suggest maybe
different<00:02:50.400> characters<00:02:51.000> or<00:02:51.329> different

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
different characters or different

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.259 
different characters or different
instead<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.099> just<00:02:53.280> saw<00:02:53.489> blades<00:02:53.819> maybe<00:02:54.060> had

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
instead of just saw blades maybe had

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.789 
instead of just saw blades maybe had
different<00:02:54.659> knifes<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.319> something<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:55.739> that

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
different knifes or something like that

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.949 
different knifes or something like that
but<00:02:56.129> very<00:02:56.730> cool<00:02:56.940> game<00:02:57.090> 3<00:02:57.329> out<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.480> 5<00:02:57.629> stars

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
but very cool game 3 out of 5 stars

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.229 
but very cool game 3 out of 5 stars
again<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.440> 99<00:02:58.920> cents<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.609> itunes<00:03:00.150> store

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239
