that little metal piece up in there you
can't<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.720> let<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:48.960> soak<00:01:49.350> in

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
then but that is really is really the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.059 
then but that is really is really the
way<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.290> we<00:02:04.290> clean<00:02:05.100> our<00:02:05.280> saddles<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.210> that

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.930 
out my saddle as you can see I like that
about<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.419> and<00:03:22.709> but<00:03:23.790> really<00:03:26.040> you'll<00:03:27.040> just<00:03:27.340> go

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
about it and but really you'll just go

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.270 
about it and but really you'll just go
down<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.510> then<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:28.930> go<00:03:29.199> you'll<00:03:29.859> turn<00:03:30.159> it

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
down it then you go you'll turn it

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.339 
down it then you go you'll turn it
inside<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:30.609> you<00:03:30.819> can<00:03:30.940> do<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.329> inside<00:03:31.780> but

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
inside so you can do the inside but

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.170 
inside so you can do the inside but
really<00:03:32.799> most<00:03:32.979> people<00:03:33.340> don't<00:03:33.519> care<00:03:33.819> about<00:03:33.940> it

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
really most people don't care about it

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.420 
really most people don't care about it
they<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:34.720> do<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.139> part<00:03:35.470> because<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.250> the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
they just do this part because it's the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.520 
they just do this part because it's the
only<00:03:36.459> part<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:36.879> brings<00:03:37.239> out<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:37.989> miss

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
only part that brings out and this miss

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.849 
only part that brings out and this miss
that<00:03:39.459> people<00:03:40.150> actually<00:03:40.419> really<00:03:40.989> see<00:03:41.199> and<00:03:41.500> they

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
that people actually really see and they

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.610 
that people actually really see and they
do<00:03:41.919> this<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.900> which<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.079> don't<00:03:44.169> have<00:03:44.349> to<00:03:44.470> worry

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
do this to which you don't have to worry

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.979 
do this to which you don't have to worry
about<00:03:44.739> doing<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.250> inside<00:03:45.639> here<00:03:45.940> but<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.389> lot<00:03:46.959> of

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
about doing the inside here but a lot of

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.369 
about doing the inside here but a lot of
people<00:03:47.199> care<00:03:47.560> which<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.489> don't<00:03:48.609> really<00:03:48.909> care

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
people care which I don't really care

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.629 
people care which I don't really care
because<00:03:50.379> I<00:03:50.560> mean<00:03:50.739> you're<00:03:50.889> just<00:03:51.099> riding<00:03:51.280> in<00:03:51.609> a

because I mean you're just riding in a

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:56.789 
because I mean you're just riding in a
saddle<00:03:51.849> and<00:03:54.959> then<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.049> just<00:03:56.260> fold<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.739> and

along<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.669> edges<00:04:09.849> here<00:04:10.389> you<00:04:10.540> can<00:04:10.659> do

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
along the edges here you can do

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.140 
along the edges here you can do
everything<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.889> even<00:04:12.459> have<00:04:12.639> to<00:04:12.759> flip<00:04:12.909> it<00:04:12.939> over

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
everything you even have to flip it over

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.319 
everything you even have to flip it over
and<00:04:13.299> did<00:04:13.540> back<00:04:13.859> but<00:04:14.859> I<00:04:15.069> would<00:04:15.549> really

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
and did back but I would really

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.170 
and did back but I would really
recommend<00:04:16.539> doing<00:04:17.259> it<00:04:17.530> on<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.769> floor

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
recommend doing it on the floor

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.849 
recommend doing it on the floor
otherwise<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.719> top<00:04:19.930> part<00:04:20.169> you<00:04:20.409> need<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.709> do

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
otherwise in the top part you need to do

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:21.289 
otherwise in the top part you need to do
like

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
like

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.360 
like
somewhere<00:04:22.199> like<00:04:22.530> on<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.800> side<00:04:22.949> of<00:04:23.009> a<00:04:23.190> bathtub

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
somewhere like on the side of a bathtub

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.339 
somewhere like on the side of a bathtub
or<00:04:23.759> something<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.389> you<00:04:24.449> can<00:04:24.629> sit<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.960> on<00:04:25.050> or<00:04:25.319> a

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
or something so you can sit it on or a

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.379 
or something so you can sit it on or a
saddle<00:04:25.680> rack<00:04:25.830> if<00:04:26.009> you<00:04:26.129> have<00:04:26.310> one<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:27.030> describe

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
saddle rack if you have one to describe

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.390 
saddle rack if you have one to describe
it<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.659> then<00:04:28.319> but<00:04:28.830> when<00:04:28.979> you're<00:04:29.099> doing<00:04:29.310> the

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
it and then but when you're doing the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.619 
it and then but when you're doing the
bottom<00:04:29.669> side<00:04:29.849> you<00:04:30.030> want<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.300> set<00:04:30.419> it<00:04:30.509> on<00:04:30.599> the

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
bottom side you want to set it on the

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.189 
bottom side you want to set it on the
floor<00:04:30.900> because<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.349> balances<00:04:31.500> better<00:04:32.129> and

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
floor because it balances better and

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.809 
floor because it balances better and
then<00:04:34.199> you<00:04:34.349> can<00:04:34.560> support<00:04:35.069> it<00:04:35.340> on<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.580> side<00:04:35.789> here

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
then you can support it on the side here

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.939 
then you can support it on the side here
but<00:04:36.360> that's<00:04:36.569> just<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:37.080> way<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.289> properly

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
but that's just the way to properly

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.090 
but that's just the way to properly
clean<00:04:38.430> your<00:04:38.789> set
