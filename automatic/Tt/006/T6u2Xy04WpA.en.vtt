00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.740

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.920
 international rank 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 who is actually with this region of 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.500
 southwestern is closely connected 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.109
 At this moment I have the honorable 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.000
 task and a politician there 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.490
 almost nothing more beautiful than at the end of one 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.050
 long preparation phase of the man 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.330
 was not involved at all 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.240
 but this last step is the 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.830
 opening to accomplish this wonderful 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.829
 exhibition erich hackel 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.579
 thank you 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.950
 not just a bit 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.360
 I am very proud that it is here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.910
 succeeded one must not forget 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.230
 and he has the beginning of the 80s with the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.850
 first exhibitions started 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.980
 that was not the same in the beginning 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.320
 great success has started very small 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.820
 the great success since 1987 with the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.940
 great chagall exhibition for the 100th 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 birthday of marc chagall and that was 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.810
 of course, the breakthrough for this 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.700
 balingen and since then it works 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.199
 here is very good and you have to say yet 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.680
 Thanks a lot to the bridge 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.450
 museum 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.310
 they really opened our doors for us 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.290
 we were really allowed to go out and that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.119
 was completely overwhelmed for us 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.130
 the decision was very easy 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.290
 to give the whole after balingen the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.759
 exhibition are very famous 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.400
 that there are always good exhibitions 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.220
 are known and then it is 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.470
 a beautiful balancing together 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.190
 I have been doing this job for 32 years 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.380
 years 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.930
 It is our 18 the exhibition which I 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.030
 open today and I think this 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.430
 But distance was so successful 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.460
 but there were only one number on the way 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.560
 let's talk in these 18 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.590
 exhibitions over 1.2 million 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.300
 brought visitors to berlin and quite 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 This exhibition can see you very much 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.560
 let it be of international rank 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.360
 For more than 30 years will be in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.420
 southwest of germany for the first time 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.670
 a great retrospective shown 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.479
 actually as we stated now 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.220
 have the biggest ever at 182 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.619
 We now have noticed through this 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.270
 art exhibitions so far about one 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.009
 million visitors had it here 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.110
 only about half expect that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.510
 or 70 percent came from outside 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.190
 there were six 700,000 visitors from 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.540
 outside that you can in this city 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.370
 really discover a lot 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.610
 you can see paintings you drawings 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.959
 watercolors etchings lithographs and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.420
 as I said very many different 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.920
 styles and the life of stern and was 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.900
 of course interesting two 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.700
 world wars brought it is always allowed 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.069
 big setbacks in his life again 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.720
 disappointments parts of his work 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.099
 For example, we have been destroyed 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.130
 second world war then he had to return 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.960
 start from the beginning 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.900
 you can all about this exhibition 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.780
 watch like this artist constantly 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.530
 Looked forward we are 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.910
 in the year 1920 we look at tübingen 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.460
 Eric Heckel is on the way to the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.790
 Bodensee and he makes a stopover in 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.340
 Tuebingen draws and paints the wooden 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.800
 tower from the neckar bridge and 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.870
 replaces Hölderlinturm 2 in the center 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.090
 that makes the relatively small around it 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.550
 are the falling lines of him 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.900
 surrounding houses and they see the 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.600
 Color is slowly becoming something again 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.100
 brighter it is the post-war era and it 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.650
 is slowly getting more positive again 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.000
 tunes the angular lines 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.830
 according to the late expressionism 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.690
 the then 20s and years 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.540
 At the same time we have something significant 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.680
 for erich heckel namely the mirroring 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.990
 in the neckar water 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.670
 reflections, these water he is from 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.860
 then again and again in his pictures 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.530
 have and this one is exemplary 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.870
 so the observer can do this here 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.880
 to see your own home again 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.680
 discover again and see how 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.230
 an artist has it with his eyes 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.070
 considered and that is the message I 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.230
 invite everyone 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.140
