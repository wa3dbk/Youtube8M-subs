00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
and I mean that in a very if they mind

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.149 
and I mean that in a very if they mind
fillet<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.600> still<00:01:07.500> holding

fillet that this is still holding
together<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.970> very<00:01:09.210> possible<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.930> there

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
together it's very possible that there

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.810 
together it's very possible that there
are<00:01:10.290> two<00:01:10.470> tornadoes<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.159> ground<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.729> you

you're looking up around Paris tells us
that<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:46.570> northeast<00:05:47.080> of<00:05:47.260> Paris<00:05:47.560> and<00:05:47.710> should

that the northeast of Paris and should

be headed to the Northeast

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.990 
be headed to the Northeast
but<00:05:50.440> we're<00:05:50.560> still<00:05:50.740> quite<00:05:50.950> concerned<00:05:51.520> over<00:05:51.760> the

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
but we're still quite concerned over the

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.820 
but we're still quite concerned over the
the<00:05:52.360> one<00:05:52.510> which<00:05:52.750> is<00:05:52.900> now<00:05:53.050> northeast<00:05:53.530> of<00:05:53.680> that

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
the one which is now northeast of that

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.529 
the one which is now northeast of that
wood<00:05:54.070> and<00:05:54.099> this<00:05:54.370> one<00:05:54.550> right<00:05:54.729> here<00:05:55.090> which<00:05:55.510> is

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
wood and this one right here which is

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.110 
wood and this one right here which is
over<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.680> south-central<00:05:57.280> part<00:05:57.760> or<00:05:58.030> the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
over the south-central part or the

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.120 
over the south-central part or the

central part of Madison County

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.890 
central part of Madison County
looks<00:06:00.580> like<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:00.910> couplet<00:06:01.270> is<00:06:01.389> now<00:06:01.539> crossed

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
looks like the couplet is now crossed

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.700 
looks like the couplet is now crossed
Highway<00:06:02.320> 45<00:06:02.740> and<00:06:03.370> if<00:06:04.150> this<00:06:04.419> is<00:06:04.630> accurate<00:06:04.960> it's

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
Highway 45 and if this is accurate it's

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.089 
Highway 45 and if this is accurate it's
in<00:06:06.160> the<00:06:06.430> just<00:06:07.180> south<00:06:07.479> of<00:06:07.750> downtown<00:06:08.099> Jackson

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
in the just south of downtown Jackson

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.420 
in the just south of downtown Jackson
the<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.740> downtown<00:06:11.740> area

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
the the downtown area

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.690 
the the downtown area
and<00:06:12.520> is<00:06:12.970> again<00:06:13.390> moving<00:06:13.570> along<00:06:13.900> to<00:06:13.930> the<00:06:14.140> east<00:06:14.700> at

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
and is again moving along to the east at

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.910 
and is again moving along to the east at
about<00:06:16.000> 65<00:06:16.660> miles<00:06:16.960> per<00:06:17.200> hour<00:06:17.320> but<00:06:17.530> it<00:06:17.650> appears

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
about 65 miles per hour but it appears

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.320 
about 65 miles per hour but it appears
to<00:06:17.980> me<00:06:18.070> maybe<00:06:18.310> it's<00:06:18.490> slowed<00:06:18.730> down<00:06:18.940> just<00:06:19.240> a

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
to me maybe it's slowed down just a

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.090 
to me maybe it's slowed down just a
little<00:06:19.360> bit<00:06:19.630> but<00:06:20.200> it<00:06:20.320> is<00:06:20.470> still<00:06:20.650> moving<00:06:20.980> along

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
little bit but it is still moving along

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.390 
little bit but it is still moving along
to<00:06:21.670> the<00:06:21.820> east<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:22.450> if<00:06:23.260> this<00:06:23.770> track<00:06:24.130> is

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
to the east and if this track is

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.310 
to the east and if this track is
accurate<00:06:25.000> and<00:06:25.150> I<00:06:25.270> hope<00:06:25.690> it<00:06:25.810> is<00:06:25.840> that<00:06:25.990> would

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
accurate and I hope it is that would

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.840 
accurate and I hope it is that would
indicate<00:06:26.560> that<00:06:26.740> maybe<00:06:27.070> it<00:06:27.220> missed<00:06:27.430> Bemis

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
indicate that maybe it missed Bemis

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.250 
indicate that maybe it missed Bemis
which<00:06:28.060> again<00:06:28.270> got<00:06:28.480> hit<00:06:28.660> very<00:06:28.780> hard<00:06:29.020> a<00:06:29.140> couple

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
which again got hit very hard a couple

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.230 
which again got hit very hard a couple
of<00:06:29.470> years<00:06:29.590> ago<00:06:29.740> but<00:06:30.490> certainly<00:06:30.820> a<00:06:30.910> serious

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
of years ago but certainly a serious

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.270 
of years ago but certainly a serious
situation<00:06:31.660> going<00:06:32.200> on<00:06:32.380> in<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:32.740> Jackson

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
situation going on in the Jackson

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.970 
situation going on in the Jackson
Tennessee<00:06:33.430> metro<00:06:34.060> area<00:06:34.360> at<00:06:34.750> this<00:06:35.140> moment<00:06:35.590> then

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
Tennessee metro area at this moment then

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.670 
Tennessee metro area at this moment then

track<00:06:39.070> on<00:06:39.310> that<00:06:39.520> for<00:06:39.790> you<00:06:40.060> and<00:06:40.740> we'll<00:06:41.740> assume

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
track on that for you and we'll assume

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.010 
track on that for you and we'll assume
that<00:06:42.130> it's<00:06:42.430> still<00:06:42.580> moving<00:06:42.910> at<00:06:43.000> 65<00:06:43.540> miles<00:06:43.810> per

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
that it's still moving at 65 miles per

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.780 
that it's still moving at 65 miles per
hour<00:06:44.230> that's<00:06:44.500> the<00:06:44.650> last<00:06:44.830> indication<00:06:45.460> we<00:06:45.610> got

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
hour that's the last indication we got

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.610 
hour that's the last indication we got
does<00:06:46.510> appear<00:06:46.780> it's<00:06:46.930> going<00:06:47.050> to<00:06:47.110> be<00:06:47.170> moving<00:06:47.290> over

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
does appear it's going to be moving over

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.490 
does appear it's going to be moving over
open<00:06:47.890> area<00:06:48.250> for<00:06:48.460> the<00:06:48.550> next<00:06:48.790> little<00:06:49.270> while<00:06:49.500> Tim

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
open area for the next little while Tim

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.310 
open area for the next little while Tim
with<00:06:51.190> I'm<00:06:51.310> sure<00:06:51.490> some<00:06:52.450> communities<00:06:52.990> in<00:06:53.170> there

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
with I'm sure some communities in there

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.380 
with I'm sure some communities in there
but<00:06:53.500> no<00:06:53.650> major<00:06:53.830> population<00:06:54.610> cities<00:06:54.940> that<00:06:55.060> is

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
but no major population cities that is

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.820 
but no major population cities that is
indeed<00:06:55.840> a<00:06:55.870> very<00:06:56.140> good<00:06:56.320> thing<00:06:56.530> we're<00:06:56.710> gonna

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
indeed a very good thing we're gonna

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.670 
indeed a very good thing we're gonna
stay<00:06:57.010> here<00:06:57.040> anyway<00:06:57.400> until<00:06:58.240> we<00:06:58.840> make<00:06:59.410> sure<00:06:59.440> that

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
stay here anyway until we make sure that

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.470 
stay here anyway until we make sure that
thing<00:07:00.040> is<00:07:00.130> out<00:07:00.220> of<00:07:00.280> the<00:07:00.430> Jackson<00:07:00.850> metro<00:07:01.180> area

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
thing is out of the Jackson metro area

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.600 
thing is out of the Jackson metro area
because<00:07:01.810> that's<00:07:02.170> a<00:07:02.350> highly<00:07:02.830> highly<00:07:03.070> populated

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
because that's a highly highly populated

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.060 
because that's a highly highly populated
area<00:07:03.850> population<00:07:04.690> of<00:07:04.900> Jackson<00:07:05.350> is<00:07:05.470> up<00:07:05.620> I<00:07:05.800> think

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
area population of Jackson is up I think

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.790 
area population of Jackson is up I think
is<00:07:06.220> over<00:07:06.430> 50,000<00:07:07.360> now<00:07:07.450> well<00:07:07.630> over<00:07:07.750> 50,000<00:07:08.680> and

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
is over 50,000 now well over 50,000 and

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.790 
is over 50,000 now well over 50,000 and
has<00:07:09.610> just<00:07:09.850> become<00:07:10.120> a<00:07:10.300> real<00:07:10.660> metropolitan<00:07:11.530> area

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
has just become a real metropolitan area

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.490 
has just become a real metropolitan area
over<00:07:11.950> the<00:07:12.040> last<00:07:12.070> few<00:07:12.460> years<00:07:12.790> as<00:07:12.970> we<00:07:13.870> continue

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500 
over the last few years as we continue

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.060 
over the last few years as we continue
to<00:07:14.620> look<00:07:14.800> at<00:07:15.010> the<00:07:15.520> radar<00:07:15.760> products<00:07:16.920> let<00:07:17.920> me
