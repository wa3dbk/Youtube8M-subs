little top part and I just grabbed a
stick<00:02:24.600> from<00:02:24.810> outside<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.650> tried

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
stick from outside and just tried

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.690 
stick from outside and just tried
pushing<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.300> tube<00:02:27.750> down<00:02:28.350> into<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.860> water<00:02:28.980> so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
pushing the tube down into the water so

then when you take the tube out it

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.600 
then when you take the tube out it
should<00:02:55.220> be<00:02:55.370> sort<00:02:55.819> of<00:02:55.940> like<00:02:56.230> half<00:02:57.430> white<00:02:58.430> and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
if I could do this again I would clean

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.830 
if I could do this again I would clean
it<00:05:44.229> out<00:05:44.320> way<00:05:44.620> better<00:05:44.800> but<00:05:45.790> um<00:05:46.060> you<00:05:46.660> can<00:05:46.810> also

it out way better but um you can also

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.409 
it out way better but um you can also
just<00:05:47.470> wash<00:05:48.190> it<00:05:48.220> off<00:05:48.490> with<00:05:48.639> water<00:05:48.940> if<00:05:49.150> you've

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
just wash it off with water if you've

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.200 
just wash it off with water if you've
got<00:05:49.690> any<00:05:49.870> color<00:05:50.110> because<00:05:50.740> with<00:05:51.610> nail<00:05:51.940> polish

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
got any color because with nail polish

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.420

nail<00:05:53.139> polish<00:05:53.470> and<00:05:53.590> water<00:05:53.770> don't<00:05:53.979> mix<00:05:54.100> so

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
nail polish and water don't mix so

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.830 
nail polish and water don't mix so
