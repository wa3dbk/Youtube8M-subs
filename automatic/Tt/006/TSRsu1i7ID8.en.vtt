the left hand side the top left but the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.760 
the left hand side the top left but the
thing<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.090> what<00:01:07.540> i<00:01:07.570> did<00:01:07.870> was<00:01:08.110> i<00:01:08.170> shot<00:01:08.530> another

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
thing is what i did was i shot another

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.280 
thing is what i did was i shot another
teleport<00:01:09.460> grenade<00:01:09.790> in<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:10.480> then<00:01:10.930> it<00:01:11.080> moved

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
teleport grenade in and then it moved

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.030 
teleport grenade in and then it moved
back<00:01:11.620> to<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.010> center<00:01:12.340> one<00:01:12.550> so<00:01:13.480> okay<00:01:14.140> so<00:01:15.010> i

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
back to the center one so okay so i

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.460 
back to the center one so okay so i
think<00:01:15.130> basically<00:01:15.520> has<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.210> reset<00:01:16.690> so<00:01:17.260> right

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470
