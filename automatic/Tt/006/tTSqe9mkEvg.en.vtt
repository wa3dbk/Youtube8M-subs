00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.089
 hello and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.010
 Engadget in Spanish is notified and 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.660
 our engadget agenda was of the week 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.450
 brings us today to the presentation of 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.610
 new curved led to choose here we are 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.470
 as the poster that has explained us a 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.480
 little bit better then good how it feels 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.279
 that the TV remembered nothing and how 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.519
 it adapted a little better to the sight 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.470
 when you want, good morning, my name 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.880
 is today the fernet and I am going to present you 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.429
 the commercial director of lg electronics 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.259
 and I'm going to present you the last 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.019
 launch that we are making in the 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.479
 today is the first television of the 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:40.360
 market and also with technology like 

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:41.799
 you can see the curvature is in the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.930
 light curvature and especially what 

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.030
 we get with this curvature is 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.830
 improve the quality of viewing over 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.110
 all because the human eye is capturing 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.420
 images of concave shape lower it so much 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.250
 that curvature makes the image you 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.430
 Wrap a lot more than a TV 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.049
 flat plus the technology oled what 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.640
 allows you is just that curvature 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.350
 being a material 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.059
 organic 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.650
 but this is not all because it is 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.520
 quickly incorporated into a 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.729
 range protection still high 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.619
 but that incorporates any technology 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.869
 already present in the television market 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.119
 how can the 3d obviously be like 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.310
 it can obviously be the smart tv of lg 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.560
 which was recognized last year as the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.509
 best smart tv on the market and obviously 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.039
 we incorporate this same 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.409
 obviously this new platform 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.409
 curved oled television that we present today 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.470
 they rest but that is the technology of 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.619
 business of the same that we have in the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.970
 cinemas incorporates what is smart tv is 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.429
 say of last generations those that 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.090
 has the maximum of 450 that we launched this 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.429
 match of the year 2013 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.579
 and obviously all the benefits of a 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.079
 television of this category for the part 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.359
 from behind the television is really 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.000
 also very spectacular apart from the 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.729
 own material that is used in a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.719
 alignment of fiber materials 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.690
 carbon 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.690
 apart from this kind of material apart 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.310
 It has four bodies HDMI ports 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.819
 hl any type of connectivity dv and 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.430
 is that any kind of l 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.639
 of possibility you can find it with 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.409
 this new TV also important to 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:33.260
 highlight is the thickness as colors of 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.580
 before the side's bleeding series 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.130
 four 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.250
 4 mm 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.670
 and if we put a mobile next to them you can 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.670
 see that it is thinner than a mobile 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.140
 when we are going to have it is already 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.670
 available is at point of sale 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.170
 it's not a thing that they sell a future of 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.170
 this product today 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.730
 an English cut soon in average 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.069
 markt and soon obviously in 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.010
 any distributor of allergens 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.530
 we will put the price right it is a product 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.560
 previously range doctor is 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.469
 positioned at medium-high range and the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.469
 price will be 9 1999 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.150
 for a niche a very public 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.209
 very technological specialist you are looking for 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.400
 the best and the last but as it happens 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.019
 always in technology is price is going to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.219
 popularize little by little as you go 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.870
 amortizing what is own 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:38.760
 technology and those economies are reached 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.510
 of scale that are always necessary 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.510
 to reach 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.420
 so more massive and we think passivity 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.420
 happening throughout the next 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.420
 months
