00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.200
 he can stand raindrops against sand, there is a flashlight on and the battery already 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.209
 the samsom 23 70 took the cell for more than a month 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.899
 ideal on the campsite during the sold out 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.230
 it's just a little phone number 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.539
 it is a sturdy telephone large buttons hard plastic purple 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.210
 on the left in the newspaper to put the flashlight on that is handy 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.289
 for example in the dark at the campsite 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.680
 just one touch and go out 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.270
 And on the other hand we are in Ghent for the charger or for example one 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.600
 headphones 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.280
 but hiddink of this the state of 23 70 no that couple 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.850
 is the DFL 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.950
 the battery 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.110
 and who must ensure that he prepares to assist for more than a month 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.890
 he is pretty megawatt he is actually a heavier than the device 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.820
 self 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.210
 and he's tall too 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.570
 I've also left it on for longer and I have to say the lifespan of 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.640
 animals from iraq now it is quite impressive it will last a long time 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.130
 arm well like I said the right outdoor phone 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680
 well we are going to find out 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.640
 I'm in the woods 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.960
 and that is their effects spot 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.610
 for the position of the 23 seats 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.370
 if you dropped your phone in the mud leave the first room more 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.020
 To fall in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.250
 it drops and falls again 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.850
 no man overboard because 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.260
 he can win 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 against splashing water m also disappointing 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.600
 I repeat dropping a few times 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.880
 and those with high prices fell on the wall street 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880
 one fifth of 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.789
 survived up there 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:16.409
 but the calling quality is great with this setting of 23 70 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.229
 for internet it is not such a big deal 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.899
 the screen is small 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.349
 and there is no 3g that has a special vision 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.859
 and what also does not count is the camera with 6 0 comma 3 megapixels 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.449
 a year this is a little phone so that hasseltweg can leave what he is there 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.859
 a few euros can be cheaper 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.889
 I think it is an interesting telephone ice-pad waterproofing can take a beating 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.019
 and that battery that lasts longer than a month, so ideal for the rougher ones 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.379
 vacation and you want on that vacation to an expensive smart of not joining is the one 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.089
 very interesting option 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.899
 because this one that your phone could taste 60 euros
