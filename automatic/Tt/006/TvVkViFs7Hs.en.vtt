twelve thousand dollars so you can see

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.979 
twelve thousand dollars so you can see
it's<00:00:44.670> highly<00:00:44.940> cost-effective<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.789> hopper<00:00:47.789> is

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
it's highly cost-effective the hopper is

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
it's highly cost-effective the hopper is
seven<00:00:48.989> thousand<00:00:49.350> liters<00:00:49.590> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.010> big<00:00:50.670> in

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
seven thousand liters which is big in

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.430 
seven thousand liters which is big in
comparison<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> other<00:00:51.870> mid-ranged

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
comparison to the other mid-ranged

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.750 
comparison to the other mid-ranged
harvesters<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.100> will<00:00:53.219> show<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
harvesters that I will show you in the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.880 
harvesters that I will show you in the
vanilla<00:00:53.969> version<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> game<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.440> upkeep

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
vanilla version of the game the upkeep

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.029 
vanilla version of the game the upkeep
is<00:00:56.899> 320<00:00:57.899> bucks<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.199> 1995<00:01:01.199> model

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
is 320 bucks and it is a 1995 model

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.640 
is 320 bucks and it is a 1995 model
which<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:03.030> assume<00:01:03.570> why<00:01:03.899> we're<00:01:04.290> getting<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
which is a I assume why we're getting it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.800 
which is a I assume why we're getting it
for<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> cost<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:06.689> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
for the cost that we are all right so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.140 
for the cost that we are all right so
let's<00:01:06.930> compare<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.909> vanilla

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
let's compare that to the vanilla

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.030 
let's compare that to the vanilla
version<00:01:11.390> all<00:01:12.390> right<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.840> would<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.350> once<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
version all right this would be once you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.429 
version all right this would be once you
upgrade<00:01:14.220> from<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.729> harvester<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.409> one<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
upgrade from this harvester here one of

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.890 
upgrade from this harvester here one of
these<00:01:16.729> more<00:01:17.729> than<00:01:17.850> likely<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.479> would<00:01:18.869> be

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
these more than likely this one would be

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.810 
these more than likely this one would be
the<00:01:19.170> upgrade<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.860> made<00:01:20.070> unless<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.700> were

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the upgrade you made unless you were

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
the upgrade you made unless you were
really<00:01:21.479> trying<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> grind<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.259> get

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
really trying to grind it out and get

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.609 
really trying to grind it out and get
one<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> these<00:01:22.950> huge<00:01:23.159> ones<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.409> may<00:01:25.560> be

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
one of these huge ones so this may be

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.710 
one of these huge ones so this may be
the<00:01:25.830> initial<00:01:26.040> upgrade<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.549> may<00:01:26.700> make<00:01:27.210> which

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the initial upgrade you may make which

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.350 
the initial upgrade you may make which
is<00:01:27.750> two<00:01:28.229> hundred<00:01:28.259> thousand<00:01:28.829> dollars<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.490> it's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
is two hundred thousand dollars for it's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.170 
is two hundred thousand dollars for it's
slightly<00:01:30.720> more<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> day<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:32.159> hopper<00:01:32.820> isn't

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
slightly more a day the hopper isn't

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.450 
slightly more a day the hopper isn't
much<00:01:33.360> smaller<00:01:33.720> much<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.470> smaller<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.009> it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
much smaller much much smaller and it

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
much smaller much much smaller and it
does<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> capacity<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.630> harvest

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
does not have the capacity to harvest

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.039 
does not have the capacity to harvest
corn<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.100> header<00:01:38.820> itself<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:40.020> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
corn and the header itself because I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.800 
corn and the header itself because I
assume<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:40.560> buying<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.860> new<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.810> almost

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
assume you're buying this new is almost

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.380 
assume you're buying this new is almost
the<00:01:43.049> cost<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.920> harvester<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.180> John

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the cost of the harvester for the John

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.800 
the cost of the harvester for the John
Deere<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> great<00:01:47.310> mod<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:48.240> sort<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
Deere so it is a great mod for sort of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.810 
Deere so it is a great mod for sort of
an<00:01:48.930> in-between<00:01:49.500> harvester<00:01:49.860> until<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
an in-between harvester until you get to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.600 
an in-between harvester until you get to
the<00:01:50.990> massive<00:01:51.990> ones<00:01:52.200> alright<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.189> let's<00:01:53.340> see<00:01:53.520> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the massive ones alright so let's see it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.450 
the massive ones alright so let's see it
in<00:01:53.670> action<00:01:53.790> let's<00:01:55.490> jump<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
in action let's jump in

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.020 
in action let's jump in
go<00:01:58.060> inside<00:01:58.330> take<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.810> look<00:01:59.049> very<00:02:01.200> detailed<00:02:03.030> they

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
go inside take a look very detailed they

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.330 
go inside take a look very detailed they
are<00:02:04.330> very<00:02:04.360> few<00:02:05.080> bugs<00:02:05.350> there<00:02:05.710> is<00:02:05.800> one<00:02:06.070> that<00:02:06.250> I'm

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
are very few bugs there is one that I'm

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.969

in<00:04:04.129> my<00:04:04.430> opinion<00:04:04.760> we're<00:04:05.150> going<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.299> jump<00:04:05.629> into

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
in my opinion we're going to jump into

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.009 
in my opinion we're going to jump into
one<00:04:06.799> of<00:04:06.919> my<00:04:07.099> other<00:04:07.340> guys<00:04:09.159> and<00:04:10.449> head<00:04:11.449> over<00:04:11.659> this

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
one of my other guys and head over this

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.750 
one of my other guys and head over this
is<00:04:12.199> one<00:04:12.319> of<00:04:12.409> the<00:04:12.469> smaller<00:04:12.769> trailers<00:04:13.219> it's<00:04:13.489> also

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
is one of the smaller trailers it's also

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.870 
is one of the smaller trailers it's also
one<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> initial<00:04:14.449> upgrades<00:04:14.810> I<00:04:14.959> make<00:04:15.880> it

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
one of the initial upgrades I make it

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.759 
one of the initial upgrades I make it
again<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.449> in<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.109> vanilla<00:04:18.289> version<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.709> the

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
again is in the vanilla version of the

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.330 
again is in the vanilla version of the
game<00:04:18.889> i<00:04:19.070> will<00:04:19.220> show<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.519> after<00:04:20.000> we<00:04:20.900> do<00:04:21.079> this

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
game i will show you after we do this

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.700 
game i will show you after we do this
but<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.759> does<00:04:23.120> function<00:04:23.630> with<00:04:23.900> this<00:04:24.229> trailer

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
but it does function with this trailer

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.439 
but it does function with this trailer
now<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.250> reason<00:04:25.550> i<00:04:25.789> don't<00:04:25.849> believe<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:26.270> to

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
now the reason i don't believe this to

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.950 
now the reason i don't believe this to
be<00:04:26.479> a<00:04:26.570> problem<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:27.729> because<00:04:28.729> this<00:04:29.389> harvester

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
be a problem is because this harvester

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.719 
be a problem is because this harvester
is<00:04:29.990> one<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.470> initial<00:04:30.949> upgrades<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.460> make

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
is one of the initial upgrades you make

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.020 
is one of the initial upgrades you make
and<00:04:31.970> you<00:04:32.680> usually<00:04:33.680> do<00:04:34.070> not<00:04:34.220> purchase<00:04:34.669> that

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
and you usually do not purchase that

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.890 
and you usually do not purchase that
massive<00:04:35.659> tipper<00:04:36.139> at<00:04:36.470> this<00:04:36.800> point<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.460> game

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
massive tipper at this point in the game

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.379 
massive tipper at this point in the game
so<00:04:38.900> it's<00:04:39.380> not<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:40.070> large<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.729> an<00:04:40.849> issue<00:04:41.000> in<00:04:41.270> my

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
so it's not that large of an issue in my

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.879 
so it's not that large of an issue in my
opinion<00:04:42.460> now<00:04:43.690> one<00:04:44.690> of<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.840> problems<00:04:44.870> that<00:04:45.440> you

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
opinion now one of the problems that you

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.050 
opinion now one of the problems that you
may<00:04:46.070> notice<00:04:46.789> here<00:04:47.030> is<00:04:48.490> sometimes<00:04:49.490> with<00:04:50.030> a

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
may notice here is sometimes with a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.110 
may notice here is sometimes with a
modded<00:04:51.009> actually<00:04:52.009> both<00:04:52.159> this<00:04:52.430> tractor<00:04:52.940> and

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
modded actually both this tractor and

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.300 
modded actually both this tractor and
the<00:04:53.150> harvester<00:04:53.840> are<00:04:53.990> modded<00:04:54.380> now<00:04:54.889> I'm<00:04:55.130> going

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
the harvester are modded now I'm going

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.159 
the harvester are modded now I'm going
to<00:04:55.400> try<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.610> hit<00:04:55.820> for<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.720> get<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:56.960> cruise

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
to try to hit for to get to cruise

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.560 
to try to hit for to get to cruise
control<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.560> match<00:04:57.710> up<00:04:57.889> with<00:04:58.009> the<00:04:58.449> with<00:04:59.449> the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
control to match up with the with the

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.060 
control to match up with the with the
harvester<00:04:59.960> but<00:05:00.080> you<00:05:00.169> can<00:05:00.289> see<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:00.620> pulls<00:05:00.889> away

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
harvester but you can see it pulls away

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.529 
harvester but you can see it pulls away
now<00:05:01.460> what<00:05:01.669> you<00:05:01.789> will<00:05:01.880> initial<00:05:02.270> what<00:05:02.360> you'll

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
now what you will initial what you'll

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.170 
now what you will initial what you'll
probably<00:05:02.900> have<00:05:03.199> to<00:05:03.229> do<00:05:03.560> is<00:05:04.030> fiddle<00:05:05.030> with<00:05:05.150> the

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
probably have to do is fiddle with the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.480 
probably have to do is fiddle with the
es<00:05:05.690> limiter<00:05:06.139> that<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.650> have<00:05:06.919> on<00:05:07.220> the

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
es limiter that you have on the

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.610 
es limiter that you have on the
harvester<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.720> harvester<00:05:09.110> has<00:05:09.259> the<00:05:09.470> capacity

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
harvester the harvester has the capacity

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.189 
harvester the harvester has the capacity
to<00:05:10.070> use<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.729> page<00:05:10.909> up<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.180> page<00:05:11.270> down<00:05:11.419> keys<00:05:11.900> to

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
to use the page up and page down keys to

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.540 
to use the page up and page down keys to
adjust<00:05:15.199> the<00:05:15.349> cruise<00:05:15.560> control<00:05:15.650> for<00:05:15.979> lack<00:05:16.310> of<00:05:16.340> a

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
adjust the cruise control for lack of a

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.790 
adjust the cruise control for lack of a
better<00:05:16.580> word<00:05:16.789> so<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:17.810> can<00:05:18.259> actually<00:05:18.380> speed<00:05:18.680> it

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
better word so you can actually speed it

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.629 
better word so you can actually speed it
way<00:05:19.130> up<00:05:19.159> or<00:05:19.490> you<00:05:20.060> can<00:05:20.860> adjust<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:21.979> way<00:05:22.070> down<00:05:22.099> now

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
way up or you can adjust it way down now

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.159 
way up or you can adjust it way down now
excuse<00:05:22.880> me<00:05:22.909> I'm<00:05:23.120> talking<00:05:23.449> at<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.780> same<00:05:23.960> time

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
excuse me I'm talking at the same time

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.899 
excuse me I'm talking at the same time
and<00:05:24.349> trying<00:05:24.530> to<00:05:24.650> think<00:05:24.860> so<00:05:25.340> that's<00:05:25.550> why<00:05:25.729> I'm

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
and trying to think so that's why I'm

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.089 
and trying to think so that's why I'm
all<00:05:26.120> herky-jerky<00:05:26.719> but<00:05:27.469> you'll<00:05:27.710> see<00:05:27.919> what<00:05:28.070> I

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
all herky-jerky but you'll see what I

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.680 
all herky-jerky but you'll see what I
mean<00:05:28.159> about<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.520> bug<00:05:28.759> there<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:29.180> actually

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
mean about the bug there it actually

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.040 
mean about the bug there it actually
functions<00:05:30.520> just<00:05:31.520> fine<00:05:31.669> with<00:05:32.570> the<00:05:32.780> other

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
functions just fine with the other

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.719 
functions just fine with the other
trailer<00:05:33.560> there<00:05:33.740> that<00:05:33.889> I<00:05:33.919> will<00:05:34.159> actually<00:05:34.340> show

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
trailer there that I will actually show

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.310 
trailer there that I will actually show
you<00:05:34.759> now<00:05:36.009> let's<00:05:37.009> go<00:05:37.190> to<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:38.020> let's<00:05:39.020> go<00:05:39.169> back<00:05:39.289> to

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
you now let's go to the let's go back to

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.779 
you now let's go to the let's go back to
owned<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.919> might<00:05:40.070> be<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.279> better<00:05:40.400> way<00:05:40.580> to<00:05:40.639> do

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
owned that might be the better way to do

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.499 
owned that might be the better way to do
it

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
it

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.939 
it
here<00:05:43.509> is<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.900> tipper<00:05:44.199> that<00:05:44.410> it<00:05:44.500> works<00:05:44.650> just

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
here is the tipper that it works just

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.110 
here is the tipper that it works just
fine<00:05:45.580> with<00:05:45.850> its<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:47.020> Gilbert<00:05:48.009> 1800<00:05:48.639> pro<00:05:48.820> and

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
fine with its the Gilbert 1800 pro and

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.450 
fine with its the Gilbert 1800 pro and
this<00:05:50.110> is<00:05:50.289> the<00:05:50.380> one<00:05:50.530> that<00:05:50.680> it<00:05:50.830> does<00:05:51.039> not<00:05:51.070> like

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
this is the one that it does not like

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.990 
this is the one that it does not like
it's<00:05:52.199> 61<00:05:53.199> you<00:05:53.440> know<00:05:53.560> thousand<00:05:54.370> is<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.639> volume

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
it's 61 you know thousand is the volume

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.420 
it's 61 you know thousand is the volume
which<00:05:55.180> is<00:05:55.360> which<00:05:55.840> is<00:05:55.870> great<00:05:56.380> but<00:05:57.009> like<00:05:57.250> I<00:05:57.370> said

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
which is which is great but like I said

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.900 
which is which is great but like I said
you<00:05:57.669> may<00:05:57.880> not<00:05:58.060> be<00:05:58.240> up<00:05:58.479> to<00:05:58.539> this<00:05:58.840> point<00:05:59.080> anyways

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
you may not be up to this point anyways
