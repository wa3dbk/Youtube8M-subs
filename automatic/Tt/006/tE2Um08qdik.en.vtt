00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
sake of the performance is a seven of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.569 
sake of the performance is a seven of
Hearts<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.559> we're<00:00:34.649> gonna<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.250> go

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
Hearts so what we're gonna do is go

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.310 
Hearts so what we're gonna do is go
through<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> cards<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.840> trying<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> make

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
through the cards when trying to make

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.530 
through the cards when trying to make
some<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:37.890> kind<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.610> four<00:00:39.000> equal<00:00:39.329> piles

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
some what kind of like four equal piles

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.680 
some what kind of like four equal piles
piles<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.430> speak<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.120> don't<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.600> be

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
piles if I can speak so don't have to be

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.799 
piles if I can speak so don't have to be
exactly<00:00:43.559> equal<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:44.520> four<00:00:44.760> piles<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.390> were

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
exactly equal just four piles that were

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.680 
exactly equal just four piles that were
kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:47.000> distributing<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.239> deck<00:00:48.420> into

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
kind of like distributing the deck into

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.010 
kind of like distributing the deck into
four<00:00:48.930> piles<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.180> we're<00:00:51.270> gonna<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.840> get

fourth pile flip them over just like

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.099 
fourth pile flip them over just like
this<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.500> we're<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> shuffle<00:00:56.840> one<00:00:57.840> pile

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
this and we're going to shuffle one pile

this and we're going to shuffle one pile
facedown<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.309> pile<00:01:00.000> faced<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.219> we

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
facedown and one pile faced up so if we

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.260 
facedown and one pile faced up so if we
can<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.930> doesn't<00:01:03.930> whoops<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:05.150> just<00:01:06.150> like

exactly twelve just somewhat around that

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.650 
exactly twelve just somewhat around that
around<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.610> range<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.270> doesn't<00:04:39.539> really

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
around that range it doesn't really

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.640

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
the the face up pack and I shuffle them

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.140 
the the face up pack and I shuffle them
together<00:05:12.419> just<00:05:12.630> like<00:05:12.690> this<00:05:13.789> now<00:05:14.789> make<00:05:15.120> sure

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
together just like this now make sure

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.110 
together just like this now make sure
you<00:05:15.900> spread<00:05:16.320> them<00:05:16.470> out<00:05:16.560> with<00:05:16.889> the<00:05:17.400> knot<00:05:17.789> heart

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
you spread them out with the knot heart

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.760 
you spread them out with the knot heart
face<00:05:18.330> up<00:05:18.599> because<00:05:18.930> they'll<00:05:19.139> really<00:05:19.410> catch<00:05:19.620> on

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
face up because they'll really catch on

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.499 
face up because they'll really catch on
if<00:05:20.009> you<00:05:20.099> do<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.400> but<00:05:20.729> just<00:05:21.150> through<00:05:21.360> like

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
if you do that but just through like

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:22.820 
if you do that but just through like
this<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:21.870> show<00:05:21.990> that<00:05:22.139> they're<00:05:22.320> kind<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.620> mixed

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
this and show that they're kind of mixed

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.980 
this and show that they're kind of mixed
up<00:05:22.919> like<00:05:23.099> this<00:05:23.280> so<00:05:24.090> once<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.389> do<00:05:24.509> this<00:05:24.539> you

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
up like this so once you do this you

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.600 
up like this so once you do this you
just<00:05:25.020> have<00:05:25.259> to<00:05:25.410> remember<00:05:25.650> that<00:05:26.039> the<00:05:26.220> hearts

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
just have to remember that the hearts

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.589 
just have to remember that the hearts
are<00:05:26.880> facing<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:28.560> hearts<00:05:28.860> are<00:05:28.979> facing<00:05:29.370> down<00:05:29.669> so

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
are facing the hearts are facing down so

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.140 
are facing the hearts are facing down so
this<00:05:30.930> pack<00:05:31.289> is<00:05:31.530> also<00:05:31.740> facing<00:05:32.070> down<00:05:32.430> so<00:05:33.060> you

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
this pack is also facing down so you

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.670 
this pack is also facing down so you
don't<00:05:33.419> want<00:05:33.570> the<00:05:33.720> hearts<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:34.199> the<00:05:34.320> other

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
don't want the hearts and the other

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.379 
don't want the hearts and the other
packs<00:05:34.979> to<00:05:35.190> go<00:05:35.310> in<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.490> same<00:05:35.669> direction<00:05:35.820> so<00:05:36.090> in

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
packs to go in the same direction so in

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.360 
packs to go in the same direction so in
this<00:05:36.510> hand<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.990> hearts<00:05:37.229> are<00:05:37.349> going<00:05:37.470> down<00:05:37.770> so

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
this hand the hearts are going down so

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.850 
this hand the hearts are going down so
you<00:05:38.460> want<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.820> rest<00:05:39.030> of<00:05:39.120> them<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:40.020> face<00:05:40.289> up<00:05:40.530> so

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
you want the rest of them to face up so

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.800 
you want the rest of them to face up so
you<00:05:40.919> flip<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.220> lips<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.550> over<00:05:41.849> so<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.570> hearts

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
you flip the lips and over so the hearts

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.570 
you flip the lips and over so the hearts
are<00:05:42.960> all<00:05:43.110> still<00:05:43.380> going<00:05:43.650> down<00:05:43.830> and<00:05:44.130> you<00:05:44.220> shuffle

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
are all still going down and you shuffle

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.060 
are all still going down and you shuffle
them<00:05:44.669> together<00:05:44.789> just<00:05:45.000> like<00:05:45.240> this<00:05:45.800> now<00:05:46.800> for<00:05:47.010> the

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
them together just like this now for the

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.010 
them together just like this now for the
last<00:05:47.250> one<00:05:47.460> you<00:05:48.030> don't<00:05:48.210> want<00:05:48.449> to<00:05:48.539> keep<00:05:48.659> it<00:05:48.780> face

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
last one you don't want to keep it face

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.080 
last one you don't want to keep it face
up<00:05:49.260> because<00:05:49.380> they<00:05:49.620> might<00:05:49.860> catch<00:05:50.070> on<00:05:50.250> so<00:05:50.849> if<00:05:50.970> you

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
up because they might catch on so if you

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.029 
up because they might catch on so if you
want<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.330> flip<00:05:51.539> this<00:05:51.720> over<00:05:51.990> you<00:05:52.320> also<00:05:52.530> have<00:05:52.919> to

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
want to flip this over you also have to

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.520 
want to flip this over you also have to
flip<00:05:53.340> this<00:05:53.699> pack<00:05:53.940> over<00:05:54.300> but<00:05:54.810> when<00:05:54.960> you<00:05:55.080> do<00:05:55.320> the

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
flip this pack over but when you do the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.170 
flip this pack over but when you do the
riffle<00:05:55.830> shuffle<00:05:55.860> just<00:05:56.310> like<00:05:56.430> this<00:05:56.580> kind<00:05:57.000> of<00:05:57.090> do

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
riffle shuffle just like this kind of do

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.089 
riffle shuffle just like this kind of do
it<00:05:57.300> faster<00:05:57.720> because<00:05:58.320> as<00:05:58.500> you<00:05:58.740> riffle<00:05:59.070> through

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
it faster because as you riffle through

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.100 
it faster because as you riffle through
they'll<00:05:59.759> start<00:06:00.030> to<00:06:00.120> see<00:06:00.300> that<00:06:00.509> there<00:06:00.840> are<00:06:00.930> only

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
they'll start to see that there are only

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.589 
they'll start to see that there are only
hearts<00:06:01.560> face<00:06:01.800> up<00:06:02.070> so<00:06:02.759> make<00:06:03.060> sure<00:06:03.240> when<00:06:03.389> you<00:06:03.479> do

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
hearts face up so make sure when you do

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:04.839 
hearts face up so make sure when you do
this<00:06:03.750> do<00:06:04.020> it<00:06:04.139> kind<00:06:04.320> of<00:06:04.349> a<00:06:04.440> riffle<00:06:04.740> shuffle

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
this do it kind of a riffle shuffle

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.610 
this do it kind of a riffle shuffle
towards<00:06:05.849> yourself<00:06:05.970> and<00:06:06.449> do<00:06:06.930> it<00:06:07.050> kind<00:06:07.259> of<00:06:07.320> fast

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
towards yourself and do it kind of fast

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.010 
towards yourself and do it kind of fast
so<00:06:08.009> they<00:06:08.130> can't<00:06:08.370> really<00:06:08.490> catch<00:06:08.789> on<00:06:08.970> to<00:06:09.090> it<00:06:09.180> so

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
so they can't really catch on to it so

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.270 
so they can't really catch on to it so
once<00:06:10.169> you<00:06:10.259> do<00:06:10.349> that<00:06:10.380> you<00:06:10.830> put<00:06:11.039> them<00:06:11.190> together

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
once you do that you put them together

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.170 
once you do that you put them together
and<00:06:11.639> then<00:06:12.060> you<00:06:12.150> do<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.449> little<00:06:12.599> spiel<00:06:12.960> about

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
and then you do the little spiel about

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.300 
and then you do the little spiel about
about<00:06:15.180> how<00:06:15.479> they<00:06:15.990> picked<00:06:16.229> a<00:06:16.320> card<00:06:16.530> they<00:06:16.949> put<00:06:17.190> it

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
about how they picked a card they put it

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.909 
about how they picked a card they put it
back<00:06:17.490> into<00:06:17.789> the<00:06:18.090> deck<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.570> you've<00:06:19.409> made<00:06:19.710> four

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.409

equal piles and shuffle shuffle them all

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.089
