 with stories from latin america and it's that 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.460
 the tourism sector of nicaragua grew 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.350
 in recent years according to data 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.940
 of the ministry of tourism and this too 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.190
 led to an increase in employment at marcel 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 it's like this with the possible construction of the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.969
 interoceanic canal we have to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.039
 Nicaraguan citizens see more and more 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.340
 near the possibilities of exploiting that 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.220
 sector according to official data tourism 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.449
 has been growing at annual rates of 7% 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.880
 and the year Nicaragua receives around 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.309
 1.4 million tourists the different 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.230
 The country's tourist businesses are 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.690
 clear of the change that this can 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.070
 mean yes I think you have to prepare 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.170
 the staff but you also have to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.750
 prepare not only the staff to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.879
 receive tourists but to make a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.719
 social change an ecological social change 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.030
 representatives of the tourism chamber 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.640
 from Nicaragua welcome the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.199
 four sub tourism projects 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 contemplated product of the possible 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.789
 construction of the canal that includes 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.699
 beach resorts to a resort 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.140
 volcanic we react of the tax of 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.489
 the property exonerate the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.070
 Value added tax 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
 we exonerate all your equipment supplies 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.530
 how well they bring them to develop their 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.909
 hoteliers or infrastructure projects 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:20.659
 we go logically to it inclusive 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.479
 We are receiving demands from abroad 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.320
 they just received a group of Spanish 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.229
 very interested to come to invest in 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.080
 Nicaragua in the beach area near the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.549
 channel I think every time for this 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.590
 analyst if you get to give the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.259
 channel construction will come to provoke 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.479
 Structural changes in technology 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.420
 employment modifications in 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.819
 tourism universities and believes that there is 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.049
 be united as a country for this change 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:52.020
 already nicaragua has a high growth 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.780
 annual economic one could do the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.270
 conjecture that this could grow in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.039
 50 percent more at least true 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.049
 you can imagine that the injection 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.270
 of 40 billion dollars in the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.420
 Nicaraguan economy is something that is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.619
 called to cause an explosion 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.560
 considerable in terms of growth 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.150

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.599
