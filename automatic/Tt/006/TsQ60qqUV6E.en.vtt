00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.359
 hi to all those noises so today 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.509
 we end up for a tutorial on how 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.850
 swap gossip of xbox 360 against 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.680
 ps3 so there you see I make 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.780
 on the controller there is the problem that's 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.000
 that I had recorded just before so 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.970
 how to install it 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.739
 but my camcorder to mess around I could 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.510
 video wii like jacques a joystick I 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.579
 I can not do it again but I 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.190
 will show you how to 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.339
 to install it so me it's a 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.519
 ps2 joystick joystick 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:00.070
 I had no diagnosis of ps3 but I 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.239
 believe it's about the same so I 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.609
 will show you first a series 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.590
 mixed customize so I did 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.789
 that one I just trigger them I 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.320
 had to forget and I did that too 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.190
 so in the style of the net strong sq 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.190
 those who know 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:23.150
 so that's so you need a screwdriver a 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:28.040
 preferably patafix and beats 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.580
 the joystick so you start with 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.580
 joystick mountings 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.170
 here 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.080
 you withdraw and so there is a little 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.340
 more complicated 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.340
 if you remove your motherboard 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.930
 so here you are will both 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.460
 boxing joysticks here so you started 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.710
 by removing that and then I do not know 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.260
 if we will see very well but on the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.670
 ps2 joystick so what a hole for them 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.040
 put on the little branch there so he 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.320
 will have the crucible so I use 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.210
 and the screwdriver has it so you go 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.760
 in the gisti that you turn mesalles 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.650
 dig away from time to time trying to 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.990
 put it to see what it's like 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.150
 right in not one passes once 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.610
 it's okay you take patafix 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.040
 you warm it up well we will you 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.629
 want to roll all that and push it 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.930
 in the joystick so I do not know if 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:39.200
 you see in it and then there 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.730
 you have to go through there you have to 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.579
 pass the joystick before what 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:53.030
 that he's too rude does not spell and 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:58.250
 then you put that back to them 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.870
 pass in front of us try that who 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.989
 now make it a little boring to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.269
 make 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:09.079
 and here it is time finally if he comes 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:15.080
 to sink in and these good that holds good he 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:17.270
 missing the buttons so that's it 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.890
 if you have questions or if something 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.480
 that you do not get to leave yourself a 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.340
 comment 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.160

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.510
