00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Sitting proudly within the confines of the the Kotoku-In temple,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the Great Buddha statue, or Daibutsu is another very popular religious attraction of Kamakura.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Despite its overall sense of serenity, the Daibutsu had a rather tumultuous history!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It all started in 1233 when the good people of Kotoku-In decided to erect a giant wooden representation of Buddha.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
After a good decade of hard labor the gorgeous wooden wonder was finally unveiled to all. Unfortunately,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in 1248 a storm destroyed both the wooden statue and its hall. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Realising that wood was too fragile, it was decided to build yet another statue of Buddha by this time in bronze.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Finished in 1252, the bronzed version of the wooden Buddha statue is the statue that you can enjoy today in Kotoku-In. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.000
While the Daibutsu itself was built to withstand the worst conditions, its main protective hall was not so lucky

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and was destroyed by powerful storms in 1334 and in 1369, as well as in 1498 by a devastating tsunami.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Unphased by the elements, the Daibutsu was still standing proudly and serene as before. It was after the 1498 tsunami that it was decided to let Daibutsu remain standing in the open air.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Finally and according to Kotoku-In record, the Daibutsu measure 13.35m with a total weight of around 121 tonnes.
