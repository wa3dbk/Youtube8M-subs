00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello to all welcome to mac forever 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 so today we test the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.290
 iphone 5's performance against 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.300
 the iphone 4s which was the flagship of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.299
 the range so far so for that we have 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.789
 took two white models 64 giga 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.250
 two and we'll see what the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.080
 new model but he his a6 chip has in 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.880
 The belly 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.519
 if we start with the launch of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.320
 So here mac applications that forever 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.220
 actually is faster on 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.570
 the iphone 5 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.780
 be aware that this is about the case 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.280
 on all applications 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.670
 a little bit less if the application is 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.430
 already started obviously then with the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.300
 new version of plans the iphone 5 is 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.910
 actually a little bit faster 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.250
 especially on loading maps here 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 in lyon after for all that is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.719
 navigation move on the maps 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.300
 there is no big difference with 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.920
 the 4s the only difference we see it on 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.079
 the 3d no there we did not put it to you 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.550
 since it's hard to do at the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.570
 hand ie also much more 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.410
 fluid actually I like a lot more 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.210
 frame per second 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.320
 when navigating in 3d on maps 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.840
 so our software that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.189
 traditionally was a lot more 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.939
 fast with the new generations 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.640
 iphone it was google earth is there 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.270
 so compared to a 4s the difference 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.530
 is not huge 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.990
 it's a little bit more fluid so we 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.930
 feel that there the most triple hearts makes 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.250
 still a good job but on a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.470
 software that is quite greedy enough 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.329
 there is no noticeable difference then 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.439
 we have seen that the network is 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.880
 load a little faster so there 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.530
 you see on the example on the way 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 neither and cards that loads a lot 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.049
 faster 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.220
 there the two devices are also on the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.360
 same network so we do not know who has 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.420
 makes the request also the first 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.680
 maybe he has priority 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.259
 here at the level of displacements you 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.140
 see a little more fluidity on 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.320
 the iphone 5 but again it remains 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.500
 really to demonstrate 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.690
 so still on the 3d so the test of 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.780
 infinity blade game which is a game based 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.729
 on the unreal engine 3 that it's part 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.850
 graphic engines that are destroyed 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.580
 censorship on ios and who exploit at 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.440
 better 3d possibilities 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.060
 so there in the game same thing we feel 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.209
 than a little more image per second with 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.550
 the iphone 5 but it is not very 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.500
 flagrant and during the game we do not have 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.270
 the impression that on the 4s is a lot 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.520
 slower then one must also know that 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.260
 these games there are very optimized for 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.530
 each phone and so that's 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.880
 normal that the gains are not either not 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.880
 huge from one device to another 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.920
 so here is a small example two more 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.500
 launches of applications that are pretty 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.350
 heavy we took the tomtom gps 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.790
 europe version 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.560
 so there you see very clearly on 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.630
 the iphone 5 which science a lot more 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.810
 quickly look at me twice more 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.959
 quickly this peak then the calculations of 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.510
 courses are also faster here it is 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.940
 will do a little test on returning to 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.250
 the address for example in the city center of 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.799
 lyon so see a little bit 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.829
 so the time that put the two 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.269
 devices with the path you see that 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:16.130
 the iphone 5 is almost immediate on 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:18.920
 the iphone 4s computing time after that 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.850
 on the on the gps software as 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.380
 that such as we did everything to 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.049
 the time it is very well optimized on 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.940
 iphone 4 iphone 4s so there is no 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.519
 camp difference otherwise at level 3 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.170
 death is simplistic too so the 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.250
 difference but especially the times of 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.260
 loading depend on calculating istres 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.400
 ajaccio then not on a small 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.630
 software that is free called 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.910
 action movie you can count one 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.250
 where it's software that actually adds 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.150
 effects on a video so there we go 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.670
 just filming black suspend for 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.230
 the administration and then after we go 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.760
 add a little effect so there you have to 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.030
 no object to actually calculate the image by 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.650
 picture 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.989
 here you see it's very very clear 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.000
 the iphone 5 and I would say almost more than 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.240
 twice as fast we will calculate the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.650
 scene while 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.330
 the iphone 4s that's just finished and so 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.770
 the end so be two videos that are 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.720
 inlaid then here it is on a black background 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.100
 with a car that was coming to invade 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.800
 the big ones then another software of 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.450
 video calculation is called vintage and puy 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.270
 actually is a kind of instagram of 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.450
 the video whose goal is to go 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.890
 to age a sequence to go put it 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.810
 in black and white had to add small 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.790
 effect a little music 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.510
 so we took a video we had 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:33.090
 shot not so long ago with 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.070
 the 3d logo of sculpteo and then we have 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.980
 started the calculation on both devices 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.010
 so here again the iphone 5 has a sacred 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.780
 advance the cdu computation really gross so 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.310
 it basically uses the whole 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.950
 part cpu we see that May 6 true 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.070
 spanking or 5 is present in the in 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.650
 the 4s there again more than twice as much 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.450
 fast since we still have not finished 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.690
 on the side of 4s which was already 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.870
 much faster than iphone 4 and that's it 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.650
 the video so produced 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.650
 so little demo 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.490
 then we come back to a gameloft game 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.260
 who are called them asphalt 6 so there 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.670
 it's more to show the time of 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.560
 actually loading in the game since 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.770
 after after the fluidity pretty much the 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.290
 even 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.360
 but see here we will launch so the 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.940
 part which is a chamonix circuit 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.810
 so we choose his car and after 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.960
 here is the iphone 5 has almost finished already 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.730
 that's when on the 4s it takes 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.310
 wait almost two months four 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.240
 times longer 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.210
 so here we wanted to make you a little 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.840
 test in fact of speed on the wifi 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.520
 so we went far enough from the terminal 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.540
 and then we started so the test on 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:00.650
 the iphone 4s first so there we had to 16 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.900
 megabit download and then 2.6 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.130
 megabit in the claude so here we have 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.600
 launched one after the other for although 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.170
 everyone can tap the whole gang 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.760
 bandwidth 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.230
 it's on the same server so the 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.600
 speed should be about the same 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.270
 and so you see on both 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:23.510
 devices one morning also 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:26.300
 15 15 like that then a little ride on the 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.010
 web with the world site so 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.450
 then there is effective what is 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.770
 more blatant it's more the size of 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.129
 the screen actually we have a lot of 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.679
 things on the screen 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.209
 the survival of the world Site time 

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:39.059
 loading so here if we click by 

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:42.309
 example on an article we take the same 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:43.659
 the one about the ecologists of the day 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:45.669
 see there seems a little faster 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:48.819
 on the iphone 5 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.209
 so after his nose on the tenth of 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:52.269
 second 

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:54.580
 so that's the glaring compared to a 

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:55.449
 iphone 3g iphone 3gs there was there 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.709
 had some difference 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.149
 today we do not want to say that 

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:59.469
 the iphone 5 allow you to surf 

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:00.939
 faster on the internet 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.409
 but it's actually a lot 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:04.659
 more responsive when we go back 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:07.539
 the page loads a little faster 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:08.740
 here you rent with our site 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:10.599
 There are sometimes some differences 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.740
 very big pages we feel that the iphone 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.080
 A little bit less 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.999
 as for skrela 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.490
 but otherwise it's pretty much kifkif with 

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:20.949
 the 4s here is a little bit more 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.429
 responsiveness is no difference 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:23.469
 most 

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:24.639
 so here we are done for the test of 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:26.919
 performance comparison between 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:28.389
 iphone 4s and iphone 5 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:30.099
 so obviously it was not 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:31.659
 exhaustive they are pretty subjective 

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:32.909
 depends on a lot of parameters like 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:35.229
 network speed 

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:38.319
 but that said they give a good overview 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:40.419
 I think performance you see it 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.249
 it's basically about the calculations 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.629
 heavy enough that I am today 

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:44.919
 the difference the iphone 5 is 

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.990
 actually twice as fast and 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:48.879
 even sometimes three or four times more 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.240
 fast following the calculations that we 

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.550
