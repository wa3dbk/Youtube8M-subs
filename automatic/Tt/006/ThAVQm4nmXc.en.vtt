00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the handbrake to work properly so if you

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.020 
the handbrake to work properly so if you
just<00:00:40.860> look<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.100> my<00:00:41.160> previous<00:00:41.340> video<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
going here so it's just a chapter of Ren

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.660 
going here so it's just a chapter of Ren
&amp;<00:00:57.059> Stimpy<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.320> start<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> off

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
&amp; Stimpy so just start it off

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.730 
&amp; Stimpy so just start it off
yeah<00:01:00.210> overwrite<00:01:00.840> you've<00:01:01.500> done<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.800> one

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.210 

God<00:01:06.549> has<00:01:06.670> done<00:01:06.820> no<00:01:07.150> go<00:01:07.659> encode<00:01:08.080> big<00:01:08.830> see<00:01:09.070> it's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
God has done no go encode big see it's

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.090 
God has done no go encode big see it's
moving<00:01:10.180> quite<00:01:10.479> quickly<00:01:10.510> for<00:01:10.960> it<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.890> fact

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
moving quite quickly for it in fact

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.960 
moving quite quickly for it in fact
encoding<00:01:12.729> at<00:01:12.970> 300<00:01:13.960> frames<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.530> second<00:01:14.970> so

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
encoding at 300 frames a second so

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.910 
encoding at 300 frames a second so
that's<00:01:16.060> about<00:01:16.270> 10<00:01:17.020> times<00:01:17.229> faster<00:01:17.710> than<00:01:17.800> the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
that's about 10 times faster than the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.870 
that's about 10 times faster than the
DVD<00:01:18.280> plays<00:01:20.250> let's<00:01:21.250> just<00:01:21.400> go<00:01:21.490> through<00:01:21.520> your

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
DVD plays let's just go through your

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.390 
DVD plays let's just go through your
options<00:01:22.150> need<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.810> use<00:01:23.110> in<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.350> handbrake<00:01:23.770> so

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
options need to use in the handbrake so

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.730 
options need to use in the handbrake so
I<00:01:24.430> first<00:01:24.759> offered<00:01:25.149> choose<00:01:25.330> a<00:01:25.360> source<00:01:25.720> so<00:01:26.560> that

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
I first offered choose a source so that

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.639 
I first offered choose a source so that
one<00:01:26.890> these<00:01:27.100> ISO<00:01:27.909> files<00:01:28.180> are<00:01:28.420> downloaded<00:01:28.649> we

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
one these ISO files are downloaded we

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.080 
one these ISO files are downloaded we
could<00:01:29.830> choose<00:01:30.009> from<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.220> DVD<00:01:30.369> drive<00:01:30.790> from<00:01:31.060> that

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
could choose from a DVD drive from that

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.880 
could choose from a DVD drive from that
side<00:01:31.420> there<00:01:31.690> I<00:01:31.930> don't<00:01:32.290> have<00:01:32.440> one<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:32.619> the

something as basic as a netbook a 1.6
gigahertz<00:05:41.550> processor<00:05:41.790> it'll<00:05:42.750> take<00:05:42.900> about<00:05:43.050> a

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
gigahertz processor it'll take about a

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.760 
gigahertz processor it'll take about a
third<00:05:43.830> of<00:05:44.730> movie<00:05:45.120> time<00:05:45.350> basically<00:05:46.350> what<00:05:46.590> about
