that differ from direct subsidies crop
insurance<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.049> like<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> as

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
insurance is I like to think of it as

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.490 
insurance is I like to think of it as
similar<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.880> car<00:01:09.299> insurance<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
similar to car insurance and the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
similar to car insurance and the
difference<00:01:10.950> being<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.570> taxpayer

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
difference being that taxpayer

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
difference being that taxpayer
subsidized<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.710> lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:15.170> farmers<00:01:16.170> premiums<00:01:16.799> for

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
subsidized a lot of farmers premiums for

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.580

the crop insurance program on average

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
the crop insurance program on average
taxpayer<00:01:20.220> subsidized<00:01:20.790> sixty-two<00:01:21.390> percent<00:01:21.570> of

taxpayer subsidized sixty-two percent of
a<00:01:22.500> farmer's<00:01:22.920> premiums<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:24.330> also<00:01:24.509> subsidize

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
a farmer's premiums we also subsidize

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.609 
a farmer's premiums we also subsidize
the<00:01:26.130> crop<00:01:26.820> insurance<00:01:27.110> industry<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> tune

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the crop insurance industry to the tune

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.490 
the crop insurance industry to the tune
of<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.159> 1.3<00:01:29.729> billion<00:01:30.270> dollars<00:01:30.869> annually

of up to 1.3 billion dollars annually

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.429 
of up to 1.3 billion dollars annually
the<00:01:32.340> difference<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> direct<00:01:33.869> subsidies

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the difference is that direct subsidies

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.710 
the difference is that direct subsidies
