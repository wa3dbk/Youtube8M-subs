00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.370
 as in the 11 minute thomas mÃ¼ller the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.230
 scored first goal for germany 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.660
 Nobody in the Messehalle Straubing yet 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.240
 the spectators guessed what a goal 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.469
 fireworks the next 90 minutes 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.469
 she should be down 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 in the cold, dingy weather outside 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.690
 offered the public viewing in the hall 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.140
 around 1700 fans create the ideal atmosphere for 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.660
 cheer and celebrate already in the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.860
 half-time there was euphoric cheering 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.860
 How is the mood? 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.270
 with these tips should the two 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.369
 young men are almost right 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.140
 It then crashed in the second half 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.140
 but twice in the gate of the hosts 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.130
 the day after the historic victory and 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.319
 bitter cell classification 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.850
 so jogis guys are back in again 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.399
 their crew quarters 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.670
 now it applies to the opponent for 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.619
 to prepare the final on sunday 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.899
 argentina or holland are 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.140
 equally strong both teams play 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.810
 I think that holland must adversary 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.950
 when the dutchmen beat 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.579
 that means they assume that we 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.579
 sunday pack 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.970
 but her tip for the final on sunday 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.670
 victory for Germany I guess 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:30.650
 that holland actually when it into the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:33.950
 the final would come 54 74 90 2014 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.870
 it could have been the last 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.150
 German eleven killed the curse of the game 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.970
 place third place in recent years 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.310
 Now an entire nation hopes for ours 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.319
 team in the final match just as courageous 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.510
 and playful aggressive and 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.870
 will occur dangerously as against 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.870
 Brazil
