we sterilize the food chain and we

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.090 
we sterilize the food chain and we

theatres we made them so clean we took

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.440 
theatres we made them so clean we took
away<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> beta<00:01:17.130> glucans<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> result<00:01:18.150> we

away the beta glucans and as a result we

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.389 
gains entry into your body the first
thing<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.720> happens<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.500> couple<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
thing that happens is a couple of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.340 
thing that happens is a couple of
chemicals<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> body<00:01:54.149> react<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.049> they

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
chemicals in the body react to it they

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.830 
chemicals in the body react to it they
bind<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.189> they<00:01:56.670> create<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.090> complex<00:01:57.450> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
bind to it and they create a complex and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440 
bind to it and they create a complex and
what<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.170> does<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.770> attracts<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.149> immune

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
what this does is it attracts the immune

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.840 
what this does is it attracts the immune
cells<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> new<00:02:01.350> cells<00:02:01.649> come<00:02:01.920> running<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
cells so the new cells come running this

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.620 
cells so the new cells come running this
is<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> macrophage<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.320> neutrophil<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.630> this

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
is a macrophage or a neutrophil and this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.570 
is a macrophage or a neutrophil and this
is<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:06.899> your<00:02:07.229> immune<00:02:07.530> systems<00:02:07.950> look<00:02:08.369> like

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
is what your immune systems look like

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.850 
is what your immune systems look like
under<00:02:09.000> these<00:02:09.239> conditions<00:02:09.560> they<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.830> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
under these conditions they will do a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.340 
under these conditions they will do a
reasonable<00:02:11.430> job<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:12.060> killing<00:02:12.510> off<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.930> back

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
reasonable job at killing off the back

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.380 
reasonable job at killing off the back

is only one key to the immune system and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.880 
is only one key to the immune system and
you<00:03:06.210> have<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.680> new

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
you have it you have it in this new

you have it you have it in this new
immune<00:03:08.340> product<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.020> effective<00:03:10.550> it

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
to get worse or not that's a moot point

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.339

but this is another animal model where
we<00:05:35.500> were<00:05:35.620> exposing<00:05:36.039> rats<00:05:36.819> to<00:05:37.270> a<00:05:37.300> high<00:05:37.930> dose<00:05:38.199> of

influenza virus and you can see it's a

well we're not saving all of them but

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.570 
well we're not saving all of them but
what<00:05:49.900> that<00:05:50.080> means<00:05:50.139> is<00:05:50.650> if<00:05:51.039> I<00:05:51.220> were<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.430> give

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
what that means is if I were to give

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.490 
what that means is if I were to give
