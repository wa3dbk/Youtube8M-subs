00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.100
I am Ron Lopes Cardozo, 56 years.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.900
My biggest hobby is to join rally's...

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.500
...together with my partner.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.000
We drive a Porsche 911.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Why Porsche?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
After experiences with other cars like...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
...Alfa Romeo,Lancia even Ford
Mustang...

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.500
Several Porsches, Mercedes...

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.000
...and Porsche again.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.500
We always return on the Porsche...

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.000
...during the fact...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
...the porsche is very reliable, robust...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
...and a wonderful drivers-car.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
On the other hand, the car can be a jerk.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you lose attention...

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
...the car punishes immediately.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Every timeyou fight the car...

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.500
...to find the edges...

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.000
...and show who is boss.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.700
I believe, the more you givi it hell...

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.000
... the more the car likes it!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The first time the two of us showed up...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
...without any experience in a rally...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.500
...we had to start in the sportsclass...

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.000
...because we believe the tourclass...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.500
is way below our standard.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.000
After the coffebreak people asked us...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.500
...did you get sign 'A' and stamp '33'?

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.000
We didn't get anything... we passed all...

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.000
...because we really raced through...

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.000
... the small streets and missed...

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.000
...all of the game.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300
After that we searched information...

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.900
...and took some classes,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
...build some experience and...

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.500
...rolled into the world of classic rally's.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.000
We did the SLS...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.500
(Scheveningen-Luxemburg-Scheveningen)

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.500
...Tulpenrally's, Grand Prix and we like it.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.020
It's a nice game.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.300
I am Brigitte Stekelenburg, Ron's partner...

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.000
... for over 16 years now.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.000
For Ron the Porsche is part of his life...

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
...but at first I couldn't appreciate it...

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.000
I didn't see myself riding the Porsche...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
...Ron said:"You must come and see...

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
...an old Porsche 911. After you see it...

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.000
...you don't want anything else!"...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.500
...And he was right.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.500
Ron told the Porsche is the ultimate...

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.000
...drivers-car and I can add to that...

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.000
...the car is also...

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.500
...the ultimate navigators-car.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.000
Rigid. I feel every move...

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.900
...ideal for me as navigator.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.500
We had several cars but...

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.010
that Porsche keeps coming back.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.800
We drive a '73 Porsche 911.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.100
A RSR replica, built on specifications...

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.000
... from '73 - '74 That means:...

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.800
...a extremely stiff chassis...

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.900
...short gears,well-fed engine...

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.270
...sturdy brakes and firm stabilisation.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.200
I own this car for 3.5 years now.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.100
It was built by a Porsche specialist that...

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.800
... also was active in racing.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.700
I'm still working to set my needs and...

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.000
...make the car more perfect than it...

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.200
already is.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.800
The stiffness of the chassis could make...

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.500
...you feel the difference of head or tail...

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.100
...if you run over an Euro.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.000
Normally, I'm a relaxed driver. But...

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.100
...in this car I want to pass everything...

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.000
...I want to eat them all.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.400
It's so easy, so fast. Such a rough beast.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.000
Fabulous!

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.400
My love for Porsche began as a small
boy...

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.900
...next to my dad in the Vauxhall Victor...

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.500
...and saw a Porsche 911 policecar...

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.400
...passing by...

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.700
...2 tough policemen in it with leather hats

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.800
Collecting booklets and magazines.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.600
For millions of kids the Porsche was...

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.800
...the ultimate dream.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.000
The Porsche is such a beautiful car...

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.200
...even after 50 years, everybody...

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.000
...recognises it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Just after years, something happens...

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.800
...giving the opportunity to buy...

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.500
...an old Porsche, fix it and sell
it,making...

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.300
...a small profit and then...

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.200
...repeat it on another one until...

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.900
...it results in the car you see here.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.300
We both are very fanatic during a rally.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:05:00.300
An enourmous drive to win makes us...

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.300
...arguing in the car.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.900
During a rally the windows are almost...

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.000
...popping out!

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.500
This feeds our performance and...

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.400
...strengthens us as a team.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.600
Often, a relationship won't last long, but...

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:23.500
...we are doing this for...

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.200
...almost 16 years now. So we know...

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.400
...our relationship is very OK...

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.300
...and the rallycart has an important role...

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:41.000
...in our lifes.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.500
On this short track we reach about...

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.100
...210 km/h.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.200
You feel the potention of the car.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.900
What can I say more... It's just...

00:05:49.960 --> 00:06:02.700
A horny car!

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.200
You immediately notice the car can be
mean...

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.000
The road is wet, the car can be...

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.000
...an asshole to you

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.000
The sound, the feels...

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.010
Everything is fantastic on this car!

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
