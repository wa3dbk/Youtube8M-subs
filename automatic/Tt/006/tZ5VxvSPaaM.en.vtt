00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and the lip on this one that's where

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.770 
and the lip on this one that's where
your<00:01:04.850> plexiglass<00:01:05.850> lens<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> go

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
your plexiglass lens is going to go

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.370 
your plexiglass lens is going to go
right<00:01:07.049> there<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:09.270> particular<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.320> one

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
right there in particular this one

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.080 
right there in particular this one
actually<00:01:11.040> they've<00:01:11.189> changed<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.729> little<00:01:11.850> bit

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
actually they've changed it a little bit

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.109 
actually they've changed it a little bit
here<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.810> does<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> flat<00:01:13.619> edge<00:01:14.119> so

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
here so it does have the flat edge so

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.820 
here so it does have the flat edge so
you<00:01:15.210> should<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.479> able<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> Plexiglas

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you should be able to see the Plexiglas

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
get access to any portion of it then we

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.289 
get access to any portion of it then we
have<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.509> 45<00:02:00.509> degree<00:02:00.689> angle<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.969> will<00:02:03.119> be

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
have a 45 degree angle so this will be

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.350 
have a 45 degree angle so this will be
inserted<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.939> here<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> piece<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:08.360> 3/4

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.640 
and I will run up the shaft then over
here<00:02:16.270> this<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.540> where<00:02:16.750> your<00:02:16.900> handle<00:02:17.230> comes<00:02:17.440> out

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
here this is where your handle comes out

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.900 
here this is where your handle comes out
so<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.950> make<00:02:18.190> sure<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:18.880> a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
so you make sure you have a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.370 
so you make sure you have a
three-quarter<00:02:19.450> inch<00:02:20.880> slip<00:02:21.880> cap<00:02:22.330> that'll<00:02:23.260> be

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
three-quarter inch slip cap that'll be

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.650 
three-quarter inch slip cap that'll be
for<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.650> end<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:23.950> your<00:02:24.100> handle<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.670> then<00:02:25.540> at

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
for the end of your handle and then at

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.910 
for the end of your handle and then at
the<00:02:25.780> very<00:02:25.810> end<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:27.190> want<00:02:27.310> another<00:02:28.680> 3/4<00:02:29.680> inch

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
the very end you want another 3/4 inch

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.370 
the very end you want another 3/4 inch
adapter<00:02:30.580> slip<00:02:31.209> fitting<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.720> one<00:02:31.750> side<00:02:32.170> that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
adapter slip fitting on one side that

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.500 
adapter slip fitting on one side that
will<00:02:32.500> go<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.890> end<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.130> your<00:02:33.250> pole<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.760> then

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
will go to the end of your pole and then

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.120 
will go to the end of your pole and then
make<00:02:35.020> sure<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.320> have<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.500> three-quarter<00:02:35.980> inch

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
make sure you have a three-quarter inch

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.520 
make sure you have a three-quarter inch
thread<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.700> other<00:02:36.850> side<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:38.140> then<00:02:38.350> your

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
thread the other side and then your

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.970 
thread the other side and then your
final<00:02:38.800> cap<00:02:39.640> is<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.270> 3/4<00:02:41.020> inch<00:02:41.080> threaded<00:02:41.620> cap

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
final cap is the 3/4 inch threaded cap

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.310 
final cap is the 3/4 inch threaded cap
that<00:02:42.790> will<00:02:42.910> thread<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.300> there<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.810> can<00:02:44.110> get

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
that will thread on there so you can get

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.610 
that will thread on there so you can get
access<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.190> then<00:02:46.020> drill<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.050> little<00:02:47.260> hole<00:02:47.410> in

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
access and then drill a little hole in

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.470 
access and then drill a little hole in
the<00:02:47.890> end<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:48.760> enough<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.120> fit<00:02:49.300> whatever

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
the end just enough to fit whatever

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.630 
the end just enough to fit whatever
chord<00:02:49.900> you're<00:02:50.050> going<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.200> use<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:51.130> run<00:02:51.310> to

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
chord you're going to use the to run to

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.640 
chord you're going to use the to run to
your<00:02:51.790> battery<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:54.459> that's<00:02:55.270> about<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
your battery and that's about it the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.320 
your battery and that's about it the
plexiglass<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:58.560> Lexon<00:03:00.030> polycarbonate<00:03:01.030> sheet

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
plexiglass is Lexon polycarbonate sheet

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.729 
plexiglass is Lexon polycarbonate sheet
and<00:03:02.790> that's<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.940> pretty<00:03:04.150> tough<00:03:04.739> plexiglass

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
and that's a pretty tough plexiglass

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.530 
and that's a pretty tough plexiglass
that's<00:03:06.130> about<00:03:06.510> 375<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:08.080> sheet<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.790> 8<00:03:10.060> by<00:03:10.270> 10

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
that's about 375 a sheet it's 8 by 10

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.930 
that's about 375 a sheet it's 8 by 10
sheet<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.350> should<00:03:11.620> give<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.250> more<00:03:12.730> than

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
sheet and that should give you more than

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.310 
sheet and that should give you more than
enough<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.540> mean<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:13.720> should<00:03:13.900> be<00:03:14.019> able<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.170> get

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
enough I mean you should be able to get

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.000 
enough I mean you should be able to get
probably<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:16.330> know<00:03:16.450> seven<00:03:17.350> or<00:03:17.440> eight<00:03:17.530> lenses

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
probably you know seven or eight lenses

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.900 
probably you know seven or eight lenses
out<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:18.940> that's<00:03:19.690> moving<00:03:20.140> enough

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
out of that so that's moving enough

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.240 
out of that so that's moving enough
anyway<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.450> should<00:03:22.720> be<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:25.650> if<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.890> want<00:03:27.100> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
anyway that should be it if you want the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.490 
anyway that should be it if you want the
battery<00:03:27.640> adapter<00:03:27.790> instead<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.870> putting<00:03:29.260> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
battery adapter instead of putting the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.430 
battery adapter instead of putting the
cap<00:03:29.709> on<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.070> end<00:03:30.250> I'll<00:03:30.870> send<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.019> later

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
cap on the end I'll send you that later

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.009 
cap on the end I'll send you that later
and<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.820> can<00:03:33.970> build<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.720> comes

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
and so you can build that and that comes

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.220 
and so you can build that and that comes
will<00:03:35.769> probably<00:03:36.130> it's<00:03:36.280> about<00:03:36.459> another<00:03:36.840> 4<00:03:37.840> or<00:03:37.870> 5

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
will probably it's about another 4 or 5

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.770 
will probably it's about another 4 or 5
inches<00:03:38.500> off<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.950> end<00:03:39.100> of<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:40.239> anyway

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
inches off the end of this so anyway

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.610 
inches off the end of this so anyway
good<00:03:41.079> luck<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.980> I'll<00:03:42.190> talk<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.549> later
