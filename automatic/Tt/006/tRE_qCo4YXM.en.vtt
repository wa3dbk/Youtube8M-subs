I want to make a flat surface to make it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.279 
I want to make a flat surface to make it
easy<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> slice<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.780> cut<00:00:58.050> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
because you can grate them up when

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.410 
because you can grate them up when
you're<00:01:07.979> making<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:08.310> zucchini<00:01:08.880> bread<00:01:09.150> or

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you're making your zucchini bread or

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.350 
you're making your zucchini bread or
muffins<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.159> point<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.119> going

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
muffins now at this point I'm just going

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.719 
muffins now at this point I'm just going
to<00:01:12.420> take<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:13.049> bit<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> slice<00:01:13.920> off<00:01:14.250> this

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
to take a little bit of a slice off this

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.749 
to take a little bit of a slice off this
side<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.900> start<00:01:16.470> slicing<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:17.189> into

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
side and then start slicing them into

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.429 
side and then start slicing them into
about<00:01:18.119> quarter<00:01:18.689> inch<00:01:18.930> wide<00:01:19.640> slabs<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.439> you'll

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
about quarter inch wide slabs so you'll

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
about quarter inch wide slabs so you'll
get<00:01:22.680> several<00:01:23.070> depending<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.790> how<00:01:24.030> large<00:01:24.600> your

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
get several depending on how large your

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.560 
get several depending on how large your
zucchini<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:26.210> there<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.729> then<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.390> can

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
zucchini is there we go and then you can

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.340 
zucchini is there we go and then you can
just<00:01:30.810> flip<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.200> over<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.869> since<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.049> kind<00:01:34.290> of

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
just flip it over and since it's kind of

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
just flip it over and since it's kind of
high<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> divide<00:01:35.250> mine<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.820> chew

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
high I'm going to divide mine and chew

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.010 
high I'm going to divide mine and chew
and<00:01:36.680> then<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.979> slice<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.579> lengthwise<00:01:39.119> into

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and then just slice it lengthwise into

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.319 
and then just slice it lengthwise into
about<00:01:40.229> quarter<00:01:40.680> inch<00:01:40.829> slices<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
about quarter inch slices and then I

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.830 
about quarter inch slices and then I
want<00:01:42.600> them<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:43.140> about<00:01:43.590> two<00:01:44.009> inches<00:01:44.460> long<00:01:44.840> so

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
want them to be about two inches long so

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.530 
want them to be about two inches long so
I<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:47.100> cut<00:01:47.340> both<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.549> these<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.030> half<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
I will cut both of these in half and I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.090 
I will cut both of these in half and I
think<00:01:48.750> they'll<00:01:48.899> probably<00:01:48.930> give<00:01:49.439> me<00:01:49.590> about<00:01:49.829> two

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
think they'll probably give me about two

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.850 
think they'll probably give me about two
inches<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.270> about<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> cup<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.110> flour<00:01:52.229> I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
inches so I have about a cup of flour I

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
inches so I have about a cup of flour I
have<00:01:53.220> two<00:01:53.549> eggs<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.090> I've<00:01:54.240> beaten<00:01:54.540> up<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
have two eggs that I've beaten up and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.620 
have two eggs that I've beaten up and
then<00:01:55.680> some<00:01:56.399> bread<00:01:56.670> crumbs<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.180> use<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
then some bread crumbs I use the
