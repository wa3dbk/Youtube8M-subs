and we made it till you meet a team that
wants<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.780> change<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.980> program<00:00:35.430> -<00:00:36.390> ugh

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.940 

but<00:00:44.420> it<00:00:44.540> was<00:00:44.660> very<00:00:44.840> very<00:00:45.080> difficult<00:00:45.380> for<00:00:45.710> me

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
but it was very very difficult for me

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.820 
but it was very very difficult for me
this<00:00:46.220> year<00:00:46.280> missing<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:47.390> whole<00:00:47.830> basketball

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
this year missing the whole basketball

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.910 
this year missing the whole basketball
season<00:00:49.370> we<00:00:49.910> took<00:00:50.180> her<00:00:50.450> situation<00:00:50.900> and<00:00:51.320> use<00:00:51.710> it

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
season we took her situation and use it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.770 
season we took her situation and use it
as<00:00:52.040> motivation<00:00:52.280> we<00:00:53.120> still<00:00:53.360> got<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.660> keep

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
as motivation we still got to keep

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.570 
as motivation we still got to keep
fighting<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:54.470> think<00:00:54.800> like<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.250> was<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.430> big

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
fighting and I think like that was a big

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.190 
fighting and I think like that was a big
message<00:00:55.820> for<00:00:55.970> all<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:56.360> us<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.690> we<00:00:56.780> brought

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
message for all of us and we brought

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.080 
message for all of us and we brought
that<00:00:57.350> into<00:00:57.559> our<00:00:57.710> season<00:00:57.950> you<00:00:58.460> can't<00:00:58.879> not<00:00:59.059> be

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
that into our season you can't not be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.790 
that into our season you can't not be
inspired<00:00:59.510> by<00:00:59.840> coach<00:01:00.020> I<00:01:00.200> feel<00:01:00.379> like<00:01:00.500> even<00:01:00.680> if

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
inspired by coach I feel like even if

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.080 
inspired by coach I feel like even if
she's<00:01:01.010> not<00:01:01.160> there<00:01:01.430> it's<00:01:01.580> just<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.760> fact<00:01:02.030> that

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
she's not there it's just the fact that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.140

do better we're just gonna move forward
with<00:02:07.900> this<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.289> mean<00:02:08.319> it's<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:08.860> lot<00:02:09.039> but<00:02:09.459> we're

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
with this I mean it's a lot but we're

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.980 
with this I mean it's a lot but we're
gonna<00:02:09.670> learn<00:02:09.910> from<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.330> come<00:02:10.630> back<00:02:10.660> harder

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:25.839 
gonna learn from it and come back harder
next<00:02:11.200> game<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.530> way<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.800> girls<00:02:12.360> amazing

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.789 

I<00:02:25.879> think<00:02:26.599> that<00:02:26.750> was<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.900> turning<00:02:27.319> point<00:02:27.349> and

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
I think that was a turning point and

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.190 
I think that was a turning point and
from<00:02:28.129> then<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.640> mean<00:02:29.299> baby<00:02:29.629> this<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:29.959> going

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
from then I mean baby this is going

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.880 
from then I mean baby this is going
after<00:02:30.530> lack<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.989> seven-game<00:02:32.989> winning

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
after lack that and a seven-game winning

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.170 
after lack that and a seven-game winning
streak<00:02:34.010> for<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.519> Blue<00:02:34.730> Devils

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
streak for the Blue Devils

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.360 
streak for the Blue Devils
in<00:02:35.329> this<00:02:35.569> series<00:02:35.959> without<00:02:36.709> spend<00:02:37.099> all<00:02:37.189> the<00:02:37.280> no

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370
