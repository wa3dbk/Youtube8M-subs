00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
doesn't get worn very often because the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.789 
doesn't get worn very often because the
print<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.720> dramatic<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.409> when<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
print is so dramatic that like when I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
wear a shirt that has any type of print

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.420 
wear a shirt that has any type of print
I<00:01:16.140> feel<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> cover<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.280> up

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
I feel like I have to cover it up

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.070 
I feel like I have to cover it up
because<00:01:17.610> these<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.210> compete<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.900> just

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
because these just compete and it just

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
because these just compete and it just
doesn't<00:01:19.229> work<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.250> well<00:01:20.430> um<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.509> that's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
doesn't work out so well um so that's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120 
doesn't work out so well um so that's
the<00:01:21.810> color<00:01:22.080> war<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.530> said<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.799> would<00:01:22.920> show<00:01:23.100> you

bit late this morning which is very

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.460 
bit late this morning which is very
typical<00:01:35.369> for<00:01:35.850> me<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.659> raining<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.290> so

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
typical for me and it was raining and so

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
typical for me and it was raining and so
I<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:37.890> didn't<00:01:38.100> want<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
I really didn't want to get up so I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.700 
I really didn't want to get up so I
really<00:01:39.509> didn't<00:01:39.689> put<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.930> much<00:01:40.049> makeup<00:01:40.320> I'm

um<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:37.639> it's<00:04:38.210> good<00:04:38.450> for<00:04:38.780> rainy<00:04:38.990> days<00:04:39.139> because

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
um and it's good for rainy days because

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.770 
um and it's good for rainy days because
it<00:04:40.070> has<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.340> dark<00:04:40.610> color<00:04:40.820> which<00:04:41.090> will<00:04:41.270> not<00:04:41.510> show

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
it has a dark color which will not show

through um

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.210 
through um
and<00:04:43.840> then<00:04:44.840> genes<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:45.650> guess<00:04:45.680> aren't<00:04:46.040> really

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
and then genes I guess aren't really

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.340 
and then genes I guess aren't really
good<00:04:46.400> for<00:04:46.430> rainy<00:04:46.730> days<00:04:46.970> but<00:04:47.300> there's<00:04:47.990> nothing
