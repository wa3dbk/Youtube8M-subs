00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
took what i did was i had the icons and

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.489 
took what i did was i had the icons and
gimp<00:03:41.579> i<00:03:41.760> made<00:03:42.060> reflection<00:03:42.689> and<00:03:42.870> then<00:03:42.989> icons<00:03:43.290> go

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:43.499 
gimp i made reflection and then icons go

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:46.009 
gimp i made reflection and then icons go
right<00:03:43.620> here<00:03:43.859> then<00:03:44.519> there's<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:45.329> flash<00:03:45.629> clock

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
right here then there's the flash clock

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.959 
right here then there's the flash clock
and<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.409> see<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.620> all<00:03:47.159> these<00:03:47.459> times<00:03:47.849> are

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:49.969 
and you can see that all these times are

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:55.429 
and you can see that all these times are
correct<00:03:52.969> that's<00:03:53.969> because<00:03:54.359> basically<00:03:54.810> flash

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
correct that's because basically flash

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.770 
correct that's because basically flash
has<00:03:55.769> an<00:03:55.939> ActionScript<00:03:56.939> that<00:03:57.150> gets<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.540> time

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
has an ActionScript that gets the time

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.170 
has an ActionScript that gets the time
from<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.260> operating<00:03:58.980> system<00:03:59.370> which<00:03:59.909> in<00:04:00.060> this

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
from the operating system which in this

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.179 
from the operating system which in this
case<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.689> our<00:04:01.169> phone<00:04:01.469> so<00:04:01.739> flash<00:04:02.010> is

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
case is our phone so flash is

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.979 
case is our phone so flash is
communicating<00:04:02.790> with<00:04:02.879> that<00:04:02.909> phone<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.750> get<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
communicating with that phone to get the

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.330
