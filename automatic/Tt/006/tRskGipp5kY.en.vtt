00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
looking at the small tree thumb screws

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.880 
looking at the small tree thumb screws
for<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.220> GoPro<00:00:05.670> so<00:00:06.660> what<00:00:07.109> these<00:00:07.290> are<00:00:07.589> are

for the GoPro so what these are are

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.390 
for the GoPro so what these are are
really<00:00:08.760> awesome<00:00:09.019> machined<00:00:10.019> aluminum<00:00:10.950> thumb

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
really awesome machined aluminum thumb

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.560 
really awesome machined aluminum thumb
screws<00:00:11.790> which<00:00:12.090> would<00:00:12.240> replace<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:13.590> standard

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
screws which would replace the standard

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.510 
screws which would replace the standard
plastic<00:00:15.570> thumb<00:00:16.049> screws<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:17.039> come<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.369> your

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
plastic thumb screws that come with your

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.689 
plastic thumb screws that come with your
GoPro<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.439> normal<00:00:19.740> GoPro<00:00:20.070> thumb<00:00:20.279> screw<00:00:20.520> is

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
GoPro so the normal GoPro thumb screw is

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.779 
GoPro so the normal GoPro thumb screw is
a<00:00:20.730> plastic<00:00:21.270> handle<00:00:22.199> around<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.920> metal

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
a plastic handle around a metal

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.990 
a plastic handle around a metal
stainless<00:00:24.090> steel<00:00:24.359> bolt<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:25.769> small<00:00:26.460> tree<00:00:26.789> ones

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
stainless steel bolt the small tree ones

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.330 
stainless steel bolt the small tree ones
are<00:00:27.240> at<00:00:27.689> same<00:00:28.080> stainless<00:00:28.590> steel<00:00:28.740> bolt<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
are at same stainless steel bolt and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.720 
are at same stainless steel bolt and
then<00:00:30.210> they're<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> milled<00:00:30.990> aluminum<00:00:31.730> housing

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
then they're a milled aluminum housing

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
then they're a milled aluminum housing
which<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.690> really<00:00:34.050> cool<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.620> just

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
which is really really cool and just

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
which is really really cool and just
looks<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.000> badass<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:37.160> insane<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.600> cool

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
looks so badass it's insane the cool

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.619 
looks so badass it's insane the cool
thing<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.770> come<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
thing with these are they come with a

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.229 
thing with these are they come with a
nut<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.079> you've<00:00:43.230> lost<00:00:43.440> nuts<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.309> bolts<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
nut so if you've lost nuts and bolts you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.729 
nut so if you've lost nuts and bolts you
would<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.600> able<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.840> replace<00:00:46.170> both<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.680> at

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
would be able to replace both of them at

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
would be able to replace both of them at
the<00:00:46.770> same<00:00:46.860> time<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> obvious<00:00:48.450> neat

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the same time and then the obvious neat

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.160 
the same time and then the obvious neat
is<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.190> housing<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.809> designed

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
is that the housing the way is designed

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.290 
is that the housing the way is designed
actually<00:00:52.379> holds<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> boat<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.030> bolt

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
actually holds the boat the bolt

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630 
actually holds the boat the bolt
completely<00:00:54.710> inside<00:00:55.710> me<00:00:55.949> there's<00:00:56.250> no<00:00:56.430> way<00:00:56.610> for

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
completely inside me there's no way for

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.779 
completely inside me there's no way for
that<00:00:56.910> bolt<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.899> pop<00:00:58.379> back<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that bolt to pop back out that was a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.630 
that bolt to pop back out that was a
problem<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.510> some<00:01:00.780> GoPro<00:01:01.199> bolts<00:01:01.559> we'd<00:01:02.370> have

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
problem with some GoPro bolts we'd have

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.759 
problem with some GoPro bolts we'd have
the<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.329> bolt<00:01:03.600> pop<00:01:03.930> actually<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the the bolt pop actually out of the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.190 
the the bolt pop actually out of the
housing<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.330> wouldn't<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.720> able<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
housing and then you wouldn't be able to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
housing and then you wouldn't be able to
push<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.830> bolt<00:01:08.100> through<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.820> you're<00:01:08.909> trying

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
push the bolt through what you're trying

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.130 
push the bolt through what you're trying
to<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.689> wouldn't<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:09.960> able<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to do and you wouldn't be able to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.750 
to do and you wouldn't be able to
tighten<00:01:10.320> anything<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:12.830> these<00:01:13.830> small<00:01:14.610> tree

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
tighten anything up these small tree

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.850 
tighten anything up these small tree
bolts<00:01:15.060> come<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.630> wide<00:01:15.840> range<00:01:15.869> of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
bolts come in a really wide range of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.490 
bolts come in a really wide range of
colors<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> green<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.540> red<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.200> blue

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
want to do that these would be really

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.090 
want to do that these would be really
really<00:01:47.130> cool<00:01:48.049> one<00:01:49.049> last<00:01:49.290> thing<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.680> note<00:01:49.860> is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
really cool one last thing to note is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.330 
really cool one last thing to note is
that<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:51.689> years<00:01:51.930> they've<00:01:52.290> added<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.890> rubber

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that the years they've added a rubber

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.109 
that the years they've added a rubber
grommet<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> inside<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> bolt<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
grommet to the inside of the bolt and I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.609 
grommet to the inside of the bolt and I
think<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.719> they're<00:01:57.840> thinking<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.500> by

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
think what they're thinking is that by

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.950 
think what they're thinking is that by
doing<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.130> they<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.399> reduce<00:01:59.880> vibration<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
doing this they can reduce vibration and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.999 
doing this they can reduce vibration and
also<00:02:02.509> keep<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.750> bolts<00:02:04.049> from<00:02:04.259> loosening<00:02:04.710> but

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
also keep the bolts from loosening but

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.709 
also keep the bolts from loosening but
then<00:02:05.130> also<00:02:05.399> make<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.700> easier<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.090> loosen<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
then also make them easier to loosen and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.469 
then also make them easier to loosen and
not<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.140> them<00:02:07.290> jammed<00:02:07.890> tight<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.300> used

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
not have them jammed tight like we used

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.510 
not have them jammed tight like we used
to<00:02:09.660> when<00:02:09.869> we<00:02:09.899> used<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.530> unscrew<00:02:11.370> them

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
to when we used to have to unscrew them

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.610 
to when we used to have to unscrew them
on<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.390> same<00:02:12.660> note<00:02:12.870> there's<00:02:13.110> no

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
on that same note there's no

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.399 
on that same note there's no
screw<00:02:14.069> port<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.940> back<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.450> bolt<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:16.019> if

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
screw port in the back of the bolt so if

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.710 
screw port in the back of the bolt so if
we<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.459> if<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.790> get<00:02:17.940> them<00:02:18.060> too<00:02:18.269> tight<00:02:18.510> and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
we have to if we get them too tight and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.119 
we have to if we get them too tight and
we<00:02:18.930> aren't<00:02:19.140> able<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.440> undo<00:02:19.650> them<00:02:19.769> by<00:02:19.860> hand

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
we aren't able to undo them by hand

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.350 
we aren't able to undo them by hand
we're<00:02:20.340> going<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.519> be<00:02:20.640> kind<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:20.909> hooped<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.239> how

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
we're going to be kind of hooped in how

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.390 
we're going to be kind of hooped in how
to<00:02:21.420> get<00:02:21.629> pliers<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.200> wrench<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.250> aluminum

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
to get pliers and wrench on the aluminum

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.920 
to get pliers and wrench on the aluminum
but<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.879> would<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.090> okay<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.569> again

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
but that would be okay because again

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.520 
but that would be okay because again
again<00:02:25.200> they<00:02:25.409> are<00:02:25.879> metal<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:28.110> can<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.409> how

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
again they are metal we can see how

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.589 
again they are metal we can see how
these<00:02:28.650> work<00:02:28.830> with<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.159> GoPro<00:02:29.580> they<00:02:30.269> do<00:02:30.329> work

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
these work with the GoPro they do work

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.330 
these work with the GoPro they do work
with<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> camera<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.379> can<00:02:31.470> grab<00:02:31.650> our<00:02:31.769> GoPro<00:02:32.190> and

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
them into your pre-existing mounts and

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.069 
them into your pre-existing mounts and
just<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.150> mount<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.629> installed

just like that the mount is installed
you<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.709> see<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.730> rubber<00:03:00.510> o-ring<00:03:01.049> deform

the mount overall you can see the color

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.920 
the mount overall you can see the color
adds<00:03:14.819> a<00:03:14.879> little<00:03:14.970> bit<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.299> its<00:03:15.510> own<00:03:15.629> flare
