00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
think that that's a fundamental that a

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.810 
think that that's a fundamental that a
lot<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.780> people<00:01:02.160> don't<00:01:03.160> pick<00:01:03.309> up<00:01:03.399> i<00:01:03.579> mean<00:01:03.730> you

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
lot of people don't pick up i mean you

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.100 
lot of people don't pick up i mean you
could<00:01:03.910> be<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.119> greatest<00:01:04.330> strategist<00:01:04.839> in<00:01:05.019> the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
could be the greatest strategist in the

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.219 
could be the greatest strategist in the
world<00:01:05.320> but<00:01:06.070> if<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.310> can<00:01:06.929> maximize<00:01:07.929> the<00:01:08.080> damage

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
world but if you can maximize the damage

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.620 
world but if you can maximize the damage
that<00:01:08.440> you<00:01:08.740> have<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:10.060> know<00:01:10.179> whatever<00:01:10.479> you<00:01:10.509> have

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
that you have you know whatever you have

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.760 
that you have you know whatever you have
a<00:01:10.690> chance<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:10.990> hit<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.229> guy<00:01:11.350> if<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.590> can't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
a chance to hit the guy if you can't

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.990 
a chance to hit the guy if you can't
maximize<00:01:12.100> that<00:01:12.369> then<00:01:12.550> you're<00:01:12.670> never<00:01:12.729> going<00:01:12.940> to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
maximize that then you're never going to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.830 
maximize that then you're never going to
win<00:01:13.149> so<00:01:14.729> luckily<00:01:15.729> for<00:01:16.000> us<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.539> lot<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.690> these

think is the final picture you know
that's<00:04:56.849> learning<00:04:57.849> how<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.410> implement<00:04:59.410> the

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
that's learning how to implement the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.430 
that's learning how to implement the
combos<00:05:00.099> on<00:05:00.220> players<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.849> how<00:05:01.599> to<00:05:01.660> play<00:05:02.020> the

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
combos on players and how to play the

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.379 
combos on players and how to play the
kind<00:05:02.620> of<00:05:02.740> range<00:05:03.009> game<00:05:03.280> in<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.699> the<00:05:04.030> things<00:05:04.300> you

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
kind of range game in and the things you

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.779 
kind of range game in and the things you
do<00:05:04.539> in<00:05:04.569> between<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.289> combos<00:05:05.650> that's<00:05:06.370> pretty

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
do in between the combos that's pretty

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.379 
do in between the combos that's pretty
much<00:05:07.030> going<00:05:07.210> to<00:05:07.270> be<00:05:08.190> what<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.220> tell<00:05:09.610> like<00:05:09.849> the

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
much going to be what I tell like the

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.570
