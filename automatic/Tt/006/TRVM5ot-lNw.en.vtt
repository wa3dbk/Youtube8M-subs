00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.840 

and<00:00:52.749> I've<00:00:52.929> always<00:00:53.140> liked<00:00:53.379> it<00:00:53.499> but<00:00:53.739> so<00:00:54.129> let's

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
start with this one actually this is the

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.740 
start with this one actually this is the
Lada<00:00:57.339> Eclipse<00:00:57.989> HP<00:00:58.989> VCS<00:01:00.479> I<00:01:01.479> bought<00:01:01.929> this<00:01:02.229> in

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
Lada Eclipse HP VCS I bought this in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.160 
Lada Eclipse HP VCS I bought this in
around<00:01:05.520> 2005<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:07.360> think<00:01:08.159> um<00:01:09.689> I'm<00:01:10.689> sorry<00:01:10.869> not

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
around 2005 I think um I'm sorry not

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.940 
around 2005 I think um I'm sorry not
2005<00:01:13.409> 1995

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.550 

yeah<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.399> lot<00:01:18.640> longer<00:01:18.759> ago<00:01:19.289> or<00:01:20.289> at<00:01:20.350> least<00:01:20.500> I

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
yeah a lot longer ago or at least I

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.320 
yeah a lot longer ago or at least I
bought<00:01:20.740> my<00:01:20.860> first<00:01:21.220> one<00:01:21.460> I<00:01:21.490> think<00:01:21.640> this<00:01:21.909> one<00:01:22.119> may

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
bought my first one I think this one may

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.870 
bought my first one I think this one may
have<00:01:22.360> been<00:01:22.600> a<00:01:22.630> replacement<00:01:23.289> because<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.850> I

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
have been a replacement because when I

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.180 
have been a replacement because when I
was<00:01:25.060> working<00:01:25.390> on<00:01:25.479> Starship<00:01:26.049> Troopers<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.590> had

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
was working on Starship Troopers I had

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.510 
was working on Starship Troopers I had
an<00:01:27.460> incident<00:01:27.850> with<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.600> brush<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.289> I<00:01:30.069> had<00:01:30.399> to

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
an incident with the brush and I had to

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.940 
an incident with the brush and I had to
replace<00:01:30.819> it<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:34.289> this<00:01:35.289> was<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.679> replacement

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
replace it so this was the replacement

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.010 
replace it so this was the replacement
so<00:01:36.399> this<00:01:36.520> would<00:01:36.640> have<00:01:36.729> been<00:01:36.789> more<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.179> 97<00:01:37.869> but

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
so this would have been more like 97 but

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.880 
so this would have been more like 97 but
I've<00:01:38.140> had<00:01:38.289> it<00:01:38.409> for<00:01:38.590> years

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
I've had it for years

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.819 
it
and<00:02:28.069> it<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:30.359> I<00:02:31.140> got<00:02:31.439> it<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.680> two<00:02:31.799> reasons

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
and it is I I got it for two reasons

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:39.910 
and it is I I got it for two reasons
first<00:02:32.689> being<00:02:33.689> that<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:35.370> is

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.680 

there<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:40.640> go<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:43.360> 0.3<00:02:44.360> millimeter<00:02:45.340> tip

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
there we go it is a 0.3 millimeter tip

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.760 
there we go it is a 0.3 millimeter tip
so<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.720> wanted<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.110> get<00:02:48.200> something<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.620> was<00:02:48.740> a

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
so I wanted to get something that was a

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.199 
so I wanted to get something that was a
little<00:02:48.890> finer<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.700> that's<00:02:50.140> almost<00:02:51.140> half<00:02:51.500> of

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
little finer and that's almost half of

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.980 
little finer and that's almost half of
the<00:02:53.209> eclipse<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.830> terms<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.550> size<00:02:55.760> plus<00:02:56.570> it<00:02:56.810> it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
the eclipse in terms of size plus it it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.870 
the eclipse in terms of size plus it it
actually<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.410> can<00:02:57.560> get<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.740> you<00:02:58.520> can<00:02:58.670> get<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
actually you can get a you can get the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.920 
actually you can get a you can get the
same<00:02:59.090> size<00:03:00.610> tip<00:03:01.610> for<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.390> Eclipse

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
same size tip for it that the Eclipse

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.150 
same size tip for it that the Eclipse
has<00:03:03.140> which<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.620> 0.5<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.910> liked<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.770> was

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
has which is the 0.5 I liked that it was

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.580 
has which is the 0.5 I liked that it was
it<00:03:07.760> had<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.090> gravity<00:03:08.450> feed<00:03:08.660> instead<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.350> side

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
it had the gravity feed instead of side

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.699 
it had the gravity feed instead of side
feed<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.400> one<00:03:10.580> has<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.930> turns<00:03:12.200> out<00:03:12.440> that

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
feed that this one has it turns out that

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.010 
feed that this one has it turns out that
the<00:03:13.010> gravity<00:03:13.370> feed<00:03:13.520> is<00:03:13.730> much<00:03:14.150> much<00:03:14.480> easier<00:03:14.780> to

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
the gravity feed is much much easier to

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.490 
the gravity feed is much much easier to
clean<00:03:15.230> plus<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.920> has<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:18.230> know<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
clean plus it has you know the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.740 
clean plus it has you know the
replacement<00:03:22.750> cups<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.370> has<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.550> variety<00:03:26.450> of

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
replacement cups so it has a variety of

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.140 
replacement cups so it has a variety of
sizes<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.290> cups<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.610> can<00:03:28.760> even<00:03:28.880> take<00:03:29.030> the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
sizes of cups and you can even take the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.550 
sizes of cups and you can even take the
cup<00:03:29.300> out<00:03:29.450> if<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.780> have<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.110> little<00:03:30.290> bit<00:03:30.440> of

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
cup out if you just have a little bit of

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.160 
cup out if you just have a little bit of
paint<00:03:30.739> that<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.010> want<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.280> use<00:03:31.660> plus<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.810> really

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
paint that you want to use plus I really

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.190 
paint that you want to use plus I really
wanted<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.530> try<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.769> pistol<00:03:34.190> grip<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:38.200> so

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
wanted to try the pistol grip and so

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.790 
wanted to try the pistol grip and so
overall<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.890> was<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:42.140> was<00:03:42.290> kind<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.680> an

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
overall it was it was kind of an

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:50.259 
overall it was it was kind of an
experiment<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:46.280> then<00:03:46.730> we<00:03:46.850> have<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:49.269> custom

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
experiment so then we have the custom

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.550 
experiment so then we have the custom
micron<00:03:50.690> be<00:03:51.070> so<00:03:52.070> this<00:03:52.459> one<00:03:52.730> is<00:03:53.090> really<00:03:53.560> this

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
micron be so this one is really this

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.300 
micron be so this one is really this
line<00:03:54.860> anyway<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:56.060> best<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:56.750> owada

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
line anyway is the best of the owada

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.430 
line anyway is the best of the owada
what<00:03:58.310> owada<00:03:58.610> has<00:03:58.850> to<00:03:59.030> offer<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.630> i've<00:04:00.230> heard

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
what owada has to offer and i've heard

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.020 
what owada has to offer and i've heard
great<00:04:00.620> things<00:04:00.709> about<00:04:01.040> them<00:04:01.370> for<00:04:01.670> many<00:04:01.970> many

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
great things about them for many many

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.880 
great things about them for many many
years<00:04:02.420> now<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:04.340> one<00:04:04.549> has<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:05.150> point<00:04:05.870> one<00:04:06.680> eight

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
years now this one has a point one eight

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.680 
years now this one has a point one eight
millimeter<00:04:07.959> tip

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
millimeter tip

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.780 
millimeter tip
that<00:04:10.690> means<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:11.230> this<00:04:11.380> is<00:04:11.620> good<00:04:11.860> for<00:04:11.890> nothing

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
that means that this is good for nothing

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.560 
that means that this is good for nothing
but<00:04:12.819> very<00:04:13.240> fine<00:04:13.599> work<00:04:13.870> but<00:04:14.230> guess<00:04:14.530> what<00:04:15.570> you're

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
but very fine work but guess what you're

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.539 
but very fine work but guess what you're
painting<00:04:16.900> minis<00:04:17.169> you're<00:04:17.650> doing<00:04:17.919> nothing<00:04:18.310> but

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
painting minis you're doing nothing but

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:26.159 
painting minis you're doing nothing but
very<00:04:18.790> fine<00:04:19.180> work<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:23.320> yeah<00:04:23.500> that's<00:04:23.860> um<00:04:25.169> so

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
very fine work so so yeah that's um so

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.790 
very fine work so so yeah that's um so
if<00:04:26.500> you're<00:04:26.650> gonna<00:04:26.740> be<00:04:26.919> doing<00:04:28.560> miniature<00:04:29.560> work

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
if you're gonna be doing miniature work

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.190 
if you're gonna be doing miniature work
you<00:04:30.040> really<00:04:30.190> want<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.910> get<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.150> brush<00:04:31.510> that<00:04:31.960> is

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
you really want to get a brush that is

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.240 
you really want to get a brush that is
as<00:04:32.530> focused<00:04:33.010> on<00:04:33.190> doing<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.700> as<00:04:34.000> possible<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
as focused on doing that as possible and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.050 
as focused on doing that as possible and
this<00:04:36.250> would<00:04:36.730> be<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.090> one<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.930> get<00:04:38.169> so<00:04:38.970> let<00:04:39.970> me

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
this would be the one to get so let me

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.550 
this would be the one to get so let me
try<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.210> go<00:04:40.780> back<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.960> little<00:04:41.230> bit<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:41.440> talk

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
try to go back a little bit and talk

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.430 
try to go back a little bit and talk
about<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.800> Gregg's<00:04:44.639> although<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:46.030> do<00:04:46.930> like<00:04:47.260> the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
about the Gregg's although I do like the

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.670 
about the Gregg's although I do like the
pistol<00:04:47.770> grip<00:04:47.979> and<00:04:48.389> I've<00:04:49.389> been<00:04:49.600> spending<00:04:50.530> some

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
pistol grip and I've been spending some

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.969 
pistol grip and I've been spending some
time<00:04:50.740> getting<00:04:51.160> used<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.729> it<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:53.320> is<00:04:53.530> taking

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
time getting used to it it it is taking

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.830 
time getting used to it it it is taking
time<00:04:54.190> to<00:04:54.400> get<00:04:54.520> used<00:04:54.729> to<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:58.270> turns<00:04:58.600> out

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
time to get used to it and it turns out

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.370 
time to get used to it and it turns out
that<00:04:59.880> aiming<00:05:00.880> this<00:05:01.600> way<00:05:03.270> seems<00:05:04.270> less<00:05:04.660> natural

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
that aiming this way seems less natural

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.560 
that aiming this way seems less natural
than<00:05:05.410> aiming<00:05:06.340> this<00:05:06.520> way<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.030> maybe<00:05:07.360> again

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
than aiming this way and maybe again

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.190 
than aiming this way and maybe again
that<00:05:08.080> is<00:05:08.200> because<00:05:09.300> I'm<00:05:10.300> so<00:05:10.720> used<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:11.020> doing

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
that is because I'm so used to doing

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.900 
that is because I'm so used to doing
this<00:05:11.410> already<00:05:11.620> but<00:05:11.950> for<00:05:12.010> some<00:05:12.280> reason<00:05:12.669> I<00:05:12.850> know

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
this already but for some reason I know

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.170 
this already but for some reason I know
where<00:05:13.870> I'm<00:05:14.020> going<00:05:14.610> when<00:05:15.610> I'm<00:05:15.729> pointing<00:05:16.090> an

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
where I'm going when I'm pointing an

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.630 
where I'm going when I'm pointing an
airbrush<00:05:16.660> like<00:05:16.900> this<00:05:17.289> but<00:05:18.190> when<00:05:18.340> I'm<00:05:18.430> like

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
airbrush like this but when I'm like

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.210 
airbrush like this but when I'm like
this<00:05:18.910> I<00:05:19.210> still<00:05:19.510> feel<00:05:19.780> like<00:05:19.810> I'm<00:05:20.680> not<00:05:20.890> entirely

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
this I still feel like I'm not entirely

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.040 
this I still feel like I'm not entirely
sure<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.789> I<00:05:21.820> pretty<00:05:22.090> much<00:05:22.180> have<00:05:22.539> to<00:05:22.570> do<00:05:22.900> it

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
sure and I pretty much have to do it

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.469 
sure and I pretty much have to do it
with<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.470> index<00:05:23.830> finger<00:05:23.919> out<00:05:24.340> which<00:05:24.610> we're

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
with the index finger out which we're

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.550 
with the index finger out which we're
pulling<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.810> trigger<00:05:26.080> feels<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.470> little

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
pulling the trigger feels a little

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.930 
pulling the trigger feels a little
unnatural

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.730 

but<00:05:31.940> may<00:05:32.780> you<00:05:33.020> know<00:05:33.140> it<00:05:33.320> could<00:05:33.470> just<00:05:33.500> be

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
but may you know it could just be

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.650 
but may you know it could just be
because<00:05:33.890> I've<00:05:34.190> been<00:05:34.370> using<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:35.150> other<00:05:35.330> style

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
because I've been using the other style

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.080 
because I've been using the other style
of<00:05:35.870> airbrush<00:05:36.290> for<00:05:36.530> years<00:05:38.200> so<00:05:39.200> anyway<00:05:39.590> I<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:40.460> have

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
of airbrush for years so anyway I I have

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.290 
of airbrush for years so anyway I I have
actually<00:05:41.450> been<00:05:41.570> using<00:05:41.750> this<00:05:41.990> for<00:05:42.170> a<00:05:42.230> bit

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
actually been using this for a bit

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.800 
actually been using this for a bit
mostly<00:05:44.300> working<00:05:44.480> on<00:05:44.720> these<00:05:44.840> terminators<00:05:45.470> and

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
mostly working on these terminators and

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.910 
mostly working on these terminators and
really<00:05:47.810> just<00:05:47.930> getting<00:05:48.170> used<00:05:48.410> to<00:05:48.530> it<00:05:48.710> so<00:05:48.860> I

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
really just getting used to it so I

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.480 
really just getting used to it so I
can't<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:49.520> don't<00:05:49.610> have<00:05:49.970> a<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:51.340> don't<00:05:52.340> have<00:05:52.460> a

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
can't I don't have a I don't have a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.760 
can't I don't have a I don't have a
definitive<00:05:52.820> review<00:05:53.510> on<00:05:53.870> its<00:05:54.470> performance

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
definitive review on its performance

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.110 
definitive review on its performance
overall<00:05:55.550> but<00:05:56.060> I<00:05:56.150> can<00:05:56.330> tell<00:05:56.540> you<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:58.090> there<00:05:59.090> is

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
overall but I can tell you that there is

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.800 
overall but I can tell you that there is
a<00:05:59.270> real<00:05:59.660> difference<00:06:00.200> between<00:06:00.380> how<00:06:01.660> any<00:06:02.660> of

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
a real difference between how any of

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.280 
a real difference between how any of
this<00:06:04.090> spray<00:06:05.090> is<00:06:05.240> compared<00:06:05.720> to<00:06:05.840> either<00:06:05.990> of

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
this spray is compared to either of

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.900 
this spray is compared to either of
these<00:06:06.470> and<00:06:06.860> it<00:06:06.950> could<00:06:07.130> just<00:06:07.340> be<00:06:07.430> because<00:06:07.460> it's

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
these and it could just be because it's

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.630 
these and it could just be because it's
so<00:06:08.120> fine<00:06:10.810> but<00:06:11.810> you<00:06:12.560> do<00:06:12.710> really<00:06:13.100> feel<00:06:13.310> like<00:06:13.340> you

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
so fine but you do really feel like you

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.820 
so fine but you do really feel like you
have<00:06:13.820> a<00:06:13.850> lot<00:06:14.120> more<00:06:14.150> control<00:06:14.810> and<00:06:15.140> that<00:06:15.380> you're

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
have a lot more control and that you're

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.600 
have a lot more control and that you're
not<00:06:16.040> having<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:16.910> constantly<00:06:17.450> worry<00:06:17.960> about

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
not having to constantly worry about

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.890 
not having to constantly worry about
spitting<00:06:19.610> too<00:06:19.880> much<00:06:20.060> paint<00:06:20.390> out<00:06:20.540> which<00:06:20.750> is

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
spitting too much paint out which is

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.320 
spitting too much paint out which is
definitely<00:06:21.470> the<00:06:21.620> case<00:06:21.770> with<00:06:21.830> this<00:06:22.250> and<00:06:22.610> still

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
definitely the case with this and still

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.940 
definitely the case with this and still
the<00:06:23.510> case<00:06:23.690> with<00:06:24.020> this<00:06:24.230> though<00:06:24.470> not<00:06:24.650> as<00:06:24.800> much

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
the case with this though not as much

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.150 
the case with this though not as much
obviously<00:06:25.400> because<00:06:25.610> it's<00:06:25.760> smaller<00:06:27.010> but<00:06:28.010> with

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
obviously because it's smaller but with

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.640 
obviously because it's smaller but with
this<00:06:28.400> the<00:06:28.730> the<00:06:29.120> feeling<00:06:29.540> of<00:06:29.600> control<00:06:30.050> is<00:06:30.320> kind

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
this the the feeling of control is kind

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.240 
this the the feeling of control is kind
of<00:06:30.710> amazing<00:06:31.010> and<00:06:31.490> so<00:06:32.230> I've<00:06:33.230> been<00:06:33.320> excited<00:06:33.800> to

of amazing and so I've been excited to
to<00:06:35.180> play<00:06:35.390> with<00:06:35.570> it<00:06:35.690> and<00:06:35.750> I'm<00:06:35.840> gonna<00:06:35.990> use<00:06:36.170> it

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
to play with it and I'm gonna use it

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.970 
to play with it and I'm gonna use it
again<00:06:37.210> some<00:06:38.210> more<00:06:38.240> today<00:06:38.750> I<00:06:38.780> notice<00:06:39.680> I<00:06:39.770> still

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
have some some areas that still need

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.470 
have some some areas that still need
some<00:06:43.040> highlighting<00:06:43.610> on<00:06:43.850> a<00:06:43.910> couple<00:06:44.270> of<00:06:44.360> these

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480
