piece of information about groundwater

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.210 
piece of information about groundwater
specifically<00:00:21.840> groundwater<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.800> coming

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
specifically groundwater that is coming

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.620 
specifically groundwater that is coming
up<00:00:23.539> from<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.600> ground<00:00:25.310> out<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.340> nowhere<00:00:26.640> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
up from the ground out of nowhere this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.810 
up from the ground out of nowhere this
is<00:00:27.779> typically<00:00:28.019> called<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.380> spring<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.699> you

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
is typically called a spring and as you

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
is typically called a spring and as you
can<00:00:29.939> see<00:00:30.150> that's<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.529> hillside

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
can see that's this is just a hillside

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.889 
can see that's this is just a hillside
great<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.610> there's<00:00:32.880> no<00:00:33.000> source<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.780> anything

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
great and there's no source or anything

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.639 
great and there's no source or anything
like<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.040 

we've<00:00:40.649> got<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:41.040> water<00:00:41.309> source<00:00:41.719> if<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.930> see

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
we've got a water source if you can see

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.350 
we've got a water source if you can see
that<00:00:43.230> down<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:44.789> coming<00:00:45.239> up

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that down there that is just coming up

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.740 
that down there that is just coming up
out<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> ground<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:48.420> reason<00:00:48.660> I'm

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
out of the ground and the reason I'm

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060 
out of the ground and the reason I'm
pointing<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:48.989> out<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.200> because<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.770> water

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
pointing this out is because this water

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.880 
pointing this out is because this water
is<00:00:50.850> fresh<00:00:51.809> water<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.410> drink

you don't have to purify or filter

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.119 
you don't have to purify or filter
spring<00:00:57.629> water<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.469> coming<00:00:58.739> up<00:00:58.859> from<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
spring water that is coming up from the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
spring water that is coming up from the
ground<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.940> ground<00:01:00.180> does<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.809> you
