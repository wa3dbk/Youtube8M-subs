rounded<00:02:30.030> corners<00:02:30.390> they're<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:30.810> slightly

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
rounded corners they're just slightly

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.410

rounded<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:31.920> see<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.280> right<00:02:32.430> there<00:02:32.460> it's

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
rounded you see that right there it's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.330 
rounded you see that right there it's
not<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.690> any<00:02:33.870> ships<00:02:34.110> really<00:02:34.380> gonna<00:02:34.530> like

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
not like any ships really gonna like

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.320 
not like any ships really gonna like
that's<00:02:35.550> gonna<00:02:35.670> make<00:02:35.850> much<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.210> difference

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that's gonna make much of a difference

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.640 
that's gonna make much of a difference
and<00:02:36.660> they<00:02:36.720> said<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:37.020> aren't<00:02:37.200> legal<00:02:37.500> for

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.020 
and they said they aren't legal for
coming<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:37.980> place<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.490> guess<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.790> can<00:02:38.910> have

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
coming in place so I guess you can have

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.570 
coming in place so I guess you can have
rounded<00:02:39.450> corners<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.990> I've<00:02:40.170> never<00:02:40.400> seen<00:02:41.400> any

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
rounded corners now I've never seen any

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.350 
rounded corners now I've never seen any
play<00:02:41.790> meant<00:02:42.000> with<00:02:42.090> rounded<00:02:42.420> corners<00:02:42.980> before

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
play meant with rounded corners before

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.970 
play meant with rounded corners before
because<00:02:45.360> when<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.810> mean<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.500> don't<00:02:46.860> know

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980

when<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.060> set<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.239> up<00:02:54.390> with<00:02:54.510> some<00:02:54.660> ships<00:02:54.930> and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
when I set it up with some ships and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.100 
when I set it up with some ships and
then<00:02:55.200> we'll<00:02:55.290> see<00:02:55.440> how<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> looks<00:02:55.860> all<00:02:56.520> right<00:02:56.580> so

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
then we'll see how it looks all right so

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.570 
then we'll see how it looks all right so
I've<00:02:58.110> got<00:02:58.230> some<00:02:58.380> ships<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.770> here<00:02:58.890> now<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:02.489> know

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
I've got some ships on here now you know

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.280 
I've got some ships on here now you know
it's<00:03:02.700> got<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> little<00:03:03.209> bit<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.480> push<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.170> like

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
it's got a little bit of push to it like

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.220 
it's got a little bit of push to it like
you<00:03:04.410> would<00:03:04.470> expect<00:03:04.590> from<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.160> neoprene<00:03:05.640> Matt

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
you would expect from a neoprene Matt

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.560 
you would expect from a neoprene Matt
seems<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.560> it's<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.459> little<00:03:08.670> smooth<00:03:09.120> though<00:03:09.510> so

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
seems to it's a little smooth though so

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.550 
seems to it's a little smooth though so
it's<00:03:09.780> not<00:03:09.870> as<00:03:10.050> it's<00:03:10.380> not<00:03:10.530> as<00:03:10.650> grippy<00:03:11.540> as<00:03:12.560> you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
it's not as it's not as grippy as you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.100 
it's not as it's not as grippy as you
know<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.739> might<00:03:14.040> want<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.730> be<00:03:14.880> mmm<00:03:15.630> but<00:03:16.080> I

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
know you might want it to be mmm but I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.720 
know you might want it to be mmm but I
don't<00:03:16.350> think<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.590> makes<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:16.920> any<00:03:17.010> worse<00:03:17.400> than

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
don't think it makes it any worse than

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.090 
don't think it makes it any worse than
you<00:03:18.570> know<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.720> vinyl<00:03:19.019> mat<00:03:21.350> but<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.650> don't<00:03:22.980> know<00:03:23.040> it

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
you know a vinyl mat but I don't know it

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.380 
you know a vinyl mat but I don't know it
could<00:03:23.220> be<00:03:23.340> wrong<00:03:23.519> so<00:03:23.790> didn't<00:03:24.090> people<00:03:24.209> have

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
could be wrong so didn't people have

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.509 
could be wrong so didn't people have
different<00:03:24.660> preferences<00:03:24.870> I've<00:03:25.290> heard<00:03:25.530> it's

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
different preferences I've heard it's

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.610 
different preferences I've heard it's
very<00:03:26.850> easy<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.720> forgive<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.290> get<00:03:28.380> used<00:03:28.530> to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
very easy I forgive to get used to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.770 
very easy I forgive to get used to
pushing<00:03:28.769> down<00:03:29.160> with<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:30.180> because<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.540> so

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
pushing down with it because it is so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.979 
pushing down with it because it is so
smooth<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.430> know<00:03:32.970> things<00:03:33.239> can<00:03:33.420> smoke

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
smooth that you know things can smoke

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:44.240 
smooth that you know things can smoke
you<00:03:34.290> know

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.430 

they<00:03:45.250> were<00:03:46.000> nice<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.480> don't<00:03:46.690> know<00:03:46.780> enough<00:03:47.290> is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
they were nice I don't know enough is

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.360 
they were nice I don't know enough is
really<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:47.770> much<00:03:47.980> difference<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:50.500> definitely

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
really a much difference it definitely

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.710 
really a much difference it definitely
cushions<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.790> sound<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:52.390> if<00:03:52.450> you're<00:03:52.540> playing

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
cushions the sound so if you're playing

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.360 
cushions the sound so if you're playing
indoors<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.860> you<00:03:53.920> don't<00:03:54.070> want<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.280> wake

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
indoors and you don't want to wake

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.070 
indoors and you don't want to wake
people<00:03:54.520> up<00:03:54.790> though<00:03:55.120> that's<00:03:55.420> definitely<00:03:55.870> good

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
people up though that's definitely good

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.320 
people up though that's definitely good
but<00:03:56.740> a<00:03:56.770> lot<00:03:56.980> of<00:03:57.130> maps<00:03:57.340> do<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.880> or<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> lot<00:03:58.300> of

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
but a lot of maps do that or a lot of

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.970 
but a lot of maps do that or a lot of
mats<00:03:58.570> rather<00:03:58.870> will<00:03:59.080> do<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.470> but<00:03:59.680> this<00:03:59.770> is

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
mats rather will do that but this is

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.400 
mats rather will do that but this is
definitely<00:04:00.130> better<00:04:00.460> than<00:04:00.550> final<00:04:01.000> for<00:04:01.210> rolling

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.390 

you<00:04:08.410> know<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:08.650> know<00:04:08.740> you<00:04:08.890> can<00:04:09.010> push<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.250> little

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
you know you know you can push a little

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.890 
you know you know you can push a little
bit<00:04:09.640> down<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> lot<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.450> times<00:04:10.600> when<00:04:10.810> I'm

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
bit down like a lot of times when I'm

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.310 
bit down like a lot of times when I'm
moving<00:04:11.140> I'll<00:04:11.620> hold<00:04:11.920> down<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.900> know<00:04:13.990> push<00:04:14.170> my

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
moving I'll hold down you know push my

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.009 
moving I'll hold down you know push my
finger<00:04:14.590> down<00:04:14.740> into<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.670> then<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:16.930> know

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
finger down into it and then you know

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.630 
finger down into it and then you know
help<00:04:17.230> keep<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.530> in<00:04:17.620> place<00:04:17.830> and<00:04:18.100> that's<00:04:18.400> good

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
help keep it in place and that's good

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.340 
help keep it in place and that's good
because<00:04:18.730> it<00:04:18.880> sinks<00:04:19.269> in<00:04:19.450> just<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.989> little<00:04:20.019> bit

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
because it sinks in just a little bit

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.070 
because it sinks in just a little bit
not<00:04:20.769> much<00:04:20.830> but<00:04:21.310> just<00:04:21.370> enough<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:22.720> keep<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:22.990> in

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
not much but just enough to keep it in

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.850 
not much but just enough to keep it in
place<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.750> there's<00:04:25.930> that<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:26.380> can't<00:04:26.740> get

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
place so so there's that I can't get

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.950 
place so so there's that I can't get
over<00:04:26.920> how<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.880> really<00:04:28.090> looks<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.540> don't<00:04:28.570> know<00:04:28.780> if

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
over how it really looks I don't know if

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.510 
over how it really looks I don't know if
the<00:04:29.110> cameras<00:04:29.470> really<00:04:29.590> picking<00:04:30.040> it<00:04:30.130> up<00:04:30.250> that

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
the cameras really picking it up that

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.370 
the cameras really picking it up that
low<00:04:30.930> it's<00:04:31.930> got<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.080> really<00:04:32.470> nice<00:04:32.770> shine<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.190> it

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
low it's got a really nice shine to it

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.360 
low it's got a really nice shine to it
and<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.470> course<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:35.710> get<00:04:35.830> ripples<00:04:36.070> through

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
and of course you get ripples through

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
and of course you get ripples through
space<00:04:37.920> that's<00:04:38.920> such<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.280> terrible<00:04:39.820> idea<00:04:39.940> what

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
space that's such a terrible idea what

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:49.100 
space that's such a terrible idea what
did<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.630> do<00:04:40.690> that

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:57.900 

so<00:04:53.580> yeah<00:04:54.580> so<00:04:54.790> basically<00:04:56.700> see<00:04:57.700> if<00:04:57.790> you're

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
so yeah so basically see if you're

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.310 
so yeah so basically see if you're
pushing<00:04:58.180> this<00:04:58.270> in<00:04:58.419> here<00:04:58.570> can<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.990> can<00:04:59.110> slide

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
pushing this in here can it can slide

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.990 
pushing this in here can it can slide
pretty<00:04:59.620> easily<00:04:59.890> so<00:05:00.160> it's<00:05:00.430> pretty<00:05:00.640> easy<00:05:00.760> to

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
pretty easily so it's pretty easy to

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.750 
pretty easily so it's pretty easy to
bump<00:05:03.600> just<00:05:04.600> it's<00:05:05.230> not<00:05:05.440> really<00:05:05.860> it's<00:05:06.370> more<00:05:06.550> for

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
bump just it's not really it's more for

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.450 
bump just it's not really it's more for
decoration<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.480> think<00:05:07.840> then<00:05:08.380> or<00:05:09.130> holding<00:05:09.400> your

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
decoration I think then or holding your

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.790 
decoration I think then or holding your
stuff<00:05:09.790> in<00:05:10.240> place<00:05:10.570> but<00:05:11.410> here<00:05:11.590> I'm<00:05:11.650> going<00:05:11.740> to

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800

that<00:05:13.210> it's<00:05:13.720> an<00:05:13.810> idea<00:05:14.080> I've<00:05:14.200> had<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:14.650> haven't

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
that it's an idea I've had and I haven't

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.630 
that it's an idea I've had and I haven't
tested<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.280> yet

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
tested it yet

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.050 
tested it yet
I'm<00:05:16.210> looking<00:05:16.480> to<00:05:16.660> test<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.130> that<00:05:18.490> is<00:05:18.730> the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
I'm looking to test it and that is the

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.680 
I'm looking to test it and that is the
idea<00:05:19.419> of<00:05:19.510> just<00:05:20.760> tossing<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:22.000> thing<00:05:22.180> completely

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
idea of just tossing a thing completely

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.740 
idea of just tossing a thing completely
upside<00:05:22.990> down<00:05:23.910> and<00:05:24.910> now<00:05:24.970> you've<00:05:25.180> got<00:05:25.330> the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
upside down and now you've got the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.070 
upside down and now you've got the
grippy<00:05:26.110> now<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.380> problem<00:05:26.770> is<00:05:26.940> this<00:05:27.940> whole<00:05:28.300> mat

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
grippy now the problem is this whole mat

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.710 
grippy now the problem is this whole mat
can<00:05:29.500> move<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:30.580> have<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:30.760> be<00:05:30.850> careful<00:05:31.570> with

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
can move so you have to be careful with

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.250 
can move so you have to be careful with
it<00:05:31.870> but<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.940> advantage<00:05:34.450> so<00:05:35.490> now<00:05:37.020> your<00:05:38.020> ships

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
it but the advantage so now your ships

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.780 
it but the advantage so now your ships
aren't<00:05:38.560> going<00:05:38.919> anywhere<00:05:39.340> I<00:05:40.030> can't<00:05:40.960> move<00:05:41.260> that

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
aren't going anywhere I can't move that

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.070 
aren't going anywhere I can't move that
and<00:05:42.790> I<00:05:42.880> cannot<00:05:43.330> slide<00:05:43.690> it

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
and I cannot slide it

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.750 
and I cannot slide it
I<00:05:44.110> can't<00:05:44.680> slide<00:05:45.010> it<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:45.250> all<00:05:45.370> has<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.700> be

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
I can't slide it it all has to be

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.750 
I can't slide it it all has to be
actually<00:05:46.030> picked<00:05:46.390> up<00:05:46.540> and<00:05:46.750> placed<00:05:46.960> back<00:05:47.290> down

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
actually picked up and placed back down

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.250 
actually picked up and placed back down
so<00:05:48.760> this<00:05:49.210> is<00:05:49.450> definitely<00:05:49.690> an<00:05:50.020> option<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:51.340> know

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
so this is definitely an option you know

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.840 
so this is definitely an option you know
watch<00:05:53.260> this<00:05:53.470> watch<00:05:53.800> this<00:05:53.860> too<00:05:54.250> forward<00:05:54.520> I

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
really go well I guess they can but they

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
my crafting and everything so so this

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.950 
my crafting and everything so so this
mat<00:06:55.010> works<00:06:55.520> really<00:06:55.820> nice<00:06:56.060> upside<00:06:56.510> down<00:06:56.690> but

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
mat works really nice upside down but

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.510 
mat works really nice upside down but
then<00:06:57.080> of<00:06:57.229> course<00:06:57.260> you<00:06:57.470> lose<00:06:57.740> yourself<00:06:57.889> the

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
then of course you lose yourself the

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.969 
then of course you lose yourself the
beauty<00:06:59.150> of<00:06:59.330> the<00:06:59.540> arch<00:06:59.750> of<00:07:00.050> the<00:07:00.229> other<00:07:00.410> side<00:07:00.710> so

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
beauty of the arch of the other side so

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.640 
beauty of the arch of the other side so
I<00:07:01.010> think<00:07:01.340> most<00:07:01.580> of<00:07:01.760> the<00:07:01.880> time<00:07:02.120> I<00:07:02.650> will

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
I think most of the time I will

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.930 
I think most of the time I will
definitely<00:07:03.950> plan<00:07:04.550> to<00:07:04.880> play<00:07:05.360> it<00:07:06.430> gorgeous<00:07:07.430> side
