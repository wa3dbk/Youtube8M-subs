00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
but keep in mind the liquid ratio will

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.030 
but keep in mind the liquid ratio will
be<00:02:54.790> off<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:56.019> you're<00:02:56.140> going<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.320> want<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.560> add<00:02:56.739> a

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
either by rolling them out and cutting

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.050 
either by rolling them out and cutting
them<00:05:08.800> or<00:05:09.800> what<00:05:10.009> I<00:05:10.039> like<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.370> do<00:05:10.490> is<00:05:10.610> just<00:05:10.669> take

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
them or what I like to do is just take

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.680 
them or what I like to do is just take
them<00:05:11.319> and<00:05:12.319> place<00:05:12.590> them<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.190> then<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.360> tops

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
them and place them and then the tops

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.939 
them and place them and then the tops
are<00:05:15.169> more<00:05:16.300> textured<00:05:17.300> so<00:05:17.659> they<00:05:17.810> get<00:05:17.990> browned

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
are more textured so they get browned

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.879 
are more textured so they get browned
differently<00:05:19.729> you'll<00:05:20.180> have<00:05:20.330> little<00:05:20.889> crispy

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.510 
differently you'll have little crispy
bits<00:05:22.159> and<00:05:23.020> softer<00:05:24.020> bits<00:05:24.259> and<00:05:24.860> that's<00:05:25.340> how<00:05:25.490> I

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
bits and softer bits and that's how I

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.830 
bits and softer bits and that's how I
like<00:05:25.729> to<00:05:25.849> do<00:05:25.970> it<00:05:26.289> you<00:05:27.289> can<00:05:27.590> also<00:05:27.800> take<00:05:28.310> your
