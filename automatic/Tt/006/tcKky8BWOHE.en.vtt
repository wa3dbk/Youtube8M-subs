there there's a boat over there so the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.140 
there there's a boat over there so the
boat<00:00:30.660> drifted<00:00:30.869> back<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> little<00:00:31.529> bit

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:44.420 

right<00:00:36.720> now<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.930> bow<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.320> controlling<00:00:37.980> itself

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.440 

jet<00:00:44.970> drives<00:00:45.240> are<00:00:45.420> running<00:00:46.220> look<00:00:47.220> ma<00:00:47.490> no<00:00:47.700> hands

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
jet drives are running look ma no hands

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.380 
jet drives are running look ma no hands
the<00:00:48.960> bow<00:00:49.110> thruster<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.680> run<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.130> needed

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
the bow thruster will run as needed

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:12.700 
the bow thruster will run as needed
so<00:00:52.990> the<00:00:53.110> boats<00:00:53.290> creeping<00:00:53.740> back<00:00:53.860> forward

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.880 

it's<00:01:13.160> about<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.400> minute<00:01:13.640> in

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
it's about a minute in

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.370 
it's about a minute in
we're<00:01:16.460> drifting<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:17.030> little<00:01:17.060> bit<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.570> port<00:01:17.900> so

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
we're drifting a little bit to port so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.550 
we're drifting a little bit to port so
now<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.590> bow<00:01:18.830> thruster

variable-speed bow thruster proportional

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.940 
variable-speed bow thruster proportional
we'll<00:01:24.060> start<00:01:24.299> kicking<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.350> bring<00:01:25.530> us<00:01:25.649> back

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
we'll start kicking in to bring us back

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.929 
we'll start kicking in to bring us back
starboard<00:01:27.020> again<00:01:28.020> no<00:01:28.469> one<00:01:28.590> at<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> helm<00:01:29.039> this

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
is all jet stick to hopper lock

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640 
is all jet stick to hopper lock
while<00:01:35.240> thrusters<00:01:35.690> coming<00:01:35.990> on<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.320> can<00:01:36.470> hear

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
while thrusters coming on you can hear

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.929 
while thrusters coming on you can hear
it

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 

and<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.299> boat<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.659> slowly<00:01:42.899> moving<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.469> starboard

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and a boat is slowly moving to starboard

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.300 
and a boat is slowly moving to starboard
back<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.729> our<00:01:44.880> location<00:01:45.560> where<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.680> set<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
back to our location where we set the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.490 
back to our location where we set the
GPS<00:01:47.490> lock

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
GPS lock

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
GPS lock
we've<00:01:49.500> moved<00:01:49.740> about<00:01:50.130> 10<00:01:50.189> feet<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:51.149> about<00:01:51.360> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
we've moved about 10 feet it's about it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.039 
we've moved about 10 feet it's about it
now<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.899> heading<00:01:52.140> back<00:01:53.570> heading<00:01:54.570> back<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
now it's heading back heading back to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.899 
now it's heading back heading back to
starboard

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.770 

so<00:02:01.540> we're<00:02:01.750> about<00:02:01.899> two<00:02:02.140> minutes<00:02:02.469> in<00:02:02.619> now<00:02:03.780> we've

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
so we're about two minutes in now we've

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.589 
so we're about two minutes in now we've
stayed<00:02:05.079> within<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:06.060> 10<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.119> 15-foot<00:02:07.619> circle<00:02:08.619> or

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.440 

and<00:02:13.230> how<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:13.829> try<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> stay<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.999> the<00:02:15.239> same

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and how we try to stay with the same

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.670 
and how we try to stay with the same
direction

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
direction

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.770 
direction
yeah<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.099> heading<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.549> always<00:02:17.849> on<00:02:18.180> heading

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
yeah the heading is always on heading

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.030 
yeah the heading is always on heading
lock<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.139> always<00:02:19.409> on<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.739> we're<00:02:19.859> always

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
lock is always on so we're always

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.789 
lock is always on so we're always
pointing<00:02:20.609> this<00:02:20.730> direction<00:02:21.260> with<00:02:22.260> jet<00:02:22.560> stick

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
pointing this direction with jet stick

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.590 
pointing this direction with jet stick
too

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.990 

but<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.350> hover<00:02:26.530> lock<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:27.130> actually<00:02:27.580> zeroed<00:02:27.880> in

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
but the hover lock is actually zeroed in

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.480 
but the hover lock is actually zeroed in
on<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.180> GPS<00:02:28.600> location<00:02:29.050> which<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:30.190> about

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
on a GPS location which is just about

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.840 
on a GPS location which is just about
over<00:02:31.180> here<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.260> we're<00:02:33.160> just<00:02:33.190> about<00:02:33.460> back

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
over here and we're just about back

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.500 
over here and we're just about back
there

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.350 

it's<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.989> little<00:02:41.290> bit<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.500> wind<00:02:41.650> today<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:43.120> much

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
it's a little bit of wind today not much

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.460 
it's a little bit of wind today not much
a<00:02:43.420> little<00:02:43.660> bit<00:02:43.900> pushing<00:02:44.410> us<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.970> support

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
a little bit pushing us to support

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.410 
a little bit pushing us to support
the<00:02:47.890> bow<00:02:48.040> thruster<00:02:48.490> you<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:48.730> barely<00:02:49.180> hear

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the bow thruster you can barely hear

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.660 
the bow thruster you can barely hear
because<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.050> proportional<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:51.220> it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
because it is proportional and it

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.010 
because it is proportional and it
doesn't<00:02:51.970> need<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> lot<00:02:52.150> about<00:02:52.480> thruster<00:02:52.900> in

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
doesn't need a lot about thruster in

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.660 
doesn't need a lot about thruster in
this<00:02:53.170> situation

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
this situation

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.820 
this situation
we<00:02:56.180> had<00:02:56.300> now<00:02:56.450> three<00:02:56.840> minutes<00:02:57.020> sitting<00:02:57.500> here

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
we had now three minutes sitting here

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.370 
we had now three minutes sitting here
and<00:02:58.660> we're<00:02:59.660> pretty<00:02:59.810> much<00:02:59.990> in<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.200> same

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
and we're pretty much in the same

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:08.130 
and we're pretty much in the same
location<00:03:00.830> we<00:03:00.890> started
