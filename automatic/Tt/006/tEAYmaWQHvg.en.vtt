here with a feature for one of the first
to<00:00:08.040> conversion<00:00:08.639> maps<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:09.000> we've<00:00:09.179> created<00:00:09.420> if

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
to conversion maps that we've created if

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.870 
to conversion maps that we've created if
you<00:00:10.620> missed<00:00:10.860> out<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.370> conversion

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
you missed out on the conversion

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.879 
you missed out on the conversion

what<00:00:19.350> conversion<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.070> video<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.460> going

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
what conversion is this video is going

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.000 
what conversion is this video is going
to<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.939> lot<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.300> gibberish<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.529> this

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
to be a lot of gibberish to you but this

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
to be a lot of gibberish to you but this
map<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.310> designed<00:00:23.850> strictly<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.330> conversion

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
map is designed strictly for conversion

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.050 
map is designed strictly for conversion
this<00:00:25.080> was<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> first<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.130> made<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.880> we

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
this was the first one we made so we

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.330 
this was the first one we made so we
were<00:00:27.180> actually<00:00:27.619> simultaneously<00:00:28.619> designing

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
were actually simultaneously designing

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.939 
were actually simultaneously designing
the<00:00:29.460> map<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.449> game<00:00:30.660> mode<00:00:31.140> around<00:00:31.769> each

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the map and the game mode around each

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.010 
the map and the game mode around each
other<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:33.059> got<00:00:33.239> pretty<00:00:33.510> crazy<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.989> first

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
other which got pretty crazy at first

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.950 
other which got pretty crazy at first
but<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.040> map<00:00:35.190> actually<00:00:35.399> plays<00:00:35.730> really<00:00:36.270> really

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
but the map actually plays really really

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.709 
but the map actually plays really really
well<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.700> after<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.910> know<00:00:39.000> five<00:00:39.239> months<00:00:39.600> of

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
well now after you know five months of

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.180 
well now after you know five months of
testing<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.170> made<00:00:40.350> tons<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.950> tons<00:00:41.040> of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
testing we made tons and tons of

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.280 
testing we made tons and tons of
revisions<00:00:41.640> through<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> testing<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.020> plays

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
revisions through the testing I plays

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.830 
revisions through the testing I plays
great<00:00:43.559> now<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:43.980> uh<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.660> an

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
great now but uh you know it's it's an

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.150 
great now but uh you know it's it's an
excellent<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:49.160> demonstration

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
excellent you know just a demonstration

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.299 
excellent you know just a demonstration
of<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.289> what<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.070> done<00:00:53.250> with

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
of you know what can be done with

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.549 
of you know what can be done with
conversion<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:55.020> bit<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
conversion it's a little bit on the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.799 
conversion it's a little bit on the
simpler<00:00:56.039> side<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> things<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> works

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
simpler side of things but it works

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.310 
simpler side of things but it works
really<00:00:57.930> nice<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:59.520> i<00:00:59.550> am<00:00:59.699> in<00:01:00.109> offense<00:01:01.109> on

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
really nice so here i am in offense on

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.100 
really nice so here i am in offense on
phase<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.309> i'm<00:01:03.210> actually<00:01:03.449> pushing<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.019> on

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
phase one and i'm actually pushing up on

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
phase one and i'm actually pushing up on
this<00:01:04.260> waterfall<00:01:04.890> building<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.820> these

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
this waterfall building here and these

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
this waterfall building here and these
buildings<00:01:07.140> these<00:01:07.590> structures<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.159> extremely

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
buildings these structures are extremely

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.370 
buildings these structures are extremely
important<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:09.900> defined

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
important you know really defined

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.010 
important you know really defined
neutral<00:01:10.890> grounds<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:12.020> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
neutral grounds like this one to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.770 
neutral grounds like this one to
actually<00:01:13.619> act<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.729> focal<00:01:15.150> points<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> left

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
actually act as focal points on the left

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960 
actually act as focal points on the left
because<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> single<00:01:17.400> static

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
because you know with a single static

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.090 
because you know with a single static
objective<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> need<00:01:18.869> need<00:01:19.530> more<00:01:19.799> than<00:01:19.830> just

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
objective you need need more than just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.880 
objective you need need more than just
the<00:01:20.670> objective<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.780> focus<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.290> because<00:01:22.500> if

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the objective to focus on because if

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.080 
the objective to focus on because if
that's<00:01:23.189> all<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:23.970> no

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that's all there was there to be no

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.490 
that's all there was there to be no
strategy<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.020> kind<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
strategy and it would be kind of a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.609 
strategy and it would be kind of a
Buster<00:01:26.430> clucks<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.990> here<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.200> moving<00:01:28.350> into

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
Buster clucks so here we are moving into

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.140 
Buster clucks so here we are moving into
Phase<00:01:28.950> two<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:29.880> kind<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
Phase two and I know it's going kind of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
Phase two and I know it's going kind of
fast<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> full<00:01:31.350> round<00:01:31.560> of

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
fast we actually have a full round of

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.560 
fast we actually have a full round of
firebase<00:01:32.369> game<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.850> help<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> channel

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
firebase game for help on the channel

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.899 
firebase game for help on the channel
open<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.619> other<00:01:34.740> day<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.520> while<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.850> guys

open up the other day so while you guys
check<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.869> out<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:38.159> the

check that out if you want to see the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670 
check that out if you want to see the
gameplay<00:01:38.759> more<00:01:38.970> naturally<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:40.020> more<00:01:40.320> detail

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
gameplay more naturally in more detail

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
gameplay more naturally in more detail
but<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.579> are<00:01:41.610> pushing<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.150> into<00:01:42.270> Phase

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
but here we are pushing up into Phase

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
but here we are pushing up into Phase
two<00:01:42.570> um<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.590> know<00:01:43.680> after<00:01:43.829> phase<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.340> of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
two um you know after phase one of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.160 
two um you know after phase one of
course<00:01:44.670> some<00:01:44.850> weapons<00:01:45.180> become<00:01:45.479> available<00:01:45.750> so

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
course some weapons become available so

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.630 
course some weapons become available so
for<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.470> attackers<00:01:46.920> you're<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
for the attackers you're going to get a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.620 
for the attackers you're going to get a
sticky<00:01:48.479> detonator<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.890> soft<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
sticky detonator and a soft on and the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.040 
sticky detonator and a soft on and the
defenders<00:01:52.079> are<00:01:52.170> actually<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.799> get

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
defenders are actually going to get

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.290 
defenders are actually going to get
and<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.320> sticky<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.190> saw<00:01:54.550> also<00:01:55.060> and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
and you sticky that and a saw also and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.930 
and you sticky that and a saw also and
after<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.870> phase<00:01:56.350> one<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:56.710> here<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.910> know

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
after a phase one on here and you know

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.130 
after a phase one on here and you know
the<00:01:58.150> sticky<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.540> can<00:01:58.690> be<00:01:58.810> pretty<00:01:58.990> effective

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
the sticky that can be pretty effective

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.830 
the sticky that can be pretty effective
at<00:01:59.650> you<00:02:00.520> know<00:02:00.610> planting<00:02:01.120> it<00:02:01.240> near<00:02:01.630> the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
at you know planting it near the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.590 
at you know planting it near the
objective<00:02:02.850> which<00:02:03.850> can<00:02:04.090> be<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.240> bit<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.480> a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
objective which can be a bit of a

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.330 
objective which can be a bit of a
douchebag<00:02:04.810> strategy<00:02:05.560> at<00:02:05.650> times<00:02:05.890> but<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.220> can

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
douchebag strategy at times but it can

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.250 
douchebag strategy at times but it can
also<00:02:06.400> be<00:02:06.550> pretty<00:02:06.850> effective<00:02:06.940> on<00:02:07.390> also<00:02:08.200> you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
also be pretty effective on also you

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.750 
also be pretty effective on also you
know<00:02:08.470> your<00:02:08.680> personal<00:02:09.010> ordinance<00:02:09.400> is<00:02:09.490> going<00:02:09.700> to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
know your personal ordinance is going to

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.820 
know your personal ordinance is going to
be<00:02:09.820> great<00:02:10.060> for<00:02:10.360> resupplies<00:02:10.930> and<00:02:11.350> conversion

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
be great for resupplies and conversion

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.700 
be great for resupplies and conversion
if<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.010> guys<00:02:12.160> haven't<00:02:12.370> played<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.790> yet<00:02:12.820> but

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
if you guys haven't played it yet but

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.900 
if you guys haven't played it yet but
anyways<00:02:14.710> something<00:02:15.370> that's<00:02:15.550> kind<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.760> cool

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
anyways something that's kind of cool

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.970 
anyways something that's kind of cool
about<00:02:16.150> phase<00:02:16.420> 2<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.870> here<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.380> way<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.590> can

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
about phase 2 on here is the way you can

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.280 
about phase 2 on here is the way you can
plant<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.400> objective<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.090> actually

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
plant the objective you can actually

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.810 
plant the objective you can actually
choose<00:02:20.290> exactly<00:02:20.620> where<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.310> plant<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.700> know

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
choose exactly where to plant you know

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.810 
choose exactly where to plant you know
it<00:02:22.060> within<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.480> certain<00:02:22.950> defined<00:02:23.950> area<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.790> you

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
it within a certain defined area so you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.940 
it within a certain defined area so you
can<00:02:25.180> actually<00:02:25.300> point<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.780> behind<00:02:26.140> some

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
can actually point it behind some

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.400 
can actually point it behind some
pillars<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.360> platform<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:28.990> it's<00:02:29.110> really

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
pillars on the platform and it's really

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.600 
pillars on the platform and it's really
effective<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:29.980> then<00:02:30.070> when<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.340> get<00:02:30.460> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
effective and then when you get the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.420 
effective and then when you get the
rocket<00:02:30.820> hog<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.390> like<00:02:31.600> we<00:02:31.780> have<00:02:31.930> now<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:33.310> know

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
rocket hog up like we have now you know

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.980 
rocket hog up like we have now you know
you<00:02:33.490> can<00:02:33.700> really<00:02:33.850> rain<00:02:34.120> death<00:02:34.360> down<00:02:34.600> with<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
you can really rain death down with the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.350 
you can really rain death down with the
rocket<00:02:35.320> on<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.940> something<00:02:36.940> that's<00:02:37.090> kind<00:02:37.330> of

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
rocket on so something that's kind of

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.660 
rocket on so something that's kind of
cool<00:02:37.540> about<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.200> rocket<00:02:38.740> holic<00:02:39.100> on<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.460> map

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
cool about the rocket holic on this map

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.180 
cool about the rocket holic on this map
is<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.200> kind<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.470> want<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.740> use<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.040> as

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
is that you kind of want to use it as

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.320 
is that you kind of want to use it as
more<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:43.410> mobile<00:02:44.410> turret<00:02:45.040> than<00:02:45.340> as<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.760> fast

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
more of a mobile turret than as a fast

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.120 
more of a mobile turret than as a fast
attack<00:02:46.540> vehicle<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.380> used<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.740> be<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.860> chain

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
attack vehicle so it used to be a chain

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.340 
attack vehicle so it used to be a chain
polymer<00:02:48.520> actually<00:02:48.840> swapped<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.990> out<00:02:50.080> for<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
polymer actually swapped it out for the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.320 
polymer actually swapped it out for the
rocket<00:02:50.650> hog<00:02:50.770> for<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.100> few<00:02:51.280> reasons<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:52.150> up

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
rocket hog for a few reasons but up

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.180 
rocket hog for a few reasons but up
you'll<00:02:53.200> see<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.530> minute<00:02:53.620> we're<00:02:53.890> coming

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
you'll see in a minute we're coming

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.950 
you'll see in a minute we're coming
going<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.430> drive<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.910> rocket<00:02:55.000> hook<00:02:55.330> up<00:02:55.540> onto

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
going to drive the rocket hook up onto

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.500 
going to drive the rocket hook up onto
this<00:02:56.080> Ridge<00:02:56.470> here<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:58.000> know<00:02:58.120> while<00:02:58.330> we're

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
this Ridge here and you know while we're

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.270 
this Ridge here and you know while we're
kind<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.780> trapped<00:02:59.110> there<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.739> know<00:02:59.860> it's

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
kind of trapped there you know it's

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.100 
kind of trapped there you know it's
definitely<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.790> risky<00:03:01.150> position<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.750> take<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
definitely a risky position to take the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.199 
definitely a risky position to take the
vehicle<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.040> can<00:03:03.220> be<00:03:03.370> very<00:03:03.400> effective<00:03:03.790> you

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
vehicle but it can be very effective you

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.560 
vehicle but it can be very effective you
can<00:03:04.360> get<00:03:04.570> your<00:03:05.200> gunner<00:03:06.030> great<00:03:07.030> line<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.360> sight

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
can get your gunner great line of sight

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.690 
can get your gunner great line of sight
on<00:03:07.780> parts<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.320> objective<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.459> can't

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
on parts of the objective but you can't

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.340 
on parts of the objective but you can't
really<00:03:09.820> see<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.270> approaches<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.750> well<00:03:11.140> and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
really see the approaches to well and

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.170 
really see the approaches to well and
it's<00:03:11.500> definitely<00:03:11.950> very<00:03:12.070> limited<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:12.730> it's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
it's definitely very limited and it's

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.930 
it's definitely very limited and it's
very<00:03:13.480> very<00:03:14.050> easy<00:03:14.170> for<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.830> other<00:03:15.370> team<00:03:15.670> to

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
very very easy for the other team to

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.330 
very very easy for the other team to
push<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.720> hog<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.080> take<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.380> out<00:03:17.440> while<00:03:18.310> it's

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
push the hog and take it out while it's

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.520 
push the hog and take it out while it's
up<00:03:18.640> here<00:03:18.790> but<00:03:18.940> it's<00:03:19.060> it's<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.630> know<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> great

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
up here but it's it's you know a great

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.229 
up here but it's it's you know a great
example<00:03:20.830> of<00:03:21.040> risk<00:03:21.250> versus<00:03:21.550> reward<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.940> can<00:03:22.120> be

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
example of risk versus reward it can be

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.199 
example of risk versus reward it can be
a<00:03:22.270> very<00:03:22.540> effective<00:03:22.660> position<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.650> hold<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.940> it

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
a very effective position to hold and it

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.760 
a very effective position to hold and it
also<00:03:25.510> outside<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.200> holic<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.470> know<00:03:26.560> that's

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
also outside of a holic you know that's

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.800 
also outside of a holic you know that's
there's<00:03:26.980> another<00:03:27.160> great<00:03:27.940> position<00:03:28.330> holds<00:03:28.600> but

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
there's another great position holds but

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.170 
there's another great position holds but
here<00:03:29.050> we<00:03:29.140> are<00:03:29.170> moving<00:03:29.380> on<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.770> phase<00:03:29.950> 3<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.640> the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
here we are moving on to phase 3 and the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.270 
here we are moving on to phase 3 and the
phase<00:03:31.330> 3<00:03:31.720> our<00:03:31.930> Charlie<00:03:32.440> building<00:03:32.890> on<00:03:33.010> this<00:03:33.130> map

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
phase 3 our Charlie building on this map

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.250 
phase 3 our Charlie building on this map
is<00:03:33.310> really<00:03:33.730> cool<00:03:33.910> hope<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.690> rebuilt<00:03:35.080> it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
is really cool hope you rebuilt it

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.890 
is really cool hope you rebuilt it
multiple<00:03:35.980> times<00:03:36.120> during<00:03:37.120> testing<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.840> we

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
multiple times during testing and we

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.240 
multiple times during testing and we
finally<00:03:38.290> arrived<00:03:38.530> at<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:38.770> building<00:03:39.130> we're

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
finally arrived at this building we're

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.460 
finally arrived at this building we're
really<00:03:39.459> happy<00:03:39.730> with<00:03:39.940> how<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.209> plays<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:41.320> cool

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
really happy with how it plays the cool

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.660 
really happy with how it plays the cool
thing<00:03:41.500> about<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.980> building<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.550> it's

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
thing about the building is that it's

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.440 
thing about the building is that it's
got<00:03:42.850> this<00:03:42.970> kind<00:03:43.239> of<00:03:43.440> front<00:03:44.550> upper<00:03:45.550> floor<00:03:46.209> and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
got this kind of front upper floor and

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.090 
got this kind of front upper floor and
that<00:03:47.020> upper<00:03:47.290> floor<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.590> going<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.770> be<00:03:47.830> really

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
that upper floor is going to be really

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.860 
that upper floor is going to be really
important<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.610> hold<00:03:48.730> for<00:03:49.000> either<00:03:49.269> teams<00:03:49.600> can

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
important to hold for either teams can

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.500 
important to hold for either teams can
be<00:03:49.989> really<00:03:50.230> contested<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.730> from<00:03:52.269> that<00:03:52.450> you

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
be really contested and from that you

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.140 
be really contested and from that you
can<00:03:52.720> control<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.910> approaches<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.060> the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
can control the approaches to the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.780 
can control the approaches to the
objective

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
objective

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.580 
objective
you<00:03:55.849> can't<00:03:56.060> actually<00:03:56.299> get<00:03:56.840> one<00:03:57.019> it's<00:03:57.200> like<00:03:57.260> on

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
you can't actually get one it's like on

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.069 
you can't actually get one it's like on
the<00:03:57.769> objective<00:03:58.280> at<00:03:58.519> all<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.750> know<00:03:59.959> it's

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
the objective at all so you know it's

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.440 
the objective at all so you know it's
kind<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.290> an<00:04:00.409> interesting<00:04:00.469> dynamic<00:04:01.209> it's<00:04:02.209> it's

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
kind of an interesting dynamic it's it's

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.360 
kind of an interesting dynamic it's it's
you<00:04:02.599> know<00:04:02.719> highly<00:04:03.019> contested<00:04:03.319> but<00:04:03.620> it's<00:04:04.069> very

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
you know highly contested but it's very

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.640 
you know highly contested but it's very
the<00:04:05.060> sight<00:04:05.269> lines<00:04:05.299> from<00:04:05.780> it<00:04:05.989> are<00:04:06.109> very

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
the sight lines from it are very

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.929 
the sight lines from it are very
controlled<00:04:07.069> as<00:04:07.219> you<00:04:07.310> can<00:04:07.459> kind<00:04:07.640> of<00:04:07.700> see<00:04:07.760> you

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
controlled as you can kind of see you

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.250 
controlled as you can kind of see you
know<00:04:08.120> we<00:04:08.390> can't<00:04:08.599> really<00:04:08.780> see<00:04:08.959> out<00:04:09.109> the<00:04:09.230> back

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
know we can't really see out the back

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.190 
know we can't really see out the back
doors<00:04:09.620> very<00:04:09.769> far<00:04:10.329> and<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.599> know<00:04:11.689> that<00:04:11.900> sort<00:04:12.109> of

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
doors very far and you know that sort of

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.649 
doors very far and you know that sort of
thing<00:04:12.260> but<00:04:12.500> it<00:04:12.920> works<00:04:13.129> really<00:04:13.310> well<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.730> again

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
thing but it works really well and again

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.180 
thing but it works really well and again
you<00:04:14.900> can<00:04:14.930> choose<00:04:15.349> where<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.650> plant<00:04:16.039> that

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
you can choose where you plant that

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.310 
you can choose where you plant that
extraction<00:04:16.820> beacon<00:04:17.329> so<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:18.019> know<00:04:18.109> if<00:04:18.199> you

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
extraction beacon so you know if you

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.289 
extraction beacon so you know if you
plant<00:04:18.560> it<00:04:18.709> in<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.829> right<00:04:19.009> place<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:20.150> can

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
plant it in the right place you can

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.210 
plant it in the right place you can
actually<00:04:20.419> see<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.959> if<00:04:21.169> you're<00:04:21.350> holding<00:04:21.680> from

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
actually see it if you're holding from

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.189 
actually see it if you're holding from
on<00:04:22.340> topic<00:04:22.669> you're<00:04:22.820> here<00:04:23.240> i<00:04:23.270> am<00:04:23.419> on<00:04:23.570> defense

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
on topic you're here i am on defense

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.230 
on topic you're here i am on defense
you'll<00:04:24.860> notice<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.250> defenders<00:04:25.669> coming<00:04:26.150> out

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
you'll notice the defenders coming out

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.420 
you'll notice the defenders coming out
of<00:04:26.270> their<00:04:26.479> spawns<00:04:26.810> which<00:04:27.139> the<00:04:27.530> swans<00:04:27.770> are<00:04:27.889> very

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
of their spawns which the swans are very

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.550 
of their spawns which the swans are very
safe<00:04:28.789> on<00:04:29.030> here<00:04:29.270> but<00:04:29.479> coming<00:04:30.229> out<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.440> the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
safe on here but coming out of the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.990 
safe on here but coming out of the
response<00:04:31.099> that<00:04:31.190> kind<00:04:31.400> of<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.699> little

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
response that kind of this little

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.120 
response that kind of this little
platform<00:04:32.240> which<00:04:32.750> not<00:04:33.169> only<00:04:33.199> blocks<00:04:33.710> line<00:04:34.009> of

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
platform which not only blocks line of

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.129 
platform which not only blocks line of
sight<00:04:34.310> into<00:04:34.520> their<00:04:34.759> spawn<00:04:35.030> but<00:04:35.690> also<00:04:35.810> gives

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
sight into their spawn but also gives

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.659 
sight into their spawn but also gives
them<00:04:36.259> a<00:04:36.349> little<00:04:36.440> position<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.099> push<00:04:37.340> up<00:04:37.520> on

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
them a little position to push up on

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.189 
them a little position to push up on
before<00:04:38.210> pushing<00:04:38.750> into<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.949> Charlie<00:04:40.820> potent

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
before pushing into that Charlie potent

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.390 
before pushing into that Charlie potent
so<00:04:42.199> that's<00:04:42.349> just<00:04:42.470> another<00:04:42.650> interesting

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
so that's just another interesting

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.620 
so that's just another interesting
dynamic<00:04:43.789> and<00:04:43.940> from<00:04:44.090> here<00:04:44.180> they<00:04:44.360> can<00:04:44.509> go

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
dynamic and from here they can go

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.210 
dynamic and from here they can go
straight<00:04:44.900> into<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.139> Charlie<00:04:45.530> building<00:04:45.830> or

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
straight into the Charlie building or

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.339 
straight into the Charlie building or
they<00:04:46.550> can<00:04:46.699> go<00:04:46.820> over<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.599> the<00:04:47.690> left<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.139> hold

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
they can go over to the left and hold

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.810 
they can go over to the left and hold
this<00:04:48.500> position<00:04:48.740> up<00:04:49.160> here<00:04:49.370> which<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.669> of<00:04:49.789> course

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
this position up here which is of course

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.580 
this position up here which is of course
connected<00:04:50.479> to<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.840> Charlie<00:04:51.139> building<00:04:51.440> by<00:04:51.560> a

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
connected to the Charlie building by a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.350 
connected to the Charlie building by a
bridge<00:04:51.889> or<00:04:52.130> they<00:04:52.580> can<00:04:52.729> go<00:04:52.759> to<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.060> right<00:04:53.210> and

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
bridge or they can go to the right and

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.610 
bridge or they can go to the right and
go<00:04:53.479> through<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.810> cave<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.320> there's<00:04:54.470> always
