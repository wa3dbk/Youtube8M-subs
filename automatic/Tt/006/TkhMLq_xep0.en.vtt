00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
to Bank them I think maybe or maybe

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.300 
to Bank them I think maybe or maybe
that's<00:03:40.080> just<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.470> that's<00:03:40.620> just<00:03:40.770> for<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:40.950> races

so<00:03:41.340> as<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.610> racer<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.090> have<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.510> decide<00:03:42.750> whether

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
so as a racer you have to decide whether

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.690 
so as a racer you have to decide whether
to<00:03:42.989> keep<00:03:43.080> on<00:03:43.350> earning<00:03:43.380> these<00:03:44.010> points<00:03:44.400> or<00:03:44.520> head
