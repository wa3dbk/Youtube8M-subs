know<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.929> think<00:01:49.469> all<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> handguns<00:01:50.189> when<00:01:50.700> it's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
know I think all the handguns when it's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.989 
know I think all the handguns when it's
a<00:01:50.909> Kimbo<00:01:51.270> are<00:01:51.689> very<00:01:52.170> very<00:01:53.159> similar<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.819> like

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
a Kimbo are very very similar but like

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:56.660 
a Kimbo are very very similar but like
you<00:01:54.210> know<00:01:54.299> m9a<00:01:55.139> kimbos<00:01:55.770> are<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.399> accurate

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you know m9a kimbos are very accurate

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.569 
you know m9a kimbos are very accurate
with<00:01:57.389> steady<00:01:57.630> aim<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.560> i<00:01:58.590> know<00:01:58.859> thats<00:01:59.249> equals

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
with steady aim but i know thats equals

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.550 
with steady aim but i know thats equals
to<00:01:59.700> go<00:01:59.850> some<00:02:00.030> records<00:02:00.389> which<00:02:00.659> even<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to go some records which even with a

which<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.270> usually<00:02:12.420> use<00:02:12.810> for<00:02:13.080> my<00:02:13.200> episode<00:02:13.380> for

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
which I usually use for my episode for

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.520 
which I usually use for my episode for
40-plus<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.459> like<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.090> know<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.209> think<00:02:15.440> 357<00:02:16.440> is

running<00:02:35.519> around<00:02:35.760> quick<00:02:36.209> scoping<00:02:36.659> is<00:02:36.900> um<00:02:37.379> I

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
running around quick scoping is um I

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.070 
running around quick scoping is um I
don't<00:02:38.310> know<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.909> think<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.750> doesn't<00:02:39.930> require

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
don't know I think it doesn't require

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.410 
don't know I think it doesn't require
that<00:02:40.319> much<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> skill<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.069> like<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.730> you're

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
that much of a skill but like if you're

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.059 
that much of a skill but like if you're
able<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.900> get<00:02:43.049> those<00:02:43.140> crosshairs<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:43.769> between

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
able to get those crosshairs in between

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.670 
able to get those crosshairs in between
the<00:02:44.190> bio<00:02:44.459> center<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.299> their<00:02:45.540> body<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.989> think

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the bio center of their body I think

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.080 
the bio center of their body I think
it'll<00:02:46.890> be<00:02:47.069> easy<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.220> quickscope<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.879> I'm

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
it'll be easy to quickscope like I'm

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.940 
it'll be easy to quickscope like I'm
feeling<00:02:48.239> kind<00:02:48.569> of<00:02:48.599> here<00:02:48.780> no<00:02:49.019> doing<00:02:49.500> long-range

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
feeling kind of here no doing long-range

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.920 
feeling kind of here no doing long-range
quick<00:02:50.190> scopes<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.730> think<00:02:50.940> mainly<00:02:51.420> lot<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.870> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
quick scopes I think mainly lot of the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.559 
quick scopes I think mainly lot of the
skills<00:02:52.200> but<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.860> think<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.000> possible

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
skills but like I think it is possible

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.649 
skills but like I think it is possible
we<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.650> right<00:02:55.769> time<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.220> know<00:02:56.450> if<00:02:57.450> they

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
we have the right time you know if they

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.300 
we have the right time you know if they
camping<00:02:58.079> in<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.260> long<00:02:58.440> range<00:02:58.650> distance<00:02:58.860> then

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
camping in the long range distance then

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.680 
camping in the long range distance then
it's<00:02:59.430> easy<00:02:59.579> for<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.879> to<00:03:00.000> get<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> quick<00:03:00.420> school

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it's easy for you to get a quick school

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.819 
it's easy for you to get a quick school

but while they move in little quick

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.220 
but while they move in little quick
scoping<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.489> long-range<00:03:03.299> distant<00:03:03.840> i<00:03:03.959> think

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
scoping the long-range distant i think

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.890

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:47.719 
quick scope in yo long-range shots I
prefer<00:05:46.469> hardscoping<00:05:47.039> a<00:05:47.129> quick<00:05:47.279> scoping<00:05:47.550> that

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
prefer hardscoping a quick scoping that

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.600 
prefer hardscoping a quick scoping that
I've<00:05:47.849> don't<00:05:48.240> waste<00:05:48.930> my<00:05:49.080> time<00:05:49.250> going<00:05:50.250> for<00:05:50.490> those

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
I've don't waste my time going for those

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.749 
I've don't waste my time going for those
crazy<00:05:50.909> long<00:05:51.240> range<00:05:51.479> quick<00:05:51.870> scopes<00:05:52.259> which

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
crazy long range quick scopes which

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.159 
crazy long range quick scopes which
personally<00:05:53.759> I<00:05:53.909> think<00:05:53.969> is<00:05:54.449> locked<00:05:54.750> more<00:05:55.050> than

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
personally I think is locked more than

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.439 
personally I think is locked more than
skill<00:05:55.439> you<00:05:56.310> guys<00:05:56.490> might<00:05:56.729> disagree<00:05:57.060> with<00:05:57.360> it

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
skill you guys might disagree with it

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.100 
skill you guys might disagree with it
but<00:05:58.080> um<00:05:58.909> figure<00:05:59.909> quickscoping<00:06:00.689> long-range

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
but um figure quickscoping long-range

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.980 
but um figure quickscoping long-range
more<00:06:01.500> small<00:06:02.189> like<00:06:02.339> no<00:06:02.550> scoping<00:06:03.029> but<00:06:03.689> I<00:06:03.719> could

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
more small like no scoping but I could

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.010 
more small like no scoping but I could
easier<00:06:04.409> I<00:06:04.620> don't<00:06:05.129> know<00:06:05.189> maybe<00:06:05.819> we<00:06:06.629> get<00:06:06.899> those

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
easier I don't know maybe we get those

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.439 
easier I don't know maybe we get those
crosshairs<00:06:07.349> in<00:06:07.919> between<00:06:08.460> those<00:06:08.639> body<00:06:08.879> in

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
crosshairs in between those body in

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.269 
crosshairs in between those body in
between<00:06:09.899> the<00:06:09.990> opponent's<00:06:10.439> body<00:06:10.499> I<00:06:10.800> think

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
between the opponent's body I think

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.559 
between the opponent's body I think
quick<00:06:11.460> scopes<00:06:11.669> will<00:06:11.849> be<00:06:11.939> so<00:06:12.089> easy<00:06:12.300> for<00:06:12.509> you

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
quick scopes will be so easy for you

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.679 
quick scopes will be so easy for you
