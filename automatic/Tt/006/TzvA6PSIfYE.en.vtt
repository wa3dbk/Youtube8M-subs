00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 so the final version is like this 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.130
 look accordingly i'll all be 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.790
 up to fix and here is this nest 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.980
 so no fit over that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.920
 that we have a voltage there did not exceed 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.650
 long it turned out it was necessary 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.240
 stand to the end there double 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.869
 shorter than double minus it doesnâ€™t work 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.619
 when and at the end then immediately voltage 12 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.170
 six off scale and all eventually earned 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.129
 fine but now I will not connect 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.520
 I got into the cap somehow and so 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.520
 look 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.360
 turn off the power supply 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.910
 that's how autonomous everything is autonomous 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:02.090
 Well, right here and so I planted 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.970
 Well, in short autonomy, everything works here 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.940
 that's all and then fix everything 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.520
 charging immediately shortcoming after 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.890
 I connected the converter started 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.300
 bask 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.729
 accordingly it is clear that through him 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.740
 a lot of current went shorter 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.360
 batteries were both cold and 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.490
 were bmx was cold attack was fee 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.700
 battery voltage monitor 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.450
 In short, I inserted it through scotch 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.200
 double sided 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.790
 on the converter here here here 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.729
 I recommend to put additional 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.009
 radiator well, so as not to go out did not come out suddenly 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.100
 out of order and accordingly then you 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:47.710
 get the opportunity to work from 5 amps 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.710
 on the power source also recommend 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.210
 for example lengthen the cord that we have 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.180
 will be inserted here yes that is possible 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.600
 find some twisted yes how in 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.220
 telephone that was convenient that is 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.580
 work if there is a socket nearby 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.970
 can connect to power supply and 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.979
 thus we get drills 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.370
 takes a second life a second wind and 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.200
 And in this case, you have all the charge 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.100
 comes down to the fact that the drill itself is 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.840
 regulates itself controls you just 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.620
 connect any source any 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.620
 power supply well, respectively, from 12 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.360
 above recommend somewhere around 14 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.720
 volt connect on what converter 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.840
 we have a lowering so that 12 2 volts 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.380
 we made shorter voltage 12-220 2 i 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.380
 put 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.390
 and all became all okay 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.130
 adjusted a little but lowered not all 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:55.600
 It was generally very good at this hurry 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:59.500
 bow out on this for sure 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.510
 pluses minuses 10 times from -1 minus 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.240
 poking around in both guys is the only one 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.250
 minus need to collect these two 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.380
 boards buy here such a wiring connector 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.840
 type well and respectively 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.760
 recommend 6 batteries to 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.130
 immediately increase the capacity to replace here 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.060
 this unit one at a time two spare 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.820
 batteries 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.560
 that is, to run less than 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.540
 batteries in perfect condition order 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.040
 more tyson is built more capacity 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.810
 working hours 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:34.180
 Well, I hope this method is useful and 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.140
 you will assemble a normal screwdriver and not 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.120
 what the guys are offering there is not clear 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.800
 How to charge about any battery you can 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.770
 you can connect any battery 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.790
 there is no need to connect if this one is any 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.500
 the battery will die again soon 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.500
 good luck to all
