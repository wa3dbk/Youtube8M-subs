00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.519
 hello everyone is one that gives them the 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.260
 welcome this fonte clan boyfriend 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.240
 online in that culture I bring you a 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.730
 totally great trick and it's how 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.230
 we can enter the train cabin 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.570
 then how the assault is obviously 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.250
 that can not be done let's say that 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.990
 Normally we have to use a 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.490
 little trick and it 's the one I'm going to 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.650
 show then the only thing we have 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.320
 to do what we first have to do 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.910
 do is look for 30 afternoons 1 and pink the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.980
 The only thing we have to do is to be 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.020
 next we will press to jump and 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.539
 so what we do is not being able to increase 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.270
 these let's say that these wagons that do not 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.620
 they have containers if they do 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.620
 they have containers obviously 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.970
 they will not be able to climb and as much as possible 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.770
 is that the train hits them and obviously 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.510
 they can get to die then 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.940
 we're just going to start going through 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.890
 let's say that these wagons those that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.200
 they have containers and we simply 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.170
 let's direct the locomotive or better 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.440
 said where is the machinist or good 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.360
 where is the train cabin already one time 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.579
 upwards the only thing that I advise them 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.229
 is that they take out any armed I 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.420
 I advise that it has a weapon and that 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.159
 begin to point towards the floor I go to 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.850
 walk for your character to walk 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.009
 much more 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.320
 and in this way they can fall into this 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.360
 part of the train and it is very important that 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.610
 do here and be very careful to 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.440
 that are not going to fall and obviously the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.850
 train of the various Trojans that 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.860
 we are simply here we are going to go 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.470
 then to our inventory where it says 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.470
 snacks and let's eat or let's say 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.869
 consume one of these depressing cruise and 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.479
 doing this as they realize the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.460
 character enters many times just that 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.680
 second in focus and the only thing we have 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.500
 what to do is simply enter here and 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.740
 be with our friend Paco the boss the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.240
 Train driver with insurance account is 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.280
 easy enough just have 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.409
 careful because if they move too much if 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.929
 they leave the train as it just happened to me 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.220
 here but it's pretty easy then 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.860
 simply the only thing they have to 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.470
 to do is to try again how they are given 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.539
 account is not complicated is enough 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.270
 great and probably for all 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.220
 people who had not seen then this 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.289
 train cabin had not shared a 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.209
 of time with our friend Paco the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.489
 driver the train driver 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.430
 there you can do it here simply what 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.129
 I will try again is 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.480
 very simple and if they do not have these 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.939
 snacks of 17 and kus obvious newsweb to like 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.189
 you say then the only thing you have to 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.900
 do is go to any store and buy 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.579
 the art to all these snacks are 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.439
 quite economic, that is they are more 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.909
 cheap then simply what 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.620
 have to do is buy new these 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.739
 and since they are not here, simply 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.269
 this afternoon with their selves so that 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.060
 our character can enter the 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.400
 train cabin then it's basically 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.959
 so it's very easy then because it has 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.450
 liked the video if it was like that we were fine 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.310
 leave your favorite light as a label 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.919
 it seems to them in this way to enter 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.290
 in the train chain if they had already 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.790
 seen if they already tried and obviously 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.769
 Do not forget to subscribe to the channel if you still 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.780
 they have not done it is because you saw 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.510
 can enter here this external chain 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.290
 obviously talk for a while with Paco and we 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.290
 we see until the next
