00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
sure that the end has a little tiny

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.139 
sure that the end has a little tiny
point<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.010> had<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.190> slow<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.550> down<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
point I had to slow it down just so you

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
point I had to slow it down just so you
guys<00:00:57.300> could<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.590> you're<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
guys could see and then you're going to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.170 
guys could see and then you're going to
cut<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.930> wrap<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.079> around<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:02.180> one

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
cut it and wrap it around like this one

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.590 
cut it and wrap it around like this one
to<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> Sapphire<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.880> I<00:01:05.880> actually<00:01:06.180> had<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
to the Sapphire and I actually had to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
to the Sapphire and I actually had to
take<00:01:06.930> mine<00:01:07.110> off<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.680> make<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> smaller<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
take mine off and make it smaller and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.120 
take mine off and make it smaller and
then<00:01:09.090> make<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> end<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> point<00:01:10.799> right

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
then make the end have a point right

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.649 
then make the end have a point right
here<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.869> would<00:01:13.020> fit<00:01:13.229> correctly<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
here so that it would fit correctly and

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:30.930 
here so that it would fit correctly and
there<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:16.140> that

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.630 

and<00:01:31.030> then<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.720> want<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:31.990> go<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.800> make<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.250> small

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
and then you want to go and make a small

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.460 
and then you want to go and make a small
ball<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:33.880> clay<00:01:34.120> and<00:01:34.510> make<00:01:34.660> a<00:01:34.690> point<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.320> one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
ball of clay and make a point on the one

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.820 
ball of clay and make a point on the one
end<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:36.100> you're<00:01:36.340> gonna<00:01:36.430> place<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:37.410> down<00:01:38.410> where

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
end and you're gonna place it down where

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.030 
end and you're gonna place it down where
the<00:01:39.460> bottom<00:01:39.850> curve<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.230> smooth<00:01:41.830> it<00:01:41.950> out

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
the bottom curve is and smooth it out

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.130 
the bottom curve is and smooth it out
with<00:01:42.250> your<00:01:42.400> dotting<00:01:42.850> tool<00:01:43.180> or<00:01:43.420> smoothing<00:01:43.810> tool

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
with your dotting tool or smoothing tool

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.270 
with your dotting tool or smoothing tool
and<00:01:44.380> add<00:01:45.310> an<00:01:45.490> eye<00:01:45.640> pin<00:01:45.670> using<00:01:46.630> TLS<00:01:46.930> or<00:01:47.380> 6000<00:01:48.160> and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
and add an eye pin using TLS or 6000 and

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.110 
and add an eye pin using TLS or 6000 and
put<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:48.700> in<00:01:48.910> your<00:01:49.120> pan<00:01:49.390> now<00:01:49.840> for<00:01:50.080> gorons<00:01:50.410> Ruby

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
put that in your pan now for gorons Ruby

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.330 
put that in your pan now for gorons Ruby
so<00:01:52.140> you're<00:01:53.140> going<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.440> condition<00:01:53.980> your<00:01:54.100> clay

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
so you're going to condition your clay

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.920 
so you're going to condition your clay
and<00:01:54.370> then<00:01:54.670> roll<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.000> out<00:01:55.120> with<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.300> rolling<00:01:55.510> pin

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
and then roll it out with a rolling pin

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.210 
and then roll it out with a rolling pin
and<00:01:56.200> here's<00:01:56.770> where<00:01:56.920> you're<00:01:57.010> going<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.190> need

that so go ahead and do that and we'll

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.059 
that so go ahead and do that and we'll
start<00:03:03.160> source<00:03:03.519> sapphire<00:03:04.590> dish<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.739> your<00:03:05.890> blue

clay<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.670> then<00:03:06.880> roll<00:03:07.090> out<00:03:07.120> three<00:03:07.599> balls<00:03:07.840> about

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
clay and then roll out three balls about

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.550 
clay and then roll out three balls about
this<00:03:08.349> size<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.099> blue<00:03:09.280> clay<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:10.319> go<00:03:11.319> ahead

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
this size of the blue clay and go ahead

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.160 
this size of the blue clay and go ahead
and<00:03:11.860> roll<00:03:12.519> out<00:03:12.700> some<00:03:13.060> more<00:03:13.239> gold<00:03:13.480> clay<00:03:13.840> and

and roll out some more gold clay and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.289 
and roll out some more gold clay and
you're<00:03:14.860> going<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.010> cut<00:03:15.220> little<00:03:15.489> pieces<00:03:15.640> about

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
you're going to cut little pieces about

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.069 
you're going to cut little pieces about
this<00:03:16.569> size<00:03:16.810> they<00:03:17.410> should<00:03:17.650> go<00:03:18.629> around<00:03:19.629> the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
this size they should go around the

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.979 
this size they should go around the
little<00:03:21.010> balls<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.579> made<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.299> if<00:03:22.810> you

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
little balls that you made so if you

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.780 
little balls that you made so if you
make<00:03:23.170> them<00:03:23.349> bigger<00:03:23.530> than<00:03:23.890> that<00:03:24.040> do<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.489> and

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
make them bigger than that do that and

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.729 
make them bigger than that do that and
you're<00:03:25.420> gonna<00:03:25.540> want<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.750> make<00:03:25.900> sure<00:03:26.170> both<00:03:26.410> ends

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
you're gonna want to make sure both ends

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.380 
you're gonna want to make sure both ends
have<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> point<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.879> then<00:03:28.120> you're<00:03:28.239> going<00:03:28.329> to

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
have a point and then you're going to

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.750 
have a point and then you're going to
wrap<00:03:28.690> them<00:03:28.989> around<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:30.040> you're<00:03:30.430> going<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.579> do

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
wrap them around and you're going to do

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.420 
wrap them around and you're going to do
that<00:03:30.879> to<00:03:31.030> all<00:03:31.180> three<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.629> them<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.319> once<00:03:33.250> all

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
that to all three of them and once all

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.009 
that to all three of them and once all
three<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.730> them<00:03:33.849> are<00:03:34.000> finished<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.870> can

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
three of them are finished you can

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.650 
three of them are finished you can
connect<00:03:35.440> them<00:03:36.989> like<00:03:37.989> this<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.420> looks<00:03:40.480> like

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
connect them like this so it looks like

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.910 
connect them like this so it looks like
that<00:03:41.459> now<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.519> need<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.850> roll<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.329> little<00:03:43.920> ball

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
that now you need to roll a little ball

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.220 
that now you need to roll a little ball
and<00:03:44.980> flatten<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.540> gold<00:03:46.750> clay<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.109> put

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
and flatten it of the gold clay and put

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.620 
and flatten it of the gold clay and put
that<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.590> middle<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.239> then<00:03:49.239> you're<00:03:49.389> going

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
that in the middle and then you're going

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.569 
that in the middle and then you're going
to<00:03:49.810> roll<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:51.180> tiny<00:03:52.180> little<00:03:52.510> like<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.500> circle<00:03:54.069> or<00:03:54.310> I

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
to roll a tiny little like a circle or I

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.210 
to roll a tiny little like a circle or I
think<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:55.000> an<00:03:55.120> oval<00:03:55.329> actually<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.980> gold<00:03:56.980> clay

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
think it's an oval actually of gold clay

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.759 
think it's an oval actually of gold clay
and<00:03:57.370> put<00:03:57.519> that<00:03:57.639> at<00:03:57.849> that<00:03:58.720> one<00:03:58.930> point<00:03:59.139> and<00:03:59.530> then

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
and put that at that one point and then

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.589 
and put that at that one point and then
roll<00:04:00.730> two<00:04:01.120> ovals<00:04:02.049> of<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.319> same<00:04:02.530> size<00:04:02.859> and<00:04:03.599> put

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
roll two ovals of the same size and put

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.629 
roll two ovals of the same size and put
those<00:04:04.810> on<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.410> other<00:04:05.560> remaining<00:04:06.040> sides<00:04:08.639> then

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
those on the other remaining sides then

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.250

you guys enjoyed that and I just put the
remaining<00:05:46.060> four<00:05:46.389> tutorials<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:47.020> had<00:05:47.229> into<00:05:47.500> one

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
remaining four tutorials I had into one

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.350 
remaining four tutorials I had into one
video<00:05:47.860> because<00:05:48.400> they<00:05:48.550> were<00:05:48.610> so<00:05:48.849> short<00:05:49.120> and

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
video because they were so short and

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.350 
video because they were so short and
easy<00:05:49.509> well<00:05:50.380> not<00:05:51.280> easy<00:05:51.610> but<00:05:51.909> they<00:05:52.300> were

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
easy well not easy but they were

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.689 
easy well not easy but they were
simplistic<00:05:53.020> to<00:05:53.169> make<00:05:53.349> so<00:05:54.250> I've<00:05:54.370> run<00:05:54.520> out<00:05:54.580> of

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
simplistic to make so I've run out of

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.430 
simplistic to make so I've run out of
tutorials<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:55.509> in<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.900> comment<00:05:56.199> section

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
tutorials so in the comment section

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.499 
tutorials so in the comment section
below<00:05:56.470> if<00:05:56.979> you<00:05:57.070> could<00:05:57.190> leave<00:05:57.400> me<00:05:57.639> some<00:05:58.090> ideas

below if you could leave me some ideas

00:05:58.509 --> 00:05:59.969

of what you would want to see polymer

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.449 
of what you would want to see polymer
