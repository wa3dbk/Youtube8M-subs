00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
video because i don't want to make it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.060 
video because i don't want to make it
too<00:01:36.630> long<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.350> episodes<00:01:37.710> are<00:01:37.860> going

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
too long because the episodes are going

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.530 
too long because the episodes are going
to<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.220> too<00:01:38.400> long<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.820> i<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.090> want<00:01:39.270> them<00:01:39.329> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
to be too long and i don't want them to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.870 
to be too long and i don't want them to
be<00:01:39.659> too<00:01:39.780> long<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.470> i<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.920> decided<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.579> make<00:01:41.759> it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
be too long so i just decided to make it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.580 
be too long so i just decided to make it
like<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> minute<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> half<00:01:42.479> H<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.049> each<00:01:43.229> map

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
like a minute and a half H of each map

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
like a minute and a half H of each map
and<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> same<00:01:44.640> gun<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.000> Sue's<00:01:45.210> commando

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and with the same gun in Sue's commando

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.590 
and with the same gun in Sue's commando
I've<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.799> much<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.490> files<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.450> my

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I've got so much more like files on my

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.030 
I've got so much more like files on my
computer<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.170> staff<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.500> render<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.950> all

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
computer that I staff to render and all

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.609 
computer that I staff to render and all
that<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.659> decided<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:52.170> make<00:01:52.320> them<00:01:52.500> like

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that so I just decided to make them like

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
that so I just decided to make them like
that<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:53.009> poor<00:01:53.220> gameplay<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.939> there<00:01:54.540> were

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
that just poor gameplay and there were

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.240 
that just poor gameplay and there were
pretty<00:01:54.810> good<00:01:54.899> gameplay<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.159> decided

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
pretty good gameplay so I just decided

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.550 
pretty good gameplay so I just decided
to<00:01:56.820> make<00:01:57.030> them<00:01:57.210> from<00:01:57.390> black<00:01:57.840> ops<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> way

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
to make them from black ops all the way

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.730 
to make them from black ops all the way
to<00:01:58.619> mw3<00:01:59.130> back<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.060> black<00:02:00.329> ops<00:02:00.540> 2<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.469> fast

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
to mw3 back to black ops 2 and so fast

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.609 
to mw3 back to black ops 2 and so fast
to<00:02:01.920> make<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.219> 55<00:02:02.880> videos<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> have

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to make like 55 videos and that I have

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.499 
to make like 55 videos and that I have
not<00:02:04.770> even<00:02:04.890> cited<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.549> yet<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.880> I've<00:02:06.270> only

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
ops and black ops ii o pretty much

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.330 
ops and black ops ii o pretty much
similar<00:02:27.480> we've<00:02:28.260> got<00:02:28.380> some<00:02:28.560> similar<00:02:28.860> maps<00:02:29.070> and
