so he's keeping his feet down gets

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.860 
so he's keeping his feet down gets
better<00:02:44.950> balance<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:46.060> can<00:02:46.269> protect<00:02:46.450> any

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
better balance and it can protect any

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.630
