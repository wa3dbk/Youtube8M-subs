want to go grab a curved to and put it

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.969 
want to go grab a curved to and put it
right<00:01:58.130> there<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.880> it's<00:02:02.870> okay<00:02:03.290> if<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.710> sticks

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979

right there and it's okay if it sticks
out<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.610> side<00:02:04.850> because<00:02:05.030> you'll<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.420> what

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
out to the side because you'll see what

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.730 
out to the side because you'll see what
we're<00:02:05.660> going<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.840> do<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:06.050> cover<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:06.380> up<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.680> a

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
we're going to do to cover that up in a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.550 
we're going to do to cover that up in a
minute<00:02:07.209> you<00:02:08.209> want<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.450> put<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:09.500> looks

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
minute you want to put it so it looks

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.430 
minute you want to put it so it looks
