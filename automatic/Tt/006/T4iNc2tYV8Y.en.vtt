hey everybody healthy prepper here with
a<00:00:03.810> little<00:00:04.049> tip<00:00:04.350> on<00:00:04.560> how<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.180> save<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.839> juice

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
a little tip on how to save the juice

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.700 
a little tip on how to save the juice
from<00:00:07.350> your<00:00:07.410> lemons<00:00:07.919> for<00:00:08.990> storage<00:00:09.990> now<00:00:10.530> this

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
from your lemons for storage now this

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.650 
from your lemons for storage now this
wouldn't<00:00:10.920> be<00:00:11.130> super<00:00:11.610> long-term<00:00:12.059> storage<00:00:12.360> but

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
wouldn't be super long-term storage but

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.560 
wouldn't be super long-term storage but
I<00:00:12.719> can<00:00:12.929> tell<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.740> they<00:00:13.920> easily<00:00:14.309> last<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.210> year

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
I can tell you they easily last a year

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.370 
I can tell you they easily last a year
or<00:00:15.780> longer<00:00:16.220> stored<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.430> way<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
or longer stored this way and I have a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.550 
or longer stored this way and I have a
lemon<00:00:19.800> tree<00:00:19.920> outside<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:22.439> was

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
lemon tree outside and it's a it was

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.070 
lemon tree outside and it's a it was
deeply<00:00:22.830> needed<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.939> harvested<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.810> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
deeply needed to be harvested so I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.279 
deeply needed to be harvested so I
pulled<00:00:25.410> off<00:00:25.590> some<00:00:25.830> lemon<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:28.050> that

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
pulled off some lemon and I know that

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.810 
pulled off some lemon and I know that
the<00:00:28.410> longer<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:28.949> sit<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.400> tree<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the longer they sit on the tree the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460 
the longer they sit on the tree the
sweeter<00:00:30.119> they<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.109> leave<00:00:31.320> them

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
sweeter they get so I like to leave them

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.549 
sweeter they get so I like to leave them
on<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:32.790> very<00:00:33.000> last<00:00:33.239> minute<00:00:33.510> although<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> think

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
on the very last minute although I think

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.490 
on the very last minute although I think
I<00:00:34.829> went<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.160> little<00:00:35.190> long<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.059> case<00:00:36.500> but

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
I went a little long in this case but

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.180 
I went a little long in this case but
anyway

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
anyway

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.369 
anyway
I<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.640> probably<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.690> big<00:00:39.870> silver<00:00:40.230> bowl

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
I have probably see that big silver bowl

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.869 
I have probably see that big silver bowl
back<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.829> probably<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.579> don't<00:00:41.640> know

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
back there I probably have I don't know

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.430 
back there I probably have I don't know
four<00:00:42.180> or<00:00:42.210> five<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.540> those<00:00:42.660> big<00:00:42.870> silver<00:00:43.230> bowls

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
four or five of those big silver bowls

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.850 
four or five of those big silver bowls
yet<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> come<00:00:44.309> off<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.090> tree<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.930> anyway<00:00:46.879> um

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
yet to come off the tree but anyway um

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
yet to come off the tree but anyway um
here<00:00:51.410> here's<00:00:52.410> my<00:00:52.649> lemon<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:54.210> grow

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
here here's my lemon and I grow

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.479 
here here's my lemon and I grow
funny-looking<00:00:55.500> lemons<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.370> know<00:00:56.460> why

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
funny-looking lemons I don't know why

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.889 
funny-looking lemons I don't know why
hopefully<00:00:59.489> they<00:00:59.609> are<00:00:59.640> not<00:00:59.850> radioactive<00:01:00.420> or

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
hopefully they are not radioactive or

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
hopefully they are not radioactive or
anything<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.829> they're<00:01:02.340> funky<00:01:02.670> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
anything like that but they're funky on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.100 
anything like that but they're funky on
the<00:01:02.789> outside<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.329> they're<00:01:03.449> awesome<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the outside but they're awesome on the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
the outside but they're awesome on the
inside<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.400> wanted<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> figure<00:01:06.000> out

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
inside and I really wanted to figure out

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.000 
inside and I really wanted to figure out
a<00:01:06.210> way<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> salvage<00:01:06.810> these<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.680> juice<00:01:07.890> from

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
a way to salvage these the juice from

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.830 
a way to salvage these the juice from
these<00:01:08.100> because<00:01:08.310> there's<00:01:08.430> no<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.479> use

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
these because there's no way I can use

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.800 
these because there's no way I can use
all<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.229> fresh<00:01:11.070> lemon<00:01:11.549> when<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.000> comes<00:01:12.270> ready

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
all this fresh lemon when it comes ready

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
all this fresh lemon when it comes ready
for<00:01:13.470> harvest<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:14.340> once<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.450> myself

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
for harvest all at once so I got myself

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.770 
for harvest all at once so I got myself
one<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.990> these<00:01:16.110> little<00:01:16.350> gizmos<00:01:17.600> it's<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
one of these little gizmos it's going to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.030 
one of these little gizmos it's going to
pan<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> down<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
pan up and down so you can see it a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.380 
pan up and down so you can see it a
little<00:01:20.070> better<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:23.310> juicer<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.119> hand

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
little better it is a juicer it's a hand

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.179 
little better it is a juicer it's a hand
juicer<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.500> thought<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:25.979> good

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
juicer and I thought this would be good

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.550 
juicer and I thought this would be good
for<00:01:26.340> prepping<00:01:26.729> purposes<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
for prepping purposes because it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.429 
for prepping purposes because it
requires<00:01:28.950> no<00:01:29.340> electricity

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
requires no electricity

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.469 
requires no electricity
basically<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:33.350> seat<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.590> lemon<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.479> then

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
basically you seat the lemon and then

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:45.679 
basically you seat the lemon and then
you<00:01:37.250> squish<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.520> limit<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.909> looks<00:01:45.329> maybe

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
you squish the limit and it looks maybe

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.719 
you squish the limit and it looks maybe
harder<00:01:46.140> than<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.220> hard<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
harder than it is it's not that hard to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.230 
harder than it is it's not that hard to
push<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:51.030> seeing

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
push and it really you see you're seeing

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.160 
push and it really you see you're seeing
that<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.470> empties<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.750> center<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that it really empties out the center of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.780 
that it really empties out the center of
the<00:01:55.259> lemon<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.649> well<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.399> very<00:01:56.610> little

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the lemon really well with very little

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.080 
the lemon really well with very little
pressure<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:59.549> will<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.060> through

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
pressure now you will have to go through

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090 
pressure now you will have to go through
and<00:02:00.420> strain<00:02:00.719> your<00:02:00.750> lemon<00:02:01.200> juice<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.950> bit

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and strain your lemon juice a little bit

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.889 
and strain your lemon juice a little bit
after<00:02:02.610> although<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:07.560> little<00:02:07.890> gizmo<00:02:08.039> does

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
after although this little gizmo does

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.150 
after although this little gizmo does
strain<00:02:09.899> some<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> lemon<00:02:10.560> seeds<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.129> you

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
strain some of the lemon seeds for you

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.350

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
juice let me see how you can see this

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.680 
juice let me see how you can see this
dancing<00:03:07.890> around<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.310> my<00:03:08.640> my<00:03:09.180> chair<00:03:09.480> here

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
dancing around like my my chair here

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.199 
dancing around like my my chair here
okay<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.530> skip<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.700> pour<00:03:11.909> it<00:03:12.030> into

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
okay and you skip it and I pour it into

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.440 
okay and you skip it and I pour it into
an<00:03:12.750> ice<00:03:13.440> cube<00:03:13.500> tray<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:14.879> just<00:03:15.060> go<00:03:15.180> along<00:03:15.300> and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
an ice cube tray so I just go along and

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.210 
an ice cube tray so I just go along and
fill<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.870> up<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:15.989> can<00:03:16.230> overflow<00:03:16.500> because<00:03:16.860> they

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
fill it up you can overflow because they

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.330 
fill it up you can overflow because they
they<00:03:17.970> overflow<00:03:18.420> into<00:03:18.599> each<00:03:18.810> other<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.920> as<00:03:20.099> they

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
they overflow into each other so as they

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.040 
they overflow into each other so as they
overflow<00:03:20.909> you<00:03:21.330> can<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.629> tilt<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.019> little

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
overflow you can just tilt it a little

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.920 
overflow you can just tilt it a little
and<00:03:22.470> it'll<00:03:23.069> even<00:03:23.370> them<00:03:23.550> off<00:03:23.670> pop<00:03:24.629> them<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.900> your

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
and it'll even them off pop them in your

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.009 
and it'll even them off pop them in your
freezer<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.700> then<00:03:26.700> when<00:03:26.849> they're<00:03:27.000> frozen<00:03:27.239> you

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
freezer and then when they're frozen you

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.869 
freezer and then when they're frozen you
can<00:03:28.200> take<00:03:28.379> them<00:03:28.530> out<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.069> just<00:03:29.459> throw<00:03:29.700> them<00:03:29.819> in

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
can take them out and just throw them in
