so<00:03:11.860> that's<00:03:12.040> what<00:03:12.250> we<00:03:12.400> found<00:03:12.610> about<00:03:12.820> that<00:03:13.060> we

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
so that's what we found about that we

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.210 
so that's what we found about that we
for<00:03:13.480> ice<00:03:13.630> camera<00:03:14.020> so<00:03:14.260> far<00:03:14.470> but<00:03:14.710> you<00:03:14.950> might<00:03:15.100> need

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
for ice camera so far but you might need

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.680 
for ice camera so far but you might need
