hooks<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.550> game<00:02:16.760> you're<00:02:16.910> not<00:02:17.000> really

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
hooks in the game you're not really

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.710 
hooks in the game you're not really
showing<00:02:17.540> them<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:18.370> b<00:02:19.370> roll<00:02:19.610> but<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.600> the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
showing them in this b roll but like the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.900 
showing them in this b roll but like the
dynamic<00:02:20.900> challenges<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:22.010> force<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.790> to

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
dynamic challenges that force you to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.160 
dynamic challenges that force you to
like<00:02:23.060> while<00:02:23.210> you're<00:02:23.390> doing<00:02:23.510> erase<00:02:23.840> see<00:02:24.020> how

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
like while you're doing erase see how

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.540 
like while you're doing erase see how
far<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.500> can<00:02:24.530> drift<00:02:24.860> if<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.070> can<00:02:25.190> answer<00:02:25.340> for

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
far you can drift if you can answer for

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.930 
far you can drift if you can answer for
your<00:02:25.670> opponent<00:02:25.820> I<00:02:26.180> think<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.930> delay<00:02:27.260> was

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
your opponent I think the delay was

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.190 
your opponent I think the delay was
think<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.000> obviously<00:02:29.270> looks<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.630> lot<00:02:29.900> better

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
think it obviously looks a lot better

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.230 
think it obviously looks a lot better
than<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.680> did<00:02:30.890> last<00:02:31.100> year<00:02:31.459> it's<00:02:31.820> it's<00:02:32.090> still

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
than it did last year it's it's still

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.880 
than it did last year it's it's still
running<00:02:32.390> at<00:02:32.570> 30<00:02:32.810> frames<00:02:33.020> which<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.620> lot<00:02:33.860> of

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
running at 30 frames which a lot of

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.510 
running at 30 frames which a lot of
people<00:02:34.010> are<00:02:34.420> pretty<00:02:35.420> upset<00:02:35.810> about<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.620> mean

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
people are pretty upset about but I mean

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.750 
people are pretty upset about but I mean
graphically<00:02:38.330> it's<00:02:38.510> pretty<00:02:38.959> out<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.230> control

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
graphically it's pretty out of control

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.620 
graphically it's pretty out of control
and<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.850> think<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.120> was<00:02:41.209> probably<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.510> big

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
and I think that was probably a big

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.380 
and I think that was probably a big
reason<00:02:41.840> for<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.470> pushing<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.220> back<00:02:43.390> yeah

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
reason for the pushing it back yeah

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.610 
reason for the pushing it back yeah
