00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.729 
number 30 and I finally got the first
suit<00:05:37.319> upgrade<00:05:37.829> alright<00:05:39.229> that's<00:05:40.229> a<00:05:40.379> hell<00:05:40.559> of<00:05:40.589> a

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:40.739 
suit upgrade alright that's a hell of a

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:43.729 
suit upgrade alright that's a hell of a
sigh<00:05:40.979> of<00:05:41.009> relief<00:05:41.189> I<00:05:41.639> guess<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:43.110> gravity<00:05:43.529> suits

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:43.739 
sigh of relief I guess the gravity suits

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:45.259 
sigh of relief I guess the gravity suits
up<00:05:43.919> there<00:05:44.099> maybe<00:05:44.279> this<00:05:44.519> opens<00:05:44.909> some<00:05:45.089> of<00:05:45.179> those

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:45.269 
up there maybe this opens some of those

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:47.290 
up there maybe this opens some of those
metal<00:05:45.689> doors<00:05:45.899> that<00:05:46.110> we've<00:05:46.259> got<00:05:46.469> down<00:05:46.679> here<00:05:47.009> and

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
metal doors that we've got down here and

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.169 
metal doors that we've got down here and
maybe<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.509> wave<00:05:48.719> beam<00:05:49.050> goes<00:05:49.229> in<00:05:49.409> there<00:05:50.149> so<00:05:51.149> I

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:51.179 
maybe the wave beam goes in there so I

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:54.499 
maybe the wave beam goes in there so I
can<00:05:51.240> get<00:05:51.509> my<00:05:51.689> grabber<00:05:51.990> a<00:05:52.139> suit<00:05:52.469> I<00:05:53.269> can<00:05:54.269> tell<00:05:54.419> you

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
can get my grabber a suit I can tell you

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.359 
can get my grabber a suit I can tell you
what<00:05:54.659> if<00:05:54.779> it's<00:05:55.289> not<00:05:55.499> here<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:55.919> I<00:05:55.949> have<00:05:56.099> to<00:05:56.249> go

00:05:56.359 --> 00:05:56.369 
what if it's not here and I have to go

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:57.919 
what if it's not here and I have to go
back<00:05:56.550> tracking<00:05:56.909> for<00:05:57.209> the<00:05:57.269> way<00:05:57.419> beam<00:05:57.629> I'm<00:05:57.779> just

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:57.929 
back tracking for the way beam I'm just

00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:00.679 
back tracking for the way beam I'm just
gonna<00:05:58.079> say<00:05:58.289> fucking<00:05:58.769> I<00:05:58.979> don't<00:05:59.519> wanna<00:05:59.909> know

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
gonna say fucking I don't wanna know

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:02.209 
gonna say fucking I don't wanna know
damn<00:06:00.959> I<00:06:00.990> can't<00:06:01.229> enter<00:06:01.589> the<00:06:01.709> terrain<00:06:02.069> without

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
damn I can't enter the terrain without

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.709 
damn I can't enter the terrain without
the<00:06:02.550> wave<00:06:02.729> without<00:06:03.029> the<00:06:03.919> ice<00:06:04.919> beam<00:06:05.659> maybe<00:06:06.659> I

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
the wave without the ice beam maybe I

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.169 
the wave without the ice beam maybe I
spew<00:06:07.050> somewhere<00:06:07.439> around<00:06:07.529> here<00:06:07.800> pins<00:06:08.789> if<00:06:08.939> I<00:06:09.029> get

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:09.179 
spew somewhere around here pins if I get

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:11.719 
spew somewhere around here pins if I get
the<00:06:09.300> ice<00:06:09.419> beam<00:06:09.779> and<00:06:10.249> can't<00:06:11.249> find<00:06:11.459> the<00:06:11.579> wave

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
the ice beam and can't find the wave

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.850 
the ice beam and can't find the wave
beam<00:06:11.909> then<00:06:12.119> I'm<00:06:12.209> gonna<00:06:12.329> go<00:06:12.539> into<00:06:12.659> the<00:06:12.839> Tauri<00:06:13.079> if

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
beam then I'm gonna go into the Tauri if

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.679 
beam then I'm gonna go into the Tauri if
I<00:06:14.009> can't<00:06:14.279> well<00:06:14.579> then

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
I can't well then

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:20.739 
I can't well then
to<00:06:16.049> prepare<00:06:16.469> for<00:06:17.309> many<00:06:18.149> more<00:06:18.389> videos<00:06:19.049> of

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
mother brain is gonna put it in a

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.149 
mother brain is gonna put it in a
relatively<00:06:28.979> easy<00:06:29.369> spot<00:06:29.789> to<00:06:29.849> find<00:06:30.209> I<00:06:31.159> mean
