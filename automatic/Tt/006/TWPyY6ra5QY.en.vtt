00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.999 

okay<00:00:02.220> so<00:00:02.520> this<00:00:02.850> is<00:00:03.030> around<00:00:03.149> three<00:00:03.629> in<00:00:04.110> the

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
okay so this is around three in the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.880 
okay so this is around three in the
first<00:00:05.790> video<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.150> said<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:07.049> was<00:00:07.319> not<00:00:07.560> going

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
first video I said that I was not going

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.700 
first video I said that I was not going
to<00:00:08.010> do<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.700> contrast<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.330> color<00:00:09.570> but<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.200> was

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
to do the contrast in color but I was

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.860 
to do the contrast in color but I was
reading<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.250> earth<00:00:11.519> fan<00:00:11.880> mail<00:00:12.150> page<00:00:12.450> that

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
reading on earth fan mail page that

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.049 
reading on earth fan mail page that
people<00:00:13.230> want<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.830> see<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.250> contrast<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.880> color

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
people want to see the contrast in color

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.439 
people want to see the contrast in color
so<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.630> will<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.109> that

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
so I will do that

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.300 
so I will do that
so<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.690> pattern<00:00:18.869> says<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.619> slip<00:00:19.980> stitch<00:00:20.279> to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
so the pattern says to slip stitch to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.900 
so the pattern says to slip stitch to
the<00:00:20.640> next<00:00:20.789> chain<00:00:21.210> space<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.850> probably<00:00:23.850> just

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
the next chain space so probably just

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.230 
the next chain space so probably just
want<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.900> extra<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.560> there<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
want to do like one extra one there and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.150 
want to do like one extra one there and
then<00:00:27.240> you're<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:29.029> cut<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.150> all<00:00:30.949> by<00:00:31.949> my

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
then you're going to cut this all by my

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.080 
then you're going to cut this all by my
scissors<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.980> want<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> leave<00:00:35.460> enough<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
scissors and you want to leave enough of

scissors and you want to leave enough of
a<00:00:36.300> tail<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.590> could<00:00:37.739> sew<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
a tail so that you could sew it in and

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.700 
a tail so that you could sew it in and
you<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.950> either<00:00:41.160> sew<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.820> now<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.469> can

you can either sew it in now or you can

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.680 
you can either sew it in now or you can
throw<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.250> at<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> end<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.000> prefer<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> sew

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
go into any one of the chain three

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.070 
go into any one of the chain three
spaces<00:01:21.049> and

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.960 

I<00:01:27.170> don't<00:01:27.800> know<00:01:27.890> what<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:28.100> like<00:01:28.370> to<00:01:28.520> do<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:28.760> kind

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
ten in each of these chain three spaces

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.300 
ten in each of these chain three spaces
first<00:01:46.100> ones<00:01:46.400> always<00:01:46.730> kind<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.440> tough<00:01:48.440> that's

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
first ones always kind of tough that's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
first ones always kind of tough that's
one<00:01:52.060> two

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.770 

three

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.160 

for

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.339 

by

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.120 

six

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.300 

and<00:02:18.670> then

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.210 

eight

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.000 

my

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.100 

ten<00:02:32.610> okay<00:02:33.319> so<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.709> pattern<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.310> says<00:02:35.640> to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
ten okay so in the pattern it says to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.380 
ten okay so in the pattern it says to
single<00:02:37.110> crochet<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.519> next<00:02:38.879> chain<00:02:39.090> space

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
single crochet to the next chain space

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:48.199 
single crochet to the next chain space
so<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:39.959> these<00:02:40.250> five<00:02:45.470> loops<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.739> whatever<00:02:47.180> but<00:02:48.180> I

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
so in these five loops or whatever but I

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.559 
so in these five loops or whatever but I
found<00:02:48.480> if<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.920> five<00:02:50.190> single<00:02:51.150> crochets

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
found if you do the five single crochets

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.580 
found if you do the five single crochets
it<00:02:51.840> makes<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:54.470> wavy<00:02:55.470> edge<00:02:56.959> here<00:02:57.959> instead<00:02:58.530> of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
it makes a wavy edge here instead of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.970 
it makes a wavy edge here instead of
that<00:02:58.920> sharp<00:02:59.310> kind<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.819> corner<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.290> what<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.769> do

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
that sharp kind of corner so what I do

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.110 
that sharp kind of corner so what I do
instead<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:04.410> find<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> center<00:03:05.489> one<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:05.879> one

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
instead is I find the center one so one

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.300 
instead is I find the center one so one
two<00:03:06.390> three<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:07.019> then<00:03:07.530> one<00:03:07.799> two

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
two three and then one two

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.680 
two three and then one two
so<00:03:08.430> there's<00:03:08.640> five<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.180> want<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.450> go<00:03:09.569> into

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
so there's five so you want to go into

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.229 
so there's five so you want to go into
the<00:03:09.870> third<00:03:10.140> one<00:03:10.379> and<00:03:10.620> do<00:03:11.549> one<00:03:11.790> single<00:03:12.060> crochet

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
the third one and do one single crochet

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.330 
the third one and do one single crochet
and<00:03:14.480> then<00:03:15.480> move<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.709> next<00:03:16.950> chain<00:03:17.310> three
