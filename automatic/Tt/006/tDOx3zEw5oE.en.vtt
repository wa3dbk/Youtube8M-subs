00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.190
 its obviously good fish i wouldn't 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.009
 otherwise really not good but it is not 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.350
 can bring some really very nice bike 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.119
 very closely together work field 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.619
 all things we can indicate is it 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.250
 equally adjusted 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.250
 and the works really perfect 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.610
 well we will there with the same bike will 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.730
 cells frame 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.750
 what we do have is other different tires 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.010
 has other tips for this sort that this 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.200
 the cobbles 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.200
 so something wider and slightly different profile 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.490
 what we use a lot for the for 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.130
 these roads that they often drive above 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:03.080
 sit a bit more at the barracks 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:06.410
 more understanding and as a step here and here one 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.360
 and switch unit mounted is also normal 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.260
 can switch right there if necessary 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.720
 is also on the inside of the handlebar 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.250
 so actually more for nutritional print 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.780
 so that is still intact even under the bracket 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.070
 fast 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.700
 we can switch heavier can 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.300
 switch without trading handlebars 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.300
 to redo the tent 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.119
 we are a few guys that 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.340
 who always like to ride because 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.749
 ever stiffer said nothing and are 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.119
 of course not just cobblestones 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:44.590
 way to be a little less busy in 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.209
 in the chips now all carbon 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.299
 what they do what other team do 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.299
 is normal 32 spoke wheels 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.000
 those wheels are just why 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.000
 we just work normal that trip
