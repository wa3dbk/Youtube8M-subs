00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 when the smartphone hits the ground 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.290
 this usually ends with a display 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.319
 on 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.599
 with the cat b15 a car smartphone 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.740
 of the us 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.210
 construction equipment manufacturer caterpillar 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.570
 belonging to the past 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.400
 the editorial has the ip67 certified 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.630
 smartphone at construction site one 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 subjected to hardness test 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:33.329
 it is virtually invulnerable device 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:36.090
 suitable not only for construction workers, the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.800
 cat b15 by caterpillar is currently available for 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.649
 to have around 300 euros 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.989
 It is thanks to P67 certification water 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.879
 and dustproof , that survives 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.780
 smartphone crashes from heights of up to 1 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.700
 meter 80 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.730
 All this has the editorial in the acid test 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.739
 tested at the construction site quite so blatantly 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 Resistant as the manufacturer indicates 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.520
 the display cover is made of gorilla glass 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.770
 But then you are not infected 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.480
 Smartphone with a handful of screws 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.550
 You can get it in your pants pocket 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.239
 go out that the display after that scratch 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.239
 will exhibit 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.790
 Yes 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.650
 in the design and in the processing has 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.420
 caterpillar much trouble given that 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.760
 know only artisan to appreciate 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.830
 their eyes that cat b15 also visually 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:54.080
 Schick therefore comes at best it is 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.030
 a bit heavy and clunky as well 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.149
 positive is that the device with two 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.460
 You can feed sim cards so you can 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.560
 parallel as a working and private mobile phone 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.899
 use what's on the job site 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.940
 However, as a criterion was the 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.899
 missing led in connection with the 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.239
 bad camera 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.100
 Nowadays, construction progresses or 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.800
 Evidence of one and dismantled 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.540
 Parts documented with the camera and 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970
 Pictures in some cases even directly 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.310
 sent by the smartphone by that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.019
 the 5 megapixel camera in bad 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.090
 lighting conditions is almost unusable 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.090
 another camera is needed 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.720
 Moreover, it is not uncommon that one 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.880
 the led of a smartphone as 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.709
 flashlight repatriated who as 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.660
 Manufacturer of an author's smartphones 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.850
 this component must be omitted 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.560
 point deduction count 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.510
 the 4 inch large screens in order 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.760
 even if manufacturers like samsung nokia 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.769
 and co in similarly expensive or even 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.570
 cheaper smartphones better displays 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.190
 can use with automatic 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.810
 brightness control appears that 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.170
 display often too dark and the 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:05.209
 Viewing angle is unstable at the processor 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.000
 caterpillar relies on a dual core cpu 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.019
 with 1 gigahertz clocking and 512 megabytes 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.570
 random access memory 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.549
 But what does that mean for the user of the 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.320
 Processor is not one of the strongest 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.040
 and cheap now and then one 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.560
 respite 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.660
 it happens that you wait longer 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.610
 must be open until application or one 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.980
 website is readable 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.890
 the small internal memory offers 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.690
 deduction of android only 16 gigabytes 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.570
 only good that one with micro sd cards 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.570
 expand it by up to 32gb 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.000
 the quality of conversation in telephone calls 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.070
 is very good 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.630
 what you get from the built-in speaker 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.640
 the back side can not claim 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.990
 this recommends the necessary power of 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.990
 a loudspeaker in an outdoor 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.910
 smartphone must have the battery, however 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.670
 Caterpillar does almost everything right 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.590
 24 hours a day this is considering 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.459
 even if you have it for some hours 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.459
 uses intensively
