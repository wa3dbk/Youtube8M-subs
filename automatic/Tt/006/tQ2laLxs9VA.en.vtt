than<00:00:12.599> later<00:00:12.750> I'm<00:00:13.380> sort<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.710> leaning<00:00:14.040> towards

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.760 
than later I'm sort of leaning towards
thinking<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.109> match<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.529> probably

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770

going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.160> money<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.640> bank<00:00:17.760> that

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
going to be at money in the bank that

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
going to be at money in the bank that
they're<00:00:18.359> probably<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> want<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> get

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
they're probably going to want to get

to be missing a lot of monday night
raw's<00:00:25.199> I'm<00:00:25.470> thinking<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.859> since<00:00:26.460> he's<00:00:26.670> back

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.060 
raw's I'm thinking that since he's back
part<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.560> roster<00:00:28.560> I'm<00:00:28.680> thinking<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
part of the roster I'm thinking that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.679 
part of the roster I'm thinking that
easy<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.609> every<00:00:29.849> raw<00:00:30.060> from<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.570> out

easy to be on every raw from here on out

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.020 
easy to be on every raw from here on out
and<00:00:30.960> possibly<00:00:31.529> being<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> guys<00:00:32.759> even

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
and possibly being one of the guys even

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.000 
and possibly being one of the guys even
jumps<00:00:33.420> over<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.719> tries<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> help<00:00:34.140> out<00:00:34.380> with
