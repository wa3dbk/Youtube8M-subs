 minutes completely forget that it is around 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.939

 it is a warm fluffy and 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.429
 totally sick fairy tale 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.890
 It is said that the magic was long ago 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.250
 time has disappeared from our world 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.289
 I wish you really could yet 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.360
 there is nothing more important than that 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.240
 wish of a little boy 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.219
 he gets as a gift for christmas 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.869
 He is one of those talking in berries 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.729
 I love you when you say it 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.310
 that's it, but that's it 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.110
 John has no friends and so will 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.909
 to his best friend 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 he really wishes that ted 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.280
 comes alive and this 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.280
 Christmas wish comes true 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.430
 this is a very funny scene 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.269
 worth talking to for the first time 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.269
 parents in the kitchen 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.319
 It's the story of a boy with 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.760
 a special relationship to one 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.690
 that was not really that 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.650
 the humor does not exist 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.600
 only the fulfillment of this wish 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.420
 but in the question what happens when 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:44.930
 they are smoking grass and would have been 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.930
 even more immature behaves as right 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.970
 Clearly beautiful would of course be stiff in the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.799
 step 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.389
 sap really had eggs in the pants he 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.970
 wanted everything as live and spontaneous as 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:00.319
 possible chain is the irreverent bear 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.319
 they have ever seen 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.159
 okay well that was one day too much 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.780
 He still gets only for adults 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:13.720
 I actually see that 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:16.739
 not the language is okay maybe 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.670
 it's a movie for adults 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.030
 i do not look at you and the towel 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.870
 the number throws me much too hairy 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.970
 corresponding teddy bears easy 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.170
 sometimes I think back to the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.859
 Christmas morning when I was eight years old 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.849
 I wish I had a few 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.849
 get gummy bears 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.700
 It's a relationship comedy as well 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.380
 a movie with action and adventure and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.380
 even with a few exciting questions 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.070
 Now comes a few names 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:21.190
 one after the other without being willing to 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:22.810
 bazar is my dad is it any 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.730
