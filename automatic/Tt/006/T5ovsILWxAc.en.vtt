settings for my camera if you think that

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.110 
settings for my camera if you think that
the<00:02:58.290> aspect<00:02:58.800> ratio<00:02:58.860> was<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> little<00:02:59.670> weird<00:02:59.880> on

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the aspect ratio was a little weird on

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.970 
the aspect ratio was a little weird on
this<00:03:00.390> when<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.600> upload<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.110> as<00:03:01.230> well<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:01.890> let

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
this when I upload it as well just let

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.259 
this when I upload it as well just let
me<00:03:02.160> know<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.430> I'll<00:03:02.519> probably<00:03:02.670> switch<00:03:03.000> back

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
me know and I'll probably switch back

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.630 
me know and I'll probably switch back
it's<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.350> previous<00:03:04.800> one<00:03:05.190> looked

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
it's just that the previous one looked

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.120 
it's just that the previous one looked
kind<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.209> off<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.410> don't<00:03:07.590> like<00:03:07.709> how<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.890> was<00:03:07.980> all

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
kind of off I don't like how it was all

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.949 
kind of off I don't like how it was all
stretched<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.730> I'm<00:03:08.820> kind<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.150> playing<00:03:09.630> up<00:03:09.840> with

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
stretched so I'm kind of playing up with

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.040 
stretched so I'm kind of playing up with
some<00:03:10.110> new<00:03:10.760> set<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.940> fate<00:03:12.120> see<00:03:12.600> features<00:03:12.930> on
