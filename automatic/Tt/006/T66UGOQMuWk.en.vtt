00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.100
 with files as they are I am bow and in 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.710
 this time I bring you a new video 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.900
 which is going to be a cheap team of 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.810
 Ecuadorian Colombians with a league 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.180
 Italian and everything combined ok 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.630
 You must prove it is very very good team 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.490
 and then let's see what players I have 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.220
 of goalkeeper can be any goalkeeper 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.779
 that you want in the Italian league 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.779
 I'm going by Samir Handanovic 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.700
 loose many rebounds but it is very good 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.010
 goalie 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.020
 here I have the central defender shilling and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.260
 that they already know the lateral 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.960
 right I have abate so that it has game 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.080
 with and chemistry with square that goes the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.900
 right end that and on this side 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.809
 will also put guarín that is a 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.130
 machine ok 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.870
 good 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.710
 the means of containment in the three 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.010
 containment means are Colombian 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.960
 they can put either darwin or ibarbo 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.400
 is what I recommend you can 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.560
 you do your experiments and 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.020
 send me to see how 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.899
 and central defense on the right side 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.689
 left I have cristian zapata del 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.350
 milan and from the left side I have 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.799
 gunsmith ok the only drawback is that 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.240
 does not have much game with fidel martínez 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.620
 that should be clearer of this team 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.480
 it costs 6 thousand 900 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.430
 why because it costs so much for the 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.040
 watermarks has five stars of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.740
 skill watermarks so they can 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.810
 you take advantage of long pass by the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 band and do skills and put salary and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.010
 either throw or pass the some 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.770
 containment that goes backwards 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.200
 this long in quintero here really 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.890
 It hurts a lot because it is very fast 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.470
 very quick then filter it yes to 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.880
 that reach it is this magna cannon the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.700
 and towers also has five 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.170
 filigree stars also driblea 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.750
 very very well quite well already dayro 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.080
 tan we have of centrodelantero not 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.900
 it's so high it's not that fast but although 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.200
 he has 73 shooting hits very well and 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.270
 has the 5 watermarks that are five 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.550
 filigree stars that helps you 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.630
 much off the central ok 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.540
 these players are the ones who could 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.510
 put of change to muriel of 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.430
 centerline or 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.330
 but the team has broken rondón 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.190
 because I wanted to try it but it 's at home 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.230
 At risk you can not put extreme 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.120
 right ok 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.730
 as you know things like pizzi barbo is 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.130
 a bouquets machine can also 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.170
 put in there from center forward is fine 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.050
 big when a 85 well it looks more 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.450
 big I still do not know what that but it's 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.640
 very well this front center 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.980
 ibarbo which is the change that I like the most 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.830
 do put it by darwin quintero like a 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.740
 the 60 minutes that I arrived fresquecito already 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.590
 the other players are already tired and 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.160
 this is a central effect machine 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.140
 they can either tuck this one but it takes off 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.750
 a little chemistry because it's not 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.730
 Colombian and they do not have the same chemistry 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.290
 with the other guys then that's why 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.000
 Cristian Zapata apart is very good 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.050
 Cristian Zapata is very big how much 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.400
 it's 1 87 if it's too big and 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.990
 well here it does straight continuation os 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.470
 I'm going to leave a series of goals that I put 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.200
 with this equipment I recommend you play 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.000
 more than anything by the bands and take advantage 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.090
 the five filigree stars that 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.410
 has fidel and five the four days 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.300
 that has a square 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.580
 cut to the center and move on 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.670
 some containment that comes and take advantage 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.070
 that is guarín and that is ibarbo him 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.770
 you hit very well from afar to put some 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.500
 golazos like the ones that right now are going to see or 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.090
 with dayro moreno to take advantage also 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.790
 its five filigree stars for 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.350
 take off defenses ok so good 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.640
 if they liked to good and the super 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.450
 coach 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.610
 gamero who is beautiful as a fool 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.400
 so if you liked the video leave your 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.379
 like and you thank them ok so the 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.060
 left with good goals great good goals 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.940
 but with some very good goals that 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.710
 I put out days we should not and they 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.980
 The project of this team costs 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.260
 around 20 thousand coins ok so that 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.000
 God is not expensive with 20 thousand coins the 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.960
 they do super well the team know what 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.580
 I recommend for minor from the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.890
 second season I do not recommend it 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.980
 so much because they are already very cancheros already 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.140
 you get players who run a lot and already 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.730
 they know what the second division is like but 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.370
 in the third fourth fifth division 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.080
 online season can be 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.360
 use without problems will result 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.360
 ok so see you 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.229
 ah 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.860
 A) Yes 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.630
 Yes, you
