video to show you my latest invention

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.820 
video to show you my latest invention
and<00:00:38.660> there<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:38.990> is<00:00:39.490> it's<00:00:40.490> a<00:00:40.820> vertical<00:00:41.830> railway

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
and there it is it's a vertical railway

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:51.280 
and there it is it's a vertical railway
system<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:45.400> call<00:00:46.400> it<00:00:46.490> the<00:00:46.610> sky<00:00:46.910> lift<00:00:50.290> main

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
system I call it the sky lift main

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.220 
system I call it the sky lift main
purpose<00:00:51.770> is<00:00:52.040> so<00:00:53.030> that<00:00:53.180> I<00:00:53.210> can<00:00:53.450> get<00:00:53.690> up<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:53.960> my

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
purpose is so that I can get up to my

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.570 
purpose is so that I can get up to my
sky<00:00:54.559> islands<00:00:56.230> faster<00:00:58.510> than<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.660> can<00:00:59.720> by<00:01:00.580> taking

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
sky islands faster than I can by taking

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.479 
sky islands faster than I can by taking
the<00:01:01.670> stairs<00:01:02.650> I'm<00:01:03.650> actually<00:01:03.800> gonna<00:01:04.040> time<00:01:04.460> it

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
the stairs I'm actually gonna time it

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.530 
the stairs I'm actually gonna time it
right<00:01:05.180> now<00:01:06.100> see<00:01:07.100> which<00:01:07.310> one<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.640> faster<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:11.450> I'm

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
right now see which one is faster so I'm

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.090 
right now see which one is faster so I'm
gonna<00:01:11.690> go<00:01:11.840> down<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.230> bottom<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.890> then

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
gonna go down to the bottom and then

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.630 
gonna go down to the bottom and then
come<00:01:13.730> up<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.970> stairs<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.800> time<00:01:15.800> it<00:01:18.550> okay<00:01:19.550> I'm

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
come up the stairs and time it okay I'm

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.800 
come up the stairs and time it okay I'm
now<00:01:19.820> at<00:01:20.150> about<00:01:20.390> ground<00:01:20.900> level<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:21.530> let's<00:01:22.690> go<00:01:23.690> up

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
now at about ground level so let's go up

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.510 
now at about ground level so let's go up
the<00:01:23.930> stairs<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.500> see<00:01:24.650> how<00:01:24.800> long<00:01:24.980> it<00:01:25.130> takes<00:01:25.400> me

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
the stairs and see how long it takes me

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:40.790 
the stairs and see how long it takes me
to<00:01:25.640> get<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.330> glass<00:01:27.290> walkway

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.160 

I'm<00:01:41.800> sure<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.220> is<00:01:42.540> probably<00:01:43.540> not<00:01:43.930> very

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
I'm sure this is probably not very

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.470 
I'm sure this is probably not very
exciting<00:01:44.680> but<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:45.370> just<00:01:45.610> wanted<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:45.970> do<00:01:46.120> this<00:01:46.300> in

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
exciting but I just wanted to do this in

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.610 
exciting but I just wanted to do this in
a<00:01:46.570> continuous<00:01:49.110> recording<00:01:50.110> without<00:01:50.380> editing

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
a continuous recording without editing

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.570 
a continuous recording without editing
this<00:01:51.040> just<00:01:51.370> so<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.520> can<00:01:51.640> get<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.270> whole<00:01:52.390> thing

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
this just so I can get the whole thing

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:02.910 
this just so I can get the whole thing
timed<00:01:59.520> just<00:02:00.520> want<00:02:00.730> to<00:02:00.790> see<00:02:00.940> if<00:02:01.030> my<00:02:01.530> my<00:02:02.530> new<00:02:02.680> rail

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
timed just want to see if my my new rail

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.180 
timed just want to see if my my new rail
track<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.460> faster<00:02:04.170> even<00:02:05.170> if<00:02:05.440> it<00:02:05.560> isn't<00:02:05.680> faster

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
track is faster even if it isn't faster

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.310 
track is faster even if it isn't faster
it's<00:02:06.310> probably<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.730> lot<00:02:06.850> more<00:02:07.030> fun<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.660> ride<00:02:08.170> up

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
it's probably a lot more fun to ride up

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:21.050 
it's probably a lot more fun to ride up
on<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:09.780> minecart<00:02:11.550> boom<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.850> now<00:02:12.910> we're<00:02:13.360> up<00:02:13.510> okay

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.020 

now<00:02:22.060> let's<00:02:22.510> try<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.870> sky<00:02:23.170> lift<00:02:26.610> yep<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.760> think<00:02:27.790> I

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
now let's try the sky lift yep I think I

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.710 
now let's try the sky lift yep I think I
have<00:02:28.209> a<00:02:28.239> cart<00:02:28.980> down<00:02:29.980> there<00:02:30.370> well<00:02:33.690> take<00:02:34.690> that

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
have a cart down there well take that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:49.660 
have a cart down there well take that
just<00:02:35.110> in<00:02:35.230> case<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.680> don't

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.699 

now<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.060> sort<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.480> wooden<00:02:51.720> walkway

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
now this is sort of a wooden walkway

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.830 
now this is sort of a wooden walkway
which<00:02:53.400> connects<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.060> lot<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.420> different

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
which connects a lot of the different

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.270 
which connects a lot of the different
build<00:02:55.260> areas<00:02:55.770> near<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.790> spawn<00:02:57.150> point<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:58.280> I

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
build areas near the spawn point and I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.309 
build areas near the spawn point and I
decided<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.760> make<00:03:00.000> my<00:03:01.610> station<00:03:03.110> connected<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
decided to make my station connected to

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.940 
decided to make my station connected to
the<00:03:04.500> walkway<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.250> there<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.000> there<00:03:06.950> this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
the walkway and there it is there this

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.589 
the walkway and there it is there this
is<00:03:08.160> where<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.400> get<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.819> minecart<00:03:09.300> and

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
is where you get in a minecart and

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:16.100 
is where you get in a minecart and
launch<00:03:09.840> yourself<00:03:10.700> up<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:12.180> tower<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.930> it

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
launch yourself up this tower and it

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.990 
launch yourself up this tower and it
deposits<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.800> up<00:03:16.980> there<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.489> let's<00:03:17.730> go<00:03:17.790> down

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
deposits you up there so let's go down

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.340 
deposits you up there so let's go down
there<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.209> look<00:03:18.330> at<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.140> view

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
there and look at that this is the view

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:36.280 
there and look at that this is the view
from<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.950> walkway

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.259 

I<00:03:36.319> call<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.129> sky<00:03:37.430> lift<00:03:37.700> station<00:03:43.000> way<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.120> works

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
I call it sky lift station way it works

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.420 
I call it sky lift station way it works
as<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.599> grab<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:44.930> minecart<00:03:46.480> out<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.689> the<00:03:47.780> chests

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
as you grab a minecart out of the chests

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.910 
as you grab a minecart out of the chests
I've<00:03:49.430> got<00:03:49.610> one<00:03:49.790> on<00:03:49.819> me<00:03:50.150> right<00:03:50.299> now

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
I've got one on me right now

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.390 
I've got one on me right now
place<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.640> there<00:03:52.909> then<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:53.480> push<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.810> button

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
place it there then you push the button

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.069 
place it there then you push the button
this<00:03:55.400> look<00:03:55.730> lights<00:03:56.150> up<00:03:56.390> when<00:03:56.659> you<00:03:56.750> push<00:03:56.930> the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
this look lights up when you push the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.850 
this look lights up when you push the
button<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:57.560> see<00:03:57.860> that<00:03:59.110> that<00:04:00.110> activates<00:04:00.739> a

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
button you see that that activates a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.130 
button you see that that activates a
powered<00:04:01.220> rail<00:04:01.310> which<00:04:01.700> pushes<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.420> because<00:04:03.019> it

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
powered rail which pushes you because it

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.839 
powered rail which pushes you because it
has<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.319> block<00:04:03.650> behind<00:04:03.859> it<00:04:04.159> pushes<00:04:04.549> you<00:04:04.670> in<00:04:04.760> the

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.809 
has a block behind it pushes you in the
opposite<00:04:05.239> direction<00:04:06.069> just<00:04:07.069> enough<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.459> get<00:04:07.579> to

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
opposite direction just enough to get to

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.839 
opposite direction just enough to get to
this<00:04:08.890> powered<00:04:09.890> rail<00:04:10.129> which<00:04:10.400> is<00:04:10.430> powered<00:04:10.819> by

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
this powered rail which is powered by

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.899 
this powered rail which is powered by
this

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
this

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.199 
this
redstone<00:04:13.909> light<00:04:14.980> which<00:04:15.980> pushes<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.669> up<00:04:16.910> and

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
redstone light which pushes you up and

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.750 
redstone light which pushes you up and
gets<00:04:17.449> you<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:18.079> this<00:04:18.199> point<00:04:18.549> where<00:04:19.549> this

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
gets you to this point where this

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.620 
gets you to this point where this
powered<00:04:20.269> rail<00:04:20.419> pushes<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.870> little<00:04:21.139> further<00:04:21.350> and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
powered rail pushes a little further and

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.980 
powered rail pushes a little further and
etc<00:04:23.630> etc<00:04:23.930> etc<00:04:24.590> I<00:04:27.669> think<00:04:28.669> I<00:04:29.300> tried<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.630> make<00:04:29.840> it

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
etc etc etc I think I tried to make it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.170 
etc etc etc I think I tried to make it
as<00:04:30.110> compact<00:04:30.620> as<00:04:30.830> possible<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.639> I<00:04:31.699> think<00:04:31.729> I'm

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
as compact as possible and I think I'm

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.360 
as compact as possible and I think I'm
I'm<00:04:32.810> at<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.169> minimum<00:04:33.560> here<00:04:36.010> so<00:04:37.010> I<00:04:37.039> couldn't

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
I'm at the minimum here so I couldn't

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.000 
I'm at the minimum here so I couldn't
it's<00:04:38.180> four<00:04:38.990> by<00:04:39.139> four<00:04:40.930> blocks<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.229> couldn't<00:04:42.560> find

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
it's four by four blocks I couldn't find

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.080 
it's four by four blocks I couldn't find
a<00:04:43.130> way<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.310> make<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.919> three<00:04:45.919> by<00:04:46.070> three

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.130 

anyway<00:04:51.090> let's

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:02.120 

let's<00:04:55.680> try<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:58.220> okay<00:04:59.570> let's<00:05:00.570> uh<00:05:00.770> let's<00:05:01.770> hit<00:05:02.010> the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
let's try it okay let's uh let's hit the

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:39.300 
let's try it okay let's uh let's hit the
button<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.520> go<00:05:02.760> up

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.390 

and<00:05:40.310> rump<00:05:40.730> and<00:05:41.260> when<00:05:42.260> I<00:05:42.290> exit<00:05:42.710> here<00:05:42.950> I<00:05:42.980> wind<00:05:43.280> up

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
and rump and when I exit here I wind up

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.620 
and rump and when I exit here I wind up
behind<00:05:43.580> this<00:05:43.910> button<00:05:45.850> like<00:05:46.850> that<00:05:49.420> and<00:05:50.420> if<00:05:50.540> I

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
behind this button like that and if I

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.240 
behind this button like that and if I
get<00:05:50.810> in<00:05:50.960> and<00:05:51.080> push<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.350> button<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:51.740> pushes<00:05:52.100> me

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
get in and push the button it pushes me

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.530 
get in and push the button it pushes me
back<00:05:52.840> down<00:05:53.840> and<00:05:53.960> make<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.260> return<00:05:54.560> trip<00:05:56.740> so

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
back down and make the return trip so

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.920 
back down and make the return trip so
that's<00:05:59.540> the<00:05:59.840> sky<00:06:00.080> lift<00:06:01.480> let<00:06:02.480> me<00:06:02.570> know<00:06:02.720> what<00:06:02.840> you

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
that's the sky lift let me know what you

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.620 
that's the sky lift let me know what you
think<00:06:03.170> I<00:06:06.580> don't<00:06:07.580> show<00:06:07.820> you<00:06:07.910> what<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.180> return

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:49.730 
think I don't show you what the return
trip<00:06:08.840> looks<00:06:09.170> like

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.540 

and<00:06:50.740> that's<00:06:51.100> that<00:06:52.860> if<00:06:53.860> you're<00:06:54.039> playing<00:06:54.310> in<00:06:54.460> the
