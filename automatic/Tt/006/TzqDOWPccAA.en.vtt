00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
infectious disease program and we are

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.239

investigating<00:01:33.569> white-box<00:01:34.499> disease<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.159> the

of that

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.350 
of that
so<00:01:39.890> what<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.580> source<00:01:40.820> of<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.210> disease

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
so what is the source of the disease

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.720 
so what is the source of the disease
what<00:01:42.350> are<00:01:42.530> potential<00:01:43.010> vectors<00:01:43.430> and

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
what are potential vectors and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.210 
what are potential vectors and
reservoirs<00:01:44.330> for<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.900> disease<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.950> marine

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.370 
sees when we went to the Florida Keys
this<00:02:14.270> summer<00:02:14.480> as<00:02:14.660> part<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.050> student

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this summer as part of the student

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.090 
this summer as part of the student
faculty<00:02:15.500> research<00:02:16.190> we<00:02:16.940> went<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.870> brief<00:02:18.470> in

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
faculty research we went to a brief in

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.610 
faculty research we went to a brief in
the<00:02:19.220> middle<00:02:19.430> keys<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.000> what<00:02:20.510> our<00:02:20.690> plan<00:02:20.990> was<00:02:21.260> we

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
the middle keys and what our plan was we

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.350 
the middle keys and what our plan was we
went<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.130> early<00:02:22.459> summer<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.060> did<00:02:23.240> not

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
went in the early summer and we did not

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.970 
went in the early summer and we did not
expect<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.840> see<00:02:24.050> white<00:02:24.230> box<00:02:24.500> because<00:02:24.800> white

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
expect to see white box because white

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.070 
expect to see white box because white
box<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.370> very<00:02:25.580> much<00:02:25.790> temperature<00:02:26.240> associated

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
box is very much temperature associated

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.660 
box is very much temperature associated
so<00:02:27.260> when<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.560> temperatures<00:02:27.980> give<00:02:28.160> warmer<00:02:28.520> the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
so when the temperatures give warmer the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.010 
so when the temperatures give warmer the
corals<00:02:29.030> get<00:02:29.209> stressed<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.750> they<00:02:29.810> show<00:02:29.990> signs

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
corals get stressed and they show signs

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.530 
corals get stressed and they show signs
of<00:02:30.470> disease<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.520> we<00:02:31.670> went<00:02:31.850> in<00:02:32.030> early<00:02:32.330> summer

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
of disease so we went in early summer

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.000 
of disease so we went in early summer
and<00:02:32.900> hopes<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.290> getting<00:02:33.380> baseline

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
and hopes of getting baseline

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.430 
and hopes of getting baseline
information<00:02:34.370> about<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.630> chloral<00:02:35.959> community

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
information about the chloral community

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.500 
information about the chloral community
and<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.070> microbes<00:02:37.550> associated<00:02:38.360> their

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
and the microbes associated their

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.810 
and the microbes associated their
community<00:02:38.959> before<00:02:39.140> disease<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:40.310> we<00:02:40.550> went<00:02:40.670> to

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
community before disease so we went to

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.990 
community before disease so we went to
the<00:02:41.000> reef<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.330> collected<00:02:42.050> this<00:02:42.680> mucus<00:02:43.340> from

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
the reef and collected this mucus from

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.580 
the reef and collected this mucus from
the<00:02:44.180> surface<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.630> corals<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.140> corals<00:02:45.500> have

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
the surface of corals and corals have

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.020 
the surface of corals and corals have
mucus<00:02:45.769> just<00:02:46.160> like<00:02:46.310> humans<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:46.880> their

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
mucus just like humans and it's their

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.030 
mucus just like humans and it's their
first<00:02:47.209> line<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.540> defense<00:02:47.989> just<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.680> humans

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
first line of defense just like humans

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.920 
first line of defense just like humans
so<00:02:49.519> they're<00:02:49.760> covered<00:02:50.150> with<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.420> mucus<00:02:50.660> layer

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
so they're covered with this mucus layer

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.199 
so they're covered with this mucus layer
that's<00:02:51.260> loaded<00:02:51.800> with<00:02:51.830> bacteria<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.790> protect

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
that's loaded with bacteria that protect

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.630 
that's loaded with bacteria that protect
them<00:02:53.500> against<00:02:54.500> pathogens<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.459> then

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
them against pathogens and then

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.100 
them against pathogens and then
sometimes<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.269> pathogen<00:02:56.720> becomes

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
sometimes a pathogen becomes

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.780 
sometimes a pathogen becomes
incorporated<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.890> this<00:02:58.010> mucus<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:59.000> cause

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
incorporated in this mucus and can cause

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.580 
incorporated in this mucus and can cause
after<00:03:00.790> diabetes<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.659> had<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.900> filter<00:03:02.349> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
after diabetes you had the filter and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.800 
after diabetes you had the filter and
process<00:03:03.400> all<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.670> samples<00:03:03.909> in<00:03:04.360> order<00:03:04.629> to<00:03:04.690> get

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
process all the samples in order to get

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.360 
process all the samples in order to get
their<00:03:04.989> genetic<00:03:05.349> fingerprint<00:03:05.920> which<00:03:06.159> would

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
their genetic fingerprint which would

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.820 
their genetic fingerprint which would
later<00:03:06.519> be<00:03:06.790> compared<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.450> other<00:03:07.959> fingerprints

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
later be compared to other fingerprints

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.309 
later be compared to other fingerprints
of<00:03:09.069> bacteria<00:03:10.030> we<00:03:10.120> found<00:03:10.360> during<00:03:11.049> later

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
of bacteria we found during later

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
with the various classes umbrella so it

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.250 
with the various classes umbrella so it
showed<00:03:49.390> me<00:03:49.950> not<00:03:50.950> just<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:52.090> lab<00:03:52.329> aspect<00:03:53.109> but

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
showed me not just the lab aspect but

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.699 
showed me not just the lab aspect but
also<00:03:53.319> at<00:03:53.709> various<00:03:54.040> field<00:03:54.340> aspect<00:03:54.849> which<00:03:55.090> is
