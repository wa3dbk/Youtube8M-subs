00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
years into something darker I think that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.740

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.740 

ah<00:00:53.949> well<00:00:54.429> they<00:00:55.089> tried<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.329> number<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.660> different

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
ah well they tried a number of different

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.310 
ah well they tried a number of different
goats<00:00:56.109> doing<00:00:56.440> experiments<00:00:57.280> they<00:00:57.550> were

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
goats doing experiments they were

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.200 
goats doing experiments they were
important<00:00:59.320> they<00:00:59.379> had<00:00:59.500> 30<00:00:59.829> goats<00:01:00.309> in<00:01:00.789> a<00:01:00.909> room

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
important they had 30 goats in a room

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.079 
important they had 30 goats in a room
and<00:01:01.930> they<00:01:02.050> put<00:01:02.260> numbers<00:01:02.800> on<00:01:03.010> on<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.460> goats<00:01:03.670> 12

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
and they put numbers on on the goats 12

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.120 
and they put numbers on on the goats 12
30<00:01:04.479> and<00:01:04.629> they're<00:01:04.750> all<00:01:04.869> staring<00:01:05.110> at<00:01:05.290> number<00:01:05.740> 16

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
30 and they're all staring at number 16

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.310 
30 and they're all staring at number 16
and<00:01:06.630> number<00:01:07.630> 17<00:01:08.229> apparently<00:01:09.130> fell<00:01:09.340> over<00:01:10.320> which

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
and number 17 apparently fell over which

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.190 
and number 17 apparently fell over which
I<00:01:11.440> guess<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.649> collateral<00:01:12.520> damage<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
I guess is collateral damage and the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.960 
I guess is collateral damage and the
goats<00:01:17.860> are<00:01:18.009> in<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.130> kind<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.310> shaking<00:01:18.640> medical

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
goats are in a kind of shaking medical

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.249 
goats are in a kind of shaking medical
condition<00:01:19.330> anyway<00:01:19.570> because<00:01:19.840> they<00:01:20.020> were<00:01:20.110> like

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
condition anyway because they were like

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.679 
condition anyway because they were like
lab<00:01:20.560> goats<00:01:20.979> that<00:01:21.340> had<00:01:21.430> been<00:01:21.610> shot<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.570> know

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
lab goats that had been shot you know

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.719 
lab goats that had been shot you know
first<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.409> then<00:01:23.500> nursed<00:01:23.770> back<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.070> health<00:01:24.220> so

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
first and then nursed back to health so

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.190 
first and then nursed back to health so
I<00:01:24.759> think<00:01:24.939> you<00:01:25.210> should<00:01:25.360> probably<00:01:25.509> assume<00:01:25.929> that

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
I think you should probably assume that

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.499 
I think you should probably assume that
if<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:27.220> he<00:01:27.340> got<00:01:27.490> did<00:01:27.729> fall<00:01:27.940> over<00:01:28.240> during<00:01:28.420> the

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
if and he got did fall over during the

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.999 
if and he got did fall over during the
staring<00:01:28.869> experiment<00:01:29.440> it<00:01:29.530> was<00:01:29.619> either<00:01:29.740> out<00:01:29.979> of

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
staring experiment it was either out of

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.010 
staring experiment it was either out of
a<00:01:30.280> pre-existing<00:01:30.550> medical<00:01:31.090> condition<00:01:31.869> or

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
a pre-existing medical condition or

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.330 
a pre-existing medical condition or
possibly<00:01:32.770> boredom

warm-hearted and I think the books
warm-hearted<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.849> book<00:02:54.030> takes<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.750> darker

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
turn than the film does the second half

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.319 
turn than the film does the second half
of<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.709> book<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:58.890> quite<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.760> quite<00:02:59.790> dark
