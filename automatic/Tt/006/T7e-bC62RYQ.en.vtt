00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
and check out how thin that blade is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.010 
and check out how thin that blade is
along<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> top

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
along the top

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.719 
along the top
in<00:01:40.290> fact<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:42.240> give<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> little<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
in fact it give you a little bit of a

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.899 
in fact it give you a little bit of a
measurement<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.299> where<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.570> thick

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
measurement right here where it's thick

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.770 
measurement right here where it's thick
2.5<00:01:47.909> millimeters<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:50.790> along<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> spine

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
2.5 millimeters and then along the spine

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.350 
2.5 millimeters and then along the spine
where<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.710> swedge<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.780> 0.82<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> very<00:01:56.759> slim

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
where that swedge is 0.82 so very slim

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.510 
where that swedge is 0.82 so very slim
