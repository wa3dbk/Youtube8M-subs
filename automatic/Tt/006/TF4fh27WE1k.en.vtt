00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:11.650
 greetings today we are going to change 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:15.670
 desktop icons 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.299
 in windows home windows 7 premiun and 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.299
 understand 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.440
 sometimes it can pull us we move in a 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.440
 screen icons 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.200
 Y 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.930
 with figures this 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.980
 and rare or not with the figures that are not 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.350
 the correct ones that must be for the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.039
 program software 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.910
 as we see here we have the grand theft 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.910
 auto san andrÃ©s the icon does not show 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.800
 the figure 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:00.450
 what should be for the program 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.270
 then come on we give you right click us 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.950
 we go to properties and in law in the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.869
 property icon 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.890
 and here in shortcut here where it says 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.890
 where is the flex 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.850
 we are going to change and as here it is 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.460
 down here 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.210
 sometimes it comes out by default or we 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.770
 must exit by the status of the icon 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.770
 as used by a certain 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.840
 but sometimes with this kind of errors 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:45.100
 that is not shown not to live accept 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.660
 to show this icon I'm going to 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 apply and already if it was shown when you do not 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.600
 sample we have to look for the route 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.640
 again we click on change icon we 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.670
 let's examine 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.670
 and we are going to do in this case 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.280
 i 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.310
 in this case we are looking for the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.569
 the folder 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.960
 where it's saved 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.150
 my program 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.750
 and in this case and we can see the route 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.750
 is in rockstar games, let's see 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.670
 should be in c they were usually saved 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.180
 now in what are archives of 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.740
 x86 program to these new 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.160
 these new with all our new 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.160
 this software as not even so new 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.209
 rockstar with served 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.340
 good if we want to change it 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.340
 for example to 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:15.960
 of these two we can be two points 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.370
 excel is where we're going 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.370
 to put the 21 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.350
 and here he throws us a list of a line 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.350
 of icons 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.480
 we can apply this 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.480
 and here we see how they change 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:43.350
 Of course , that's good icon 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.590
 desired but this is the icon is the 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.580
 way how to change icons 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.110
 we need to know the route 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.440
 destiny 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:01.330
 and that is the excel 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.500
 and he's going to throw the icon strip at us 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.500
 nothing else brings one 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.200
 and that's how we change the icons
