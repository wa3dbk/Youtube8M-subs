for<00:01:57.540> problem<00:01:58.140> matches<00:01:58.909> and<00:01:59.909> all<00:02:00.329> i'll<00:02:00.689> use<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
for problem matches and all i'll use the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.399 
for problem matches and all i'll use the
legos<00:02:01.320> will<00:02:01.560> holla<00:02:01.799> d<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:03.170> jump<00:02:04.170> around

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
legos will holla d for like jump around

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.050 
legos will holla d for like jump around
holler<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.040> far<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.340> glitches<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
holler and you get far more glitches and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.390 
holler and you get far more glitches and
stuff<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.829> pretty<00:02:08.069> cool<00:02:09.259> also<00:02:10.400> there

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
stuff so that's pretty cool also there

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.360 
stuff so that's pretty cool also there
will<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.849> strug<00:02:12.209> packages

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
will be like strug packages

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.640 
will be like strug packages
killstreaks<00:02:13.790> whatever<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.269> held<00:02:14.650> and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
killstreaks whatever is held and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.890 
killstreaks whatever is held and
probably<00:02:16.340> support<00:02:16.849> and<00:02:17.060> whatever<00:02:17.599> else<00:02:17.690> they

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
probably support and whatever else they

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.710 
probably support and whatever else they
can<00:02:18.049> think<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:20.830> yeah<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.970> also<00:02:23.120> says<00:02:23.450> here

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
can think of and yeah it also says here

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.149 
can think of and yeah it also says here
that<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.900> point<00:02:24.200> system<00:02:24.379> we<00:02:24.620> can<00:02:24.739> but<00:02:24.920> we<00:02:25.010> come

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
that the point system we can but we come

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.140 
that the point system we can but we come
back<00:02:25.370> from<00:02:25.519> black<00:02:25.760> ops<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.790> ranking

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
back from black ops and the ranking

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.110 
back from black ops and the ranking
system<00:02:29.510> will<00:02:29.629> be<00:02:29.720> changed<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:31.190> when<00:02:31.849> I<00:02:31.879> first

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
system will be changed and when I first

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.490 
system will be changed and when I first
read<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.420> i<00:02:32.569> wasn't<00:02:32.810> too<00:02:32.989> happy<00:02:33.140> about<00:02:33.349> it

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
read that i wasn't too happy about it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.710 
read that i wasn't too happy about it
because<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:34.040> did<00:02:34.190> like<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.489> old<00:02:34.610> one<00:02:34.819> they've

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
because I did like the old one they've

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.210 
because I did like the old one they've
been<00:02:35.840> using<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.260> since<00:02:36.290> early<00:02:36.739> qaulity

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
been using it since early qaulity

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.259 
been using it since early qaulity
foreign<00:02:37.579> it's<00:02:37.670> been<00:02:37.790> working<00:02:37.940> out<00:02:38.120> pretty

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
foreign it's been working out pretty

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.759 
foreign it's been working out pretty
good<00:02:39.220> but<00:02:40.220> that's<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.180> Treyarch<00:02:42.110> pieces<00:02:42.650> look

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
good but that's it Treyarch pieces look

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.069 
good but that's it Treyarch pieces look
like<00:02:43.239> Jared<00:02:44.239> eats<00:02:44.480> anyways<00:02:44.810> they<00:02:44.930> don't

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
like Jared eats anyways they don't

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.780 
like Jared eats anyways they don't
really<00:02:45.200> know<00:02:45.349> how<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.500> make<00:02:45.560> Google<00:02:45.890> game<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
really know how to make Google game and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.970 
really know how to make Google game and
yeah<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.989> also<00:02:51.140> says<00:02:51.470> here<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:51.739> a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
yeah so it also says here that a

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.330 
yeah so it also says here that a
multiplayer<00:02:53.079> like<00:02:54.079> most<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:54.890> game<00:02:55.069> modes

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
multiplayer like most of the game modes

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.910 
multiplayer like most of the game modes
will<00:02:55.609> be<00:02:55.819> even<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.269> hardcore<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.049> core<00:02:57.379> so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
will be even to hardcore and core so

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.490 
will be even to hardcore and core so
used<00:02:58.129> to<00:02:58.220> choose<00:02:58.900> which<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.079> good<00:03:00.290> because<00:03:00.409> a

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
used to choose which is good because a

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.280 
used to choose which is good because a
lot<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.709> people<00:03:00.799> do<00:03:01.069> like<00:03:01.310> hardcore<00:03:05.290> there

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
lot of people do like hardcore there

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.940 
lot of people do like hardcore there
will<00:03:06.379> be<00:03:06.500> ten<00:03:06.680> prestigious<00:03:07.329> and<00:03:08.620> it's<00:03:09.620> not

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
will be ten prestigious and it's not

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.030 
will be ten prestigious and it's not
confirmed<00:03:10.489> how<00:03:10.760> many<00:03:10.909> levels<00:03:11.120> 0<00:03:11.269> BS<00:03:12.040> but

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
confirmed how many levels 0 BS but

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.650 
confirmed how many levels 0 BS but
oscillator<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.150> probably<00:03:14.390> like<00:03:14.750> around<00:03:14.900> 70<00:03:15.500> I

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
oscillator is probably like around 70 I

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.460 
oscillator is probably like around 70 I
don't<00:03:17.660> think<00:03:17.720> it's<00:03:17.959> going<00:03:18.049> to<00:03:18.109> be<00:03:18.200> like<00:03:18.290> around

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
don't think it's going to be like around

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.280 
don't think it's going to be like around
50<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.130> time<00:03:19.340> because<00:03:19.660> he<00:03:20.660> never<00:03:20.810> had<00:03:21.049> a<00:03:21.079> lot

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
50 this time because he never had a lot

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.120 
50 this time because he never had a lot
of<00:03:21.319> stuff<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.769> latch<00:03:21.980> or<00:03:22.220> whatever<00:03:23.079> and

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
of stuff on latch or whatever and

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.640 
of stuff on latch or whatever and
another<00:03:25.130> thing<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.669> a<00:03:25.900> trek<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.109> saying<00:03:27.349> here

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
another thing that a trek is saying here

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.470 
another thing that a trek is saying here
is<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.889> they're<00:03:28.790> going<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.090> try<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.239> upgrade

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
is that they're going to try to upgrade

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.550 
is that they're going to try to upgrade
up<00:03:30.049> like<00:03:30.440> update<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:31.040> graphics<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.700> the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
up like update the graphics and the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.809 
up like update the graphics and the
graphics<00:03:33.560> are<00:03:33.889> pretty<00:03:33.919> go<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.250> nikogda<00:03:34.549> d

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
graphics are pretty go to nikogda d

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.670 
graphics are pretty go to nikogda d
games<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.419> it<00:03:36.049> will<00:03:36.169> just<00:03:36.290> make<00:03:36.349> it<00:03:36.470> more

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
games so it will just make it more

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.930 
games so it will just make it more
realistic<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:38.200> there's<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.260> lot<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.470> like

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
realistic and there's a lot of like

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.920 
realistic and there's a lot of like
people<00:03:40.940> going<00:03:41.120> around<00:03:41.239> saying<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.690> Kyle

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
people going around saying that Kyle

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.420 
people going around saying that Kyle
duty<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.379> just<00:03:42.560> recycled<00:03:43.040> material<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
duty is just recycled material and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.439 
duty is just recycled material and
anyways<00:03:46.430> what<00:03:46.669> treyarch<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.090> trying<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.359> do

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
anyways what treyarch is trying to do

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:48.819 
anyways what treyarch is trying to do
this<00:03:47.599> time<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:47.840> trying<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.349> change<00:03:48.530> up<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
this time is trying to change up the

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.949 
this time is trying to change up the
collar<00:03:49.010> duty<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.310> bit<00:03:49.519> so<00:03:49.790> they<00:03:50.660> won't<00:03:50.810> be<00:03:50.870> able

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
collar duty a bit so they won't be able

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.890 
collar duty a bit so they won't be able
to<00:03:51.109> say<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.260> it's<00:03:51.530> recycled<00:03:52.220> material<00:03:52.900> so

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
to say that it's recycled material so

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.420 
to say that it's recycled material so
that's<00:03:54.049> gonna<00:03:54.169> be<00:03:54.260> kind<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.500> interesting<00:03:54.739> it's

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
that's gonna be kind of interesting it's

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.500 
that's gonna be kind of interesting it's
probably<00:03:55.549> going<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.849> be<00:03:55.910> like<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.150> different

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
probably going to be like a different
