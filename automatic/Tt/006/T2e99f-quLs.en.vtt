00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
defense something I don't usually have

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.319 
defense something I don't usually have
happen<00:03:04.739> for<00:03:04.980> me<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.220> we're<00:03:05.640> continuing<00:03:05.819> now

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
happen for me and we're continuing now

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.839 
happen for me and we're continuing now
to<00:03:06.750> throw<00:03:06.989> short<00:03:07.319> passes<00:03:07.769> here<00:03:08.010> should<00:03:08.730> have

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
to throw short passes here should have

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.789 
to throw short passes here should have
been<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> first<00:03:09.299> down<00:03:09.480> there<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.260> wasn't<00:03:10.680> I

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
been a first down there but it wasn't I

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.470 
been a first down there but it wasn't I
decided<00:03:11.160> then<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.459> punt<00:03:11.879> and<00:03:12.120> give<00:03:12.329> my

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
decided then to punt and give my

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.330 
decided then to punt and give my
opponent<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.959> chance<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.470> easily<00:03:13.950> could<00:03:14.190> have

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
opponent to chance I easily could have

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.410 
opponent to chance I easily could have
probably<00:03:14.489> picked<00:03:14.849> that<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:15.150> up<00:03:15.209> on

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
probably picked that one up on

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.580 
probably picked that one up on
fourth-and-inches<00:03:15.870> but<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.200> was<00:03:16.319> trying<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.500> be

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
fourth-and-inches but I was trying to be

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.050 
fourth-and-inches but I was trying to be
a<00:03:16.650> nice<00:03:16.799> guy<00:03:16.859> trying<00:03:17.669> to<00:03:17.700> give<00:03:17.849> him<00:03:17.970> an

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
a nice guy trying to give him an

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.339 
a nice guy trying to give him an
opportunity<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.660> put<00:03:18.810> some<00:03:18.959> points<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
opportunity to put some points on the

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.960 
opportunity to put some points on the
board<00:03:19.440> himself<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.609> he<00:03:20.700> doesn't<00:03:20.819> get

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
board himself so he doesn't get

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.370 
board himself so he doesn't get
embarrassed<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.569> he<00:03:21.780> throws<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.169> one

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380

almost<00:03:22.590> into<00:03:23.099> coverage<00:03:23.519> again<00:03:23.910> probably

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
almost into coverage again probably

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.330 
almost into coverage again probably
could<00:03:24.540> have<00:03:24.569> been<00:03:24.750> intercepted<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.530> finally

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340

when<00:03:48.989> when<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.650> try<00:03:49.829> to<00:03:49.859> be<00:03:50.010> an<00:03:50.099> a-hole<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.579> go

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
when when you try to be an a-hole and go

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.970 
when when you try to be an a-hole and go
for<00:03:51.269> two<00:03:51.450> for<00:03:51.720> no<00:03:51.870> reason<00:03:52.349> they're<00:03:52.709> really

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
for two for no reason they're really

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.009 
for two for no reason they're really
really<00:03:53.819> was<00:03:53.970> no<00:03:54.150> reason<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.599> him<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.750> go<00:03:54.870> for

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
really was no reason for him to go for

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.289 
really was no reason for him to go for
two<00:03:55.139> honestly<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.370> he's<00:03:56.579> gonna<00:03:56.700> be<00:03:56.790> back<00:03:57.269> on

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
two honestly and he's gonna be back on

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.180 
two honestly and he's gonna be back on
offense<00:03:57.629> now<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.319> throw<00:03:58.769> another

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
offense now and throw another

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.890 
offense now and throw another
interception<00:03:59.849> here<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.269> think<00:04:00.510> what<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.810> that

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
interception here I think what is that

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.750 
interception here I think what is that
his<00:04:01.079> fifth<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.769> game<00:04:02.129> I<00:04:02.160> mean<00:04:02.459> obviously

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
his fifth of this game I mean obviously

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.879 
his fifth of this game I mean obviously
a<00:04:03.120> terrible<00:04:03.750> performance<00:04:04.290> by<00:04:04.410> him<00:04:04.620> throwing

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
a terrible performance by him throwing

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.530 
a terrible performance by him throwing
the<00:04:05.069> football<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.519> this<00:04:05.639> one<00:04:05.819> nearly<00:04:06.239> brought

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
the football in this one nearly brought

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.830 
the football in this one nearly brought
that<00:04:06.750> thing<00:04:06.780> back<00:04:07.109> there<00:04:07.379> by<00:04:07.500> Vontae<00:04:07.859> Davis

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
that thing back there by Vontae Davis

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.569 
that thing back there by Vontae Davis
but<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:09.870> look<00:04:10.319> at<00:04:10.440> Cam<00:04:10.650> Newton<00:04:10.949> here<00:04:11.099> breaking<00:04:11.400> a

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
but I look at Cam Newton here breaking a

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.309 
but I look at Cam Newton here breaking a
tackle<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.180> he's<00:04:12.480> gonna<00:04:12.629> throw<00:04:12.930> this<00:04:13.079> one<00:04:13.139> in
