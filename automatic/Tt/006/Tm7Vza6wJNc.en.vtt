00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
sit on it miss her moments like that I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.430 
sit on it miss her moments like that I
would<00:00:49.890> assume<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.390> too

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.790 

substrates<00:00:59.440> um<00:00:59.739> I<00:01:00.220> don't<00:01:00.340> really<00:01:00.640> use<00:01:01.000> any<00:01:01.300> um

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
substrates um I don't really use any um

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.630 
substrates um I don't really use any um
I<00:01:02.940> found<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:04.180> costly<00:01:05.430> unnecessary<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:08.640> hard

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
I found it costly unnecessary and hard

I found it costly unnecessary and hard
to<00:01:09.850> clean<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.880> want<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.330> use<00:01:13.510> substrate

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
to clean if you want to use substrate

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.960 
to clean if you want to use substrate
the<00:01:14.590> only<00:01:14.800> thing<00:01:14.950> I<00:01:15.040> would<00:01:15.190> really<00:01:15.430> use<00:01:15.520> is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
the only thing I would really use is

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.170 
the only thing I would really use is
paper<00:01:16.240> towel<00:01:17.160> maybe<00:01:18.160> if<00:01:18.550> you're<00:01:18.759> going<00:01:19.030> into

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180

breeding<00:01:19.600> these<00:01:19.900> guys<00:01:20.200> which<00:01:20.590> is<00:01:20.800> also

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
breeding these guys which is also

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.109 
breeding these guys which is also
unnecessary<00:01:22.920> unless<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.520> live<00:01:24.729> somewhere

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
use coconut fiber at the bottom pretty

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.120 
use coconut fiber at the bottom pretty
dry<00:01:33.070> coconut<00:01:33.399> fibers<00:01:34.090> still<00:01:34.800> moist<00:01:35.800> enough
