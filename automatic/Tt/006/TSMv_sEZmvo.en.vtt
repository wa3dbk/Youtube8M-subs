00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello everyone with you channel beauty ksyu 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.049
 today I would like to tell you about 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.910
 tom what not to do to 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.620
 did your hair fall out if in your life 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.900
 there was some kind of life change 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.350
 some very big stress 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.140
 it is most likely in time from six 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.039
 weeks to 3 months your hair will begin 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.070
 fall out 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.160
 and the fall will start very much and 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.099
 it will last until that period 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.010
 your life will not come normal normal 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.980
 mode that is as soon as you get rid 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.920
 from stress you will look positively on 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.040
 life your hair will stop falling out 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.469
 that is, the first rule is not nervous and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.309
 even if what happened in your life 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.100
 or you need to quickly adjust your stress 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.870
 attitude from this your hair will be 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.620
 look beautiful we make ourselves very 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.359
 tight hairstyles and tails for example 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.689
 very tight tail tighten 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.190
 very tight pulling braid we wear 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.460
 often extended 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.060
 braid your hair in afrokrosichki all these 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.850
 manipulations are very bad for hair 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.340
 and contribute to their chafing due 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.480
 this is not immediately clear in time 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.380
 again start falling hair 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:32.150
 so of course you can rarely do 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.060
 other hairstyles but daily best 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.890
 braid for example just such a pigtail 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.610
 more romantic till she is not 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.950
 squeezed hair if it's a tail then one 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.470
 day it can be made higher another day 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 below so that there is no permanent place 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.290
 friction that is because of this is also very 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.750
 hair still fall out more hair 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.410
 drops out because every day either 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.310
 we often use hair dryers and ironing 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.970
 for straightening these all devices too 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.040
 greatly impair the hair structure and 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.750
 promote brittle hair 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.830
 therefore, it is desirable to limit the use 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.459
 a hair dryer to dry the best curling iron; 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.989
 hair naturally but if needed 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.030
 hairstyle then when the hair is already dried and 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.610
 in a natural way you can just a little 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.070
 hair dryer go make your form so your 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.920
 hair will not suffer from exposure 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.230
 hot air 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.620
 you cannot comb your hair when they are 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.980
 wet wet hair is very fragile and 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.440
 brittle when you come out of the shower is not worth it 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.630
 immediately grasp at the comb need 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.630
 wait a bit for hair to dry 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.750
 and then combing them in the same place 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.060
 advised immediately after a shower stab 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.400
 wet hair for example a hairpin for 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.810
 so they do not interfere it also hurts 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.850
 hair and promote their loss 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.270
 lovers of diets or various 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.340
 fasting through time will see that their 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.130
 shag is becoming less and less 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.410
 due to poor nutrition very quickly 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.680
 hair falls out as they lack 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.010
 proteins proteins and other trace elements 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.710
 very good hair affects the greens it 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.650
 parsley dill and a variety of salad 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.690
 spinach leaves and seafood 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.020
 that is, they just noticed that your hair 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.800
 start falling out starting to eat 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:37.170
 shrimps with spinach and parsley and everything 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.420
 the main thing is to comply with these five 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.430
 points plus make masks on care and 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.400
 hair will be more beautiful and 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.440
 stop falling out 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.740
 since the condition of my hair is far from 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.260
 perfect but i want to improve my condition 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.560
 hair for this i make different masks 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.570
 nutrition masks for moisturizing 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.260
 I also want to grow hair because 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.660
 I had to 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.600
 get your hair cut because your hair was 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.459
 enrolled I want them to grow for that I 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.000
 making masks for hair growth 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.930
 and I also follow these 5 rules for 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.330
 that hair grow faster and were in 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.489
 more good condition ie through 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.890
 time will see the effect
