doing a traditional background which to
relieve<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:40.980> also<00:00:41.400> is<00:00:41.460> good<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.880> if<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.060> get

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
relieve all also is good but if you get

into the front side of the ball still

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
into the front side of the ball still
get<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> pretty<00:00:50.190> good<00:00:50.489> stretch<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.850> half<00:00:51.300> hip

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
get a pretty good stretch in half hip

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.259 
get a pretty good stretch in half hip
flexors<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.410> never<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.519> over<00:00:53.730> more

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.820 

her<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> way<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> stretch<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.530> breath

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
her also the way I stretch is all breath

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.000 
her also the way I stretch is all breath
related<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.729> breathe<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> pack

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
related so I breathe in to get a pack

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.250 
related so I breathe in to get a pack
off<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> stretch<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.030> exhale<00:01:15.660> for<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.050> gas

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
off the stretch and exhale for the gas

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.719 
off the stretch and exhale for the gas
the<00:01:16.500> stretch<00:01:16.800> most<00:01:17.070> people<00:01:17.370> get<00:01:17.460> into<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the stretch most people get into a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.310 
the stretch most people get into a
thinner<00:01:18.210> stretch<00:01:18.510> and<00:01:18.780> they're<00:01:18.870> doing<00:01:19.050> static

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
thinner stretch and they're doing static

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.660 
thinner stretch and they're doing static
stretching<00:01:19.860> requirement<00:01:20.400> requirement

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
stretching requirement requirement

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.850 
stretching requirement requirement
farther<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.690> creates<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.290> tug-of-war<00:01:22.560> with

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
farther this creates a tug-of-war with

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.410 
farther this creates a tug-of-war with
the<00:01:23.070> muscles<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.760> it<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.060> creates<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the muscles and it just creates a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.880 
the muscles and it just creates a
contraction<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.200> very<00:01:25.410> stretches

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
contraction in the very stretches

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
contraction in the very stretches
contraction<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.330> don't<00:01:27.479> lose<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
contraction so you don't lose the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.900 
contraction so you don't lose the
stretch<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> back<00:01:28.830> off<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.160> little<00:01:29.280> bit<00:01:29.550> so

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
stretch if you back off a little bit so

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.940 
stretch if you back off a little bit so
it<00:01:30.000> looks<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.540> most<00:01:31.350> important<00:01:31.830> thing

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it looks like this most important thing

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.530 
it looks like this most important thing
to<00:01:32.100> remember<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.700> you're<00:01:32.880> doing<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.330> is

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
to remember when you're doing this is

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780 
to remember when you're doing this is
not<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.320> too<00:01:34.590> far<00:01:34.920> down<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> front<00:01:35.520> side

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
not to get too far down the front side

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.700 
not to get too far down the front side
because<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> through<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> Balkans<00:01:37.080> like<00:01:37.470> if

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
because you through the Balkans like if

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.410 
because you through the Balkans like if
I<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> matter<00:01:38.340> under<00:01:38.490> awesome

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
I have the matter under awesome

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.139 
I have the matter under awesome
so<00:01:39.869> position<00:01:40.649> yourself<00:01:41.340> against<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.119> wall

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
so position yourself against the wall

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.350 
so position yourself against the wall
sequence<00:01:42.840> against<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> wall<00:01:44.210> maintain<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
sequence against the wall maintain that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.510 
sequence against the wall maintain that
the<00:01:45.479> whole<00:01:45.600> time<00:01:45.840> arms<00:01:46.770> overhead<00:01:47.039> either

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the whole time arms overhead either

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.060 
the whole time arms overhead either
close<00:01:47.789> together<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.869> push<00:01:49.229> people<00:01:49.500> legs

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
close together and you push people legs

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.400 
close together and you push people legs
to<00:01:50.369> advance<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.789> stretch<00:01:51.090> not<00:01:51.690> reaching<00:01:52.229> back

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
to advance the stretch not reaching back

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.310 
to advance the stretch not reaching back
by<00:01:52.649> itself<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.580> I<00:01:53.880> use<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> open<00:01:54.750> grip<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.259> can

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
by itself so I use the open grip you can

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.900 
by itself so I use the open grip you can
use<00:01:55.560> your<00:01:55.680> arms<00:01:55.920> parallel<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.490> stretches

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
use your arms parallel this stretches

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.020 
use your arms parallel this stretches
out<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.450> biceps<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.229> relax<00:01:58.470> as<00:01:58.710> well<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.759> arms

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
out the biceps and relax as well so arms

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.740 
out the biceps and relax as well so arms
overhead<00:02:00.470> breathe<00:02:01.470> in<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.820> exhale<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
overhead breathe in on the exhale and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:21.260 
overhead breathe in on the exhale and
stretch<00:02:04.140> which<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.800> plan<00:02:05.009> sir

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.510
