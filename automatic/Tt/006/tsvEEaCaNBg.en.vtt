you do that you're just going to boost
right<00:00:39.600> through<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.320> kind<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.829> clipping

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
right through if you're kind of clipping

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.590 
right through if you're kind of clipping
through<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:41.850> keep<00:00:42.000> boosting<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
through it then just keep boosting and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.090 
through it then just keep boosting and
you<00:00:42.660> should<00:00:42.870> push<00:00:43.110> through<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.469> not<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:43.890> just

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
you should push through if not then just

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.660 
you should push through if not then just
try<00:00:44.370> again<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.710> how<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
try again so that is how you get the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.490 
try again so that is how you get the
wall<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.030> pretty<00:00:48.360> simple<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.320> don't

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
wall it's pretty simple if you don't

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.470 
wall it's pretty simple if you don't
know<00:00:49.620> how<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.430> from<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.940> tutorial

picky as long as you choose the wall he

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
picky as long as you choose the wall he
can<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.650> glitch<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:15.030> you're<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.270> go

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
can do this glitch so you're gonna go

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.870 
can do this glitch so you're gonna go
into<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> next<00:01:15.869> loading<00:01:16.380> zone<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.950> let<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
into the next loading zone and let it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
into the next loading zone and let it
load<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.049> where<00:01:19.380> amna

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
load up and this is where amna

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.609 
load up and this is where amna
corresponds<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> tricky<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
corresponds so it's kind of tricky it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.100 
corresponds so it's kind of tricky it

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.109 
of a ride if you could see this big
mound<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.079> rock<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.979> snow<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.909> should

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
mound of rock and snow then you should

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.719 
mound of rock and snow then you should
be<00:01:33.240> good<00:01:33.270> from<00:01:33.750> here<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.470> jump<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.610> can

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
be good from here just jump if you can

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.219 
be good from here just jump if you can
see<00:01:35.880> I'm<00:01:36.030> already<00:01:36.060> feeling<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> hard<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
see I'm already feeling this is hard to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.840 
see I'm already feeling this is hard to
see<00:01:37.320> what's<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.159> go<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> very

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
see what's going on but go to the very

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.910 
see what's going on but go to the very
end<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.270> kind<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.930> didn't<00:01:40.110> get

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
end of this kind of like I didn't get

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.550 
end of this kind of like I didn't get
where<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.670> jump<00:01:41.970> towards<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.869> part<00:01:43.350> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
where I and jump towards that part of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.789 
where I and jump towards that part of
the<00:01:43.649> ceiling<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.030> complex<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.710> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the ceiling it's it's complex but if you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.380 
the ceiling it's it's complex but if you
just<00:01:47.070> look<00:01:47.310> around<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.820> figure<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.210> where

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
just look around and figure out where

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
just look around and figure out where
you<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.530> figure<00:01:49.710> out<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.430> know

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you are then you can figure out you know

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.820 
you are then you can figure out you know
where<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
where to go so

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.740 
where to go so
and<00:01:51.940> from<00:01:52.940> here<00:01:53.120> we're<00:01:53.270> gonna<00:01:53.360> go<00:01:53.540> over<00:01:53.570> there

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
and from here we're gonna go over there

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.050 
and from here we're gonna go over there
so<00:01:54.440> as<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.130> can<00:01:55.280> see<00:01:55.490> there<00:01:55.790> underneath

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
so as you can see there underneath

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.610 
so as you can see there underneath
fighting<00:01:56.540> right<00:01:56.720> now<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:57.080> I'm<00:01:57.230> just<00:01:57.380> going<00:01:57.590> to

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
fighting right now but I'm just going to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.310 
fighting right now but I'm just going to
jump<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.010> ceiling<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.780> jump<00:01:59.780> all<00:01:59.930> the<00:01:59.990> way

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
jump on the ceiling and jump all the way

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.730 
jump on the ceiling and jump all the way
over<00:02:00.770> here<00:02:01.510> because<00:02:02.510> if<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:03.050> look<00:02:03.260> in<00:02:03.530> this

over here because if you look in this

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.740 
over here because if you look in this
room<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.100> I'm<00:02:04.430> next<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.790> now<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.480> is<00:02:05.630> where

room that I'm next to now this is where

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.450 
room that I'm next to now this is where

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
you actually run out of ammo that is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.410 
you actually run out of ammo that is
alright<00:02:33.620> if<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.400> an<00:02:34.490> icebreaker<00:02:34.880> you

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
alright if you have an icebreaker you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.990 
alright if you have an icebreaker you
can<00:02:35.600> swap<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.050> that<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.459> know<00:02:37.490> I<00:02:37.730> am

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
can swap to that and just you know I am

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.510 
can swap to that and just you know I am
aware<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.930> have<00:02:39.050> ammo<00:02:39.290> synthesis<00:02:40.010> then<00:02:40.400> we

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
aware you have ammo synthesis then we

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.820 
aware you have ammo synthesis then we
could<00:02:40.670> actually<00:02:40.820> just<00:02:41.060> use<00:02:41.240> that<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:41.959> who

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
could actually just use that but who

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.610 
could actually just use that but who
even<00:02:42.860> have<00:02:43.400> special<00:02:43.940> analysis<00:02:44.480> right<00:02:44.870> all<00:02:45.560> i

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
even have special analysis right all i

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.110 
even have special analysis right all i
got<00:02:45.920> room<00:02:46.130> for<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.430> heavy<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:46.940> we're<00:02:47.090> just

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
got room for is heavy so we're just

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.840 
got room for is heavy so we're just
gonna<00:02:47.360> switch<00:02:47.750> over<00:02:47.990> to<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.250> know<00:02:49.370> ice

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
gonna switch over to that you know ice

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.780 
gonna switch over to that you know ice
breaker<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.720> we're<00:02:50.930> Gilda<00:02:51.320> ammo<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:52.010> know<00:02:52.370> this

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
breaker and we're Gilda ammo I know this

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.980 
breaker and we're Gilda ammo I know this
is<00:02:52.970> where<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.240> kind<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.510> get<00:02:53.600> impatient

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
is where you kind of get impatient

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.720 
is where you kind of get impatient
because<00:02:54.440> she's<00:02:54.770> probably<00:02:55.010> just<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.400> few<00:02:55.580> more

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730
