 more than three million tons of pig iron per year per 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:04.399
 Novolipetsk metallurgical 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:06.090
 combine end 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.359
 final preparations before 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.610
 commissioning new networks my 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.379
 a blast furnace that promises to be one 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.009
 of the most powerful russian tours almost 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.209
 three years and the erection left 140 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.480
 thousand tons of steel 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.019
 now in the furnace loaded saw 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.580
 for further torture cast iron reportage our 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.769
 Chinese colleagues 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.999
 the most global scale 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.969
 modern steel projects 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:31.029
 Russia almost completed commemorates 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.809
 convenient as average in performance 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.149
 metallurgical plant it will allow 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.600
 Novolipetsk Combine by a third 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.150
 increase iron production 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 and release of steel 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.480
 furnace loading the first of the guys to melt 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.370
 iron has already begun iron ore 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.430
 materials on slang metallurgists mine 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.430
 entered the bunker on the overpass n 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.520
 until the end of the week Lipetsk metallurgist 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 to prepare all for 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.530
 boot the seventh house populating the fuel you need 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.880
 much performance 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.120
 new furnace almost nine and a half 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.089
 thousand tons of pig iron per day 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.110
 president question in two stages 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.760
 first stage to the luxury of filing 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.020
 Based on iron ore materials 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.990
 so it is left 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.170
 no just a bank 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.229
 the second stage of which we plan 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.790
 start falling asleep 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.820
 and not putting Borovkov 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.900
 before loading the furnace serious payment 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.250
 the wood for growth is like a tribute to tradition 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.820
 so and most technologically 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.320
 element 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.230
 according to the metallurgist in the new furnace is better 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.720
 just rake it with firewood helped 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.590
 failure case is the perfect material 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.810
 to prepare material reports 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.900
 because is 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.470
 Seventh house Novolipetsk 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.020
 Combine included all 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.790
 innovative developments in the industry 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.000
 as a result of high performance 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.750
 resource saving 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.370
 automated smelting process 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.140
 cast iron special attention when 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.390
 construction design 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.040
 devoted to environmental issues and 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.430
 environmental component of soup and 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.620
 even transportation technology 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.000
 raw materials but literally we can 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.590
 the pipe will become 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.560
 and here it is all buildings tass operation 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.940
 bunker trestle 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.390
 P 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.390
 d 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.239
 great atmosphere stayed there 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.159
 she is not on the most modern defense 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.419
 which is just in our place 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.639
 the raw material in the furnace is already left 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.729
 complete only some 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.699
 commissioning works officially 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:20.869
 Seventh Duma in Novolipetsk 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.789
 Iron and Steel Works plans 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:23.300
 open 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.530
 already at the end of August Sharapova week 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.390
 Anatoly Bragin to lead Lipetsk
