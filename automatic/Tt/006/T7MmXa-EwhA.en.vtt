00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.780

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.240
 was exciting and my last 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.800

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.130
 which you can do on top of it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.390
 yoghurts a bit from the akw 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.800
 Strawberry I 've got it today 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 lunch filled puff pastry 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.489
 your child is probably here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 I recently got his video about it 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.200
 made to abfuhrtag now I have 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.410
 but another filling, and indeed something 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.910
 hearty as it player tomato and me 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.620
 I just got a bit seared with it 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.809
 onions garlic salt pepper and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.520
 herbs and I have everything now 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.590
 I'm just at the soup 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 I cook about one 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 Half onion fried 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.199
 then I packed vegetables with water 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.769
 and potatoes pure 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.229
 it was about 46 as big as normal 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.000
 Broke namely lidl this here 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.560
 found soup greens and I could 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.030
 Now everything has to be done now 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.100
 About six to eight minutes 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.229
 I cook with the soup greens 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.159
 my packs off so and that's it 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.630
 caribbean 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.189
 I made myself so smart today 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 but it is not so good 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.320
 So that's it already 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.090
 third time 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.200
 and unfortunately we had this sushi rice 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.890
 not anymore that's why I have one 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.650
 took 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.820
 as you can see it falls 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.579
 unfortunately, I have got it apart now 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.560
 These three things in there once little 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.170
 so cucumber strips and sauté 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.159
 avocado and that we are still fine 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.630
 I can taste it now 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.119
 but soy sauce not eat 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.259
 auseinanderschneiden far then the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.990
 anyway a bunch 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.700
 but practice makes the master who knows 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.829
 maybe it will work for x or something 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.240
 this a few pieces of frozen bananas 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.020
 I always have them in such a box 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.250
 freezer compartment 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.590
 and I do not know that is now 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.750
 about a banana or something in america 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.130
 always used such coal spoon 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.500
 and I have recently at max 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.750
 found always finds itself with and finds 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.129
 then I stop with the grünenthal 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.739
 I have Montis Bonn together 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:13.260
 and second, oatmeal boots and me 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.970
 believe so far more pure in any case 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.349
 I need a saddlery now 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.780
 but just now and care is there 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.890
 Also add peanut now comes too 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.349
 milk, of course I know 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.879
 exactly how much time I simply print 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.629
 usually always do everything 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:30.209
 by eye 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:31.920
 I hope you have that here 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.299
 my fresh ready is given as 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.030
 so a bit of forward bloggers here 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.920
 In any case, he really tastes like that 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.269
 I am very happy as I am 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.890
 I did not know here 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.060
 Sometimes I sometimes fail 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.349
 if you have this check or something 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.849
 You can tell me something else about power 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.980
 send pictures I am always very happy 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.630
 if that copes with my stuff i 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.220
 Just make lunch here 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.720
 once rich and here I do such a thing 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.370
 he vegetable pan me back as a 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.590
 finished packages found at paths 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.299
 nyse mix chinese and there I have 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.060
 now so different things are packed 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.930
 Once there is soy sauce in it then 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.430
 I first started with margarine and 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.209
 I have some cashew nuts 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.370
 seared 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.510
 then it can be a bit peanut with it 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.769
 and also tandoori masala fit and 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.049
 I also have some soja in it 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.630
 done and it is very fluid war 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.680
 somehow never a real sauce i 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.959
 have in any case already tried 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.450
 and it tastes delicious but that with the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.739
 make sauces exercise that little bit looks like that 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.829
 the whole number served on the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.019
 plate of glass of water and the lungs 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.920
 I now have two of those 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.470
 Now I probably asked 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.819
 What that is I can get the recipe for it 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.130
 I have that from instagram in the 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.079
 infobox link and that is the stop 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.060
 so 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.579
 that's just from the freezer 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.769
 It's tough now and it tastes good 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.200
 and biscuit part yes that looks just like that 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.280
 but I'll lose you that 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.840
 In any case, it tasted really good 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.500
 or pivot after the war, it's me 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.660
 from google 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.359
 I do not feel a nicer muffin 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.519
 from 1 to 100 hearts and you can 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:03.049
 just as good as dessert or as 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.049
 snack food in between times 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.720
 Freezer lunch is today 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.700

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.920

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.859
 and I have lunch again today 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.169
 done the same thing because it was me yesterday 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.699

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.630
 I still added mushrooms but 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.919

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.699

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.919
 I do not want to be poorer then 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.380
