00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.820
 understood he speaks of my voice and all of me 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.710
 know for my weak voice I have the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.140
 feeling that he wrote to olivia 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.970
 feel I know that you think jacob 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.229
 we are a couple or something 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.030
 but the truth is that we are only friends 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.530
 commanding tickets to those who prefer the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.050
 don't try to pretend nothing happened 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.080
 angry you have every right 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.880
 no this is not the right way 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.490
 olivia must only understand that it is not 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.420
 will never marry that traitor of jacob not 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.179
 he is a traitor 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.140
 well maybe not a little 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.020
 you don't think so 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.720
 my thanks I believe that andrea 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.400
 should go out with him and wait for them 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.250
 heart to teach him a lesson 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.260
 after all, stop all of them 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.020
 I want to talk more about this topic 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.020
 andrea i say you have to go out with 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.130
 jacob okay if you say so but then 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.130
 network you too with me 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.489
 then we hear what you have to say 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.489
 jacob I can understand how hard you are 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.470
 has done so far to resist but not 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.379
 for this you can betray one of the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.769
 my best friends already more than right 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.290
 exactly what you think is enough 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.290
 ridiculous poesiola of valentine for 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.299
 grab guys at your leisure 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.269
 let alone already with hardly Hair 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.690
 blue here will undermine my friend sound 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.690
 I'm definitely more than this good 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.260
 more polite so girls now I would say of 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.750
 Leave 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.150
 olivia we will eat seen this is that 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.010
 what is it that you really owe that you would have 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
 could conquer them by offering me a pizza 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.670
 with my name 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.950
 olivia written with olives and but I don't 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.200
 my name is olivia, I wouldn't say no 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.819
 and this pizza is not for you andrea mi 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.549
 sorry and for olivia for me it is so 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.170
 even the ticket was for you 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.859
 it seems that for some reason andrea 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:43.109
 he thought it was for her 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:46.109
 the judges must have gone 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.329
 so sorry olivia there must be 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.599
 It was a misunderstanding that you would say about it 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:56.130
 dine with me like that you didn't have a 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.900
 artisan commitment you know all in all are 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.590
 glad that andrea has succeeded in 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.590
 resist 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.440
 then you like the pizza you say
