where I thought I wasn't going to be

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880 
where I thought I wasn't going to be
doing<00:02:43.060> anything<00:02:43.420> kind<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.930> he<00:02:44.170> stuck<00:02:44.470> having

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
to wait with this other canal to happen

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.830 
to wait with this other canal to happen
but<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:48.070> know<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.250> for<00:02:49.060> me<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.390> biggest<00:02:49.570> thing
