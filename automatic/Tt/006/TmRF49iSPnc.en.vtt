00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.649
 this is a big day 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.919
 we will be informed 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.659
 Stevens follows 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.829
 it takes a while for the little ones to be one 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.589
 so we go back in time 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.009
 the ground is here stood one with ten people 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.419
 the tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.469
 the citizen she is suspected of having her four children 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.840
 I am curious how is that possible? 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 spectacular 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.370
 the wind is like I'm in the middle of it 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.710
 the minus initially this is incredibly well made 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.820
 the blemish the consequences for customers 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.900
 set the music on fire beautifully 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.549
 in 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.349
 the edge of the forest is called to be very beautiful, I think 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.519
 it would not hurt the 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:04.750
 7 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.380
 valparaÃ­so football 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.410
 affected customers the farmer take over people people who 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.140
 nominees for a false name at 3 0 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.030
 the band of brothers 8 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.860
 we expect to be able to follow the man 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.970
 then he has 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.330
 2 people 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.040
 how we injured people 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 lies it is a dual feeling towards people 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.030
 as far as known 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.410
 groningen and in that sense 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.900
 16 because he is 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.890
 4 to see the garment 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.080
 incompetent 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.330
 the gentlemen 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.610
 I don't think it's saying dokic 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.680
 in that this newspaper if there is anywhere in a press release 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.020
 it looks very heavy pressure 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.440
 how do you end up here? 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 you are very little bit at home 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.480
 syntus once tackled how you end up here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.360
 you are 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.349
 it played, among other things 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.349
 in this sense a little boy doing their job 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.679
 and just managed to find lisbon 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.369
 to do next 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.949
 and 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.949
 am curious about the ground an crazy adventures 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.459
 he swims 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.360
 coronel the toppers 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.659
 you need a system 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.999
 subjects 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:33.670
 but something not then I will see it going on again 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.899
 in the beginning, the risks were one more 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.789
 the room 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.079
 the award ceremony 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.329
 closed on Thursday 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.540
 we did play a duel less, the intention is that the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.789
 operation 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.789
 the debt paper 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.719
 the 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.719
 hanks 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.239
 have got 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.029
 i play and 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:14.359
 a small 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.979
 I may have to take my love there 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.379
 a role that 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.829
 tailored to the body is very dangerous 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.680
 several years a little bit on paper that tell the big world about 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.159
 this to find all the dangers attached to it and 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.159
 where thus learned a better life lessons 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.709
 the band beautiful 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.639
 the are a bit the ball in the depth i have won 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:43.849
 x don't know 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.519
 the the hive 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.069
 very smoothly 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.789
 join me and my children who immediately report seeing and perpetrating multiple offenders 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:54.419
 to hear 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.889
 so this year you can no longer count on shooting as I may be less now 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.839
 then also all that as a dirty 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.849
 they are already seeing ghamdi dinant 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.269
 that's all of him, of course, they have to be busier than last year 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.599
 Well 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.069
 there is no employment contract in the students though 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:22.069
 when you when that now only short film 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.809
 az and then when the film is referring to the important animation film then you have to 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.569
 in the long run said the leader is playing on the digital h 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.779
 for mario martinez what we want the unions want to let go 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.379
 and that is simply the property 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.849
 the demands that film then bouterse president 4 temporarily make yourself 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.529
 then for example to win us that's it 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.180
 very strange in it 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.320
 those works will then form the serpentine dividends 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.009
 eext in chili 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.729
 we 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.539
 3 seventh and eighth wonder of the world 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.050
 and there is nothing wrong with this and exciting to do 3 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.050
 a contract on this day 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.990
 I don't think we should be as big as an example of anp 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.129
 weyts 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:21.539
 this time playing poor people in the movie this is it the movie that you don't like 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.169
 may also miss, for example, a driver in the beginning who is the last one 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.039
 time 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.039
 and and also shrink shares 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.599
 find my thing as it turns out 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.039
 and the movie that this delicious 2 won the tortoise 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.309
 a 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:41.539
 next to each other 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.610
 also benefit from it 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.699
 I let myself be told the four states further there is a 3D version 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.050
 get it 3d tv but i know too 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.029
 and we have a chair here or like supporters it is a bit 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.039
 if your identity is temporary, you can get stinky again 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.029
 meet 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.029
 and a 4d 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.300
 smart is a start supermarkets about the fairs also the coast of course there is 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.639
 thorough 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.840
 which is sold for each it is not for nothing that they think so too 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.300
 people the group that leaves on the bus is hopefully going to make it one 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.680
 delivery van 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.810
 the 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.259
 Hey 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.949
 hey 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:44.249
 The most important thing is that for the different one how the racer needs it 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:46.400
 as in this case a start 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.030
 to also approach the character sometimes it is that everything is a bit harder than than 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.990
 then koenders 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.280
 but it is especially important to keep their voice because otherwise it will be 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.349
 very fast 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:00.779
 but taste good 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:02.050
 Yes 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.559
 also welcome to the prosecutor 

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:07.799
