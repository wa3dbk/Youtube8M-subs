00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 on television more open than ever and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.359
 let's start 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.400
 good morning at home with what I already 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.870
 We were talking about the Mexican national team 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.120
 is already on Costa Rican soil 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.799
 to face today's match in the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.960
 night before the boys waiting for 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.670
 honduras lose in their duel against 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.770
 Jamaica and that combination of results 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.170
 I could qualify it directly 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.760
 brazil but meanwhile let me 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.220
 tell them that the coach of costa rica 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.170
 jorge luis pinto said that if mexico does not 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.050
 classifies the world is not your problem 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.910
 that they will come out to win and achieve a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.219
 perfect close as local in the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.500
 hexagonal in this hexagonal where the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.780
 tricolor is suffering already recognized 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.520
 the court in the national stadium of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.260
 Costa Rica yesterday and it fits 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.010
 remember that in the premises they do not beat 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.719
 Mexico in territory since 1992 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.820
 that costa rica can not beat 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.739
 mexico then good then you have to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.199
 think that the odds of that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.520
 mexico win are many this said the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.329
 technical that we're going to listen to the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.609
 statements from costa rica because a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.140
 journalist or pseudo journalist I do not know 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.580
 exactly who on social networks 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.410
 he put what 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.210
 Costa Rica had let itself be won by 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.100
 honduras so that mexico will not qualify 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.170
 in the last game to which the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.440
 technician answered for that with fans already 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440
 I think that 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.929
 we are also to blame for what you 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.679
 is happening to mexico now not the 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.539
 they want to throw us to panama honduras 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.609
 they solve their problems 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.579
 managers journalists players 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.649
 the professional technician of the problem of 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.209
 the problems we do not go 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.649
 to play tomorrow thinking that the doctor 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.390
 can be eliminated, not that we do not 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.130
 interesting and it has happened to me for the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.750
 head and tomorrow I go to look for the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.890
 party that touches me is my obligation 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 go out and look and win 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.810
 which is very right Jorge Luis 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.000
 I paint also good yesterday they said that no 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.860
 you can generalize by statements 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.260
 of a person is to say that all the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.600
 press in minute is the feeling of all 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.520
 exactly wrong I think if the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.770
 statements of this reporter 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.540
 journalist who said that because that's the way 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.220
 I think that a selection is left to give 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.990
 other milestones works always from our 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.820
 Youtube channel so you're always there 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.910
 informed of the latest news of 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.920
 mexico and the world starts right now
