to start by making a sheet of duct tape

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.029 
to start by making a sheet of duct tape
and<00:00:14.660> your<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.809> used<00:00:16.289> about<00:00:16.529> two<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.010> half

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
you can always fix that by ripping a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.040 
you can always fix that by ripping a
piece<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.830> half<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.580> lining<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.449> as<00:00:24.630> you

half strip you just fold in half

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080 
half strip you just fold in half
instead<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.980> putting<00:00:41.100> another<00:00:41.399> piece<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.820> top

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
instead of putting another piece on top

I'm<00:01:08.040> using<00:01:08.400> galaxy<00:01:09.119> print<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.600> this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
I'm using galaxy print for this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
I'm using galaxy print for this
particular<00:01:10.080> design<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.189> use<00:01:11.340> any

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
particular design but you can use any

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.780 
particular design but you can use any
print<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> duct<00:01:12.360> tape<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.780> want<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
print of duct tape you want to so I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.359 
print of duct tape you want to so I
added<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:16.049> hash<00:01:16.259> strip<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> bottom<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
added a hash strip to the bottom and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
added a hash strip to the bottom and
fold<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.060> half<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.420> marked<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.110> did

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
fold it in half and marked it and I did

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.399 
fold it in half and marked it and I did
that<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.770> sole<00:01:20.009> -<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:21.509> lined<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.259> up

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that with the sole - and I lined it up

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.399 
that with the sole - and I lined it up
and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.340> cut<00:01:23.549> little<00:01:23.700> slits<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
and then cut little slits in it so that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.010 
and then cut little slits in it so that
I<00:01:25.590> could<00:01:25.650> fold<00:01:26.070> over<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.549> curve<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.600> foot

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
I could fold over the curve of the foot

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.490 
I could fold over the curve of the foot
so<00:01:31.579> now<00:01:32.579> you're<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> repeat<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
so now you're going to repeat this to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.789 
so now you're going to repeat this to
the<00:01:34.650> other<00:01:34.829> side<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.750> if<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.930> too<00:01:37.229> long<00:01:37.500> for

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the other side and if it's too long for

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
the other side and if it's too long for
your<00:01:38.070> shoe<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.850> always<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.180> cut<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
your shoe then you can always just cut a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.109 
your shoe then you can always just cut a
little<00:01:39.509> piece<00:01:39.750> off<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:41.790> we're<00:01:41.939> going<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
little piece off so now we're going to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.440 
little piece off so now we're going to
line<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:43.229> inside<00:01:43.259> by<00:01:43.979> splitting<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.939> piece<00:01:45.149> in

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
line the inside by splitting a piece in

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.520 
line the inside by splitting a piece in
half<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:47.329> then<00:01:48.329> you're<00:01:48.509> gonna<00:01:48.720> place<00:01:49.170> that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
half and then you're gonna place that

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.069 
half and then you're gonna place that
down<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.250> make<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.180> makes<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.659> look<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> bit

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
down and make it it makes it look a bit

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.819 
down and make it it makes it look a bit
more<00:01:52.380> neater<00:01:52.850> hiding<00:01:53.850> scenes<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> ankle

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
more neater hiding scenes for the ankle

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.200 
more neater hiding scenes for the ankle
part<00:01:56.070> you're<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> flip<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.969> shoe

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
part you're going to flip the shoe

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.569 
part you're going to flip the shoe
inside<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.560> place<00:01:58.860> half<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.340> piece

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
inside out and then place half a piece

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.490 
inside out and then place half a piece
and<00:01:59.820> cut<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.240> slits<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.750> put<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.290> down

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
and cut little slits and put that down

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.520 
and cut little slits and put that down
as<00:02:01.799> well<00:02:02.180> it's<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.360> an<00:02:03.659> easier<00:02:03.960> way<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.409> it

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
as well it's just an easier way to do it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.310 
as well it's just an easier way to do it
than<00:02:04.740> lining<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.340> without<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:07.049> this

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
than lining it up without that at this

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.869 
than lining it up without that at this
point<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.740> realized<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.250> had<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> little<00:02:08.610> sticky

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
point I realized I had a little sticky

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.120 
point I realized I had a little sticky
piece<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.200> are

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
piece so I are

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.790 
piece so I are
cut<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.910> little<00:02:12.180> piece<00:02:12.330> off<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:13.650> we're

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
cut the little piece off so now we're

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.980 
cut the little piece off so now we're
going<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> make<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.310> first<00:02:14.580> foot<00:02:15.060> strap<00:02:15.390> this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
going to make the first foot strap this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.040 
going to make the first foot strap this
is<00:02:16.050> going<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.530> go<00:02:16.680> across<00:02:16.920> your<00:02:17.910> foot<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:19.020> you

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
another strip on top to make a second

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.940 
another strip on top to make a second
toe<00:03:14.910> oval<00:03:15.870> box<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:18.570> now<00:03:19.350> I'm<00:03:19.530> going<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.770> make<00:03:19.920> a

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
regular strip and put a half strip on

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.470 
regular strip and put a half strip on
the<00:03:22.470> bottom<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:25.190> put<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:27.180> on

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
the bottom so that I can put it on

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.360 
the bottom so that I can put it on
easier<00:03:28.050> so<00:03:28.380> I'm<00:03:28.560> just<00:03:28.740> going<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.950> roll<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
easier so I'm just going to roll it

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.640 
easier so I'm just going to roll it
along<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:30.150> edge<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.690> sticky<00:03:31.080> side<00:03:31.290> and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
along the edge of the sticky side and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.100 
along the edge of the sticky side and
fold<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.580> over<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.090> cut<00:03:33.330> little<00:03:33.510> slits<00:03:33.810> and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
fold it over and cut little slits and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.420 
fold it over and cut little slits and
then<00:03:34.290> fold<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.740> over<00:03:35.300> this<00:03:36.300> is<00:03:37.010> easier<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.250> do

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
then fold it over this is easier to do

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.090 
then fold it over this is easier to do
than<00:03:38.640> just<00:03:38.880> place<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.120> regularly<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:41.070> can

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
than just place it regularly you can

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.340 
than just place it regularly you can
leave<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:41.820> this<00:03:41.970> or<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.720> can<00:03:43.110> put<00:03:43.320> a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
leave it like this or you can put a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.010 
leave it like this or you can put a
piece<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.590> tape<00:03:43.980> on<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.790> top<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.660> make<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.840> a

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
piece of tape on the top to make it a

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.780 
piece of tape on the top to make it a
bit<00:03:46.200> more<00:03:46.230> neat<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.740> did<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.400> don't<00:03:47.580> have

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
bit more neat I did but you don't have

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.310 
bit more neat I did but you don't have
to<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.120> don't<00:03:48.150> want<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.810> I'm<00:03:52.170> just

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
cutting the excess off and then cutting
