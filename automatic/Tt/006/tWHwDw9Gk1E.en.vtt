00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.760
Donut: Pretty neat, huh

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.340
Doc: So, who uses this?

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.040
Donut: Mainly just Simmons and Caboose

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.880
Oh wait, it looks like Sarge has a profile now. Like!

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.560
Doc: And you just...talk about yourself?

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.660
Donut: You can post pictures and stuff too. I've been downloading this picture of Freckles for a while

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.140
Doc: How long's that been going for?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.360
Donut: Oh, just a few hours

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.540
Doc: You spent hours of our limited energy just downloading a single picture?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.480
Donut: It is a very high quality picture

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.300
Doc: Well, you can't argue with that. So, is this all you did while we were out last night?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.820
Donut: Nope! I cleaned this base from top to bottom. It was the least I could do to make it look more presentable

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.320
I did the dishes, swept sand off the floor...

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.140
Doc: Wow. Did you clean Grif's room?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.060
Donut: Grif has a room?

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.600
Doc: Well he and Simmons share that side of the base. But Grif's stuff kind of overflowed onto the roof

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.080
Donut: Wooo, let me take a peek!

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.540
Doc: Oh my gosh! If this post gets over 10 000 likes, Basebook will pay for a rescue team to come save us!

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.060
(Donut makes a happyish sounding noise of exclamation)

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.020
Doc: I know, it sounds too good to be true

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.740
Donut: Dexter Grif!

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.240
Grif: Huh?

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.740
Donut: I can't live in this base with the way you've been treating it

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.560
The layout is all wrong! The colour palette is atrocious! And the garden doesn't even have flowers in it - just vegetables!

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.320
Also, I think someone tried to plant candy corn at some point

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.260
Grif: (cough) I wonder who did that?

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.420
Doc: How's the testing going?

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.040
Grif: Well, Doc, after countless experiments, I have determined that the teleportation cubes are still FUCKING AWESOME

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.680
All other data has been inconclusive

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.620
Doc: Grif, I really think we shouldn't be messing with these - they could be dangerous!

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.740
We can't keep just throwing them around all willy-nilly

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.420
Donut: Gimme that!

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.040
Grif: Hey!

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.460
(cube noise)

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.120
Grif: My stuff!

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.900
Doc: Nice arm

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.420
Donut: There. If you're not responsible enough to clean your room, then you can just say goodbye to everything that was in it

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.400
Grif: Oh man

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.140
(beep)

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.000
Simmons: Hey! Somebody liked my post. Heh - things are sure looking up for Private Simmons

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.420
What the-

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.840
(cube noise)

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.440
Simmons: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.340
Wash: What are you doing?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.720
Tucker: I'm fixing the radio

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.260
Wash: By beating it with the butt of your rifle?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.220
Tucker: It worked for you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.800
Wash: But that was-

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.740
Tucker: You know what? Why don't you just come over here and do it yourself?

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.760
Wash: Try connecting the antenna port to the amp

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.260
Tucker: What?

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.600
Wash: If you increase the input voltage, that will just fry the radio, but if you were to transmit through and amp-

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.100
Tucker: All I hear are words that would get me beat up in high school

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.380
Wash: Tucker, I'm being serious

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.540
Tucker: Oh my God. Stop the fucking presses. Agent Washington is being serious

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.580
Wash: If you just listen to me, you could do this!

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.080
Tucker: Well I don't want to do this - you ever think of that?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.620
All I want to do is stand around and talk to my friend, but he's gone now and all I've got is you!

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.620
Wash: What?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.420
Tucker: It's fucking bullshit

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.800
Wash: (sigh)

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.820
Wash: Did you know I was one of the worst freelancers in my squad?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.880
There was Agent York, our security specialist, Agent North, the sharp shooter

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.700
Carolina was an expert in martial arts and Tex was...well, you know Tex

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.800
Tucker: Cool story, bro

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.860
Wash: I was known for getting a grappling hook stuck to my balls

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.060
Tucker: Ok, where are you going with this?

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.660
Wash: Church was your leader for years. You guys knew each other inside and out

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.220
Tucker: Dude, don't phrase it like that

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.720
Wash: But I'm new to all of this. I've never really had to lead anybody before

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.520
But when Church and Carolina disappeared, I didn't have a choice

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.360
I had to try

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.440
Tucker: Well, there's your problem

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.620
You tried too hard, man. I mean - Church wasn't the best leader ever. But he never made us run laps or do push ups or anything

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.600
He just took the blame whenever shit went wrong

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.720
That was pretty much it

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.220
Wash: Well...we're shipwrecked, low on food and have to do whatever Caboose tells us or we'll be killed by a robot

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.640
Tucker: Sounds like you really fucked up

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.960
Wash: Yeah...kind of looks that way

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.000
Tucker: But, I guess, you weren't really our leader when the ship crashed - so you don't have to take the blame for that one

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.880
Wash: Whoops. Sorry - knocked a cable out of the wall. Hope that wasn't important

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.260
(alarm)

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.840
Wash: Heh. I'll take some of the blame

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.640
Tucker: Whatever

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.320
Wash: So, are you going to fix this radio or not?

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.720
Tucker: Well, when I started the radio was working, but the signal wasn't strong enough

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.800
and now it's just...not working

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.300
Wash: Sounds like you really fucked up

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.500
Tucker: Don't be a dick

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.160
Wash: You're a capable soldier, Tucker

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.140
At least compared to your usual aquaintances

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.760
You just need to...try

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.760
Tucker: Oh

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.940
Wash: What

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.500
(click)

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.860
Tucker: It was just turned off

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.440
Caboose: Attention Blue Team

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.780
(echos)

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.480
Wash: Uhh, yes Captain?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:10.040
Caboose: Um...yeah I know we all said that we wanted to fix the radio and that was really important...to fix the radio and the tower and all that is really important...

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.920
Wash: We'll probably die if it's not repaired

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.880
Caboose: But...um I really need you guys to go back to Blue base and kinda...clean up

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.020
Tucker: Clean up what?

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.660
Caboose: Garbage and robot parts and gross socks all over and uh Simmons...

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.840
Yeah um Simmons actually won't stop rocking back and forth in the corner and it's kind of um...kind of freaking me out

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.280
Wash: And you're sure you mean Blue base?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.520
Freckles: Do not question your commanding officer

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.040
Wash: Ok, ok

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.360
We'll be there in a few minutes

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.240
Caboose: Assistant captain best friend Freckles initiate piggy-back sequence!

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.300
Tucker: You realise we're all going to die because of him?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.040
Wash: Tucker, I need you to head back to base and do what you can, I'm going up to the ship

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.160
Tucker: You're leaving me again?! What the fuck do you need to go to the ship for?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.020
Wash: I found something. I just need you to buy me some time

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.640
Tucker: Why? What're you gonna do?

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.800
Wash: Hopefully...

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.980
I'm going to put a stop to this

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.900
Locus: You four, with me

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.620
We're going hunting

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:04.580
Grif: What's up, forever alone? So, uh, you wanna do something with your life or you just wanna sit around on your ass all day like a loser?

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.080
Yeah! Me too! So, er, just subscribe and keep watching youtube. It's way easier
