00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 so hello people welcome to a new one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.980
 Although here and indeed I have said 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:17.220
 Served longboard clock and there 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:24.300
 was a consequence there are hd to which he too 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:28.590
 visit and there I thought so 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.529
 I found exactly what the video 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.600
 I actually believe that too 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.600
 has come on following page 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.989
 After that, the face is coming 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.420
 Gerhard as I was from I know it 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.120
 Yes, not at all 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.879
 but i bet x as well as that really 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.329
 if you click now so if you are 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.430
 now to the video then clicks unfortunately 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.250
 deleted 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.799
 but that's how you came to look 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.420
 So I do not know that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:17.130
 promised guess of me but yes 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:21.960
 that would be nice, sometimes my opinion 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 is yes otherwise there mirabeau the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.740
 channel that released the video 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.900
 and the link to this video you will find 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.570
 in the description while still the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.180
 webvideo so it measured three links 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.750
 afterwards this video comes first 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.270
 had deleted the video from the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.890
 youtuber is and the channel of this 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.500
 I'll tell you your own song about yourself 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.700
 force so in my opinion, goma 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.040
 hd from writing comments what else i have 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.979
 to do 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.969
 otherwise I'm trying just one 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.560
 what we view to install but that 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.600
 yes is not actually say in 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.480
 maybe I'll take this review 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.460
 imagine 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:15.550
 the motto is you have him but to the 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.390
 climate comes later so my guess 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.390
 gorny
