to like
you<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:07.979> if<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.179> slowly<00:02:09.750> open<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.590> back<00:02:10.920> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you see if you slowly open the back of

you see if you slowly open the back of
your<00:02:11.220> throat<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:12.300> was<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.720> like<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> real

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
your throat it was not like like a real

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.559 
your throat it was not like like a real
like<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> strange<00:02:14.520> frog<00:02:15.000> alien<00:02:17.569> ultra

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
like a strange frog alien ultra

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.380 
like a strange frog alien ultra
terrestrial<00:02:19.230> noise<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:22.290> don't<00:02:23.390> but

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
terrestrial noise so like you don't but

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.949 
terrestrial noise so like you don't but
instead<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:24.989> slowly<00:02:25.739> letting<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.400> air

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
instead of like slowly letting in air

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.870 
instead of like slowly letting in air
you<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:28.200> open<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> real<00:02:29.069> quick<00:02:29.340> your<00:02:29.640> throat

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
you just open it real quick your throat

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.240 
you just open it real quick your throat
to<00:02:30.480> where<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> makes<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.140> popping<00:02:31.500> noise<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.220> I

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
to where it makes a popping noise so I

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.790 
to where it makes a popping noise so I
thought<00:02:32.400> it'd<00:02:32.489> be<00:02:32.520> like<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:37.530> doesn't<00:02:37.709> hurt<00:02:37.920> so

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
thought it'd be like it doesn't hurt so

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.400 
thought it'd be like it doesn't hurt so
eventually<00:02:40.800> you'll<00:02:41.220> get<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.080> yeah<00:02:43.080> I

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
eventually you'll get it and yeah I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.870 
eventually you'll get it and yeah I
guess<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.800> didn't<00:02:44.040> explain<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.400> purpose<00:02:44.610> of

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
guess I didn't explain the purpose of

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.410 
guess I didn't explain the purpose of
this<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> purpose<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.910> go<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.209> for

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
this the purpose is you can go on for

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.949 
this the purpose is you can go on for
longer<00:02:48.660> when<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.530> beatbox<00:02:49.739> instead<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.550> like

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
longer when you beatbox instead of like

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.960 
longer when you beatbox instead of like
relying<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.110> your<00:02:52.260> lungs<00:02:52.590> how<00:02:53.310> much<00:02:53.489> air<00:02:53.730> they

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
relying on your lungs how much air they

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.110 
relying on your lungs how much air they
can<00:02:54.000> hold<00:02:55.010> cuz<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.069> can<00:02:56.220> sit<00:02:56.400> up<00:02:56.489> for<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:56.940> long<00:02:57.060> I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
can hold cuz I can sit up for so long I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.080 
can hold cuz I can sit up for so long I
can<00:02:57.390> do<00:02:59.930> eventually<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.140> run<00:03:01.380> out<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.530> air<00:03:02.090> what

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
can do eventually I run out of air what

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.960 
can do eventually I run out of air what
inward<00:03:03.690> snare<00:03:03.870> does<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.380> let<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.709> breathe<00:03:04.970> so

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
inward snare does is let you breathe so

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.059 
inward snare does is let you breathe so
you<00:03:06.060> can<00:03:06.209> go<00:03:06.330> on<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.660> even<00:03:06.810> longer<00:03:07.350> periods<00:03:07.980> of

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
you can go on for even longer periods of

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:17.699 
you can go on for even longer periods of
time<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:13.100> can<00:03:14.100> go<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.310> forever

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709
