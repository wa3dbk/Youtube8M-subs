was<00:00:59.699> actually<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.420> stupid<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
was actually really stupid with this and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
was actually really stupid with this and
I<00:01:01.859> didn't<00:01:02.280> remember<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.629> gel<00:01:04.019> eyeliner<00:01:04.949> sets

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.750 
I didn't remember that gel eyeliner sets
so<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> did<00:01:06.630> both<00:01:07.020> eyes<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.280> blended<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so I did both eyes and then I blended it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.450 
so I did both eyes and then I blended it
out<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> mistake<00:01:09.990> by<00:01:10.439> me<00:01:10.650> don't<00:01:11.189> do

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
out that was a mistake by me don't do

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.050 
out that was a mistake by me don't do
this<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.360> eye<00:01:12.570> at<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.320> time<00:01:13.400> with<00:01:14.400> applying

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
this do one eye at a time with applying

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.050 
this do one eye at a time with applying
the<00:01:15.420> eyeliner<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.729> gets<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the eyeliner so as you can see it gets a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.710 
the eyeliner so as you can see it gets a
bit<00:01:18.360> tough<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.200> blend<00:01:19.799> out<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.150> going

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
bit tough to blend out and we are going

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.289 
bit tough to blend out and we are going

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to keep the middle bare so that it keeps

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.749 
to keep the middle bare so that it keeps
that<00:01:24.509> halo<00:01:24.990> effect<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.250> once<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759

a<00:01:45.990> flat<00:01:46.290> shader<00:01:46.530> brush<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> be

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
a flat shader brush I'm going to be

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.950 
a flat shader brush I'm going to be
packing<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:48.090> where<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> put<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> black

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
packing this right where I put the black

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.230 
packing this right where I put the black
and<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.770> having<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.100> black<00:01:50.310> base<00:01:50.640> down<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and just having the black base down it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.210 
and just having the black base down it
makes<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.750> bit<00:01:51.990> more<00:01:52.259> vibrant<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.009> then

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
makes it a bit more vibrant and then

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.649 
makes it a bit more vibrant and then
obviously<00:01:53.460> we're<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.210> into<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
obviously we're going to go into the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.649 
obviously we're going to go into the
crease<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.350> hence<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.430> halo<00:01:56.939> smokey

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
crease with this hence the halo smokey

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.469 
crease with this hence the halo smokey
eye<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:59.430> look<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.329> back

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
eye of the look and then just going back

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
eye of the look and then just going back
in<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.409> brush<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.770> had<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> two

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
in with this brush that had the two

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.270 
in with this brush that had the two
Browns<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.240> didn't<00:02:03.540> dip<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.860> brush<00:02:05.040> back

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
Browns on it I didn't dip the brush back

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.130 
Browns on it I didn't dip the brush back
in<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.579> colors<00:02:05.909> I'm<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.659> blending

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
in the colors I'm just you know blending

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.040 
in the colors I'm just you know blending
out<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.310> see<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:09.000> these<00:02:09.479> shadows

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
out and you can see that these shadows

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.260 
out and you can see that these shadows
are<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.530> chalky<00:02:10.950> which<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.670> don't<00:02:11.730> really

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
are a bit chalky which I don't really

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.370 
are a bit chalky which I don't really
like

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
like

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.960 
like
but<00:02:13.860> they<00:02:13.980> are<00:02:14.070> kind<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.310> chalky<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.820> do

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
but they are kind of chalky so you do

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.850 
but they are kind of chalky so you do
have<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.240> layer<00:02:15.690> them<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:16.020> few<00:02:16.200> times<00:02:16.410> until<00:02:16.620> you

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
have to layer them a few times until you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.250 
have to layer them a few times until you
get<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.370> look<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.630> like<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.230> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
get this look that you like and then I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.650 
get this look that you like and then I
just<00:02:19.440> repeated<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.160> both<00:02:20.310> eyes<00:02:20.550> as<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.480> can

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
just repeated it on both eyes as you can

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.930 
just repeated it on both eyes as you can
see<00:02:21.840> though<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.290> did<00:02:22.620> get<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.830> bit<00:02:23.040> messy<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.910> I

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
see though it did get a bit messy so I

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.490 
see though it did get a bit messy so I
have<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.330> put<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> white<00:02:24.720> base<00:02:24.930> down<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
have to put a white base down in the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.430

middle<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.860> my<00:02:26.040> eyelids<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.730> help<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.870> next

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
middle of my eyelids to help the next

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.130

there's a lot of ways to do that

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.390 
there's a lot of ways to do that
so<00:03:16.530> I've<00:03:16.650> sharpened<00:03:16.800> up<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.160> edge<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> little

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
so I've sharpened up the edge a little

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.150 
so I've sharpened up the edge a little
bit<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.820> then<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.270> took<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:19.050> highlight<00:03:19.770> color

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
bit and then I took a highlight color

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.450 
bit and then I took a highlight color
and<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:21.270> put<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.960> where<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.100> highlight<00:03:23.430> color

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
and I put this where the highlight color

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.980 
and I put this where the highlight color
would<00:03:23.850> go<00:03:24.000> which<00:03:24.210> is<00:03:24.360> right<00:03:24.660> underneath<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
would go which is right underneath the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.140 
would go which is right underneath the
eyebrow<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.770> brow<00:03:25.920> bone<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:27.000> just

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
eyebrow on the brow bone and it just

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.350 
eyebrow on the brow bone and it just
kind<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.420> helps<00:03:27.720> fade<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:29.160> eyeshadows<00:03:29.880> up<00:03:30.150> a

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
kind of helps fade the eyeshadows up a

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
and then I thought that the inner corner

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.430 
and then I thought that the inner corner
is<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.850> little<00:04:33.210> bit<00:04:33.360> too<00:04:33.600> dark<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.110> kind<00:04:34.320> of

in<00:04:39.570> on<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.990> inner<00:04:40.139> corner<00:04:40.590> it's<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.889> matte
