00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
feel that makes it look a little more

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
feel that makes it look a little more
sophisticated<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.940> little<00:01:39.120> more<00:01:39.210> elevated

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
sophisticated and a little more elevated

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.020 
sophisticated and a little more elevated
so<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.530> pencil<00:01:41.130> skirt<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.430> actually<00:01:41.790> leather

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
so this pencil skirt is actually leather

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.310 
so this pencil skirt is actually leather
I<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.510> don't<00:01:42.660> usually<00:01:42.900> think<00:01:43.260> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
I know you don't usually think of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
I know you don't usually think of
leather<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.860> spring<00:01:44.190> but<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.640> white<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.090> can

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
leather for spring but in white it can

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.360 
leather for spring but in white it can
be<00:01:45.330> a<00:01:45.360> very<00:01:45.630> spring<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.380> friendly<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.950> then

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
be a very spring and friendly and then

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.280 
be a very spring and friendly and then
this<00:01:47.640> top<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> actually<00:01:48.150> from<00:01:48.450> last<00:01:48.600> season<00:01:49.050> so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
this top is actually from last season so

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.110 
this top is actually from last season so
