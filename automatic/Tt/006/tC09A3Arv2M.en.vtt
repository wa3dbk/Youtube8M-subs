00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.830 
of just really try and keep my options
healthy<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.640> don't<00:01:20.820> end<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.090> kind<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.479> having

healthy so I don't end up kind of having

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.719 
healthy so I don't end up kind of having
to<00:01:22.020> grab<00:01:22.259> lunch<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.250> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> thing

to grab lunch out and that kind of thing

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.580 
to grab lunch out and that kind of thing

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I think that's always a bit of a kind of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.940 
I think that's always a bit of a kind of
trap<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.330> yeah<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.229> kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> my<00:01:28.650> little

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
trap so yeah that's kind of my little

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
trap so yeah that's kind of my little

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.670 
mid-afternoon not my favorite thing ever
I<00:03:02.270> wouldn't<00:03:02.570> recommend<00:03:02.690> them<00:03:03.200> they're<00:03:03.500> kind

they're<00:03:06.140> like<00:03:06.230> 80<00:03:06.410> calories<00:03:06.740> so<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.460> fine

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
they're like 80 calories so it's fine
