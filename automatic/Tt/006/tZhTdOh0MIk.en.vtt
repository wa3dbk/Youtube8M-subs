00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
as a sort of test to check whether it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.299 
as a sort of test to check whether it
looks<00:00:45.510> good<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.260> came<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.500> well<00:00:46.829> because<00:00:47.160> I've

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
looks good and came on well because I've

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.290 
looks good and came on well because I've
never<00:00:47.430> read<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.670> anything<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.120> this

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
never read that anything on this

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.840 
never read that anything on this
resolution<00:00:48.510> before<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.500> well<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> haven't

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
resolution before and well I haven't

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.279 
resolution before and well I haven't
written<00:00:51.059> anything<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> few<00:00:51.809> months<00:00:52.020> anyway

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
written anything out a few months anyway

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.840 
written anything out a few months anyway
so<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.530> could<00:00:52.829> use<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> practice<00:00:53.280> not<00:00:53.699> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
so I could use the practice not to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.729 
so I could use the practice not to
mention<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.480> templates<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.260> gone<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.500> had

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
whore and the solo Lane I mean I picked

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.339 
whore and the solo Lane I mean I picked
it<00:03:41.849> because<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.269> had<00:03:42.420> no<00:03:42.599> one<00:03:42.750> going<00:03:43.019> ranged

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
it because we had no one going ranged

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.380 
it because we had no one going ranged
physical<00:03:43.799> in<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.069> gods<00:03:44.250> selection<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.269> you

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
physical in the gods selection but you

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.149 
physical in the gods selection but you
know<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.659> worked<00:03:45.840> okay<00:03:46.080> this<00:03:46.290> game<00:03:46.440> for<00:03:46.739> god<00:03:47.129> I

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
know it worked okay this game for god I

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.080 
know it worked okay this game for god I
think<00:03:47.250> he's<00:03:47.400> gonna<00:03:47.519> move<00:03:47.670> this<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.060> a

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
think he's gonna move this is like a

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.850 
think he's gonna move this is like a
proper<00:03:48.360> ranked<00:03:48.900> game<00:03:49.230> or<00:03:49.409> anything<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.799> that

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
proper ranked game or anything like that

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.610 
proper ranked game or anything like that
but<00:03:50.849> yeah<00:03:51.150> there's<00:03:51.450> solar<00:03:51.989> lanes<00:03:52.349> now

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
but yeah there's solar lanes now

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.550 
but yeah there's solar lanes now
jungling<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.610> dual<00:03:54.030> Lane<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> mid<00:03:54.750> lane<00:03:54.989> it's

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
jungling a dual Lane and a mid lane it's

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.339 
jungling a dual Lane and a mid lane it's
a<00:03:55.769> much<00:03:55.950> more<00:03:56.220> structured<00:03:56.900> it's<00:03:57.900> League<00:03:58.230> of

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
a much more structured it's League of

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.110 
a much more structured it's League of
Legends<00:03:58.769> as<00:03:59.220> far<00:03:59.430> as<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.610> can<00:03:59.670> tell<00:03:59.939> they<00:04:00.090> have

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
Legends as far as I can tell they have

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.479 
Legends as far as I can tell they have
like<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.450> solo<00:04:01.019> top<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.739> dual<00:04:02.129> Lane<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.430> the

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
like a solo top and dual Lane in the

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.190 
like a solo top and dual Lane in the
bottom<00:04:02.819> Lane<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.420> jungler<00:04:03.870> in<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.019> mid<00:04:04.170> I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
bottom Lane and a jungler in the mid I

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.929 
bottom Lane and a jungler in the mid I
think<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.739> don't<00:04:05.069> really<00:04:05.220> know<00:04:05.400> League<00:04:05.670> very

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
think I don't really know League very

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.880 
think I don't really know League very
well<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.780> that's<00:04:06.930> what<00:04:07.140> it's<00:04:07.260> like<00:04:07.409> there<00:04:07.680> and

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
well but that's what it's like there and

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.490 
well but that's what it's like there and
it's<00:04:08.459> gone<00:04:08.730> from<00:04:08.939> two<00:04:09.209> one<00:04:09.390> two<00:04:09.599> which<00:04:10.230> is<00:04:10.349> so

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
it's gone from two one two which is so

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.990 
it's gone from two one two which is so
basic<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.069> flexible<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:11.700> could<00:04:11.849> play

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
basic and flexible you could play

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.699 
basic and flexible you could play
anything<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.540> wanted<00:04:12.840> anywhere<00:04:13.230> pretty<00:04:13.590> much

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and get away with it and now not so much
