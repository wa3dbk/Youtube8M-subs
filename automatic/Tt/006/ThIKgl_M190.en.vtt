00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 about alten in Russian they write at Leason 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.450
 ulzzang in English ties strange reason 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.269
 same because in korean language 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.849
 actually this sound in communication in 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.720
 korean this is i-chan 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.850
 fly away I do not know, they can very nearly 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.180
 I pronounce correctly this double c 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.099
 I am not friends with these double consonants 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.230
 I don't see much of a difference. 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.719
 asked the Koreans and asked 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.020
 Koreans looked at a little 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.020
 online but never found an answer for 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.420
 yourself what is it in translation from 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.780
 korean meaning beautiful face 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.559
 beautiful face or better face like me 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.500
 understood 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.660
 from the words of the Koreans it is more like 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.949
 posing yes that's this korean 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.609
 posing your eyes do bulging 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.129
 somehow i don't know a sponge certain 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.780
 how to photograph mainly this 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 The theme of this style went after the photos 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.030
 connected to the internet with photos this 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.950
 style is more like internet style when 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.400
 guys guys girls are photographed 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.650
 in a certain way there on their blogs 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.409
 exhibited either on social networks there 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.509
 ranking put that photo here with this 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.329
 but they are there mostly makeup there usually 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.200
 make-up certain pose and I know 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.850
 a lot of koreans 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.890
 including adults, too, Koreans like this 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.200
 here is photographed love themselves 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.780
 taking pictures from certain angles 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.299
 they already know best 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.170
 take a picture so that the nose 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.100
 looked like this in a certain way 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.210
 face shape 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.329
 eyes they already know all these belly and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.170
 just photographed and expose 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:08.599
 these photos later when you see them in 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:12.120
 living very often just not 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.620
 matches at least i know 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.599
 many quarries 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.180
 which should be pretty but not 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.110
 as straight as these idol and 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.819
 yes, but in the photos I look at the photos 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.569
 facebook you in phones and they absolutely 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.390
 other posture certain look 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.390
 certain facial expressions certain yes here 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.640
 And this style is called the Ulsan 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.739
 over time he has become a style 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.110
 and as I understood, but rather they do not 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.030
 view it as a style it is more 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.129
 that 's somehow abroad at least with 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.549
 who I talked to and talked to youth and 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.549
 asked they just say it is 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:59.010
 here's the flow to be photographed so in 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:02.060
 Korea is like in Korea it is not 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.069
 as much in style as it is by itself 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.810
 for granted something if suddenly someone with 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.079
 this sign 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.959
 better then leave it in the comments 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.659
 this is what i heard but my experience is 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.650
 a little about what i asked because 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:22.260
 I read on the Internet I did not understand 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.889
 before you just had to ask yourself 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.090
 Koreans 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.090
 what it is
